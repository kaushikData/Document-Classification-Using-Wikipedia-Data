[[File:Athletes compete at Wounded Warrior Trials Image 6 of 8.jpg|thumb|Competitors participated in the [[shot put]] during the 2012 U.S. Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Trials, Feb. 19, at [[Camp Pendleton]]]]
The '''Army Wounded Warrior Program''' (AW2) is the official U.S. Army program that assists and advocates for severely wounded, ill or injured Soldiers, Veterans, and their Families and Caregivers, wherever they are located, regardless of military status. Soldiers who qualify for AW2 are assigned to the program as soon as possible after arriving at the Warrior Transition Unit (WTU). AW2 supports these Soldiers and their Families throughout their recovery and transition, even into Veteran status. Through the local, personalized support of AW2 Advocates, AW2 strives to foster the Soldier's independence. There are more than 20,000  severely wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and Veterans currently enrolled in AW2.

==Eligility requirements==
In order to be considered eligible for entry into AW2, Soldiers must suffer
from wounds, illnesses, or injuries incurred in the line of duty after
September 10, 2001 AND receive or expect to receive at least a 30% rating from the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) for one of the conditions listed below:
* Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
* Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
* Severe loss of vision/blindness.
* Severe hearing loss/deafness.
* Fatal/incurable disease with limited life expectancy.
* Loss of limb.
* Spinal cord injury.
* Permanent disfigurement.
* Severe burns.
* Severe paralysis.
* Receive a 30% rating or greater for one Veterans Affairs Scheduled Rating Decision (VASRD) as rated by the Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) in any other Special Category (SPECAT)/ Enabling Care (EC) or combat/combat-related condition OR receive a combined 50% IDES rating for any other combat/combat-related condition.

At this time there are no exceptions to AW2 entry criteria. However, AW2 is currently evaluating the appeals process.

==AW2 Advocates==
Upon enrollment in the U.S. Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2), each Soldier is assigned an AW2 Advocate, who helps the Soldier with the recovery and transition process, fostering the Soldier's independence. Together, AW2 Advocates and AW2 Soldiers collaborate to set goals for the Soldiers' and Families' future.  AW2 Advocates are located at Warrior Transition Units (WTUs), military treatment facilities (MTFs), most Army installations and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities to provide personalized local support on a wide range of issues and resources.

==Warrior Care and Transition Program==
The  Army's Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP), headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], evaluates and treats wounded, ill and injured Soldiers through a comprehensive, Soldier-centric process of medical care, rehabilitation, professional development and achievement of personal goals. Led by the Army's Warrior Transition Command (WTC), the WCTP serves an essential role, not only in managing the care and recovery of Soldiers evacuated from theater, but also those preparing to deploy and those who have returned from combat that require complex care management to cope with the effects of war and multiple deployments. WTC works to ensure everything possible is done to enable Soldiers to return to duty. WTC also plays an important role in ensuring Reserve Component Soldiers receive the care they require prior to and after deployment to remain mission ready. AW2 is a key program in executing the WCTP. WCTP is a subordinate command of [[United States Army Medical Command]].

==Services provided by other military branches==
Wounded or disabled Veterans from other branches of service are served through other programs.

{{nihongo|'''Bunsei'''|文政}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era| Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} after ''[[Bunka]]'' and before ''[[Tenpō]]''.  This period spanned the years from April 1818 through December 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Bunsei''" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 92|page=92}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Ninko of Japan|Ninkō]]''-tennō''|仁孝天皇}}.

==Change of era==
* '''April 22, 1818''' ({{nihongo|''Bunsei gannen''|文政元年}}):  The new era name was created to mark the enthronement of the emperor Emperor Ninko in ''Bunka'' 15.

The new era name was drawn from an aphorism attributed to the ancient Chinese emperor, Great [[Emperor Shun|Shun]] (大舜): "Shun reads the Heavens, and so brings together all seven governments" (舜察天'''文'''、斉七'''政''').

==Events of the ''Bunsei'' era==
* '''1822''' (''Bunsei 5''): Edo was struck with 150 earthquake tremors over three days.&lt;ref name="h63"&gt;Hammer, Joshua. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O8VyhDbUPgC ''Yokohama Burning: The Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire that Helped Forge the Path to World War II'', p. 63.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 11, 1823''' (''Bunsei 6, 6th day of the 7th month''):&lt;!-- NengoCalc 文政六年七月六日 --&gt;  German flora- and fauna-taxonomist [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] arrives at [[Dejima]] as new physician for the Dutch trading post in Nagasaki harbor.  ''[[Bakufu]]'' policy in this era was designed to marginalize the influence of foreigners in ''Bunsei'' Japan; however, an unintended and opposite consequence of ''[[sakoku]]'' was to enhance the value and significance of a very small number of thoughtful observers like von Siebold, whose writings document what he learned or discovered first-hand.  Von Siebold's published accounts and unpublished writings provided a unique and useful perspective for [[Orientalists]] and [[Japanologists]] in the 19th century; and his work continues to be rigorously examined by modern researchers today.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 13, 1830''' (''Bunsei 13, 25th day of the 6th month''):&lt;!-- NengoCalc 文政十三年六月二十五日 --&gt; Earthquake at Kyoto (Latitude: 35.000/Longitude: 136.000), no [[Richter Scale]] magnitude suggested by available data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov "Significant Earthquake Database"] U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]] and subsequent Marxian analyses, the '''capitalist mode of production''' refers to the systems of organizing production and distribution within [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Society|societies]]. Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist [[mode of production]] proper, based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology, began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Duncan Foley]] and Gérard Duménil, 2008. "Marx's analysis of capitalist production," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000399&amp;edition Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

The capitalist mode of production is characterized by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and—at least as far as [[commodities]] are concerned—being [[Market economy|market-based]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism|title=Capitalism.|publisher=Marxist.org|accessdate=July 8, 2011|author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A "[[mode of production]]" (German: ''Produktionsweise'') means simply "the distinctive way of producing", which could be defined in terms of how it is socially organized and what kinds of technologies and tools are used. Under the capitalist mode of production:
* Both the inputs and outputs of production are mainly privately owned, priced goods and services purchased in the market.
* Production is carried out for exchange and circulation in the market, aiming to obtain a net profit income from it.
* The owners of the means of production (capitalists) are the dominant class ([[bourgeoisie]]) who derive their income from the surplus product produced by the workers and appropriated freely by the capitalists.
* A defining feature of capitalism is the dependency on wage-labor for a large segment of the population; specifically, the working class ([[proletariat]]) do not own capital and must live by selling their [[labour power]] in exchange for a wage.

The capitalist mode of production may exist within societies with differing political systems (e.g. [[liberal democracy]], [[social democracy]], [[fascism]], [[Communist state]] and [[Czarism]]) and alongside different [[social structures]] such as [[tribalism]], the [[caste system]], an agrarian-based [[peasant society]], urban [[industrial society]] and [[post-industrialism]]. Although capitalism has existed in the form of merchant activity, banking, renting land and small-scale manufactures in previous stages of history, it was usually a relatively minor activity and secondary to the dominant forms of social organization and production with the prevailing property system keeping commerce within clear limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article139 ''The Laws of Motion of the Capitalist Mode of Production''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154036/http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article139 |date=July 22, 2011 }} [[Ernst Mandel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing characteristics==
Capitalist [[society]] is epitomized by the so-called circuit of commodity production, M-C-M' and by renting money for that purpose where the aggregate of market actors determine the money price M, of the input labor and commodities and M' the struck price of C, the produced market [[commodity (Marxism)|commodity]]. It is centered on the process M → M', "making money" and the exchange of value that occurs at that point. [[Profit (accounting)|M' &amp;gt; M]] is the condition of rationality in the capitalist system and a necessary condition for the next cycle of accumulation/production. For this reason, Capitalism is "production for exchange" driven by the desire for personal accumulation of money receipts in such exchanges, mediated by free markets. The markets themselves are driven by the needs and wants of consumers and those of society as a whole in the form of the bourgeois state. These wants and needs would (in the socialist or communist society envisioned by Marx, Engels and others) be the driving force, it would be "[[production for use]]". Contemporary mainstream (bourgeois) economics, particularly that associated with the right, holds that an "[[invisible hand]]",&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, often mis-attributed in this sense. See the [[Invisible hand#The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]] section for what Smith actually said.&lt;/ref&gt; through little more than the freedom of the market, is able to match social production to these needs and desires.

"Capitalism" as this money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to "[[merchant capitalism]]") since the beginnings of civilization. What is specific about the “capitalist mode of production” is that most of the inputs and outputs of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode. For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labor are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.

This has the important consequence that the whole organization of the production process is reshaped and reorganized to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labor factor costs, sales, profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall. That is, the whole process is organized and reshaped in order to conform to "commercial logic". Another way of saying this is that capital accumulation defines economic rationality in capitalist production. In the flourishing period of capitalism, these are not operating at cross purposes and thus capitalism acts as a progressive force (e.g. against feudalism). In the [[Late Capitalism|final stages]], capitalism as a mode of production achieves complete domination on a planetary basis and has nothing to overcome but itself, the final (for it, capitalism, viewed as a [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectics|Hegelian process]], not for historical development per se) negating of the negation posited by [[orthodox Marxism]].

In this context, Marx refers to a transition from the “[[Base and superstructure|formal subsumption]]” of production under the power of capital to the “real subsumption” of production under the power of capital. In what he calls the "specifically capitalist mode of production", both the [[technology]] worked with and the social [[organization]] of labour have been completely refashioned and reshaped in a [[commerce|commercial]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]] and [[Market (economics)|market]]-oriented) way—the "old ways of producing" (for example, [[crafts]] and [[cottage industries]]) had been completely displaced by the then new industrialism.

===Summary of basic distinctions===
In general, capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarized by the following:
* [[Capital accumulation]]: production for profit and accumulation as the implicit purpose of all or most of production, constriction or elimination of production formerly carried out on a common social or private household basis.
* [[Production (economics)|Commodity production]]: production for exchange on a market; to maximize [[exchange-value]] instead of [[use-value]].
* [[Private ownership]] of the means of production: ownership of the means of production by a class of capital owners, either individually, collectively (see [[corporation]]) or through a state that serves the interests of the capitalist class (see [[state capitalism]]).
* Primacy of [[wage labor]]: near universality of wage labor, whether so-called or not, with [[Wage slavery|coerced work]] for the masses in excess of what they would need to sustain themselves and a complete saturation of [[bourgeois]] values [[Base and superstructure|at all levels]] of [[society]] from the base reshaping and reorganization described above .

==Origins==
Marx argued that [[Capital (economics)|capital]] existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities and occasionally also as small-scale industry with some wage labour (Marx was also well aware that wage labour existed for centuries on a modest scale before the advent of capitalist industry). Simple [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which form the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. The "capitalistic era" according to Marx dates from the 16th century, i.e. it began with merchant capitalism and relatively small urban workshops.{{Citation needed|reason=The origins of the capitalist mode of production is a contentious issue, and a reference to the text where Marx argues this periodization would help those looking for further clarification|date=May 2018}}

For the capitalist mode of production to emerge as a distinctive mode of production dominating the whole production process of society, many different social, economic, cultural, technical and legal-political conditions had to come together.

For most of human history, these did not come together. Capital existed and commercial trade existed, but it{{Clarify|reason=what does "it" refer to|date=January 2016}} did not lead to industrialisation and large-scale capitalist industry. That required a whole series of new conditions, namely specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers compelled to sell their [[labor power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure making the circulation of goods on a large scale possible, security for private accumulation and so on. In many [[Third World]] countries, many of these conditions do not exist even today even though there is plenty of capital and labour available—the obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are less a technical matter and more a social, cultural and political problem.

A society, a region or [[nation]] is “capitalist” if the predominant source of incomes and products being distributed is capitalist activity—even so, this does not yet mean necessarily that the capitalist mode of production is dominant in that society.

==Defining structural criteria==
Marx never provided a complete definition of the capitalist mode of production as a short summary, although in his manuscripts he sometimes attempted one.

In a sense, it is Marx's three-volume work ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'' (1867–1894; sometimes known by its German title, ''Das Kapital''), as a whole that provides his "definition" of the capitalist mode of production. Nevertheless, it is possible to summarise the essential defining characteristics of the capitalist mode of production as follows:
* The means of production (or capital goods) and the means of consumption (or consumer goods) are mainly produced for market sale; output is produced with the intention of sale in an open market; and only through sale of output can the owner of capital claim part of the surplus-product of human labour and realize profits. Equally, the inputs of production are supplied through the market as commodities. The prices of both inputs and outputs are mainly governed by the market laws of supply and demand (and ultimately by the [[law of value]]). In short, a capitalist must use money to fuel both the means of production and labor in order to make commodities. These commodities are then sold to the market for a profit. The profit once again becomes part of a larger amount of capital which the capitalist reinvests to make more commodities and ultimately more and more capital.
* Private ownership of the means of production ("private enterprise") as effective private control and/or legally enforced ownership, with the consequence that investment and management decisions are made by private owners of capital who act autonomously from each other and—because of business secrecy and the constraints of competition—do not co-ordinate their activities according to collective, conscious planning. Enterprises are able to set their own output prices within the framework of the forces of supply and demand manifested through the market and the development of production technology is guided by profitability criteria.
* The corollary of that is [[wage labour]] ("employment") by the direct producers, who are compelled to sell their labour power because they lack access to alternative means of subsistence (other than being self-employed or employers of labour, if only they could acquire sufficient funds) and can obtain means of consumption only through market transactions. These wage earners are mostly "free" in a double sense: they are “freed” from ownership of productive assets and they are free to choose their employer.
* Being carried out for market on the basis of a proliferation of fragmented decision-making processes by owners and managers of private capital, social production is mediated by competition for asset-ownership, political or economic influence, costs, sales, prices and profits. [[Competition]] occurs between owners of capital for profits, assets and markets; between owners of capital and workers over wages and conditions; and between workers themselves over employment opportunities and civil rights.
* The overall aim of capitalist production under competitive pressure is (a) to maximise net profit income (or realise a net [[superprofit]]) as much as possible through cutting production costs, increasing [[sales]] and monopolisation of markets and supply; (b) capital accumulation, to acquire productive and non-productive assets; and (c) to [[privatisation|privatize]] both the supply of goods and services and their consumption. The larger portion of the [[surplus product]] of labor must usually be reinvested in production since output growth and accumulation of capital mutually depend on each other.
* Out of preceding characteristics of the capitalist mode of production, the basic class structure of this mode of production society emerges: a class of owners and managers of private capital assets in industries and on the land, a class of wage and salary earners, a permanent [[reserve army of labour]] consisting of unemployed people and various intermediate classes such as the self-employed (small business and farmers) and the “new middle classes” (educated or skilled professionals on higher salaries).
* The finance of the capitalist [[State (polity)|state]] is heavily dependent on levying taxes from the population and on credit—that is, the capitalist state normally lacks any autonomous economic basis (such as state-owned industries or landholdings) that would guarantee sufficient income to sustain state activities. The capitalist state defines a legal framework for commerce, civil society and politics, which specifies public and private rights and duties as well as legitimate property relations.
* Capitalist development, occurring on private initiative in a socially unco-ordinated and unplanned way, features periodic crises of over-production (or excess capacity). This means that a critical fraction of output cannot be sold at all, or cannot be sold at prices realising the previously ruling rate of profit. The other side of over-production is the over-accumulation of productive capital: more capital is invested in production than can obtain a normal profit. The consequence is a recession (a reduced economic growth rate) or in severe cases, a [[depression (economics)|depression]] (negative real growth, i.e. an absolute decline in output). As a corollary, mass [[unemployment]] occurs. In the history of capitalist development since 1820, there have been more than 20 of such crises—nowadays the under-utilisation of installed productive capacity is a permanent characteristic of capitalist production (average capacity utilisation rates nowadays normally range from about 60% to 85%).

In examining particular manifestations of the capitalist mode of production in particular regions and epochs, it is possible to find exceptions to these main defining criteria, but the exceptions prove the rule in the sense that over time the exceptional circumstances tend to disappear.

==State capitalist interpretation==
{{original research|date=July 2015}}
{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}
As mentioned, Marx never explicitly summarised his definition of capitalism, beyond some suggestive comments in manuscripts which he did not publish himself. This has led to controversies among Marxists about how to evaluate the "capitalist" nature of society in particular countries. Supporters of theories of [[state capitalism]] such as the [[International Socialist Tendency|International Socialists]] reject the definition of the capitalist mode of production given above. In their view, claimed to be more revolutionary (in that true liberation from capitalism must be the self-emancipation of the working class—"socialism from below"), what really defines the capitalist mode of production is:
* Means of production which dominate the direct producers as an alien power.
* The existence of a wage-earning [[working class]] which does not hold or have power.
* The existence of an elite or ruling class which controls the country, exploiting the working population in the technical Marxist sense.

If true, then [[ownership]] relations generally and private ownership in particular are irrelevant to the definition of capitalism. The existence of commercial relations and commodity production are also irrelevant.

Many of the state capitalist theories (which actually originated in Germany, where they were already criticised by [[Frederick Engels]]) define "capital" only as a [[social relation]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

This idea is based on some passages from Marx, where Marx emphasized that capital cannot exist except within a power-relationship between [[social classes]] which governs the extraction of [[surplus-labour]]. It is this power-relationship that is most important for the proponents of theories of state capitalism—everything else is secondary.

==Heterodox views and polemics==
Orthodox Marxist debate after 1917 has often been in Russian, other East European languages, Vietnamese, Korean or Chinese and dissidents seeking to analyze their own country independently were typically silenced in one way or another by the regime, therefore the political debate has been mainly from a Western point of view and based on secondary sources, rather than being based directly on the experiences of people living in "actually existing socialist countries". That debate has typically counterposed a socialist ideal to a poorly understood reality, i.e. using analysis which due to such party stultification and shortcomings of the various parties fails to apply the full rigor of the dialectical method to a well informed understanding of such actual conditions in situ and falls back on trite party approved formulae. In turn, this has led to the accusation that Marxists cannot satisfactorily specify what capitalism and socialism really are, nor how to get from one to the other—quite apart from failing to explain satisfactorily why socialist revolutions failed to produce the desirable kind of socialism. Behind this problem, it is argued the following:
*A kind of [[historicism]] according to which Marxists have a privileged insight into the "march of history"—the doctrine is thought to provide the truth, in advance of real research and experience. Evidence contrary to the doctrine is rejected or overlooked.
* A uni-linear view of history, according to which feudalism leads to capitalism and capitalism to socialism.
* An attempt to fit the histories of different societies into this schema of history on the basis that if they are not socialist, they must be capitalist (or vice versa), or if they are neither, that they must be in transition from one to the other.

None of these stratagems, it is argued, are either warranted by the facts or scientifically sound and the result is that many socialists have abandoned the rigid constraints of Marxist orthodoxy in order to analyse capitalist and non-capitalist societies in a new way.

From an orthodox Marxist perspective, the former is simple ignorance and or purposeful obfuscation of works such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'' and a broader literature which does in fact supply such specifications. The latter are partly superficial complaints which can easily be refuted as they are diametrically opposite of well known statements by Marx, Lenin, Trotsky and others, part pettifogging and redundant restatement of the same thing and partly true observations of inferior and simplistic presentations of Marxist thought (by those espousing some brand of Marxism). Neither [[historical materialism|historical]] or [[dialectical materialism]] assert or imply a "uni-linear" view of human development, although Marxism does claim a general and indeed accelerating secular trend of advancement, driven in the modern period by Capitalism. Similarly, Marxists, especially in the period after 1917, have on the contrary been especially mindful of the so-called unequal and [[uneven and combined development|uneven development]] and its importance in the struggle to achieve socialism. Likewise, the pushback on Marxism's claim to be a science is partly justified and partly a [[scientism]]: as a social science, Marxism stands on better philosophical foundations than many of the so-called hard sciences,{{POV statement|date=October 2014}} let alone the other social sciences. Finally, in the wake of the disasters of socialism in the previous century most modern Marxists are at great pains to stipulate that only the independently acting working class can determine the nature of the society it creates for itself so the call for a prescriptive description of exactly what that society would be like and how it is to emerge from the existing class-ridden one, other than by the conscious struggle of the masses, is an unwitting expression of precisely the problem that is supposed to be being addressed (the imposition of social structure by elites).

The '''chronology of the Bible''' is an elaborate system of lifespans, "generations," and other means by which the passage of events is measured, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and extending through other significant events. A widespread scholarly understanding is that the Bible marks out a world cycle ([[Great Year]]) of 4,000 years, beginning with Creation and ending, presumably, around 164 [[Common Era|BCE]], with the year [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 2666 for [[the Exodus]] representing 26 2/3 of 100 years or two-thirds of the total.&lt;ref name="Johnson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall D.

The count begins with creation and Year 1. The passage of time from the Creation to [[the Exodus]] is measured by adding the ages of the [[Patriarch]]s at the birth of their firstborn sons, later through express statements, and later still by the synchronised reigns of the [[kings of Israel and Judah]].{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The Exodus takes place in the year [[Anno Mundi|''anno mundi'']] 2666, or AM 2666, exactly two thirds of the way through the four thousand years, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is commenced 480 years, or 12 generations of 40 years each, after that, and 430 years pass between the building of the Temple and its destruction.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The 50 years between the destruction of the Temple and the "[[Cyrus's edict|Decree of Cyrus]]" and end of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]], added to the 430 years for which the Temple stood, produces another symmetrical period of 480 years,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} and the 374 years between the re-dedication of the Temple by the [[Maccabees]] and the Edict of Cyrus completes the 4,000 years.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}

As recently as the 18th century, scholars of the stature of [[Isaac Newton]] believed that the date of Creation was knowable from the Bible.{{sfn|Barr|1987|p=3}} Today, the Genesis account of Creation has long since vanished from serious [[cosmology]], the Patriarchs and Exodus are no longer included in most serious histories of ancient Israel,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}} and it is almost universally accepted that [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] have little historical value.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Mazar|2007|pp=62, 74}} Even the monarchy is questioned, and although scholars continue to advance proposals for reconciling the chronology of the [[Books of Kings]], there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

== Pre-Masoretic chronologies ==
During the centuries that [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Biblical texts and canons developed]], theological chronologies emerged at different composition stages, though scholars have advanced various theories to identify these stages and their schematizations of time. These chronologies include:
* A "Progenitor" chronology that placed [[Abraham]]'s birth at AM 1600 and the foundation of the Temple at AM 2800. Alfred Jepsen proposed this chronology on the basis of melding time periods in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic recensions]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=3ff.}}
* Distinct chronologies can be inferred from the [[Priestly source]] (of the Pentateuch), along with priestly authors of later Biblical books,&lt;ref&gt;On the "Priestly chronology", see especially Hughes, e.g., 233f.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deuteronomistic history]], which purports to chronicle the reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel (with some significant historical corroboration, see below and [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]). 
* The Nehemiah chronology, devised to show 3,500 years from creation to [[Nehemiah|Nehemiah's]] mission. Northcote says that this chronology was "probably composed by [[Levites]] in Jerusalem not long after Nehemiah's mission, perhaps sometime late in the fifth century BCE (i.e. nearing 400 BCE)."{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}} Bousset (1900) apparently sees this schematization, too, but calls it Proto-[[Masoretic Text|MT]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}}
* A proto-Masoretic chronology, shaped by [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilees]], with an overall literary showing of 3,480 years from creation to the completion of the [[Second Temple]], per B.W. Bousset (1900), and which had the [[first Temple]] at 3,000 years.
* The Saros chronology that reflected 3,600 years leading up to the first Temple and 4,080 years from creation to the completion of the Second Temple. This scheme served as "the basis for the later [[Septuagint|LXX]] chronology and pre-SP [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] chronologies".{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=12}}

== Masoretic Text ==

{{hatnote|The following table is derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past'';{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}} notes within the table as cited.}}

It should be noted that some data in this table are questionable. For example, Genesis 11:10 states that Shem was 100 years old when he gave birth to his son two years after the flood. The statement (Gn 5:32) that Noah was 500 years old when his sons were born, means that they were born starting then. Some commentators state that Shem was the youngest of the three, which could mean that he was born two years later in order to make his age 100 two years after the flood. If one starts from two years after the flood (no matter what the age of Shem was) and adds the ages of his descendants, Abraham was born in 1948 AM. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old in 2048. According to some commentators the Exodus is dated as 400 years after the birth of Isaac (from Genesis 15:13), making it 2448. According to others the 430 year time mentioned in Exodus 12:40 is dated from the descent of Jacob to Aegypt, making it 2668.

The temple was built 480 years after the Exodus, in the fourth year of King Solomon's rein, according to I Kings 6:1. This places the start of King Solomon's reign as 2924 and the building of the temple as 2928.

The Masoretic Text is the basis of modern Jewish and Christian bibles. While difficulties with Biblical texts make it impossible to reach sure conclusions, perhaps the most widely held hypothesis is that it embodies an overall scheme of 4,000 years (a "great year") taking the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE as its end-point.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} Two motives may have led to this: first, there was a common idea at the time of the Maccabees that human history followed the plan of a divine "week" of seven "days" each lasting a thousand years;{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=246}} and second, a 4,000 year history—even longer in the Septuagint version—would establish the antiquity of the Jews against their pagan neighbours.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=98–99}}

== Other Second Temple chronologies: Septuagint, Samaritan, Jubilees==
[[File:Tissot Solomon Dedicates the Temple at Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Solomon Dedicates the Temple ([[James Tissot]])]]

The canonical text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is called the [[Masoretic Text]], a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early the 7th and 10th centuries CE. There are, however, two other major texts, the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. The Septuagint is a [[Koine Greek]] translation of the original [[biblical Hebrew]] holy books. It is estimated that the first five books of the Septuagint, known as the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, were translated in the mid-3rd century [[BCE]] and the remaining texts were translated in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=April 7, 2018|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly agrees with the Masoretic Text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the [[Samaritan]] community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries BCE—just when is disputed—and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic Text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic Text as superior to the other two—the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a13.htm 1 Samuel 13:1]&lt;/ref&gt; More relevantly, all three texts have a clear purpose, which is not to record history so much as to bring the narrative to a point which represents the culmination of history.

In the Samaritan Pentateuch, 'the genealogies and narratives were shaped to ensure a chronology of 3000 years from creation to the Israelite settlement of Canaan. Northcote reports this as the "Proto-SP chronology," as designated by John Skinner (1910), and he speculates that this chronology may have been extended to put the rebuilding of the Second Temple at an even AM 3900, after three 1,300-year phases. In the Septuagint version of the Pentateuch the Israelite chronology extends 4,777 years from creation to the finishing of the Second Temple, as witnessed in the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] manuscript. This calculation only emerges by supplementing Septuagint with the MT's chronology of kings. There were at least 3 variations of Septuagint chronology; [[Eusebius]] used one variation, now favored by Hughes and others. Northcote asserts that the Septuagint calendrical pattern was meant to demonstrate that there were 5,000 years from creation to a contemporaneous [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], circa 300 BCE.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=14ff}}

The 2nd century BCE [[Book of Jubilees]] begins with the Creation and measures time in years, "weeks" of years (groups of seven years), and jubilees (sevens of sevens), so that the interval from Creation to the settlement of Canaan, for example, is exactly fifty jubilees (2450 years).{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=245}}

==Seder Olam==

More significant, and still in common use among Jews, was the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ("Great Order of the World"), a work tracing the history of the world and the Jews from Creation to the 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Milikowski|2011|p = 656}}{{sfn|Solomon|2006|p = 61}} It allows 410 years for the duration of the First Temple, 70 years from its destruction to the Second Temple, and 420 years for the duration of the Second Temple, making a total of 900 years for the two temples.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 253}} This schematic approach to numbers accounts for its most remarkable feature, the fact that it shortens the entire Persian Empire from over two centuries to just 52 years, mirroring the 52 years it gives to the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 257}}

==Christian use and development of biblical chronology==

The early Church Father [[Eusebius]] (c. 260–340), attempting to place Christ in the chronology, put his birth in AM 5199, and this became the accepted date for the Western Church.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}} As the year AM 6000 (800 CE) approached there was increasing fear that the end of the world was nigh, until the [[Venerable Bede]] made his own calculations and found that Christ's birth took place in AM 3592, allowing several more centuries to the end of time.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}}

[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) switched the point of focus from Christ's birth to the Apostolic Council of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 15, which he placed in the year AM 4000, believing this marked the moment when the Mosaic Law was abolished and the new age of grace began.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=260–261}} This was widely accepted among European Protestants, but in the English-speaking world, Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1581–1656) calculated a date of 4004 BCE for creation; he was not the first to reach this result, but his chronology was so detailed that his dates were incorporated into the margins of English Bibles for the next two hundred years.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=261–262}} This popular 4,000 year theological timespan, which ends with the birth of Jesus, differs from the 4,000 timespan later proposed for the Masoretic text alone, which ends with the Temple rededication in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}

==The Israelite kings==
{{For|detailed reconstructions of the chronology of the Hebrew kings|Kings of Judah}}

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|pp=95–96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]], linking the Hebrew kings by accession and length of reign ("king X of Judah came to the throne in the ''n''th year of king Y of Israel and ruled ''n'' years"), can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}}

Possibly the most widely followed attempt to reconcile the contradictions has been that proposed by [[Edwin R. Thiele]] in his ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} The weaknesses in Thiele's work have led subsequent scholars to continue to propose chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

'''''[[Metamorphoses]]''''' ({{lang-la|Metamorphoseon libri}}: "Books of Transformations") is a [[Latin]] [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Ovid]], considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. Comprising fifteen books and over 250 [[myth]]s, the poem chronicles the history of the world from its [[Creation myth|creation]] to the deification of [[Julius Caesar]] within a loose mythico-historical framework. Although meeting the criteria for an [[epic poem|epic]], the poem defies simple genre classification by its use of varying themes and tones.

Considered one of the most influential works of art in [[Western culture]], particularly [[Culture of Europe|European]], ''Metamorphoses'' has inspired such authors as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Numerous episodes from the poem have been depicted in sculptures and paintings by artists such as [[Titian]]. Although Ovid's reputation faded after the [[Renaissance]], towards the end of the twentieth century there was a resurgence of interest in his work; today, ''Metamorphoses'' continues to inspire and be retold through various media.

==Literature==
===Drama===
[[File:Pygmalion serialized November 1914.jpg|thumb|First American serialized printing of Bernard Shaw's ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (November 1914).]]
* The myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] and [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] (Book X) has been adapted into plays by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (''[[Pygmalion (Rousseau)|Pygmalion]]'', 1762), [[W.S. Gilbert]] (''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea, an Original Mythological Comedy]]'', 1871) and [[George Bernard Shaw]] (''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', premiered October 1913). Gilbert's play was parodied in the musical burlesque ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883) Shaw's play—in which [[phonetics]] professor Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a Cockney flower girl to pass for a duchess by improving her speech—was adapted by Shaw himself into a film version (''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]'', 1938), the screenplay of which was later adapted into the [[Lerner and Loewe]] musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), itself adapted into a [[My Fair Lady (film)|1964 musical film]].
* In 2002, author [[Mary Zimmerman]] adapted some of Ovid's myths into [[Metamorphoses (play)|a play by the same title]], and the open-air-theatre group London Bubble also adapted it in 2006.
* [[Naomi Iizuka]]'s ''[[Polaroid Stories]]'' also bases its format on ''Metamorphoses'', adapting Ovid's poem to modern times with drug-addicted, teenage versions of many of the characters from the original play.
* ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'', a [[masque]] by [[Händel]], is based on the [[eponymous]] characters out of the ''Metamorphoses'', as is [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s opera ''[[Acis et Galatée]]''.
* In 2010, the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]] presented a new adaptation of ''Metamorphoses'' at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yvonne-arnaud.co.uk/studio.asp?s=708{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels and other literature===
* In 1613, Spanish poet [[Luis de Góngora]] wrote an illustrious poem titled ''[[La Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea]]'' that retells the story of Polyphemus, Galatea and Acis found in Book XIII of the ''Metamorphoses''.
* In 1988, author [[Christoph Ransmayr]] reworked a great number of characters from the ''Metamorphoses'' in his ''[[The Last World]]''.
* In 1997, the [[Poet Laureate|British poet laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] adapted twenty-four stories from the ''Metamorphoses'' into his volume of poetry ''[[Tales from Ovid]]''. This was later adapted for the stage in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1999, the year after Hughes's death.
* In 2000, author Phillip Terry edited a collection of modern adaptations of some of Ovid's myths as ''Ovid Metamorphosed''.  Contributors included [[Margaret Atwood]]. 
* In 2009, British author [[Adrian Mitchell]] wrote a collection entitled ''Shapeshifters: Tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses'', intended for young adult readers. This is one of Mitchell's last books, as he died in 2008, and it was published posthumously.
* Australian writer [[Ursula Dubosarsky]] adapted ten of the stories from the ''Metamorphoses'' into plays for children. These were first published in the ''[[School Magazine]]'', a publication of the [[New South Wales Department of Education]], from 2006.

==Visual art==
[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Diana and Actaeon]]'', [[Titian]], 1556-59 ([[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]]).]]
* ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' (1522–23), an oil painting by [[Titian]] produced for [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], depicts the story of [[Ariadne]] and [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] described in Book VIII. During his later years (1550–1576), Titian painted a series of large mythological paintings known as the "poesie" for [[Philip II of Spain]]. The "poesie" series, which depicts scenes from Ovid, contained the following works: ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (Book X), ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' (Book IV), ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' (Book III), ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', ''Perseus and Andromeda'' (Book IV), ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'' (Book II), and ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'' (Book III). Titian's last finished work, ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|The Flaying of Marsyas]]'' (c. 1570–1576), depicts the punishment of the satyr [[Marsyas]] (Book VI).
* The marble sculpture ''[[The Rape of Proserpina]]'' (1621–22) by Baroque sculptor [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] depicts the [[Persephone#Abduction myth|abduction of Proserpina]] by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], ruler of the underworld (treated by Ovid in Book V). In 1625, Bernini finished his sculpture ''[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]'', which depicts the metamorphosis of the nymph [[Daphne]] as she flees from [[Apollo]] after he was pierced by [[Cupid]]'s love-inducing arrow (Book I). This episode furthermore has been treated repeatedly in opera, notably by [[Jacopo Peri]] (''[[Dafne]]'') in 1597 and [[Richard Strauss]] (''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', with a libretto that deviates significantly from Ovid's account) in 1938. 
* ''[[Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]'' ("The Spinners"), a painting from the 1650s by [[Diego Velázquez]] housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], is influenced by Ovid's story of [[Arachne]] (Book VI). In the Velázquez painting, the tapestry Arachne is weaving is a copy of Titian's ''The Rape of Europa'' (ca. 1560-62).
* ''[[Jupiter and Semele]]'' (1894–95), a painting by the French Symbolist artist [[Gustave Moreau]], depicts the myth of the mortal woman [[Semele]], mother of Bacchus, and her lover, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Book III).
* The painting ''[[Echo and Narcissus (Waterhouse painting)|Echo and Narcissus]]'' (1903), by the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[John William Waterhouse]], depicts the myth of [[Echo and Narcissus]] described in Book III.

==Music==
* In 1743, [[George Frideric Handel]] composed ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]''. Based on a pre-existent libretto by [[William Congreve]], the story of this Baroque [[oratorio]] comes from the episode of [[Semele]] and the birth of [[Dionysus |Bacchus]] from Book III.
* In 1746, French composer [[Jean-Marie Leclair]] wrote an [[opera]] ([[tragédie en musique]]) ''[[Scylla et Glaucus]]'' based on the books 10, 13 and 14.
* In 1767, 11-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote Apollo et Hyacinthus, K. 38. The opera is based on Metamorphoses. It is credited as Mozart's first opera. 
* In 1783, Austrian composer [[Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] wrote twelve symphonies on selected stories of the ''Metamorphoses''; only six survive, corresponding to stories from the first six books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.553368# under "About this Recording" at bottom left.

== Construction ==
The vessels mentioned by Vitruvius in his ''Ten Books on Architecture'' are made of bronze and designed specifically for each unique theater. They were then placed in niches between the theater's seats, specifically so that nothing was touching them. They used mathematical calculations to decide where they should be placed&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brillls New Pauly CYR-EPY|last=|first=|publisher=Leiden|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "They should be set upside down, and be supported on the side facing the stage by wedges not less than half a foot high."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Usage ==
Both their use in Roman times and usefulness have been debated. Thomas Noble Howe wrote in his commentary on Vitruvius' ''Ten Books on Architecture'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=a9ayDAAAQBAJ|page=171}}|title=The Ten Books on Architecture|last=Pollio|first=Vitruvius|date=19 July 2016|publisher=Vitruvius Pollio|isbn=978-605-04-8404-5|p=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These vessels, bronze or clay, may be another example of Vitruvius singling out a highly technical feature of Greek architecture that was uncommon, but between eight and sixteen potential sites with evidence of echea have been identified. It is debatable whether such vessels amplified or deadened sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ten Books on Architecture|last1=Vitruvius|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00292-9|editor1-last=Howe|editor1-first=Thomas Noble|edition=9th Printing|location=New York, NY|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echea were used with a, "due regard to the laws and [[harmony]] of physics," according to Roman writer [[Vitruvius]]. The vases operated by resonance, enhancing key frequencies of the performers' voices and absorbing those of the audience, which altered the sound in the theater to make the performers' voices clearer and more lush.&lt;ref name="AcousticalPrimer" /&gt; The size and shape of a theater determined the number of echea used, and their positioning within it.&lt;ref name="BrittonArchaeology" /&gt;

There is the possibility that echea were not used at all, as they may have never existed. Brill states that, "It is possible that Vitruvius, following the teachings on harmony by Aristoxenus, took speculation for reality."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
Vitruvius mentions a man named Lucius Mummius, who destroyed the theater of Corinth. He then brought the remains of the building's bronze echeas back to Rome. After selling the fragments, Mummius used the money to make a dedicatory offering at the temple of Luna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similar devices were used in early churches. Some were discovered in the vaulted ceiling of the choir of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], as well as in [[mosque]]s dating to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="BrittonArchaeology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AcousticalPrimer" /&gt;

{{political anthropology}}

'''Ernest André Gellner''' (9 December 1925 – 5 November 1995) was a British-Czech [[philosopher]] and [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]] described by ''The Daily Telegraph'', when he died, as one of the world's most vigorous intellectuals, and by ''The Independent'' as a "one-man crusader for [[critical rationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stirling|first1=Paul|title=Ernest Gellner Obituary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, ''Words and Things'' (1959), prompted a leader in ''The Times'' and a month-long correspondence on its letters page over his attack on [[linguistic philosophy]]. As the Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] for 22 years, the [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] for eight years, and head of the new Centre for the Study of Nationalism in Prague, Gellner fought all his life—in his writing, teaching and political activism—against what he saw as closed systems of thought, particularly [[communism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[relativism]] and the dictatorship of the [[free market]]. Among other issues in social thought, [[modernization theory]] and [[nationalism]] were two of his central themes, his multicultural perspective allowing him to work within the subject-matter of three separate civilizations: Western, Islamic, and Russian. He is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ERIKSEN|first1=THOMAS HYLLAND|title=Nationalism and the Internet|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=January 2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00273.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gellner was born in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=IndepObit&gt;Chris Hann, [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/gellner/Bio.html Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213012158/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/gellner/Bio.html |date=13 February 2006 }}, ''The Independent'', 8 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt; to Anna, née Fantl, and Rudolf, a lawyer, an urban intellectual German-speaking [[Jews|Jew]]ish couple from [[Bohemia]] (which, since 1918, was part of the newly established [[Czechoslovakia]]). [[Julius Gellner]] was his uncle. He was brought up in [[Prague]], attending a [[Czech language]] primary school before entering the English-language grammar school. This was [[Franz Kafka]]'s tricultural Prague: [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] but "stunningly beautiful", a city he later spent years longing for.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/gellner/InterGellner.html|title=Gellner Interview|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, when Gellner was 13, the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Germany]] persuaded his family to leave Czechoslovakia and move to [[St Albans]], just north of [[London]], where Gellner attended St Albans Boys Modern School, now [[Verulam School]] (Hertfordshire). At the age of 17, he won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] as a result of what he called "Portuguese colonial policy", which involved keeping "the natives peaceful by getting able ones from below into Balliol."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;
[[File:Prague from Klementinum.jpg|left|thumb|300px|"Prague is a stunningly beautiful town, and during the first period of my exile, which was during the war, I constantly used to dream about it, in the literal sense: it was a strong longing."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;]]

At Balliol, he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) and specialised in philosophy. He interrupted his studies after one year to serve with the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]], which took part in the [[Siege of Dunkirk (1944–45)]], and then returned to Prague to attend university there for half a term.

During this period, Prague lost its strong hold over him: foreseeing the communist takeover, he decided to return to England. One of his recollections of the city in 1945 was a communist poster saying: "Everyone with a clean shield into the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Party]]", ostensibly meaning that those whose records were good during the occupation were welcome. In reality, Gellner said, it meant exactly the opposite:
{{Quote|If your shield is absolutely filthy we'll scrub it for you; you are safe with us; we like you the better because the filthier your record the more we have a hold on you. So all the bastards, all the distinctive [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian personalities]], rapidly went into the Party, and it rapidly acquired this kind of character. So what was coming was totally clear to me, and it cured me of the emotional hold which Prague had previously had over me. I could foresee that a [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinoid]] [[dictatorship]] was due: it came in '48. The precise date I couldn't foresee, but that it was due to come was absolutely obvious for various reasons.... I wanted no part of it and got out as quickly as I could and forgot about it.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;}}
He returned to Balliol College in 1945 to finish his degree, winning the [[John Locke]] prize and taking [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours]] in 1947. The same year, he began his academic career at the [[University of Edinburgh]] as an assistant to Professor [[John Macmurray]] in the Department of Moral Philosophy. He moved to the London School of Economics in 1949, joining the sociology department under [[Morris Ginsberg]]. Ginsberg admired philosophy and believed that philosophy and sociology were very close to each other.

{{Quote|He employed me because I was a philosopher. Even though he was technically a professor of sociology, he wouldn't employ his own students, so I benefited from this, and he assumed that anybody in philosophy would be an evolutionary Hobhousean like himself. It took him some time to discover that I wasn't.&lt;ref name="interview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/gellner/Section2.html|title=Interview section 2|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] had preceded Ginsberg as Martin White Professor of Sociology at the LSE. Hobhouse's ''Mind in Evolution'' (1901) had proposed that society should be regarded as an organism, a product of evolution, with the individual as its basic unit, the subtext being that society would improve over time as it evolved, a [[teleology|teleological]] view that Gellner firmly opposed.

{{Quote|Ginsberg... was totally unoriginal and lacked any sharpness. He simply reproduced the kind of evolutionary [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] vision which had already been formulated by Hobhouse and which incidentally was a kind of extrapolation of his own personal life: starting in Poland and ending up as a fairly influential professor at LSE. He evolved, he had an idea of a [[great chain of being]] where the lowest form of life was the drunk, Polish, anti-Semitic peasant and the next stage was the Polish gentry, a bit better, or the Staedtl, better still. And then he came to England, first to [[University College London|University College]] under Dawes Hicks, who was quite rational (not all that rational—he still had some anti-Semitic prejudices, it seems) and finally ended up at LSE with Hobhouse, who was so rational that rationality came out of his ears. And so Ginsberg extrapolated this, and on his view the whole of humanity moved to ever greater rationality, from drunk Polish peasant to T.L. Hobhouse and a Hampstead garden.&lt;ref name=interview2/&gt;}}

Gellner's critique of linguistic philosophy in ''Words and Things'' (1959) focused on [[J. L. Austin]] and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], criticizing them for failing to question their own methods. The book brought Gellner critical acclaim. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on ''Organization and the Role of a [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]]'' and became Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method just one year later. ''Thought and Change'' was published in 1965, and in ''State and Society in Soviet Thought'' (1988), he examined whether Marxist regimes could be liberalized.

He was elected to the [[British Academy]] in 1974. He moved to Cambridge in 1984 to head the Department of Anthropology, holding the [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology|William Wyse chair]] and becoming a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]], which provided him with a relaxed atmosphere where he enjoyed drinking beer and playing [[chess]] with the students. Described by the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' as "brilliant, forceful, irreverent, mischievous, sometimes perverse, with a biting wit and love of irony", he was famously popular with his students, was willing to spend many extra hours a day tutoring them, and was regarded as a superb public speaker and gifted teacher.&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

His ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988) investigated the philosophy of history, and ''Conditions of Liberty'' (1994) sought to explain the collapse of [[socialism]]. In 1993, he returned to Prague, now rid of communism, and to the new [[Central European University]], where he became head of the Center for the Study of Nationalism, a program funded by [[George Soros]], the American billionaire philanthropist, to study the rise of [[nationalism]] in the post-communist countries of eastern and central [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalism.ceu.edu/ Nationalism Studies Program] at the CEU&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 1995, after returning from a conference in [[Budapest]], he suffered a heart attack and died at his flat in Prague, one month short of his 70th birthday.

Gellner was noted for his questionable sense of humour. His daughter, Sarah Gellner, revealed that one of her father's favourite jokes was "Rape, rape, rape, all summer long", and that "If there was one thing Dad disliked more than feminists, it was homosexual men."&lt;ref name="LRB v33 n16"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n16/letters |date=25 August 2011 |title=Letters: Memories of Ernest Gellner |journal=London Review of Books |volume=33 |number=16 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Words and Things''==
[[File:Balliol College Feb 2005.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gellner discovered his interest in linguistic philosophy while at Balliol.]]
With the publication in 1959 of ''Words and Things'', his first book, Gellner achieved fame and even notoriety among his fellow philosophers, as well as outside the discipline, for his fierce attack on [[ordinary language philosophy]] (or "linguistic philosophy", Gellner's preferred phrase). Ordinary language philosophy, in one form or another, was the dominant approach at [[Oxbridge]] at the time (although the philosophers themselves denied that they were part of any unified school). He first encountered the strong ideological hold of linguistic philosophy while at Balliol:
{{quotation|[A]t that time the orthodoxy best described as linguistic philosophy, inspired by Wittgenstein, was crystallizing and seemed to me totally and utterly misguided. Wittgenstein's basic idea was that there is no general solution to issues other than the custom of the community. Communities are ultimate. He didn't put it this way, but that was what it amounted to. And this doesn't make sense in a world in which communities are not stable and are not clearly isolated from each other. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein managed to sell this idea, and it was enthusiastically adopted as an unquestionable revelation. It is very hard nowadays for people to understand what the atmosphere was like then. This was ''the'' Revelation. It wasn't doubted. But it was quite obvious to me it was wrong. It was obvious to me the moment I came across it, although initially, if your entire environment, and all the bright people in it, hold something to be true, you assume you must be wrong, not understanding it properly, and they must be right. And so I explored it further and finally came to the conclusion that I did understand it right, and it was rubbish, which indeed it is.&lt;ref name=interview2/&gt;}}
''Words and Things'' is fiercely critical of the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[Antony Flew]], [[P. F. Strawson]] and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' (which he edited), and [[Bertrand Russell]] (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to ''[[The Times]]''. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social anthropology==
In the 1950s, Gellner discovered his great love of [[social anthropology]]. Chris Hann, director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology]], writes that following the hard-nosed empiricism of [[Bronisław Malinowski]], Gellner made major contributions to the subject over the next 40 years, ranging from "conceptual critiques in the analysis of kinship to frameworks for understanding political order outside the state in tribal [[Morocco]] (''Saints of the Atlas'', 1969); from sympathetic exposition of the works of Soviet Marxist anthropologists to elegant syntheses of the Durkheimian and Weberian traditions in western social theory; and from grand elaboration of 'the structure of human history' to path-breaking analyses of ethnicity and nationalism (''[[Thought and Change]]'', 1964; ''[[Nations and Nationalism (book)|Nations and Nationalism]]'', 1983)".&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

==Nationalism==
{{main article|Gellner's theory of nationalism}}
In 1983, Gellner published ''Nations and Nationalism''. For Gellner, "[[nationalism]] is primarily a political principle that holds that the political and the national unit should be congruent".&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, ''Nationalism'', 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Gellner argues that nationalism appeared and became a sociological necessity only in the modern world. In previous times ("the agro-literate" stage of history), rulers had little incentive to impose cultural homogeneity on the ruled. But in modern society, work becomes technical; one must operate a machine, and to do so, one must learn. There is a need for impersonal, context-free communication and a high degree of cultural standardisation.

Furthermore, [[industrial society]] is underlined by the fact that there is perpetual growth: employment types vary and new skills must be learned. Thus, generic employment training precedes specialised job training. On a territorial level, there is competition for the overlapping [[catchment area]]s (such as [[Alsace-Lorraine]]). To maintain its grip on resources and its survival and progress, the state and culture must for these reasons be congruent. Nationalism, therefore, is a necessity.

'''Fernão Lopes de Castanheda''' (Santarém, c. 1500 &amp;ndash; 1559 in Coimbra) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[historian]] in the early [[Renaissance]].
His "History of the discovery and conquest of India", full of geographic and ethnographic objective information, was widely translated throughout Europe.

== Life ==
Castanheda was the natural son of a royal officer, who held the post of judge in [[Goa]]. In 1528, he accompanied his father to [[Portuguese India]] and to the [[Moluccas]]. There he remained ten years, from 1528 to 1538, during which he gathered as much information as he could about the discovery and conquest of India by the Portuguese, in order to write a book on the subject. In 1538, he returned to Portugal, having collected from written and oral sources material for his great historical work. In serious economic difficulties, he settled in Coimbra, where he held a modest post of [[bedel]] in the [[University of Coimbra]].

== Works ==
Eight of the ten books of Castanheda's "História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses" (History of the discovery and conquest of India by the Portuguese) were printed in Coimbra: the first volume was issued in 1551, with a second edition in 1554. Six more volumes were published in his lifetime and three posthumously. 
After the eighth volume was issued, [[Catherine of Austria (1507–1578)|regent Queen D. Catarina]], pressured by few noblemen who disliked the objectivity of Castanheda, banned the printing of the remaining ninth and tenth volumes. His work, full of geographic and ethnographic information, was soon widely translated throughout Europe, first into French by Nicolas de Grouchy,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas de Grouchy (1510–1572) was a French scholar and writer who, after receiving many accolades, was called by [[John III of Portugal]] to teach Greek and philosophy at Coimbra until the end of 1549, when he returned to Normandy. He was [[Montaigne]]'s instructor at the [[College of Guienne|Collège de Guyenne]] with [[André de Gouveia]], which could explain at least a partial impact on Montaigne's understanding of the New World, shedding some light on some of the source material for his numerous essays.&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher at the University, Spanish (1554), Italian (1578) and English (1582).

The '''"figurative system of human knowledge"''', sometimes known as '''the tree of Diderot and d'Alembert''', was a tree developed to represent the structure of [[knowledge]] itself, produced for the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]].

The tree was a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of human knowledge, inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]''. The three main branches of knowledge in the tree are: "Memory"/[[History]], "Reason"/[[Philosophy]], and "Imagination"/[[Poetry]].

Notable is the fact that [[theology]] is ordered under 'Philosophy'. The historian [[Robert Darnton]] has argued that this categorization of [[religion]] as being subject to human reason, and not a source of knowledge in and of itself ([[revelation]]), was a significant factor in the controversy surrounding the work.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, "Philosophers Trim the Tree of Knowledge: The Epistemological Strategy of the ''Encyclopedie''," ''The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History'' (New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1984), 191-213.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally notice that 'Knowledge of God' is only a few nodes away from 'Divination' and 'Black Magic'.

The original version, in [[French (language)|French]], can be seen in the graphic on the right. An [http://www.hti.umich.edu/d/did/tree.html image of the diagram with English translations superimposed over the French text] is available. Another example of English translation of the tree is available in literature (see the reference by Schwab). Below is a version of it rendered in [[English (language)|English]] as a bulleted outline.

'''Frequency-dependent selection''' is an evolutionary process by which the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a [[phenotype]] depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given [[population]].

* In '''positive''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In '''negative''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of [[balancing selection]].

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to [[anti-predator adaptations]]. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; parameters in [[Lotka-Volterra]] competition equations are non-zero).

==Negative==
[[File:The anvil stone of a thrush - geograph.org.uk - 1751348.jpg|thumb|Anvil stone, where a thrush has broken open the shells of polymorphic [[grove snail]]s, may be a sign of frequency-dependent selection.]]

The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Clarke | first2 = B.C. | year = 1984 | title = Frequency-dependent selection -- homage to Poulton, E.B | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is [[Bryan Clarke]]'s 1962 paper on [[apostatic selection]] (a synonym of negative frequency-dependent selection).&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47-70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing [[Luuk Tinbergen]]'s classic work on [[searching image]]s as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation in songbirds. Archs.Neerl.Zool. 13:265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of [[heterosis]]) in opposition to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].

Another example is [[plant self-incompatibility]] [[allele]]s. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In human pathogens, such as the [[flu]] virus, once a particular strain has become common, most individuals have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus is able to spread quickly to almost any individual, causing continual evolution of viral strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Nei | first2 = M. | date = 1990 | title = Allelic genealogy under overdominant and frequency-dependent selection and polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex loci | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 967–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghans | first1 = JA | last2 = Beltman | first2 = JB | last3 = De Boer | first3 = RJ. |date=Feb 2004 | title = MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen coevolution. | url = | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 732–9 | doi=10.1007/s00251-003-0630-5 | pmid=14722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral ecology]], negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form.  As another example, male [[common side-blotched lizard]]s have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a [[rock paper scissors]] sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two.&lt;ref name="S&amp;L1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |author2=C.M. Lively |date=1996 |title=The rock–paper–scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6571 |pages=240–243 |doi=10.1038/380240a0|bibcode=1996Natur.380..240S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setal2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=Barry |author2=Donald B.

==Positive==
[[File:Müllerian mimicry among Heliconius species.tiff|thumb|Müllerian mimetic species of ''Heliconius'' from South America]]

Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species.  Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation.  Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller, F. |authorlink=Fritz Müller |year=1879 |title=Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London |pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the [[Batesian mimicry]] complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (''[[Lampropeltis elapsoides]]''), and the model, the eastern coral snake (''[[Micrurus fulvius]]''), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep [[sympatry]], the [[phenotype]] of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not 'educated', so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.&lt;ref name="Harper 1955–1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=G. R. |author2=Pfennig, D. W. |title=Mimicry on the edge: why do mimics vary in resemblance to their model in different parts of their geographical range? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=22 August 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1621 |pages=1955–1961 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0558 |pmid=17567563 |pmc=2275182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Clapp Vaillant''' (April 5, 1901,  &amp;ndash; May 13, 1945) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropologist]].

George Clapp Vaillant was born 1901 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and attended [[Noble and Greenough School]] in his hometown. After finishing his secondary education at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Massachusetts]], he went to [[Harvard University]] where he received his Bachelor's Degree in 1922 and Ph.D. in 1927. His Ph.D. thesis established a chronology of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ceramics. Later on, his work launched the historical sequence of cultures in pre-Columbian [[Mexico]].

During his college years, he worked at the Harvard [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]], and continued on excavating in [[Pecos, New Mexico|Pecos]], [[New Mexico]]. At the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York, N.Y.]], Vaillant was appointed the position of Assistant Curator in 1927, and promoted to Associate Curator three years later. He became an Honorary Curator at AMNH in 1941, when he accepted an invitation to become the Museum Director at the University of Pennsylvania. His position there was interrupted during the war when he became an Honorary Professor at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico in 1942, followed by a year in Peru where he served as the US State Department Cultural Relations Officer stationed in Lima (1943-1944). In 1944, he returned to Philadelphia, resuming his museum directorship at Penn. 

Vaillant conducted archaeological expeditions in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] from 1921 to 1922 and 1922 to 1925, in [[Egypt]] from 1923 to 1924, and in [[Central America]] in 1926 and 1928 to 1936. He also organized archaeological programs throughout [[Latin America]]. Three major excavation sites in the Basin of Mexico, [[Zacatenco]], [[Ticomán]], and [[El Arbolillo]], are located.

''[[Aztecs]] of Mexico: Origins, Rise and Fall of the Aztec Nation'' was completed in 1941, and a second edition was published posthumously. His other book, ''Indian Arts in North America'', was written in 1939. Vaillant also wrote several monographs on Middle American excavations.

Vaillant was known for the reconstruction of the early stages of Mexican Culture. His excavations at Zacatenco, Ticomán and El Arbollo established the framework for the Formative or Preclassic period in central Mexico. He was also known for his synthesis of Aztec history, which is also written in ''Aztecs in Mexico''. Throughout his research of relating archaeology to the events and descriptions of colonial sources and Mexican traditions, Vaillant concentrated on problems of chronology and culture history. Later in his career Vaillant excavated at several Aztec sites (Chiconautla and Nonoalco), but  failed to publish these projects. Several decades later Christina Elson and other scholars at the American Museum of Natural History completed the study of artifacts from these sites and began a program to publish them.

Vaillant shot himself in [[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1945, at the age of 44. His wife found him in their yard, a revolver next to him and a fatal wound through his head. The last person to see him alive was his elder son and namesake, [[George Eman Vaillant]], who at that time was 10 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200906/happiness/2 "What makes us happy?"] – The Atlantic Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4038">'''Guido Görres''' (28 May 1805 &amp;ndash; 14 July 1852) was a German Catholic historian, publicist and poet.

[[File:Guido Görres - Schriftsteller.jpg|thumb|Guido Görres.]]

==Life and works==
Born in [[Koblenz]], he was the son of [[Joseph Görres]], and made his early classical studies in his native town. During his father's banishment he went to [[Aarau]] and [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] to pursue his education. Reaching the [[University of Bonn]] in 1824, he devoted himself chiefly to the study of philology and history.
 
In Munich he continued his linguistic studies, and in 1830 received a prize from the [[French Academy]]. In the meantime (1827) his father had received a call as professor of history to Munich and Guido, influenced by his father's lectures, took up history as his chief study. The fruit of these studies where "[[Nikolaus von der Flüe]]" (Ratisbon, 1831) and "Die Jungfrau von Orleans" (Ratisbon, 1834; 3rd ed., 1895). Jointly with Count Franz Pocci, he published from 1834-39 an illustrated serial on the festivals of the Church, the "Festkalender in Bildern und Liedern", the first illustrated magazine for the young in German. Still carrying on his historical work, he made a great tour of Investigation through France in search of further material relating to the [[Joan of Arc|Maid of Orléans]].
 
But before long his work took a different direction. He edited from 1838 the "[[Historisch-politische Blätter]]", a publication established to maintain the defense of the rights of the Catholic Church and to champion the Interests of German Catholics. Guido Görres took charge of the editorial management with [[George Phillips (canon lawyer)|George Phillips]], and continued at this post until his death.
 
The writings published by him on this review were numerous and on various topics. At the same time his talents as a poet found expression in many beautiful compositions. He became one of the foremost lyricists among the modern Catholic poets of Germany. The tale "Schön Röslein" (Munich, 1838), the charming collection of "Marienlieder" (Munich, 1843), some of which are still sung by the people, besides " Das Weihnaehtskripplein" (Schaflthausen, 1843), "Das Leben der hl. Cäcilia in drei Gesangen" (Munich, 1843), and the widely known and popular poems "Die Gottesfahrt nach Trier" (Coblenz, 1844), "Die arme Pilgerin zum hl. Rock" (Coblenz, 1845), the "Gedichte" (Munich, 1844), evince true art, deep perception and delicate tenderness, combined with power of conception and vigour of form. His work "Der hürnene Siegried und sein Kampf mit dem Drachen" (Schaffhausen, 1843) belongs to the domain of literary history.
 
In 1846 he began with Count Pocci, as he had formerly done in the case of the Feast Calendar, the publication of an illustrated magazine called the "Deutsches Hausbuch", which however appeared for two years only. On the death of Klemens Brentano Görres edited his "Märchen" (2 volumes, Stuttgart, 1846). He also produced an excellent German translation of the "[[The Imitation of Christ]]" (St. Pölten, 1839, with illustrations by Steinle). In 1844 Görres married Maria Vespermann, who gave him three daughters. But his conjugal happiness was not to last more than eight years, for he died at Munich at the age of forty-seven years.

The University of Göttingen was the original centre of the "[[:de:Geschichtswissenschaft|Geschichtswissenschaft]]" or history as an academic discipline, and became a major centre for globally-orientated anthropology.&lt;ref name="Burns2006"/&gt; The school itself was one of the newest universities in Europe, having been founded in 1734 by [[:de:Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen|Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen]], and the first to require the obligation to conduct and publish research alongside lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demel|first=Walter|title=Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Western and Eastern Constructions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTMyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23741-4|pages=68–|quote=In order to explain this concept and its changes, one must consider the intellectual situation of Göttingen. A university had been founded in this Lower Saxony town in 1736-37. Here, for the first time. the task of giving lectures was combined with the obligation to conduct and publish research. Göttingen soon became known as a center of “universal” historiography which - under English influence - flourished there… Being a center of global history, Göttingen became a hub for globally oriented anthropology as well. Or, to express it with a slight exaggeration: It became what would be called in German the most important ‘’Hexenküche’’ [witch’s kitchen] of racial theories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historians of this school sought to write a [[universal history]] by combining the critical methods of [[Jean Mabillon]] with that of the philosophical historians such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Edward Gibbon]].&lt;ref name="Ranke2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iggers|first=Georg|title=The Theory and Practice of History: Edited with an Introduction by Georg G.

Niebuhr and Ranke refined the concern with critical method, Ranke in the process narrowed the universality of the outlook of the Gottingen historians. What Ranke brought to history was less a new method - this had been developed to a great extent by the Gottingen school - than a greater emphasis on the professional and technical character of history and a conception of history that we shall discuss later in this Introduction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1961, Sierra Leone became politically independent of Great Britain. It retained a parliamentary system of government and was a member of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), led by Sir [[Milton Margai]] were victorious in the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1962|first general election]] under universal adult franchise in May 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Pham | first = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/WikEd_align_down.pngJohn-Peter   | title = Child soldiers, adult interests: the global dimensions of the Sierra Leonean tragedy  | publisher = Nova Publishers  | year = 2005 | pages = 32–33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=sierra+leone+independence+1961&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8VZmTcP2F8qwhQexyuDODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sierra%20leone%20independence%201961&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Sir Milton's death in 1964, his [[half-brother]], Sir [[Albert Margai]], succeeded him as Prime Minister. Sir Albert attempted to establish a [[one-party state]] had the ready cooperation of the opposition All People' Congress  but met fierce resistance from some cadre  within his party [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP) and ultimately abandoned the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political leadership in Sierra Leone | author=John R.

In [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1967|closely contested elections]] in March 1967, the APC won a plurality of the parliamentary seats. Accordingly, the [[Governor General]] (representing the British Monarch) [[Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston]] declared [[Siaka Stevens]] &amp;ndash; APC leader and Mayor of Freetown &amp;ndash; as the new Prime Minister. Within a few hours, Stevens and Lightfoot-Boston were placed under house arrest by Brigadier [[David Lansana]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces|Sierra Leone Military Forces]] (SLMF), on grounds that the determination of office should await the election of the tribal representatives to the house. A group of senior military officers overrode this action by seizing control of the government on 23 March, arresting Brigadier Lansana, and suspending the constitution. The group constituted itself as the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC) with Brigadier [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]] as its chairman. The NRC in turn was overthrown in April 1968 by a "sergeants' revolt," the [[Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement]]. NRC members were imprisoned, army and police officers were deposed, the democratic constitution was restored, and power was handed back to Stevens, who at last assumed the office of Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Gberie| first =Lansana | title = A dirty war in West Africa: the RUF and the destruction of Sierra Leone | publisher =C.

After the return to civilian rule by-elections were held beginning in the fall of 1968 and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Tranquility was not completely restored: in November 1968 a state of emergency was declared after provincial disturbances, and in March 1971 the government survived an unsuccessful military coup. In April 1971 a republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became President. In 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that it boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last =Rotberg | first =Robert I. | title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror  | publisher = Brookings Institution Press| year =2003  | pages = 80 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=sierra+leone+%221973+election%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HGJmTfLzK4-7hAfG1cXjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sierra%20leone%20%221973%20election%22&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1974, the government uncovered an alleged military coup plot. As in 1971, the leaders were tried and executed. In 1977, student demonstrations against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics. A [[Sierra Leonean parliamentary election, 1977|general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15.

==An independent nation led by Sir Milton Margai==

On 27 April 1961, Milton Margai led Sierra Leone to independence from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="advocate"&gt;[http://www.advocatenations.org/html/sierra_leone.html Advocate Nations of Africa: Sierra Leone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927213105/http://www.advocatenations.org/html/sierra_leone.html |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Sierra Leoneans across the nation took to the streets to celebrate their independence. The nation held its [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1962|first general elections]] on 27 May 1962, and Margai was elected Sierra Leone's first prime minister by a landslide.&lt;ref name="advocate" /&gt; Milton Margai's political party, the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), won by large margins in the nation's first general election under universal adult [[suffrage]] in May 1962. 
{{Original research|section|date=April 2011}}
An important aspect of Margai's character was his self-effacement. He was neither corrupt nor did he make a lavish display of his power or status. Sir Milton's government was based on the [[rule of law]] and the notion of separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai used his conservative deology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials with a clear eye to satisfy various ethnic groups.  Margai successfully built coalitions from in the 1950s to attain independence without bloodshed. With his genteel nature, Margai employed a brokerage style of politics by sharing political power between political groups and the [[paramamount chiefs]] in the provinces.

Upon Margai's death on 28 April 1964, an internal crisis within members of the Sierra Leone People's party erupted as to who would succeed Margai as Prime Minister. The parliament of Sierra Leone held an emergency session to elect a new prime minister; the person must be a member of the ruling SLPP party. One of the two leading candidates to succeed  Margai as prime minister was [[Sir]] [[Albert Margai]], Sierra Leone's Finance Minister and also the younger brother of Sir Milton Margai. The other was Dr. [[John Karefa-Smart]], Sierra Leone's foreign minister and a close ally of Sir Milton. Sir Albert Margai was elected by a majority vote in Parliament to be the new leader of the SLPP and the next prime minister of Sierra Leone. Sir Albert Margai's leadership was briefly challenged by Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister John Karefa-Smart, an ethnic [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]], who questioned Sir Albert's succession to the SLPP leadership position. Kareefa-Smart received little support in Parliament in his attempt to have Margai stripped of the SLPP leadership.

==Albert Margai Administration==

Sir Albert was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second Prime Minister the same day his brother died at a ceremony held at the Sierra Leone's parliament in Freetown. Soon after Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he immediately dismissed Karefa-Smart and several other senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Sir Milton's government, as he viewed them as [[traitors]] and a threat to his administration. Sir Albert appointed the Creole politician [[Cyril B. Rogers-Wright]] to replace Karefa-Smart.

Unlike his late brother Milton, Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing the country's Paramount Chiefs executive powers and he was seen as a threat to the existence of the ruling houses across the country. This made him unpopular with the powerful paramount chiefs, most of whom were founding members of the SLPP. To strengthen support for his reform agenda for the party and the country the new Prime Minister brought into the executive of the SLPP and his government younger, western-educated, and more radicallised members of the party including [[Salia Jusu Sheriff]] (PhD). The party was thus divided with the traditionalist and more powerful old guard against the new and younger leaders. As Prime Minister Sir Albert Margai opposed Creole domination of the civil service and many ethnic Creoles lost their positions in the civil service as a result. Sir Albert Margai was highly criticized during his tenure as prime minister.  He was accused of corruption and of a policy of affirmative action in favor of the [[Mende people|Mende]] ethnic group. During Albert Margai's administration, The Mende increased their influence both in the civil service and the army. Most of the top military and government positions were held by Mendes. Sir Albert also tried to establish a [[one-party state]] but with very little support in Parliament, even among his fellow SLPP members and was also met by fierce resistance from the main opposition the [[All People's Congress]] (APC), which had become suddenly more popular than the ruling SLPP and ultimately abandoned the idea. 
[[File:All People's Congress political rally Sierra Leone 1968.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[All People's Congress|APC]] political rally in [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]], [[Koinadugu District]] outside the home of supporters of the rival SLPP in 1967.]]

Under Albert Margai's government, Sierra Leone enjoyed [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. Sir Albert tolerated criticism of his government, even by his political opponent. Not a single journalist or politician was killed during his term in office. Sir Albert tolerated criticism or written a [[libel]] claim against his government. Under Albert Margai, all Sierra Leoneans had equal access to free and fair trial .Sir Albert had the opportunity to perpetuate himself in power, but he elected not to do so even when the opportunities presented themselves. He had the police and the army on his side and nothing could have prevented him from achieving his ambition to hold on to power, but he chose not to and called for a free and fair elections.

==Three military coups, 1967-1968==

After the closely contested general election in March 1967, Sierra Leone [[Governor General]] Sir [[Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston]] declared the new prime minister to be Siaka Stevens, an ethnic [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]], the candidate of the APC and the mayor of Freetown.  Stevens had defeated the incumbent prime minister, Sir Albert Margai, by a narrow margin. Stevens won the majority of the vote in the north of the country and in the western area, including in Freetown. Albert Margai on the other side, won the vast majority of the vote in south-eastern Sierra Leone. Sir Albert conceded defeat and handed power to Siaka Stevens. Stevens was sworn in as Sierra Leone's third prime minister on 21 March 1967 in Freetown. Mere hours after he took office, soldiers stormed the State House and abducted Stevens at gunpoint. The coup was led by [[Brigadier General]] [[David Lansana]], an ethnic Mende and the commander of the [[Military of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone Armed Forces]]. Brigadier Lansana was a prominent supporter of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the top command in 1964. Brigadier Lansana declared a state of emergency and imposed martial law. He insisted that the determination of the winner of the election should await the election of the tribal representatives in Parliament, mostly from Mende [[chiefdoms]] in South-Eastern Sierra Leone.

On 23 March 1967, however, a group of senior army officers led by Brigadier [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]], an ethnic Creole, in turn seized control of the government, arrested Lansana and suspended the constitution.  Martial law was maintained. The group constituted itself as the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC) with [[Brigadier]] [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]] as its chairman. On 18 April 1968, the NRC was in turn overthrown by a third group of senior army, who called themselves the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM), led by Brigadier General [[John Amadu Bangura]], an ethnic Limba. The ACRM imprisoned Brigadier Andrew Juxon-Smith and other senior NRC members and restored the constitution. In Brigadier Bangura's  first speech, he urged Sierra Leoneans to stay calm and appealed to the military to respect the constitution and stay out of politics. Bangura invited Stevens to the state house and reinstated him as prime minister in a special ceremony. Brigadier Bangura was accused of tribalism in favor of Siaka Stevens.

==Stevens government and one-party state==

Stevens assumed power again in 1968 with a great deal of promise and ambition. Much trust was placed upon him as he championed multi-party politics. Upon taking power from the military, however, he drove the SLPP from competitive politics in general elections using violence and intimidation. To gain support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.

After the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, Stevens declared a [[state of emergency]] after disturbance in the provinces.

Stevens had campaigned on a platform of socialist principles. However, when he became Prime Minister he abandoned his pre-election promises and employed an authoritarian model of governance.&lt;ref name="trcsierraleone.org"&gt;[http://trcsierraleone.org/drwebsite/publish/v3a-c1.shtml?page=15 The Final Report of the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission of Sierra Leone].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone military were disappointed but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could put the brakes on Stevens. Bangura was a magnetic and popular figure among Sierra Leoneans. The army was devoted to him and this made him potentially dangerous to Steven's new agenda in the shifting political climate of Sierra Leone. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. He was convicted and [[sentenced to death]] by execution. On 29 March 1970, Bangura was hanged at the Kissy Road in central Freetown. In March 1971, a group of senior military officials attempted an unsuccessful military coup. The coup leaders were convicted and executed, including several senior officers in the army and some senior government officials.

On 19 April 1971, parliament declared Sierra Leone a republic, with Siaka Stevens as president and [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] as Vice President. Under the APC regimes headed by Stevens, the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]], Stevens' own ethnic group and the Creoles, enjoyed strong influence in the government and civil service. Another major ethnic group, the [[Temne people|Temne]] joined the [[Mende people|Mende]] in opposition to the APC government. But after Stevens appointed an ethnic Temne, Sorie Ibrahim Koroma as vice-president, the Temne appeared to have emerged as an influential group in the APC government. [[Guinea]]n troops requested by Stevens to support his government were in the country from 1971 to 1973. In May 1973, general elections were held throughout the country, but the main opposition, the SLPP, boycotted the 1973 general election, alleging widespread intimidation and procedural obstruction.

In 1973, president Stevens and president [[William Tolbert]] of Liberia signed a treaty forming the [[Mano River Union]] to facilitate trade between Sierra Leone and Liberia, with Guinea joining in 1980 under president [[Sekou Toure]]. In 1975, Sierra Leone joined the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

An alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials including Brigadier David Lansana, former cabinet minister [[Mohamed Sorie Forna]], Brigadier General [[Ibrahim Bash Taqi]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Habib Lansana Kamara]] were executed after being convicted for allegedly attempting a coup to topple president Stevens' government.

In early 1977, a major anti-government demonstration by students and youth occurred throughout the country against the APC government and deteriorating economic conditions. Police and the army put down the demonstration.

In the national parliamentary election of May 1977, the APC won 74 seats and the main opposition, the SLPP, won 15. The SLPP condemned the election, alleged widespread vote-rigging and voter intimidation. In 1978, the APC dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a [[one-party state]]. The 1978 referendum made the APC the only legal political party in Sierra Leone. This move lead to another major demonstration in many parts of the country  but again it was put down by the army and the police.

Stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominating APC government.

'''Hong Kong Archaeological Society''' ({{zh|t=香港考古學會}}) is a government-funded organization dedicated to carry out excavations and preserve archaeological heritage in [[Hong Kong]]. The society affiliates with the [[Hong Kong Museum of History]] to establish artifact collections and journal publications.&lt;ref name="HKASIntro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkarch.org/main/index.php/en/about-hkas-en|title=Introduction|publisher=Hong Kong Archaeological Society|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

After the discovery of prehistoric sites in [[Hong Kong]] during the 1920s, archaeology activities began in the area. Artifact recoveries and research publications appeared by the 1930s. The earliest recorded archaeologists in Hong Kong were John Schofield and Raffaele Maglioni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Hong Kong|page=26|isbn=978-962-209-925-8|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unearthed stone tools, potteries, and bronze artifacts led to support of human presence during the late [[Neolithic]] period and [[Bronze Age]] in the Hong Kong area with artifacts dating back to 3000–1200&amp;nbsp;BC and 1200–400&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=HKAS1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html |title=The Trial Excavation at the Archaeological Site of Wong Tei Tung, Sham Chung, Hong Kong SAR |publisher=Hong Kong Archaeological Society |date=January 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227012021/http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html |archivedate=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the accidental discovery of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] tomb at [[Lei Cheng Uk]]. An archaeological team was formed by the [[University of Hong Kong]] a year later, with a limited membership to survey the site. By 1960, the team carried out other excavations at Man Kok Tsui, [[Lantau Island]] with artifact dating back to the Bronze Age.

In 1967, the archaeologist team reformed to the Hong Kong Archaeological Society to anticipate larger participations numbered around 200 members.&lt;ref name=HKASIntro /&gt;

==Notable excavations==
During the 1970s, projects in [[Sham Wan]] and [[Sha Po Old Village]] of [[Lamma Island]] discovered artifacts dating to [[Bronze Age]] and [[Neolithic]] eras.

In 1990, the society began a 16 months artifact rescue mission in [[Chek Lap Kok]] at the future site of the [[Hong Kong International Airport]].

In 1991, an excavation at Yung Long, west to [[Tuen Mun]] revealed a cultural phase with painted pottery, dated to 4400–3800 BC.

In 1994, salvage project in [[Kau Sai Chau]] revealed a site without pottery dating to approximately 5000 BC.

In 1999, the society discovered numerous artifacts in Chan Ka Yuen in [[Pak Nai|Ha Pak Nai]], west to Tuen Mun.

In 2000, [[Lam Tsuen Valley]] in [[Tai Po]] was investigated by the society.

In 2001, a house structure with underground water system dated to [[Song Dynasty]] were discovered in Mong Tseng Wai of [[Yuen Long]].  It was the only Song Dynasty village site in Hong Kong.

In 2004–05, the society invited Lingnan Archaeology of [[Sun Yat-sen University]] to salvage a stone quarry excavation site at [[Wong Tei Tung]] near [[Sai Kung]].  Artifacts discovered were dated back to late [[Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scitech.people.com.cn/BIG5/53757/4115149.html|script-title=zh:港現舊石器制造場 嶺南或為我發源地|trans-title=Paleolithic site appears in Hong Kong, Lingnan perhaps discovered our birthplace|newspaper=[[People's Daily]]|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=9 October 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=Chung|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/linkfile/cuhk_uc.pdf|script-title=zh:考古與香港尋根|language=Chinese|trans-title=Archaeologist help find Hong Kong's Roots|publisher=[[New Asia College]]|journal=New Asia Monthly|volume= 32|issue=6|year=2005|pages=6–8|accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Kaminiates''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Καμινιάτης}}, fl. tenth century) was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] resident of [[Thessalonica]] when the city, then one of the largest in the [[Byzantine Empire]], was [[Sack of Thessalonica (904)|besieged and sacked]] by a [[Saracen]] force led by [[Leo of Tripoli]] in 904. His account of the city's plunder, ''On the capture of Thessalonica'', (Εις την άλωσιν της Θεσσαλονίκης, ''Eis tēn alōsin tēs Thessalonikēs'') survives in four manuscripts; though of these, none were written before the fourteenth century, causing some concern over the text's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

John Kaminiates has alternatively been [[Romanization of Greek|transliterated]] John Kaminatos, Ioannis Kaminiatis, and sometimes appears in the [[Romanization|Latinized]] forms Ioannis Caminiatae, Joannes Cameniata and John Cameniates.

He was a founder of the [[Ibadan School]] that dominated the writing of the [[History of Nigeria]] until the 1970s. He is credited with "having played the leading role in creating a generation of African historians who could interpret their own history without being influenced by Eurocentric approaches."&lt;ref name=Sandiford&gt;[[Keith A.

==Career== 
Born in [[Awka]], eastern Nigeria, Kenneth Onwuka Dike was educated in West Africa, England and Scotland. He attended [[Fourah Bay College]], [[Sierra Leone]] and also [[Durham University]] for his [[BSc]], the [[University of Aberdeen]] for his [[Master of Arts|MA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html|title=Kenneth O.

During the 1960s, as a member of the University of Ibadan's history department, he played a pioneering role in promoting African leadership of scholarly works published on [[Africa]]. As the head of the organizing committee of the First International Congress of Africanists in [[Ghana]] in 1963, he sought for a strengthened meticulous non-colonial focused African research, publication of research in various languages including indigenous and foreign, so as to introduce native speakers to history and for people to view African history through a common eye. In 1965 he was elected chairman of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]].&lt;ref name=Sandiford /&gt;

Nwaubani argues that Dike was the first modern scholarly proponent of Africanist history. His publications were a watershed in African historiography. With a PhD from London, Dike became the first African to complete Western historical professional training. At the University College of Ibadan, he became the first African professor of history and head of a history department. He founded the [[Nigerian National Archives]], and helped in the founding of the Historical Society of Nigeria. His book ''Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta 1830-1885'' dealt with 19th-century economics politics in the Niger Delta. He focused on internal African factors, especially defensive measures undertaken by the delta societies against imperialist penetration. Dike helped create the Ibadan School of African history and promoted the use of oral evidence by African historians.&lt;ref&gt;Ebere Nwaubani, "Kenneth Onwuka Dike, 'Trade And Politics,' and the Restoration of the African in History", ''History in Africa: A Journal of Method,'' 2000, Vol. 27, pp. 229-248&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumasi is near [[Lake Bosomtwe]], in a [[rain forest]] region, and is the commercial, industrial and cultural capital of [[Ashanti Empire|Asanteman]]. Kumasi is approximately {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[the Equator]] and {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Kumasi is alternatively known as "The Garden City" because of its many beautiful species of flowers and plants. It is also called Oseikrom ([[Osei Kofi Tutu I|Osei Tutu]]'s town). Kumasi is described as Ghana’s second city&lt;!-- because almost every diplomatic and evolving uplift to a city that makes it number one is situated/ created in the country's capital (This is problem some citizens complain about) but Kumasi has every trait and effort to be Ghana's first city--&gt;.&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|title=The grasscutter shows why it is hard to stop bushmeat hunting|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21727918-farming-delicious-cane-rats-turns-out-be-harder-hunting-them|work=[[The Economist]]|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Lake Bosumtwi1, Ghana.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Lake Bosomtwe]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
There is evidence that the area around Kumasi has been kept cleared since the [[Neolithic]] age and that the first human settlement was at Lake Bosomtwe.

===Etymology===
The name Kumasi comes from the [[Twi]] language, meaning "Under the Kum tree."  The word "ase" or "asi" means "under, down, or below" and is used in many place names in Ghana, such as [[Obuasi]], [[Daboase]], and Kenyase.

Around the end of the 17th century, the Asante Kingdom chief fetish Priest Anokye Komfuo planted three "KUM" trees at different places: one at Kwaaman ruled by the Nananom Ayokofuo , a second one at Apemso-Bankofo ruled by Nananom Aduanafuo, and a third at a village near Fomena and Amoafo called Oboani, which was ruled by Nananom Ɛkoɔnafuo. He wanted to see which of these would become a great city for the kingdom, as he was directed by the oracles. The Kum tree at Kwaaman flourished and became a very big tree under which the King and his people often sat, and so Kwaaman became Kum-ase meaning under Kum.

The tree at Oboani was however very tiny and for no apparent reason was relatively short. According to oral tradition this small tree however produced a couple of other trees which were all small in size. The name of the village was changed to Kuma meaning small KUM.

The Kum tree at Apemso-Bankofo did not grow at all. After some few weeks the leaves got rotten and the tree fell down and so it was said that the Kum tree has died or the Kum tree was dead and so the village became Kum-awu and this later changed to become Kumawu.

===Asanteman===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-37-39.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Kings Way Road in Kumasi, 1925.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The city rose to prominence in 1695 when it became capital of the [[Ashanti Confederacy]] due to the activities of its ruler [[Osei Tutu]]. The ruler of Kumasi, known as the [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]], also served as ruler of the Confederacy. With their 1701 victory over Denkyira the Asante confederacy became the primary state among the [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]].&lt;ref&gt;McCaskie, T. C. "Denkyira in the Making of Asante" in ''The Journal of African History'' vol. 48 (2007) no. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the city, including the then royal residence, were destroyed by British troops in the [[Anglo-Ashanti Wars|Third Anglo-Ashanti War]] of 1874.

Lady Mary Alice Hodgson, the first English lady to visit Ashanti, wrote "The Siege of Kumasi" an account of the siege of the fort by the [[Nationality|nationals]] of Ashanti and of the subsequent march to the coast.&lt;ref name="Morgan,  Henry James Types"/&gt; (She was the daughter of Hon. W. A. G. Young, C.M.G., former governor of the Gold Coast, and the wife of Sir [[Frederick Mitchell Hodgson]], K.C.M.G., the governor of the Gold Coast in 1900.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Henry James Types"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Morgan |editor-first=Henry James |editor-link=Henry James Morgan |title=Types of Canadian Women and of Women who are or have been Connected with Canada |location=Toronto |publisher=Williams Briggs |date=1903 |url=https://archive.org/details/typesofcanadianw01morguoft/page/160 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1926, following the return of the Ashanti king, Prempeh I after a 30-year exile Kumasi was restored as the ceremonial control over the Ashanti sub-states and the full role of king was restored by the colonial administration in 1935. The city holds an important place in the history of the [[Ashanti people]], as legend claims that it was here [[Okomfo Anokye]] received the [[Asante royal thrones|golden stool]], an embodiment of the soul of the Ashanti nation [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]].Yaa Asantewaa also a very renowned Ashanti warrior and leader was also taken to Seychelles Island and never returned.

==Climate==

Kumasi features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]], with relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Kumasi averages around 1400&amp;nbsp;mm (55") of rain per year.

The city almost features two rainy seasons: a longer season from March through July and a shorter rainy season from September to November.

The months of February through to November is one long [[wet season]], with a relative lull in precipitation in August. Similar to the rest of West Africa, Kumasi experiences the [[harmattan]] during the "low sun" months. Lasting from December to February, the harmattan is the primary source of the city's [[dry season]].

This is a list of monuments suffering damage from conflict in the [[Middle East]] during the 21st century. It is sorted by country.

==Afghanistan==
* The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were a spectacular legacy of [[Buddhism]] in [[Afghanistan]]. The sandstone sculptures were among the tallest standing Buddhas in the world (the largest at 53 metres). The 35 structures had survived more than 1,500 years. The [[Taliban]] stated that they considered the monuments [[idolatrous]] and destroyed them with dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"&gt;{{cite news |title=The greatest buildings you'll never see: 20 priceless monuments lost in conflict |author=Kieron Monks |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/gallery/precious-monuments-lost-in-middle-east-conflicts/index.html|network=cnn |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
* The [[Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Cairo]] is home to one of the world's most impressive collections of Islamic art. It includes over 100,000 pieces that cover the entirety of [[Islamic history]]. The Cairo site was first built in 1881 and underwent a multi-million dollar renovation between 2003 and 2010.

: On January 24th, 2014 a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It is estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the buildings facade, wiping out intricate designs in the Islamic style. The [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] in the same building was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140124-cairo-egypt-museum-islamic-art-bomb-artifacts-destroyed/|title=Cairo Blast Rips Into Islamic Art Museum, Damaging Key Global Collection|date=26 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25877201 | work=BBC News | title=Cairo's Islamic Art Museum hit in blast | date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/unesco-islamic-museum-cairo-blast|title=Unesco to assess blast damage at Islamic museum in Cairo|first=Associated Press in|last=Cairo|date=26 January 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq==
* [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. Once the largest [[mosque]] in the world, built in the 9th century on the [[Tigris River]] north of [[Baghdad]]. The mosque is famous for Malwiya Tower, a 52-meter minaret with spiraling ramps for worshipers to climb. The site was bombed in 2005, in an insurgent attack on a [[NATO]] position, destroying the top of the minaret and surrounding walls.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Tomb of Jonah]]. The purported resting place of biblical prophet Jonah, along with a tooth by some believed to be from the whale that consumed him in the myth. The site dated to the 8th century BC, and was of great importance to [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] faiths. It was entirely blown up by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] militants in 2014 as part of their campaign against perceived apostasy.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Nimrud]]. The ancient [[Assyria]]n city around Nineveh Province, Iraq was home to countless treasures of the empire, including statues, monuments and jewels. Following the 2003 invasion the site has been devastated by looting, with many of the stolen pieces finding homes in museum abroad.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Saint Elijah's Monastery 1.JPG|thumb|[[Dair Mar Elia]] monastery]]
* [[Dair Mar Elia]]. The Christian monastery near Mosul was founded in the late 6th century, and its sanctuary was built in the 11th century. The monastery was damaged during the invasion of 2003, before being completely destroyed by ISIL in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Martin|title=Isil extremists destroy Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/isil-extremists-destroy-iraq-s-oldest-christian-monastery/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanon==
* [[Old Beirut]] suffered through a brutal 15-year civil war, successive battles with [[Israel]], and sweeping urban development. It is referred to as the "Paris of the [[Middle East]]" and is known for its impressive landscape Ottoman, French and [[Art Deco]] architecture. Officials report that just 400 of 1200 protected historic buildings remain.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

==Libya==
* [[Cyrene (Libya)]]. A key city for the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], established in [[630 BC]]. Famed as the basis for enduring myths and legends, such as that of the huntress heroine of the same name and bride of [[Apollo]]. The ruins were some of the best preserved from that period.

: In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Cyrene in 1917 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in [[Benghazi]] were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artefacts which were part of the so-called 'Benghazi Treasure' . The whereabouts of these objects are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/benghazi-treasure |title=Benghazi Treasure |publisher=Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Cyrene were destroyed in August 2013 by locals to make way for homes and shops. Approximately 200 vaults and tombs were leveled, as well as a section of a viaduct dating to the third century BC. Artifacts were thrown into a nearby river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1242-130823-libya-cyrene-necropolis |title=Destruction of Cyrene Necropolis |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site included a church, museum, and fire that burned continuously. On 21 September 2014, the memorial complex was blown up by militants of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayrumyan|first1=Naira|title=Middle East Terror: Memory of Armenian Genocide victims targeted by ISIS militants|url=http://www.armenianow.com/commentary/analysis/57070/armenia_church_syria_isis_aram_catholicos|work=[[ArmeniaNow]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IS said to destroy Armenian Genocide memorial|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/is-reportedly-destroys-armenian-genocide-memorial/|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who destroyed the Armenian Genocide Martyrs’ Memorial Church in Deir Ezzor?|url=https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/iraq-syria-islamic-state-destruction-deir-ez-zor-armenian-genocide-memorial-church-responsibility/|website=conflict antiquities|accessdate=20 March 2015|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ancient city of [[Bosra]]. Continually inhabited for 2,500 years, and became the capital of the Romans' Arabian empire/ The centerpiece is a magnificent Roman theatre dating back to the second century that survived intact until the current century. Archeologists have revealed the site is now severely damaged from mortar shelling.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Aleppo Citadel 04.jpg|right|thumb|The fortified entrance of the Citadel of Aleppo]]
* [[Citadel of Aleppo]]. The fortress spans at least four millennia, from the days of [[Alexander the Great]], through Roman, Mongol, and Ottoman rule. The site has barely changed since the 16th century and is one of Syria's most popular [[World Heritage sites]].&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

: In August 2012, during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012)|Battle of Aleppo]] of the [[Syrian civil war]], the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the [[Free Syrian Army]] and the [[Syrian Army]] to gain control over the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aleppo citadel hit by shelling, says opposition |agency=Agence France Presse |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Aug-11/184198-aleppo-citadel-hit-by-shelling-says-opposition.ashx#axzz23BbEcFXx |newspaper=The Daily Star Lebanon |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: During the conflict, the [[Syrian Army]] used the Citadel as a military base, with the walls acting as cover while shelling surrounding areas and ancient arrow slits in walls being used by snipers to target rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Syrian castles serve again as fighting positions |author=Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ancient-syrian-castles-serve-again-as-fighting-positions/2013/05/04/5d2bb176-b3f8-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Syrian castles serve again as fighting positions |author=Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ancient-syrian-castles-serve-again-as-fighting-positions/2013/05/04/5d2bb176-b3f8-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this contemporary usage, the Citadel has received significant damage.

* [[Al-Madina Souq]]. The covered markets in the Old City are a famous trade center for the region's finest produce, with dedicated sub-souks for fabrics, food, and accessories. The tunnels became the scene of fierce fighting and many of the oldest are now damaged beyond recognition. This was described by UNESCO as a tragedy.&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"/&gt;
* [[Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge]]. This French-built suspension bridge was a popular pedestrian crossing and vantage point for its views of the Euphrates River. The bridge was destroyed by [[Free Syrian Army]] militiamen during the [[Syrian civil war]] in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breakingnews.sy/ar/article/16724.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque]]. Among Syria's most famous Ottoman-style mosques, which also shows [[Mamluk]] influence through its light and dark contrasts. As of 2007, activities in the mosque were organized by [[sheikh|shaykh]]s Haytham al-Sa'id and Ahmad Mithqan.&lt;ref&gt;Rougier, 2007, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps depicting the mosque have been issued in several denominations.

: The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque has been a symbol of anti-government rebels during the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Albert |last1=Aji |first2=Bassem |last2=Mroue |title=Khalid Ibn Al-Walid Mosque In Homs' Khaldiyeh District |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/27/syrian-troops-homs-mosque_n_3663894.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2013-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Syrian security forces killed 10 protesters participating in a funeral procession as they were leaving the mosque on 18 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/world/middleeast/20syria.html?_r=0|title=At Funerals for Protesters, More Syrians Are Fatally Shot|accessdate=8 September 2012|publisher=New York Times|date= 18 July 2011|first=Nada|last=Bakri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque, which the [[Syrian government]] stated had been turned by the rebels into an "arms and ammunition depot", was abandoned by the rebels on 27 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/07/29/01003-20130729ARTFIG00374-syrie-l-armee-en-voie-de-controler-totalement-homs.php|title=Syrie : l'armée en voie de contrôler totalement Homs|accessdate=2013-07-30|publisher=Le Figaro|date=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelling by government forces damaged Khalid's tomb inside the mosque.

* [[Krak des Chevaliers]]. The Crusader castle from the 11th century survived centuries of battles and natural disasters, becoming a [[World Heritage site]] in 2006 along with the adjacent castle of Qal'at Salah El-Din.

: During the [[Syrian Civil War]] which began in 2011 UNESCO voiced concerns that the conflict might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/862 |title=Director-General of UNESCO appeals for protection of Syria’s cultural heritage |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the castle was [[Artillery|shelled]] in August 2012 by the [[Syrian Army|Syrian Arab Army]], and the Crusader chapel has been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syrias-ancient-treasures-pulverised-8007768.html| title=Robert Fisk: Syria's ancient treasures pulverised| publisher=The Independent| date=2012-08-05| accessdate=2012-08-05| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was reported to have been damaged in July 2013 by an [[Syrian Arab Air Force|airstrike]] during the [[Siege of Homs]],&lt;ref name="Air strike  2013"&gt;{{cite news| title=Latest victim of Syria air strikes: Famed Krak des Chevaliers castle| url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=60073| accessdate=14 July 2013| newspaper=Middle East Online| date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once more on the 18th of August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown. The Syrian Arab Army recaptured the castle and the village of al-Hosn from rebel forces during the [[Battle of Hosn]] on March 20, 2014, although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/us-syria-crisis-lebanon-idUSBREA2J19M20140320|title=Syrian army retakes Crusader castle from rebels|first=Oliver|last=Holmes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

* [[Palmyra]]. An "oasis in the Syrian desert" according to [[UNESCO]], this Aramaic city has stood since the second millennium BC and featured some of the most advanced architecture of the priod.

The '''Long Look Estate''' in East End, [[Tortola]], [[British Virgin Islands]], claims to be the oldest [[free black]] community in the Western world.[https://web.archive.org/web/20061019063934/http://www.islandsun.com/2005-July/30072005/local12-v15i17.html]

==History==
In 1776 Samuel Nottingham, a [[Quaker]], [[Manumission|manumitted]] 25 slaves and gave them {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land in Long Look in [[Tortola]], directing them to cultivate it for the common good. [[Quakers in the abolition movement|Quakers were prominent in the abolition movement]]; Nottingham's action pre-dates the foundation of the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] by more than a decade.

A report made in 1823 by a John Dougan states "So quiet and retired had these Persons lived there, that although I have been for many years residing in the Island, yet I derived no knowledge of the Situation and Circumstances regarding these People..."  At the time of Dougan's report, the population of the estate had increased to 43.  He further reported that "Not one of them is in debt, and their Property is free from all [[security interest|Incumbrance]].  That 12 of the grown up Persons are admitted Members of the Westleyan Methodist Society, and with their Children attend regularly the Methodist Chapel at the East End of the Island ... since their Emancipation to the present Day none of them have been sued in Court, or brought before a Magistrate to answer a complaint against them.  One of them once obtained a Warrant against a Person who had assaulted him, who begging his Pardon, He forgave Him."

==Currently==
In 2002 the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands legislature]] passed laws which required residents of the estate to sell their land to other residents of the estate if they were prepared to pay the same price, to preserve the cultural heritage of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061019070039/http://www.islandsun.com/2002-March/15032002/local4-v7i08.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure was not universally popular, as it made it more difficult for land-owning families to sell their property, but it is nonetheless thought to be an important step in securing the historical legacy of the Territory.

The freed slaves (as was common at the time) [[slave name|took the surname of their last owners]], and went by the family name of Nottingham.  Although many other former slave owners' descendants are still well represented within the Territory, by the twenty-first century no Nottinghams appeared on the voter's roll or the telephone directory.

'''Merle Greene Robertson''' (August 30, 1913 &amp;ndash; April 22, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Zender and Skidmore (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] artist, [[art historian]], archaeologist, lecturer and [[Mayanist]] researcher, renowned for her extensive work towards the investigation and preservation of the art, iconography, and writing of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (2000), Zender and Skidmore (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; She is most famous for her rubbings of Maya carved stelae, sculpture, and carved stone, particularly at the Maya sites of [[Tikal]] and [[Palenque]].

==Early life and education==
Robertson was born in 1913 in the small town of [[Miles City, Montana]] to Ada Emma Foote and Darrell Irving McCann, but she moved to [[Great Falls, Montana]] as a small child. Here she became greatly interested in Native American culture and even learned Indian sign language from Blackfoot Indian chiefs her father was close friends with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Never in Fear|last = Robertson|first = Merle Greene|publisher = The Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute|year = 2006|isbn = 9780934051118|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; But more importantly, in Great Falls she met the artist [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles M. Russell]] who spent many afternoons teaching Merle how to paint. She moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] as a teenager and completed high school there and attended the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart (2003, p.1). In interview, Robertson describes Mile City [sic] of the time as "..a little cattle crossing in the road."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adulthood ==
Merle started working as a commercial artist and gold leaf window painter; during the summers she worked at Camp Tapawingo. Following her graduation, Merle married her college boyfriend Wallace McNeill Greene. The couple was married for thirteen years and had two children, David and Barbara. However, the marriage dissolved when Merle found out her husband had participated in multiple affairs throughout the years. After the divorce, Merle and her children moved to California where she began teaching at San Rafael Military Academy. There is where she first met Bob Robertson, the dean, who she would marry later on. She and Mr. Robertson traveled to El Salvador to visit cadets Quinonez, Escalon and Sagrera and learn about salvadorean  archeology. She later decided to go back to school and moved to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.

She earned her Master's of Fine Arts from the [[Universidad de Guanajuato|University of Guanajuato]], where she studied watercolors, oils, photography, and mural painting from one of Mexico's top artists, James Pinto.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After completing her MFA, Merle began working on the Tikal Project with the University of Pennsylvania in 1961.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = In memoriam: Merle Greene Robertson|last = Zender|first = Marc|date = 2011|journal = PARI Journal|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent three summers drawing the architecture of the [[Central Acropolis]]. She also started her famous rubbings at this time, making the art form a way to document and preserve the information on Maya relief sculptures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While she was there, it was suggested that she travel through Guatemala and record stelae at other sites.

While Merle carved out a path for herself as a Mayanist she continued to teach school in the states. She and her husband Bob both worked at the Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California; this is where Merle first began to instill her love of the Maya into young students. She taught a Mesoamerican Archaeology class and she took many of her students on expeditions into the jungles of Central American. Some of her students even went on to study archaeology at college and pursue a career studying the Maya, one of the best examples being Mayanist [[Arlen F. Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.stevensonschool.org/alumni/stories/robertson/index.aspx|title = Remembering Merle Greene Robertson|year = 2011|accessdate =1 November 2015|website = Stevenson School|publisher = |last = Chase|first = Arlen|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150411032850/http://www.stevensonschool.org/alumni/stories/robertson/index.aspx|archivedate = 2015-04-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to Maya Studies==

=== Rubbings ===
[[File:Merle with rice rubbing.png|thumb|311x311px|Merle with her rice rubbing of Stela 1 at Bonampak, Mexico.]]
Initially trained as an artist, Robertson pioneered the technique of taking rubbings from Maya monumental sculptures and inscriptions, making over 4,000 of these over a career spanning four decades (2,000 being monuments).&lt;ref&gt;Some 2,000 of these rubbings are archived at the [[Tulane University]]'s Latin American Library in [[New Orleans]]; see Gidwitz (2002), Olivera (1998). In a 2003 interview Robertson estimated that she has made "probably about four thousand" (Barnhart 2003, p.4).&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases these rubbings have preserved features of the artworks which have since deteriorated or even disappeared, through the actions of the environment or looters. This method was first used by the ancient Chinese but Merle further developed and refined the process. She developed two techniques using two different forms of ink on rice paper. The type of ink that was chosen was based on the environmental conditions and the nature of the item being recorded. Merle, along with Mayanist [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] and Edith Ricketson, paved the way for women to enter the field of Maya archaeology. She was the first woman to join the Tikal Project, at a time where it was generally understood that women were not to work on archaeological projects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A celebration of the life of Merle Greene Robertson|last = Wyllys|first = Andrew|date = 2011|journal = PARI Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palace tablet at Palenque from MesoWeb.gif|thumb|343x343px|Palace Tablet of a ruler or lord at Palenque, rubbing done by Merle Greene Robertson courtesy of MesoWeb]]
Merle is most well known for her work at Palenque. In the 1980s, she undertook a project to document and record in detail all the sculptural art.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This led to the instrumentation of the series of Mayanist conferences known as the [[Palenque Round Table]]s, which have produced some of the most significant breakthroughs in Maya research and the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] decipherment of the ancient [[Maya script]]. The meetings started in December 1973 and ended in June of 1993.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A total of 10 of the proceedings of the round table meetings have been published as volumes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Merle also famously worked at Chichen Itza for many years. Here she also created a large, encompassing report of all the sculptures at the site.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.instituteofmayastudies.org/index.php/features/archaeologists/merle-greene-robertson|title = Merle Greene Robertson|date = November 2015|accessdate = |website = Institute of Maya Studies|publisher = |last = Kurjack|first = Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did she record the hieroglyphic and iconographic inscriptions, she also interpreted the work through the eyes of the authors. This showed her unique perspective as an artist rather than a formally trained archaeologist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1982, Merle founded the Pre-Columbian Art Institute, which publishes the PARI Journal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This non-profit organization supported the research of Mesoamerican art, epigraphy, and iconography and funded archaeological excavations at Palenque under the Cross Group Project.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2004, Robertson received the [[Orden del Pop]] Award from Guatemala's [[Museo Popol Vuh]] in recognition of her decades of work preserving the country's Maya cultural heritage through her detailed documentation of Maya monuments and [[Maya script|hieroglyphic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;Museo Popol Vuh (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; This Instituto de Nacional de Anthropologia e Historia ([[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|INAH]]) also presented Merle with the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forward to Never in Fear|last = Matthews|first = Peter|publisher = Pre-Columbian Art Institute|year = 2006|isbn = |location = San Francisco|pages = 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named her Honorary President of the Palenque Round Tables which have since continued.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
In local tradition [[Kpase]] is supposed to have founded the town.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Law, Ouidah: The Social History of a West African Slaving 'Port', 2004, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; This probably happened towards the end of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Law, Ouidah: The Social History of a West African Slaving 'Port', 2004, p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The town was originally known as ''Glēxwé'', literally 'Farmhouse', and was part of the Kingdom of Whydah.

Ouidah saw its role in international trade rise when the British built a fort here in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Benin-history-timeline.htm national online article on Benin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whydah troops pushed their way into the African interior, capturing millions of people through tribal wars, and selling them to the Europeans and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Ouidah Museum, Benin - ''"Depart pour D'Autres 'Ceux', Convoi De negres: homes, femmes et enfants, conduits enchaines par des metis Arabes"''&lt;/ref&gt; By 1716, when the massive English slave ship ''[[Whydah Gally]]'' arrived to purchase 500 slaves from King Haffon to sell in [[Jamaica]], the Kingdom of Whydah had become the second largest slave port in the [[Triangular trade]].

The Kingdom was ruled by King Haffon, who received his coronation crown as a gift from Portugal, until, in 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah was captured by the forces of King [[Agaja]] of [[Dahomey]]. On 19 March 1727, the ''[[Boston News-Letter]]'' gave this report:

"WHYDAH IN AFRICA: the beginning of this month, Agaja the king of Dahomey came down unexpectedly with an army, and soon became master of this place, and the country adjacent [[Allada]]; the defoliation which ensued was so great, that it is impossible to be represented! The factory at Saber, once the king's town and Seat of Trade, was burnt to the ground, and in it a great quantity of merchandise. Forty Europeans were carried into captivity, to the King of Dahomey's camp at Ardrah, but after having been detained about 14 days, seven of them were released and are now returning hither; they gave a melancholy account of their treatment. This country, which was the pleasantest in all these parts, is now laid waste by fire and sword, and made a wilderness!"

The land which constituted the Kingdom of Whydah became a mere city in the new Kingdom of Dahomey. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[English colonial empire|English]], [[Dutch Slave Coast|Dutch]] and French all constructed [[fort]]s in the city to protect their interests in slaving. The [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese had reached the town]] which they called ''Ajudá'' in 1580 and the Portuguese Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá, now housing The Whydah [Ouidah] Museum, dates from 1721 and remained with Portugal until 31 July 1961.

In the time frame of 1946-1949 French government estimates put the population of Ouidah at about 14,600. By then it had a railway. It was a center for production and trade in palm kernels, palm oil, copra, coffee, manioc, beans, tomatoes and onions. It was also a venter of the fish trade and the manufacture of vegetable oil. It had Catholic, Protestant and Muslim places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia-Lippincott Gazeteer'', p. 1408&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá==
{{split-section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:São João Baptista de Ajudá 1886.jpg|thumb|left|The fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá, late 19th century]]
The '''Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá''' (in English ''Fort of'' ''St John the Baptist of Ouidah'') is a small [[fortress]] built by the Portuguese in Ouidah on the coast of Dahomey (originally ''Ajudá'', from ''Hweda'', on the [[Atlantic]] coast of modern [[Benin]]), reached by the Portuguese in 1580, after which it grew around the [[slave trade]], for which the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] was already renowned. In 1680 the Portuguese governor of [[Colonial São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]] was authorized to erect a fort. In 1721, after having been abandoned for some years, it was reconstructed and named [[São João Baptista de Ajudá]].The Fort, built on land given to [[Portugal]] by King Haffon of Whydah, remained under Portuguese control from 1721 until 1961.

[[File:Fort Ouidah Benin.JPG|thumb|left|The Historical Museum of Ouidah]]
[[File:Bartholomew Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Pirate [[Bartholomew Roberts]] at Ouidah, with his ship and captured merchantmen in the background]]
The fort had an important impact in Benin, greatly contributing to both the Portuguese and [[African slave trade]]. Its importance is attested by the fact that the [[Portuguese language]] was the only foreign language that the Kings of Dahomey authorised. Portuguese descendants were also important in the political structure of the kingdom and some established [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-[[Brazil]]ian families, such as the [[Sousa (surname)|de Sousa / de Souza]] whose descendants still exist in Benin, Togo and Ghana, were powerful and abided by private law. In January 1722 the pirate [[Bartholomew Roberts]] ("Black Bart") sailed into the harbour and captured all the eleven ships at anchor there.

Following the abolition of the legal slave trade in 1807, the fort, which had before been one of the major slave ports, gradually lost its importance and although Portugal continued to claim it as one of its possessions, formal occupation and administration were abandoned on several occasions. It was only when French presence in the region started threatening Portugal's interests that the settlement was again permanently manned. This didn't prevent the French conquest of Dahomey (1891–1894). After this, São João Baptista de Ajudá – now reduced to the territory actually within the walls of the fort – lost what remained of its importance.
[[File:Ouidahfootball.jpg|thumb|right|Football in Ouidah]]
The fort was reoccupied by Portugal in 1865. In this period it served as a base for a brief Portuguese attempt to create a [[protectorate]] in the Kingdom of Dahomey of which the city of Hweda (Ajudá – Ouidah) was part (1885–1887).

Until its [[annexation]] by Dahomey in 1961, São João Baptista de Ajudá was probably the smallest recognized separate modern political unit, initially around {{convert|1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} and later reduced to only 2ha (5&amp;nbsp;acres), at which time, according to the census of 1921, it had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese sovereignty, who tried to burn it rather than surrendering it. When the fort was captured, they were hastily escorted to the [[Nigeria]]n border and expelled from the country&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/08/02/97683885.pdf|title=Dahomey Takes Over Enclave And Expels Portuguese Official; Lisbon Aide Burns Residence – African Nation Raises Flag Over Ajuda.|author=[[United Press International]]|date=2 August 1961|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|page=13|accessdate=2008-12-13 | format=PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:Ouidah.jpg|thumb]]

Only in 1975, after the Portuguese [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo regime]] had been overthrown due to the [[Carnation Revolution]] at [[Lisbon]], did the annexation of the fort by Dahomey (now renamed Benin) gain official Portuguese recognition. This was followed by the fort's restoration, which was paid for by Portugal. The fort is a small square with towers at the four corners. It comprises a church and officers' quarters. The Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá now houses a museum.

[[Bruce Chatwin]]’s book ''[[The Viceroy of Ouidah]]'' (1980) is a fictional retelling of the life of [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], the Sousa family founder in Benin, and of his powerful local descendants, dealing also with the slave trade with [[Brazil]]. The novel inspired [[Werner Herzog]]’s movie ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1177">The '''Sagramental''' (Catalan: literally ''sacramental'') was a type of paramilitary organization native to [[Catalonia]], appearing in the Middle Ages.  They were mutual-protection agreements, made under oath and thus called "sacramental."

Though they were institutionalised during the reign of [[James I of Aragon|Jaume I]], they had already been legislated in writing during the 11th century.  In Catalonia, the text ''[[Princeps namque]]''' established the requirement that every man participate in the national defense in the event of external threat.

The participants were summoned, in times of peril, by bonfires lit on hilltops (similar to the Spanish ''[[Hueste]]s''), or by the sound of the horn, trumpet, or bells.  By the 16th century, other forms of defense began to overtake the Sagramental.

==Historical examples==
* The first Sagramental was raised in 1257 by the peoples of [[Llobregat]]
* In 1314, [[James II of Aragon|Jaume II]] created the Sagramental del Vallès
* In 1395 the Sagramentals of [[Moià]] and [[Maresme]] were added to the lists

The '''Seshat: Global History Databank''' is an international [[scientific research]] project of the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Evolution Institute]]. Founded in 2011, the [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''Seshat: Global History Databank''] gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a [[Digital humanities|digital storehouse]] for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

The Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of [[Cliodynamics]]. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the [[scientific method]] to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turchin |first=Peter |title= Arise cliodynamics |journal=Nature |date=2008 |doi= 10.1038/454034a |pmid=18596791 |volume=454 |issue=7200 |pages=34–35}} http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural evolutionary theory]] or [[Cultural evolutionism|cultural evolutionary theory]] to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.

== Project ==

The Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of [[social complexity]] in early civilizations, the creation of [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]] (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of [[ritual]] and [[religion]] in [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], the causes of [[economic growth]] and its consequences on individual's [[well-being]], and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge [[Semantic Web|digital technologies]] can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.

Several key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does [[prosocial behavior]] evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info|title=Seshat: Global History Databank - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late [[Neolithic]] (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30/|title=World Sample 30 - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Praise ===

[[Ian Morris (historian)]] recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

[[Gary Feinman]] also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Critics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process. The Seshat project uses multiple coders and experts and other techniques for ensuring data quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collard |first=Mark |last2= Whitehouse |first2= Harvey |last3= Francois |first3= Pieter |last4= Slingerland |first4= Edward |last5= Turchin |first5= Peter |title=A Historical Database of Sociocultural Evolution |journal= Cliodynamics |date=2012 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have recently suggested that machine coding techniques hold great promise for further reducing biases and increasing the reliability of the data produced.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Funding ===

Funding for the Seshat: Global History Databank comes from the [[John Templeton Foundation]], the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[Horizon 2020]], the Tricoastal Foundation, and the Evolution Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-about-us/acknowledgements/|title=Acknowledgements - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

=== Administration ===

The Seshat: Global History Databank is governed by an Editorial Board, which includes Prof. [[Peter Turchin]], Prof. [[Harvey Whitehouse]], Dr. Pieter François, Dr. Thomas E. Currie, and Dr. Kevin C. Feeney.

'''Shelia Mulloy''' (née O'Malley) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and historian.

Mulloy was born in GALWAY in 1922 and moved to Paris in 1945 to take up a scholarship to study at the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1949 she married John Mulloy, a businessman of [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], with whom she had eight children.

Mulloy was editor of  ''Cathair na Mart'', the journal of the Westport Historical Society, founded by the late Jarlath Duffy and Peadar Ó Flanagáin in 1981. She was also elected Chief of the O'Malley clan.

[[File:Sirte.jpg|thumb|A square in Sirte (2007)]]
'''Sirte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|t}}; {{lang-ar|سرت}}, {{Audio|Ar-ly-Surt.ogg|pronunciation}}; from {{lang-grc|[[Greater Syrtis|Σύρτις]]}}), also spelled ''Sirt'', ''Surt'', ''Sert'' or  ''Syrte'', is a city in [[Libya]]. It is located south of the [[Gulf of Sirte]], between [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. It is famously known for its [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battles]], [[Demographics of Libya|ethnic groups]], and [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|loyalism]] to [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Also due to its development, it was the capital of [[Libya]] as [[Tripoli]]'s successor after the Fall of Tripoli since September 1, 2011 to October 20, 2011. The settlement was established in the early 20th century by the [[Italian Libya|Italians]], at the site of a 19th-century fortress built by the [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Ottomans]]. It grew into a city after [[World War II]].

As the birthplace of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Sirte was favoured by the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Gaddafi government]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The city was the final major stronghold of Gaddafi loyalists in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] and Gaddafi was [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|killed there]] by rebel forces on 20 October 2011. During the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle]], Sirte was left almost completely in ruins, with many buildings totally destroyed or damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sirte, Libya: Gadhafi's hometown seems largely destroyed |date=16 October 2011 |newspaper=The News Tribune |location=Tacoma, Washington |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/10/16/1866950/sirte-libya-gadhafis-hometown.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224002556/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/10/16/1866950/sirte-libya-gadhafis-hometown.html |archivedate=24 December 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after the civil war, almost 60,000 inhabitants, more than 70 percent of pre-war population, had returned.&lt;ref name=rebuilding2012&gt;Dobbs, L.

==Early history==
Sirte is built near the site of the ancient [[Phoenicia]]n city of '''Macomedes-Euphranta''',&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Bill. ''Doing business with Libya'', p. 197. Kogan Page Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7494-3992-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an important link on the road along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] littoral. It is the last confirmed place where the [[Punic language]] was spoken, in the 5th century CE. The region had no recognized administrative centre and was infested for centuries by bandits. In Classical times, the coast was "proverbially dangerous to shipping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter='''Syrtis'''|page=1897|author=P. G. W. Glare|title=Oxford Latin Dictionary|place=Oxford|publisher=The Clarendon Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-864224-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "inhospita Syrtis" in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, line 41&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' Book 2 lines 939-940 speaks of "a boggy Syrtis, neither sea/Nor good dry land".

==Modern history==
In 1842 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] built a fortress at ''Marsat al Zaafran'' ("[[saffron]] harbour") which became known as ''Qasr al Zaafran'' ("saffron [[Ksar|castle]]"), and later as Qasr Sert. The fortress was built under sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] as part of the restoration of Ottoman control over [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] after the fall of the [[Karamanli dynasty]]. It was around this fortification, which was taken over and repaired by the [[Italo-Turkish War|Italians]] in 1912, that the settlement of Sirte grew up.&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, Richard George. ''Libyan studies: select papers of the late R. G. Goodchild'', p. 136. P. Elek, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-236-17680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirte served as an administrative centre under Italian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Ham, Anthony. ''Libya'', p. 121. Lonely Planet, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-74059-493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[North African Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]] there were no noteworthy events in this location, which was characterised at the time as "a shabby little Arab village of mud huts, clustered on the banks of a foul-smelling stream."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A.J. ''Afrika Korps'', p. 16. Bison Books, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The village grew into a prominent town after the [[Second World War]] for two reasons – the discovery and exploitation of oil nearby and the birth of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1942 in a tent at [[Qasr Abu Hadi]], some {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of Sirte. He was sent to the primary school at Sirte at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Simons|Simons, Geoffrey Leslie]]. ''Libya: the struggle for survival'', p. 170. Palgrave Macmillan, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-312-08997-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gaddafi era ===
After [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|seizing power in 1969]], Gaddafi transformed Sirte into a showcase of his self-proclaimed revolution, carrying out an extensive programme of public works to expand the former village into a small city. After 1988, most government departments and the Libyan parliament were relocated from Tripoli to Sirte, although Tripoli remained formally the capital of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Libya". ''Europa World Year 2004'' Volume II, p. 2651. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-85743-255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Al-Tahadi University]] was established in 1991.

In 1999, Gaddafi proposed the idea of creating a "[[United States of Africa]]" with Sirte as its administrative centre. Ambitious plans to build a new international airport and seaport were announced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''The Report: Libya 2008'', p. 73. Oxford Business Group, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-902339-11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Sirte Declaration]] was signed in the city by the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in a conference that was hosted by Gaddafi. In 2007 he also hosted talks in Sirte to broker a peace agreement between the government of [[Sudan]] and warring factions in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Struggle to salvage Darfur talks|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[China Railway Construction Corporation]] won a $2.6 billion bid in Libya to build a west-to-east coastal railway {{convert|352|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Khoms, Libya|Khoms]] to Sirte and a south-to-west railway {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} long for iron ore transport from the southern city [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] to [[Misrata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crcc.cn China Railway Construction Corporation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 Libyan Civil War ===
{{further|2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan rebel advance on Sirte|Battle of Sirte (2011)}}
On 5 March 2011, [[anti-Gaddafi forces]] said they were preparing to capture the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasevic|first=Goran|title=In disorganized surge, Libya's rebels push west along shifting front line|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0305/In-disorganized-surge-Libya-s-rebels-push-west-along-shifting-front-line|accessdate=6 March 2011|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 6 March, the rebel advance was stopped during the [[Battle of Bin Jawad]] before reaching Sirte. Government forces launched a counter-offensive that [[Battle of Ra's Lanuf#Second phase|recaptured Ra's Lanuf]]&lt;ref name="aj11-05-10-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rebel forces retreat from Ras Lanuf |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/201131041228856242.html |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aj11-05-10-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rebel push stalls outside Ras Lanuf  |date=10 March 2011 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/spotlight/libya/2011/03/2011310131427537949.html |accessdate=10 March 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to advance as far as the outskirts of the de facto rebel capital of [[Benghazi]]. Under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], several Western and Arab countries then intervened with air and missile strikes, which turned the tide again in favour of the rebels. On 28 March, Al Jazeera reported that Sirte had been claimed to be taken by rebel forces overnight with little resistance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpCJkCA_VI&lt;/ref&gt; but other news organisations later reported that rebels and Gaddafi forces were fighting on the road between [[Bin Jawad]] and Sirte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya: Rebels battle for road to Gaddafi hometown Sirte|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12885395|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 March 2011|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 30 March, Gaddafi loyalists had forced the rebels out of Bin Jawad and Ra's Lanuf and once again removed the immediate threat of an attack on Sirte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12906562 | work=BBC News | title=Libya: Gaddafi's fighters force rebel retreat | date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, the city faced a more severe threat from the rebels as the loyalist position deteriorated rapidly, with rebels making gains on multiple fronts. As [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Tripoli came under attack]], other rebel forces based in [[Benghazi]] broke the military stalemate in the eastern desert, taking [[Fourth Battle of Brega|Brega]] and [[Ra's Lanuf]]. At the same time, rebels in [[Misrata]] pushed eastward along the coast towards Sirte, which then faced a pincer movement from the rebels on two fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Libyan rebels storm Gaddafi compound in Tripoli | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/appearance-by-gaddafis-son-tempers-rebel-hopes-of-victory/2011/08/23/gIQAZMWZYJ_print.html | last1=Erdbrink | first1=Thomas |last2=Sly | first2=Liz | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2011-08-23 | accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 24 August, rebel units were reported as being {{convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/24/libya-rebels-advance-gaddafi-home-town|title=Libyan rebels advance on Gaddafi's home town|last=Stephen|first=Christopher|date=2011-08-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 August, Bin Jawad &amp;ndash; about 150&amp;nbsp;km east &amp;ndash; was once again recaptured by the rebels. It was also reported that the [[National Transitional Council]] were in negotiations with tribal figures from the city for it to surrender to rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7JN27R20110823|title=Libya rebels in "fierce" fight for Sabha--spokesman|date=2011-08-23|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio address on 1 September 2011, [[Gaddafi]] declared Sirte the new capital of the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], replacing the former capital [[Tripoli]], which had been captured by rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From voice said to be Gadhafi, a defiant message to his foes|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/01/libya.war/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=CNN|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Gaddafi forces [[Second Gulf of Sidra offensive|surrounded the city]] during September 2011 and began a long, difficult [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle]] there, hoping to bring the war to an end. On 20 October, after suffering massive casualties during a siege that lasted over a month, NTC fighters mounted a major offensive and took control of the last remaining district of Sirte, "Number Two", that was in the hands of regime loyalists. [[Muammar Gaddafi]] attempted to flee the city, but he was injured and captured by fighters. He [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|was killed]] in custody less than an hour later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|title=Muammar Gaddafi killed as Sirte falls|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postwar ===
In April 2012, almost six months after the civil war, more than 70 percent of the inhabitants had returned to Sirte.

== Films ==
{{main|List of films featuring eclipses}}
There is a body of films featuring [[solar eclipse]]s. Compared to other astronomical events featured in films, such as [[full moon]]s and [[asteroid]] strikes, solar eclipses are less commonly seen. When they have featured in films, they often drive the plot and have a portentous presence.&lt;ref name="hickman"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hickman | first=Matt | url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/movies-solar-eclipses-starring-role | title=9 movies starring solar eclipses | work=MNN | publisher=[[Mother Nature Network]] | date=August 8, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]]'s Glen Weldon said that films use eclipses "to signal to audiences that the normal rules have temporarily lifted, and things are about to get weird." The first film to feature a solar eclipse was the 1907 silent film ''[[The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon]]'', which featured a solar eclipse as a fantastical consummation between the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="weldon"&gt;{{cite news | last=Weldon | first=Glen | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/08/17/543962064/in-movies-a-solar-eclipse-means-change-is-coming | title=In Movies, A Solar Eclipse Means Change Is Coming | work=npr.org | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=August 17, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclipses have been seen as bad omens throughout history and filmmakers leverage that belief "as visual cues or key plot points", according to ''[[The Oregonian]]''{{'}}s Amy Wang.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wang | first=Amy | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/eclipse/2017/08/15_movies_where_eclipses_play.html | title=15 movies that include eclipses (not always accurately) | work=[[The Oregonian]] | date=August 6, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most accurate depiction of a solar eclipse in film is seen in the 1961 religious epic film ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'', which included film of an actual solar eclipse during a crucifixion scene.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite news | last=White | first=Amy | url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/18/16158544/solar-eclipses-science-fiction | title=Solar eclipses have been a science fiction theme for thousands of years | work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=August 18, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984 eclipse and ''Witness'' ===
While director [[Peter Weir]] was filming ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) in the [[Amish]] region of Pennsylvania, a solar eclipse occurred on [[Solar eclipse of May 30, 1984|May 30, 1984]]. Weir filmed several of his actors in costume, responding to the eclipse, with the vague intention of revising the film's plot to include a solar eclipse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The eclipse footage was not included in the final edit.

== Television ==

* In one of his cartoons, [[Bugs Bunny]] accidentally travels through time to the [[Middle Ages]].  While there, he tricks everyone into believing that he has put out the sun with a spell.

* In an episode of ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', the titular character accidentally travels to the Middle Ages and is about to be executed as a [[warlock]] when he remembers that his execution is timed exactly with an eclipse. He threatens everyone that he will black out the sun unless released and begins to speak [[gibberish]], pretending to put a spell on the sun. However, he has misread the date of the solar eclipse by one day, and stands on the gallows for 24 hours, continuing the gibberish until the eclipse happens.
* In the 1993 first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', evil witch [[Rita Repulsa]] causes a solar eclipse to drain the [[Megazord]]'s power in the five-part episode, "[[Green With Evil]]".

* In the 2007 ''[[Avatar: the Last Airbender]]'' episode, "[[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse]]", [[Aang]] and his allies plan for the day of the invasion of the [[Fire Nation]] capital on the day a solar eclipse would occur, leaving the firebenders without firebending for about 8 minutes. The plan was expected to end the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Plot synopsis|war]]. The plan fails because [[Azula]], the princess of the Fire Nation, learns of the upcoming invasion beforehand.
* The 2007 Sci-Fi channel [[miniseries]] ''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'' is centered on a "double eclipse" which will give power to one of the two princesses of the O.Z.

* The final two episodes of ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', "The Great Eclipse" and "Time of Eternity", take place during a solar eclipse, which in the series universe happens only once every 216 years and marks the birth of a new member of the Godhand. During these episodes, Griffith, once the leader of the Band of the Hawk, betrays and sacrifices his men in order to become the fifth member of the Godhand, Femto.
* The  ''[[Mad Men]]'' episode "[[List of Mad Men episodes|Seven Twenty Three]]" features the [[Solar eclipse of July 20, 1963|solar eclipse that occurred in July 1963]].

Robert Frobisher-Smythe, who is central to the series' backstory, has been cursed by Anubis in this manner.  As an eclipse approaches, an attempt is made to re-awaken Robert.  One of the people who performs the ceremony, Caroline Denby, is impure of heart and causes Robert to be re-awoken evil.
* Episode 61 "[[List of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood episodes|He Who Would Swallow God]]" in the anime series ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]]'' empowered stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra.
* In the sixth season of ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', from episode 2, "[[Yellow Ledbetter (The Vampire Diaries)|Yellow Ledbetter]]", to episode 15, "[[Let Her Go (The Vampire Diaries)|Let Her Go]]", an eclipse is present in the missing dimension in 1994 where Damon and Bonnie (later just Bonnie) are trapped.

The '''Sousse Archaeological Museum''' ([[Tunisian Arabic]]: المتحف الأثري بسوسة) is an [[archaeological museum]] located in [[Sousse]], [[Sousse Governorate]], [[Tunisia]].

==The Museum==
The [[museum]] is housed in the [[Kasbah]] of Sousse's [[Medina of Sousse, Tunisia|Medina]], which was founded in the 11th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patrimoinedetunisie.com.tn/eng/musees/sousse.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1951. The museum reopened its doors to the public in 2012, after the collections were rearranged and the edifice was renovated. It contains the second largest collection of [[mosaics]] in the world after that of the [[Bardo National Museum]] in the capital [[Tunis]].

== The Collections==

Some votive stelae and urns displayed in the [[punic]] room date from as early as the 7th century BC.

==Biography==
Pollo was born in [[Përmet]], in a family originating in [[Frashër|Frashër region]]. He was also a novelist and member of the Albanian organization "[[Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America|Vatra]]" which fought for the independence of Albania. Pollo graduated from elementary with high grades due to getting the education from his parents as well, and he developed an interest in science. He was distinguished for natural wisdom and willingness to learn from school in Përmet, and continued with high grades in the [[Albanian National Lyceum|French Lyceum in Korçë]]. Here he studied history, literature and the [[Albanian language]], as well as scientific formulation, interpretation and evaluative skills.

When the [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion by Fascist Italy]] began on April 7, 1939, he was forced to interrupt his studies. This motivated him to emerge in the first anti-fascist protests in [[Korça]] and later in the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Antifascist Movement]]. Through the battles of war against the fascists, he directed the newspaper "Kushtrimi i Lirisë" (War cry of Freedom) and "Zëri i Rinisë" (The voice of the young). He also studied history in the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], he became the editor in chief of the [[Bashkimi (Democratic Front newspaper)|Bashkimi (The Union)]]. After the [[Liberation Day (Albania)|liberation]], he withdrew from politics and continued with his scientific endeavours and studied history in [[Lomonosov University]] in the years of 1945, graduating with high results. He began teaching at the Institute of Tirana in 1950-1951. 

In the years of 1951-1957, he continued his post as vice-president of the Institute of Sciences. With the establishment of the [[University of Tirana]] in 1957, he was appointed the first Dean of the faculty of history and philosophy. From 1972 to 1989 he was director of the [[Academy of Albanological Studies#Institute of History|Institute of History]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]]. He was also the coauthor of the standard ''History e Popullit Shqiptar'' (History of the Albanian people, Tirana, 1966-1967) and ''Historia e Shqiperisë'' (History of Albania, Tirana, 1983-1984). He was responsible for the French-language ''Histoire de l'Albanie des origines a nom jours'' (Roanne, 1974), translated as "History of Albania from its Origins to Present day" (London, 1981). 

During the Albanian Academy of Sciences, professor Pollo has entitled a seat in the committee. He was also a member of the principals of the academy of science and also of the Balkan Committee of AIESE. He received the "Republic Award" and was decorated with medals due to his contributions to Albanian culture. 

Stefanaq Pollo died in may 15, 1997.

'''Tibor Szamuely''' (May 14, 1925 – 10 December 1972) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[historian]] and [[polemic]]ist.

Born in [[Moscow]] to a [[Hungarian Jewish]] family, he received his education in [[England]], first at [[Bertrand Russell]]'s Beacon Hill School in [[Hampshire]], and later at the progressive [[Summerhill School]] in [[Suffolk]]. Returning to Moscow in the 1930s with his family, he was later evacuated to [[Tomsk]] during the [[Second World War]]. He served with the [[Red Army]] in their [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|occupation of Hungary]], but would later return to the [[Soviet Union]] to study history at the [[University of Moscow]].

In 1950 he was arrested on espionage charges and spent eighteen months at a lumber camp before being released at the request of [[Mátyás Rákosi]]. After his release, he took up academic work in Hungary, becoming vice-rector of the [[University of Budapest]] in 1957. After failing to participate in an attack on [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]], he was, however, dismissed from this post. He left Hungary in 1963 to teach at the Kwame Nkrumah Institute of Economic and Political Sciences (later the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]]) in [[Winneba]], [[Ghana]]. In 1964, he settled in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] with his family.

During his time in England, he taught at the [[University of Reading]] and contributed frequently to ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''. He was a close friend of [[Robert Conquest]] and [[Kingsley Amis]] and was a regular attendee of the lunches at [[Bertorelli]] restaurant.

He spent the latter part of his life living in [[Bayswater]]. In 1972, Szamuely died of [[cancer]] aged 47 in a hospital in London. He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=96|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His major study of Soviet history, ''The Russian Tradition'', was edited by Robert Conquest and published posthumously by [[Secker &amp; Warburg]] in 1974.

He was the nephew of [[Tibor Szamuely]], a politician during the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of 1919. He was the father of [[George Szamuely]], a journalist who contributes to [[Russia Today]], and of [[Helen Szamuely]], a prominent figure in the founding of the [[UK Independence Party]].

'''Victor Guérin''' (15 September 1821 – 21 September 1891) was a French intellectual, explorer and amateur archaeologist. He published books describing the [[geography]], [[archeology]] and [[history]] of the areas he explored, which included [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]], [[North Africa]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

==Biography==
From 1840, Guerin was a professor of [[rhetoric]] and member of faculty in various colleges and high schools in France and in [[Algeria]].
In 1852, he became a member of the [[French School of Athens]]. With the financial help of [[Honoré Théodoric d'Albert de Luynes]] he was able to explore Greece and its islands, Asia Minor, [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], [[Tunisia]] and the [[Levant]].

He spent some time as a professor of foreign literature in [[Lyon]] and [[Grenoble]], and in 1878 he joined the faculty of the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]].

He died on 21 September 1891 in Paris.

==Expeditions==
Guérin visited the [[Holy Land]] eight times in 1852, 1854, 1863, 1870, 1875, 1882, 1884, and 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lotp-Coz5_YC&amp;pg=PA31 |title=The Hebrew Bible reborn: from Holy Scripture to the Book of Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2011-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a [[French Academy of Sciences]] prize for his 7-volume ''Geographical, Historical, and Archaeological Description of Palestine''. Much of Guérin's seminal work is spent in describing the ruins (khirbas) in those places he visited.

==Works==
In his books Guerin writes about the identification and history of archaeological sites, often referring to passages from the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Greek mythology]], and contemporary explorers and scholars such as [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Robinson]] and [[Titus Tobler]]. He also quotes from other Jewish sources such as the [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]], as well as Jewish travelers such as [[Benjamin of Tudela]] and [[Isaac Chelo]].

His published works include:

'''Vryheid''' is a [[coal]] mining and [[cattle]] ranching town in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]]. Vryheid is the [[Afrikaans]] word for "freedom".

==History==
[[File:Kerkstr by Presidentstr, Vryheid.jpg|thumb|upright|View of Church Street in Vryheid's Commercial District.]]
After [[Boer]] farmers, who lived in the Vryheid area, had helped King [[Dinuzulu]] defeat his rival chief [[Zibhebhu]] for succession of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] throne, land that they occupied was given to them by cession from the Zulu king along the banks of the [[Mfolozi River]]. On August 5, 1884 the Boers formed the ''[[Nieuwe Republiek]]'' (New Republic) with Vryheid as its capital and its sovereignty was recognized by Germany and Portugal. It was later incorporated into the [[South African Republic]], but at the end of the [[Second Boer War]] the town and its surrounding area was absorbed into the Natal colony by the British. Vryheid is located along the [[Transnet]] Coaline.

== Education ==
In 2007 [[Inkamana High School]] and [[Vryheid Comprehensive Secondary School]] were amongst several schools recognised as "historic schools". Funding of six million rand a year was earmarked for these two and [[Adams College]], [[Ohlange High School]] and Inanda Seminary to make them academies focussing on Maths, Science and Technology.&lt;ref name=witness&gt;{{cite news|last=Ngcobo|first=Gabisile|title=Plea to maintain ‘historic’ schools in SA|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=89076|newspaper=The Witness|date=10 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools are [[Hoërskool Vryheid]], which uses both [[Afrikaans]] and [[English language|English]] as the medium of instruction and Hoërskool Pionier which uses Afrikaans as medium of instruction.

== Sport ==
Kilian Academy, a martial arts academy instructing in the arts of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Kickboxing, is situated in Vryheid.

Vryheid Wrestling Academy, is one of the top wrestling clubs in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal.

===Hanami Gi-Challenge===

The Hanami Gi-Challenge (commonly known as The Challenge) is a  [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] ([[BJJ]]) tournament in Africa. The Hanami Gi-Challenges are hosted annually by the Hanami Martial Arts, with the first Challenge hosted in 2014 at the Indoor Speedball Club Vryheid in South Africa. In 2015, it will be held once again in Vryheid, South Africa.

== Religion ==
The [[Inkamana Abbey]], a Roman Catholic Benedictine abbey is located in the town.

== Heritage Sites ==
The Dutch Reform Church in Vryheid, better known as ''Die Moeder Gemeente'' (Afrikaans for the Mother Congregation), has been added to the list of '''12 Gorgeous Churches and Cathedrals''' in Africa, by AFK Insider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://afkinsider.com/80271/12-gorgeous-churches-africa/13/| last =| first =| publisher =AFK Insider| date = December 5, 2014| access-date = 2015-01-24 | title=12 Gorgeous Churches And Cathedrals In Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Abelshauser''' (born 24 November 1944 in [[Wiesloch]] near [[Heidelberg]]) is a German [[Economic history|economic historian]].

== Life ==
Abelshauser studied economics at the [[University of Mannheim]] and graduated in 1970. He received his PhD at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in 1973 with his dissertation on [[West Germany|West German]] economy 1945–1948. In 1980 he was appointed as Professor for economic and social history in [[Bochum]]. From 1983 to 1988 he was acting director of the institute for the research on the European workers movement (IGA, now institute for social movements, ISB). He was visiting professor at [[Bielefeld]], [[Göttingen]], [[Cologne]], (Germany), [[Oxford]] ([[UK|United Kingdom]]), [[Florence]] ([[Italy]]), [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] ([[United States]]) and [[Sydney]] ([[Australia]]). From 1988 to 1991 he held the chair in European History of the 20th century at the [[European University Institute]] (EUI) in [[Florence]]. Since 1991 he is heading the chair in [[Economic history]] at [[Bielefeld University]]. He is member of the Institute for Research on Science and Technology and founding member of the Bielefeld Institute for Global Society Studies. He is among the editors of the journal “Geschichte und Gesellschaft” (History and Society), the leading journal of history as social science, and the Journal of Comparative Government and European Policy (ZSE).

== Focus of Research ==
Abelshauser’s dissertation (published 1975) was the first theory-based thesis on the causes of the German “[[Wirtschaftswunder]]” (the so-called economic miracle of the early federal republic) that included the relevant sources for that topic. Its findings put into perspective the impact of the [[Marshall Plan]], the monetary reform of 1948 and [[Ludwig Erhard|Ludwig Erhard’s]] model of [[social market economy]] as the crucial forces behind the comeback of the West German economy in the 1950s. Instead the study points out the importance of the specific circumstances of reconstruction of the West German economy, which could not be reproduced after the ‘long’ 1950s.
Most of Abelshauser’s arguments were first fiercely criticized by historians as well as in prominent public newspapers like the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]. Today his thesis is broadly accepted in the field. The news weekly “[[Die Zeit]]” concluded in 1996 that Abelshauser rewrote the economic history of the Federal Republic. His book “Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte seit 1945” (German economic history since 1945, newly published 2004) is among the benchmarks of German economic history.

Abelshauser’s second field of research is [[business history]]. His work on the history of the chemical company [[BASF]] (2004, German original edition 2002, 2003, 2007) and on the history of the steel giant [[Krupp]] during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] (2002) is core literature for the “new business history” ([[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]]) and was crucial for the emergence of this new discipline. Here, Abelshauser focuses on specific and historically established cultures of the companies and their economic importance for current business decisions.

A third field is the reaction of the German social system of production to the second economic revolution (see [[Douglass North|Douglass C. North]]). According to Abelshauser, [[Globalization]] and scientification at the end of the 19th century created “new industries” that focused on immaterial production. During that time a set of economic institutions were established which still shape the German economy. His Volume “The Dynamics of German Industry” (2005, German original edition 2002, Jap. edition 2009) interprets historic and recent pressures on these institutions as part of a struggle between two different systems of [[capitalism]]s (American vs. “Rhenish” i.e. European Capitalism). His thesis, which - up to the financial crisis of 2008 - was standing against the scientific and public mainstream, gives him the reputation of a prominent supporter of the German/European model of capitalism in the era of [[Globalization]].

Recently, Abelshausers focus turned towards scientific biography. As shown in his work on Hans Matthoefer (2009), he aims to find out, under which conditions people change their way of thinking and acting and, by doing so, help to create new economic, political or social institutions. With his biographical approach Abelshauser added a new method to the corpus of the school of New Institutional Economics.

Fulbecke's "Direction..." (1600), discussed study methods for law students, techniques for arguing a case, and suggestions for further reading. It is also full of advice, such as admonishing law students not to study at night, because:

:    "''for when the stomach is full and stuffed with meat, the abundance of humours is carried to the head, where it sticketh for a time and layeth as it were a lump of lead upon the brain.''"

This book has been very popular and has been reprinted over and over and is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;''Direction or Preparative to the Study of the Law; Wherein is Shewed, What Things Ought to be Observed and Used of Them That Are Addicted to the Study of the Law, And What, on the Contrary Part, Ought to be Eschewed and Avoided.'', William Fullbecke, Second Edition, Revised, by T.H. Stirling. London: Printed for J. and W.T. Clark, 1829. [xii], 252 pp. Folding table. Reprinted 2004 by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. {{ISBN|1-58477-371-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It demonstrates that Fulbecke was more comfortable with written [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the ambiguities that characterized [[common law]] at the time. Fulbeck   displays his knowledge of medieval lawyers such as [[Bartolus of Sassoferrato]], and 16th-century French legal scholars [[Guillaume Budé]] and [[François Hotman]].

Fulbecke's "Pandectes"  (1602) was one of the first books on international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lawschool.cornell.edu/Using_the_Library/leghist/nurnberg.html ''The Legacy of Nuremberg: Sustaining Human Rights''] , Daniel Smith, ''Cornell Law Forum'', vol. 25, no. 3, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulbecke collaborated with lawyer [[Thomas Hughes (dramatist)|Thomas Hughes]] on the play ''The Misfortunes of Arthur'' for [[Queen Elizabeth I]] at [[Gray's Inn]] on 28 February 1588. The Misfortunes of Arthur was an imitation of a [[Seneca the Younger|Senecan]] tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/511699 ''Elizabethan Themes in The Misfortunes of Arthur''], William A. Armstrong, The Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 7, No. 27 (Jul., 1956), pp. 238-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulbecke also wrote books on [[Roman history]], including his popular 1601 version. Fulbecke describes it as:
:''The use of this historie is threefold: first the revealing of the mischeifes of discord and civill discention… Secondly the opening of the cause hereof, which is nothing else but ambition, for out of this seed groweth a whole harvest of evils. Thirdly the declaring of the remedie, which is by humble estimation of our selves, by living well, not lurking well: by conversing in the light of the common weale with equals, not by complotting in darke conventicles against superiors.''
