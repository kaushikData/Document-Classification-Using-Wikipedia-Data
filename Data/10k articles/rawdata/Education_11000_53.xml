'''''Academy Earth''''' is an American quarterly magazine for young readers. It is an omnibus of both mainstream school subjects and uncommon subjects. It is designed to expose adolescents to as many forms of intellect, providing them a solid base of knowledge for further learning, and to present it in such a way that a child is not offended by its overly-scholarly nature.

==Renaissance Method==
Taking directly from [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s model of cognitive development, which brings to light the underestimated logical ability of a child, and the [[Montessori method]], which understands that children are simply not "small adults" but humans that have their own way of learning and understanding, the Renaissance Method presents introductions to all subjects, but allows the adolescent to choose his favorite, or the one he is most comfortable in. Through this liberty, a child may pick up on the fundamental subjects subconsciously, without having to be drilled.

For example, instead of teaching an adolescent directly about multiplicative inverses of numbers, one could instead show her the merits of the [[golden ratio|golden mean]] and how it is often seen in nature and architecture. After a certain interest be developed, one would explain the mathematical elements behind the golden mean. Or instead of teaching a child the basic elements of a story as the beginning, middle, and end (which can often be ambiguous and confusing, and differ from story to story), one might begin with the simple three-act story structure and, in time, proceed to the four-act story structure.

==Cultural Persuasion==
Borrowing from ''[[Highlights for Children]]'' and other children's magazines, ''Academy Earth'' attempts to instill ethics into young readers, not by direct means, but by featuring stories that exhibit moral values. ''Academy Earth'' also tries to instill an interest in [[culture]], featuring historical articles, and tolerance of the world's peoples. The vast curriculum encourages a child to take an interest in many subjects.

==History==
ANU is a private Christian University and an institution of the [[Church of the Nazarene|Church of the Nazarene International]], whose mission and vision follows the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Holiness Tradition]]. It was established to prepare leaders for the Church both at ministerial and laity level. The Church of the Nazarene sought to address the challenges witnessed in African society in the early 1980s through an institution of higher education. In accordance with the Kenya University’s Act of 1985, (provision for establishment of private universities in Kenya), the Church settled on Kenya as a location to start a Nazarene University which became the first one outside North America.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

In July 1993, the Board of the Church granted its authority for the establishment of a university in Africa following a unanimous vote by its members during a General Assembly in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. The Church, through the university’s founders, continued to pursue negotiations with the Commission of University Education, then Commission of Higher Education (CHE) to establish a degree awarding institution. Therefore, the legal authority to establish the university was given on November 23, 1993, when CHE issued, on behalf of the Kenyan Government, a Letter of Interim Authority for the university to start laying the foundation for the development of ANU.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

In August 1994 Dr. Martha John, ANU’s first Vice Chancellor, opened the university’s doors to 62 students from eleven African countries taking undergraduate courses in Theology and Business Administration and a Masters of Arts in Religion. One year later, the university introduced the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, welcoming an additional 42 students.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

Professor Leah Marangu took over from Dr. John in January 1996 and was installed as Vice Chancellor in February 1997. On 8 October 2002, the university was granted the Charter (Accreditation Credentials) by the [[government of Kenya]], making ANU the first private university to receive the credential under the new act and without being affiliated with any other university locally and abroad.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Academics==
The university is composed of the following schools:&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anu.ac.ke/#nogo | title=Africa Nazarene University: Schools |date=8 January 2018 |accessdate=8 January 2018 | publisher=Africa Nazarene University (ANU) |author=ANU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* School of Religion and Christian Ministry
* School of Science and Technology
* School of Humanities and Social Sciences
* School of Law
* School of Business

Starting off with three programs, the university now has 36 programs, offered at nine campuses, as of January 2018.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9325">The '''Association Montessori International/USA''' (AMI/USA) is a national [[non-profit organization]] that strives to propagate and further the teachings and work of Dr. [[Maria Montessori]] in the [[United States]]. As the United States office for the [[Association Montessori Internationale]], the Association Montessori International/USA oversees recognition of eligible [[Montessori in the United States|Montessori schools]], assists in recruitment and organization of Montessori teacher training, and organizes professional development opportunities in the United States. The organization also maintains a member database of about 45,000 [[teachers]], [[school administrators]], parents, and interested individuals.

== History ==

The Association Montessori Internationale is the oldest Montessori organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Danna (2009) ''Understanding Montessori: A Guide for Parents''. Random House. p. 255. {{ISBN|9781598589740}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Montessori]] established AMI in 1929, with the headquarters in [[Amsterdam]], [[the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lillard|first=Angeline|title=Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-516868-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international head office of AMI is still located in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Lillard, Paula Polk (1972). ''Montessori A Modern Approach''. Schocken Books Inc. p. 15. {{ISBN|9780805203943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded to maintain the integrity of her life's work and to ensure that it would be perpetuated after her death: "The AMI was to function not only as organizer of courses and overseer of teacher training, not only as a way of keeping the various worldwide Montessori schools and societies in touch with each other and disseminating information about the movement's ideas and activities, but also as a firm, controlling rights to the publication of [[Maria Montessori|Montessori's books]] and the manufacture and sale of the materials as well as recipient of training-course fees."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Rita (1988) ''Maria Montessori: A Biography''. Perseus Books. p. 311. {{ISBN|9781635761092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Montessori, Maria’s son and personal assistant, was given the task of safeguarding the Montessori movement after Maria Montessori's death. "At [Montessori's] death she appointed Mr. Montessori as her successor in the task of directing and coordinating the work of the Association Montessori Internationale... A responsibility laid upon Mr. Montessori's shoulders was the delicate task of safeguarding the integrity of the Montessori movement, in the many countries where it is active, by recognizing under the aegis of the Association Montessori Internationale only such "Montessori" schools and training courses as faithfully interpret, both in spirit and practice, the Montessori principles."&lt;ref&gt;Standing, E.M. (1998) ''Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work''. Plume. p. 72. {{ISBN|9780452279896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Montessori sent Margaret Elizabeth Stephenson to the United States in 1961. A trainee of Maria Montessori herself Stephenson first operated as Mario Montesori's personal representative in the United States. As the movement grew, Montessori granted her request to set up a branch office of AMI in the United States. AMI/USA was founded in 1972 and directed for its first ten years by Karin Salzmann. In 1988, Virginia McHugh succeeded Jon Osterkorn as Executive Director of AMI/USA.

Today there are thousands of [[:Category:Montessori schools in the United States|Montessori schools]] across the United States. However there is no central acredidation nor specific set of standards they must hold to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lillard|first=Angeline|title=Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-516868-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past twenty years the amount of scientific research confirming the [[Montessori education|Montessori method]] has increased: "Maria Montessori, through observation of children, developed materials that engage both the hands and the mind of the child. Science and research, especially in the past twenty years, have come to prove that Montessori's observations accurately describe the learning needs of children and have shown as well that the principles Dr. Montessori envisioned do create joyful learners."&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Danna (2009) ''Understanding Montessori: A Guide for Parents''. Random House. p. 85. {{ISBN|9781598589740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of the Association Montessori International of the United States (AMI/USA), as stated on the organization's website, is to bring the principles of Dr. Maria Montessori to the education of children, to help them attain their full potential in our society. AMI/USA collaborates with affiliates such as the [[Elementary Alumni Association]] (EAA) and the [[North American Montessori Teachers' Association]] (NAMTA).

== Programs ==

'''School Recognition Program'''&lt;br /&gt;
A certificate of recognition is granted to a subset of Montessori schools who prove that they meet a set of specific Montessori [http://www.amiusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=74 standards] as derived from Maria Montessori’s original research and methodology. Schools must apply annually for one of the following levels: recognition, affiliation, and association.

'''Professional Development'''&lt;br /&gt;
AMI/USA facilitates two [http://www.amiusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=73 conferences] each year. The annual refresher course and workshops cater to all AMI trained professionals, as well as classroom assistants, administrators, and, beginning in 2009, parents. Additionally, each fall AMI/USA sponsors a public school forum for school districts with AMI Montessori programs.

'''Membership'''&lt;br /&gt;
AMI/USA facilitates membership benefits to AMI members living in the United States. [http://www.amiusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=71 Membership to AMI through AMI/USA] is offered on an individual basis; schools and institutions are not eligible for AMI membership. Membership benefits include a yearly subscription to AMI and AMI/USA publications, including the quarterly AMI/USA newsletter ''AMI/USA News'' and the bi-annual AMI scholarly journal ''Communications''. Members also receive a preferred rate on AMI/USA publications, and receive a discount from AMI approved Montessori materials distributors.

'''Teacher Training Program'''&lt;br /&gt;
AMI/USA works in partnership with [http://www.amiusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=72 AMI Montessori training centers] to help ensure the caliber of AMI teacher training is maintained in the United States. "The standards of Montessori practice were originally delineated by the Association Montessori International (AMI) in 1929. They represent an integrated body of materials, methodology, psychology, and philosophy that provides Montessori teachers with a common reference point."&lt;ref&gt;Loeffler, Margaret Howard (1992). ''Montessori in Contemporary American Culture''. Heinemann Educational Books. p. 195. {{ISBN|9780435087098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''We Are Montessori'''&lt;br /&gt;
AMI/USA also coordinates the "[[We Are Montessori]]" project, which has the objective of "celebrating Montessori alumni and bringing awareness to the benefits of Montessori education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Are Montessori|url=https://amiusa.org/alumni/|website=AMI/USA|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative collects information to showcase alumni they consider as successful, and the schools that fostered their education. To date, AMI/USA it is the only organization systematically collecting information on Montessori alumni in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">The '''[[Brigham Young University]] Museum of Paleontology''' was started in 1976 around the collection of [[James A. Jensen]].  For many years, it was known as the ''BYU Earth Science Museum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/156955/Y-RESEARCHERS-START-TO-PIECE-PUZZLE-OF-DINOSAUR-BONES.html |title= Y.

In October 2009, the museum held a grand opening of its new facilities during BYU homecoming week. With the {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition, it now displays most of the collection. The change of name clarifies that the museum actually houses a large collection of [[dinosaur]] bones and other [[fossils]].&lt;ref name="Deseret News 2009-10-22"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705338766/Y-science-museum-expanded-renamed.html |title= Y. science museum expanded, renamed |newspaper= Deseret News |date= October 22, 2009 |first= Sara |last= Israelsen-Hartley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is currently directed by [[Rodney Scheetz]], who was one of Jensen's students at BYU.  Its main purpose is to facilitate research, but it is open to the public.

'''''Carnival Cruise Lines Tycoon 2005: Island Hopping''''' is a 2004 cruise-line [[business simulation game]] inspired by the cruise line [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] and developed by [[Deck13]] under the Artex Software label, and published by [[Activision Value]]. The primary objective of the game is to offer cruise line services to customers. The game itself offers what would be expected from a typical tycoon game. Users are in command of the ship and are responsible for the task of purchasing buildings and designing the layout. While gaining popularity, users also have an advantage to buy more ships and have a large fleet of ships going to exotic destinations.  The game included Carnival logos and the entertainment and lounges available to add to the ships were named as per Carnival Cruise Lines standards. The ships that can be worked with in the game are: ''Sunshine'' (a fictional cruise [[ferry]] only accessible as the first ship in the career mode), ''[[Grand Celebration|Carnival Celebration]]'', ''[[Carnival Paradise]]'', ''[[Carnival Legend]]'', and the ''[[Carnival Conquest]]''.

'''''Class of 1984''''' is a 1982 Canadian-American [[Action film|action]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed by [[Mark L. Lester|Mark Lester]] and co-written by [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] and John Saxton based on a story by Holland. The film stars [[Perry King]], Merrie Lynn Ross (who also served as co-executive producer), [[Timothy Van Patten]], [[Stefan Arngrim]], [[Michael J. Fox]] (credited as Michael Fox in an early role shortly before his breakthrough on the TV series ''[[Family Ties]]''), and [[Roddy McDowall]].

The film used the [[Punk subculture|punk]] look and image that was becoming part of popular culture in the early 1980s. The theme song, "[[I Am the Future]]", was performed by [[Alice Cooper]]. The film also features a performance by Canadian punk band [[Teenage Head (band)|Teenage Head]].

==Plot==
Andrew Norris is the new music teacher at a troubled [[inner city]] school.  As he arrives on his first day, he meets fellow teacher Terry Corrigan, who is carrying a gun. When Andrew asks about the firearm, Terry assures him he will learn why the protection is necessary.  When they enter the school, Andrew is shocked to see everyone scanned by metal detectors and frisked.  He spots a student with a knife, but the security guards let the kid go because they are so overworked.

The halls of the school are covered with graffiti. Andrew learns he is expected to patrol the halls as a security guard during his off periods.  In his first class, a group of five disruptive students are roughhousing and causing trouble.  The leader of the gang is Peter Stegman, the only member of the group who is actually registered in that class.  They all eventually walk out, and Andrew discovers the rest of the students actually want to learn, especially Arthur, who plays the trumpet, and Deneen, who plays the clarinet.

As Andrew gets to know the school and the area, he decides that he wants to put together an orchestra with his more advanced students.  Peter's gang sells drugs, run a strip club, and cause all kinds of mayhem. They follow Andrew home and taunt him one night.

At school, Andrew is confronted with more and more evidence of Peter's crimes.  The two grow increasingly at odds. Eventually, they wind up in a bathroom alone together. Peter throws himself into a mirror and beats himself, claiming that Andrew attacked him.  Trying to clear things up, Andrew visits Peter's mother at home.  Frustrated when Peter still plays the victim and his mother will not hear Andrew out, he hotwires Peter's car and drives it into a wall.

Andrew's orchestra is about to give its first concert. As his wife Diane gets ready at home, Peter's gang breaks into the house and gang rapes her.  One of them takes a Polaroid of her being raped and has it delivered to Andrew on the podium, just as he is about to start the concert.  Horrified by the photo, he runs off the podium in pursuit of Peter's gang. Andrew and the gang chase each other through the school.  Andrew kills them off one by one, and finally confronts Peter on the roof.  Their last scuffle ends with Peter falling through a skylight and getting tangled in the ropes above the stage.  He falls into full view of the audience as his neck is broken by one of the ropes.  Andrew is never charged because the police could not find a witness to the crime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">[[File:Iraqi Air Force C-172.jpg|thumb|An example of a single engine land class aircraft, the ubiquitous [[Cessna 172]]]]

In aviation, a '''class rating''' is an allowance to fly a certain group of aircraft that require training common to all aircraft within the group. A [[type rating]] is specified if a particular aircraft requires additional specialized training beyond the scope of initial [[Pilot licensing and certification|license]] and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a type rating is decided by the local aviation authority. Almost all single engine piston (SEP) or multi engine piston (MEP) single pilot aircraft can be flown without a ''type rating'', but are covered by a ''class rating'' instead. 

There are seven categories of aircraft, which may be further subdivided into two or more classes:
* [[airplane]] category
** single-engine land class
** multi-engine land class
*** Multi-engine class aircraft are more commonly known as "'''multis'''," and their pilots are called "multi pilots" or "multi-engine pilots."
*** Pilots of larger multi-engine aircraft are sometimes called '''transport pilots''', although mostly in the realm of military aviation (see the article on [[military transport aircraft]]).  The term ''transport pilot'' can be ambiguous in civil aviation, since the [[Airline Transport Pilot License]] is a very specific civil qualification.
** single-engine sea class - Pilots of all sea class aircraft are usually called "seaplane pilots" or "float-plane pilots"
** multi-engine sea class
* [[rotorcraft]] category
** [[helicopter]] class
** [[autogyro|gyroplane]] class
* [[powered lift]] category
* [[Glider aircraft|glider]] category
* [[aerostat|lighter than air]] category
** [[airship]] class 
** [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] class
* [[powered parachute]] category
** powered parachute land class
** powered parachute sea class
* weight-shift-control aircraft category
** weight-shift-control aircraft land class
** weight-shift-control aircraft sea class

The '''Descriptive Video Service''' ('''DVS''') is a major [[United States]] producer of [[video description]], which makes visual media, such as [[television program]]s, [[feature film]]s and [[home video]]s, more accessible to people who are [[Blindness|blind]] or otherwise [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]]. ''DVS'' often is used to describe the product itself.

==History==
In 1985, [[PBS]] [[Network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[WGBH-TV]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], began investigating uses for the new technology of [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic television broadcasting]], particularly [[multichannel television sound]] (MTS), which allowed for a third audio channel, called the ''[[Second audio program|Secondary Audio Program]]'' (''SAP''). With a history of developing [[closed captioning]] of programs for [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] viewers, WGBH considered the viability of using the new audio channel for narrated descriptions of key visual elements, much like those being done for live theatre in [[Washington, D.C.]], by Margaret Pfanstiehl, who had been experimenting with television description as part of her Washington Ear radio reading service.

After reviewing and conducting various studies, which found that blind and visually impaired people were consuming more television than ever but finding the activity problematic (often relying on sighted family and friends to describe for them), WGBH consulted more closely with Pfanstiehl and her husband, Cody, and then conducted its first tests of DVS in Boston in 1986. These tests (broadcasting to local groups of people of various ages and visual impairments) and further study were successful enough to merit a grant from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] to complete plans to establish the DVS organization permanently in 1988. After national testing, more feedback, more development of description technique, and additional grants, DVS became a regular feature of selected PBS programming in 1990.&lt;ref name="cronin"&gt;[http://www2.edc.org/NCIP/library/v&amp;c/cronin.htm The Development of the Descriptive Video Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, DVS became an available feature in some films and home videos, including DVDs.

==Technique==
DVS describers watch a program and write a script describing visual elements which are important in understanding what is occurring at the time and the plot as a whole. For example, in the opening credit sequence of the children's series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' on PBS, the description has been performed as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Arthur is an 8-year-old aardvark. He wears round glasses with thick frames over his big eyes. He has two round ears on top of his oval-shaped head. He wears red sneakers and blue jeans, with a yellow sweater over a white shirt."&lt;ref name="abcs"&gt;[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/the-abcs-of-dvs.html WGBH - Media Access Group - ABCs of DVS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The length of descriptions and their placement by a producer into the program are largely dictated by what can fit in natural pauses in dialogue (other producers of description may have other priorities, such as synchronization with the timing of a described element's appearance, which differ from DVS's priority for detail).&lt;ref name="avcanada"&gt;[http://www.audiovisioncanada.com/ACCFMX/about.cfm About AudioVision&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Once recorded, placed and mixed with a copy of the original soundtrack, the DVS track is then "laid back" to the master tape on a separate audio track (for broadcast on the SAP) or to its own DVS master (for home video). For feature films, the descriptions are not mixed with the soundtrack, but kept separate as part of a [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] soundtrack.&lt;ref name="dvs-faq"&gt;[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/dvs-faq.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==FCC involvement==
When the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started establishing various requirements for broadcasters in larger [[media market|markets]] to improve their accessibility to audiences with hearing and vision impairments&lt;ref&gt;http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/guides/mag_guide_vol3.html&lt;/ref&gt;, DVS branched out to non-PBS programming, and soon description could be heard on the SAP for shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. However, a federal court ruled in 2002 that the Federal Communications Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring broadcasters in the top 25 markets to carry video description.

Since that time, the amount of new DVS television programming in the United States declined, as did access to information regarding upcoming described programming, while broadcasters like ABC and Fox instead decided to devote their SAP channels to [[Spanish language]] [[Dub localization|dubbing tracks]] of their shows rather than DVS due to the technical limitations of the analog NTSC standard.[http://adinternational.org/ADIACB1.html]  Description by DVS and other producers was still available in a limited form on television (the greatest percentage of DVS programming is still on PBS).&lt;ref name="pbs-sch"&gt;[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/services/description/ontv/pbs-schedule.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; WGBH's Media Access Group continues supporting description of feature films (known as DVS Theatrical)&lt;ref name="mopix"&gt;[http://ncam.wgbh.org/mopix/ MoPix – Motion Picture Access&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and DVS home videos/[[DVD]]s are available from WGBH as well as other vendors and libraries.&lt;ref name="dvs-cat"&gt;[http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/mag/resources/dvs-home-video-catalogue.html WGBH - Media Access Group - DVS Home Video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial caption providers the [[National Captioning Institute]] and [[CaptionMax]] have also begun to describe programs. Benefit Media, Inc., a subsidiary of DuArt Film and Video in New York City provides DVS services to [[USA Network]]. For the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], [[NBC Olympics|NBC]] is providing description of events during the network's primetime block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/community/announcements/comcast-and-nbc-to-make-the-2016-summer-olympic-games-accessible-to-people-with-vision-loss-through-live-description/12|title=Comcast and NBC to Make the 2016 Summer Olympic Games Accessible to People with Vision Loss through Live Description|publisher=[[American Foundation for the Blind]]|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 reinstates the FCC's involvement in providing rules for video description. Under the rules, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable networks will have to provide at least 50 hours of video described programming per quarter; the rules took effect on July 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=source1/&gt; However, this provision currently does not apply to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming; notably, many programs which have [[audio description]] in their network runs, such as those produced by [[Twentieth Century Fox Television]], remove the DVS track for syndication, substituting in the Spanish dubbing track on SAP to reach more viewers, though as many stations affiliated with "netlets" like [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] are not under the video description provision, do not have SAP channels and thus, neither an audio description or Spanish dub track can be heard. In some markets where SAP is activated on affiliate stations though, The CW does provide a Spanish SAP dub for ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' and audio description is available and passed through for their Saturday morning ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' [[E/I]] block, which is done for all of the blocks produced for the major broadcast networks by [[Litton Entertainment]]. MyNetworkTV has no provisions for audio description or language dub tracks.

Online streaming services such as [[Hulu]] and the services of television networks themselves such as [[CBS All Access]] have yet to carry descriptive video service audio in most cases as they instead are currently focused on adding closed captioning to their libraries (the network app for ABC began to carry existing audio described shows in the fall of 2017). [[Netflix]] committed in April 2015 to begin audio description of their original series, starting with ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' (which features a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|blind protagonist]] with other heightened senses) and the remainder of their original programming in the next few months, making their goal in that timeframe, along with providing the DVS tracks of existing series in their library; however some platforms (mainly older versions for devices that are now unsupported) do not provide the alternate audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Netflix Begins Audio Description for Visually Impaired|publisher=Netflix corporate blog|date=14 April 2015|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/netflix-begins-audio-description-for-visually-impaired|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC, along with sister network [[Disney Channel]] has since added audio description to some of their programming (with a commensurate decline in Spanish-dubbed programming, though the [[ATSC]] standard allows more audio channels), but does not contract any of their shows to be described by the Media Access Group, instead going with commercial providers [[CaptionMax]] and [http://audioeyesllc.com/ Audio Eyes], though some special programming such as ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' is described by the Media Access Group under existing contracts with [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. NBC and their associated cable networks, along with outside productions by [[Universal Television]] such as ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' and ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', solely use CaptionMax for description services; Netflix also utilizes CaptionMax for their original series, while going per studio for acquired programming. Most scripted programming on Fox, except for the shows of [[Gordon Ramsay]] (''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'', ''[[Hotel Hell]]'' and ''[[Kitchen Nightmares]]'') is described by the Media Access Group; Ramsay's programs are contracted by his [[ITV Studios America|producing studio]] to have audio description done by Scottish-born voiceover artist [http://www.deyanaudio.com/femascottish.html Mhairi Morrison] with [http://www.descriptivevideoworks.com/ Descriptive Video Works]. Unique to most described shows, Fox's ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' uses actress [[Adrienne Barbeau]] for their description. CBS's described shows all use the Media Access Group.

Some shows have lost their DVS during their original network runs due to outside factors or complications. For instance, ''[[American Dad!]]'' had a two-season interregnum in part of season 12 and all of season 13 without any DVS service during its move from Fox to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in late 2014, before it returned in November 2016 for its fourteenth season. ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' lost DVS at the start of their fourth season upon the move to Hulu, which does not yet provide DVS service.

On November 26, 2018 [[Adult Swim]] Begins DVS on [[Family Guy]], [[Bob's Burgers]] and [[American Dad]]

{{Education in Hong Kong}}

The '''Education Bureau''' ({{zh|t=教育局|cy=Gaauyuhk Gúk}}; abbr. '''EDB''') is responsible for implementing [[education]] policies in [[Hong Kong]].

The bureau is headed by the [[Secretary for Education (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Education]] and oversees agencies including [[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|University Grants Committee]] and [[Student loan|Student Finance Office]].

==History==
The Education Department ({{zh|t=教育署}} and 教育司署 before 1983) was responsible for education matters in the territory, with the exception of post-secondary and tertiary education. In 2003, the department was abolished and a new bureau, the '''Education and Manpower Bureau''' ({{zh|t=教育統籌局}} abbreviated '''EMB''') was formed. In July 2007, the manpower portfolio was transferred to the new [[Labour and Welfare Bureau]] by newly re-elected [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]].

The bureau was formerly housed at the [[Former French Mission Building]].

== Education System ==
The Education System includes: Kindergarten Education, Primary and Secondary School Education, Special Education, Post-secondary Education, and other Education and Training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/|title=EDB - Home|website=www.edb.gov.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrollment in educational institutions''' varies considerably across the [[continent]] of [[Asia]], as evidenced by data maintained by [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/ |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's measurement categories for education are used in the context of [[international development]] work, and are adopted by the [[World Bank]] in its EdStats database.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/topic/education |title=World Bank EdStats}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] issues a [[Human Development Index]] for each nation, of which the [[Education Index]] is a component.

==Participation in education==
The Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) is a component of the [[Education Index]]. It expresses the number of students enrolled in a given level of education as a percentage of the number of people within the official age for that level of education. GER can exceed 100% because some enrolled students may fall outside the official age range.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

The tables below show GER for each country in Asia, organized into five regions by population: [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[West Asia]] and [[Central Asia]]. Data are shown for four levels of education: [[preschool|pre-primary]], [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[tertiary education|tertiary]]. (Tertiary education is also referred to as [[higher education]]).

The last year for which data are available is shown in parentheses following each number in the table. If the year is the same as for the column to the left, the year is omitted.

{| class="wikitable" summary="The first column names each country within Asia, grouped by region (South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia and West Asia). Columns two through five show the latest available UNESCO data for Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) for four levels of education: pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary."

==Challenges and Opportunities==
===Low GER===
As Asian nations compete in the global economy and aspire to join the developed nations, there is concern that rates of education may not be keeping pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Higher-education-enrolment-rate-dismal-in-Bihar/articleshow/49974690.cms |title=Higher education enrollment rate dismal in Bihar | work=The Times of India | first=B.K. |last=Mishra |date=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books/p/pub-4388284172809704?hl=en&amp;q=Google+Full+Text+of+this+Book&amp;vid=ISBN9780857280749&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#v=onepage&amp;q=Google%20Full%20Text%20of%20this%20Book&amp;f=false | last = Bharucha | first = Jamshed | date = 2013 | title=Education in South Asia: Time bomb or silver bullet? | work= In A. Najam &amp; M. Yusuf (Eds.), South Asia 2060: Envisioning Regional Futures. NY: Anthem Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Gross Enrollment Rate]]s for North America and Western Europe in 2013 were 84.3% for pre-primary, 101.1% for primary, 105.1% for secondary, and 76.6% for tertiary education.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;
===Supply versus demand===
Many Asian nations lack the capacity to scale up their enrollment to meet the escalating demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/90-surge-but-big-demand-supply-gap/articleshow/8909625.cms? |title=90% surge but big demand-supply gap | work=The Times of India | first=Subodh |last=Varma |date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Quality in education at scale===
There is also concern about a quality gap, as nations seek to scale up their enrollment quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110722202005936 |title=INDIA: A crisis of confidence in higher education? | work=University World News | first=Rahul |last=Choudaha |date=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/100-cut-off-symptom-of-a-disease-says-yash-pal-111061700085_1.html |title=100% cut-off symptom of a disease, says Yash Pal | work=Business Standard | first=Kalpana |last=Pathak |date=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent HSBC survey of 8400 parents in 15 Asia-Pacific countries revealed that parents from Hong Kong spend the most on their children's education to ensure a quality education that increases their competitiveness in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Asian-parents-among-top-spenders-on-education|title=Asian parents among top spenders on education    - Nikkei Asian Review|work=Nikkei Asian Review|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, parents in Hong Kong spend an average of $132,100 per child, which is almost three times as much as the global amount of $44,200. Singapore and Taiwan followed with education expenditures of $70,939 and $56,400 respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Skills gap===
There is concern about a gap between the education sought by the labor market and what is being taught in the educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/can-india-harness-its-demographic-dividend/26034/ |title=Can India harness its demographic dividend? | work=Financial Express | first=Nishant |last=Arya |date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Demographic dividend===
Many Asian countries - mostly in East Asia and Southeast Asia - experienced a [[demographic dividend]] that boosted their economies during the past few decades. There is a widespread view that the South Asian countries are poised to benefit from a [[demographic dividend]] because their populations are young relative to the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/narendra-modi-in-us/india-blessed-with-democracy-demographic-dividend-and-demand-pm-modi-at-msg_1477180.html |title=India blessed with democracy, democratic dividend and demand: PM Modi at Madison Square Garden | work=Zeenews | first=Hemant |last=Abhishek |date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reaping this dividend is expected to require a work force that is well educated, which means, at a minimum, increasing enrollment rates and educational quality.
===Progress===
Even though many Asian nations still have low GER compared with their North American and Western European counterparts, there has been considerable progress in recent years. For example, consider the change in GER over ten years preceding the latest data reported, for the three most populous Asian countries: China, India and Indonesia. All three countries had achieved virtually universal [[primary education]] (close to 100%) before this ten-year period, so consider the other three levels. Over a ten-year period, China's GER increased from 40% to 74% for [[preschool|pre-primary]], from 60% to 92% for [[secondary education|secondary]], and from 15% to 30% for [[tertiary education]]. India's GER increased from 25% to 58% for [[preschool|pre-primary]], from 48% to 71% for [[secondary education|secondary]], and from 11% to 25% for [[tertiary education]]. Indonesia's GER increased from 26% to 51% for [[preschool|pre-primary]], from 61% to 83% for [[secondary education|secondary]], and from 15% to 32% for [[tertiary education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.university-analytics.net/#!global-education/vphur |title=University Analytics: Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30723">'''Education sector responses to LGBT violence''' addresses the ways in which education systems work to create safe learning environments for [[LGBT]] students. Overall, education sector responses tend to focus on [[homophobia]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence linked to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression]], and less on [[transphobia]]. Most responses focus in some way on diverse expressions of gender and support students to understand that gender may be expressed in a different way from [[Gender role|binary models]] (of masculine and feminine). Responses vary greatly in their scope (from a single class to the national level); duration (from one-off events to several years); and level of support that they enjoy (from individual teachers to the highest levels of government).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=15, 61–62, 65, 69–75, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive [[Education#Education sector|education sector]] response to homophobic and transphobic violence encompasses all of the following elements: effective policies, relevant curricula and learning materials, training and support for staff, support for students and families information and strategic partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Very few countries have education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence or include [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]/expression in [[Curriculum|curricula]] or learning materials. In most countries, staff lack training and support to address sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and to prevent and respond to homophobic and transphobic violence. Although many countries provide support for students who experience violence, services are often ill-equipped to deal with homophobic and transphobic violence. Few countries collect data on the nature, prevalence or impact of homophobic and transphobic violence, which contributes to low awareness of the problem and lack of evidence for planning effective responses.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In general terms, the range of responses to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings appears to correlate to a country's: socio-cultural context (in terms of the society's beliefs and attitudes towards sexual and [[gender diversity]], as well as to [[human rights]] and [[gender equality]]); and legal context (in terms of the rights of LGBTI individuals and the situation of human rights in general).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

== Policy approaches ==
Few countries have developed education sector policies to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools, reflecting the fact that recognition of the prevalence and harmful impact of such violence in the sector is a relatively recent development. Most countries that have developed policies have taken one of the two following approaches:
* Integrating references to sexual orientation and gender identity or to homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence into existing education sector policies on general violence, [[bullying]] or discrimination.
* Developing specific education sector policies that focus on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
The first approach aims to protect and support LGBTI students by mainstreaming issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity into broader policies to prevent and address discrimination and violence. However, available data suggest that in countries where policies do not clearly refer to homophobic and transphobic violence, this form of violence may not be addressed by schools. For example, a large-scale qualitative research study conducted in 19 European countries in 2013 by the European Union [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] concluded that: 'Where anti-bullying measures are in place, these are often generic and they may be ineffective in dealing specifically with bullying on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;FRA, Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people. Vienna - Austria: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second approach requires political leadership and a legal environment that is conducive to the protection of the rights of LGBTI people. A number of countries have developed specific education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools and other educational settings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Work conducted in countering violence in schools in general has shown that 'school and system wide interventions', often referred to as 'whole school' strategies or approaches, are particularly effective. The same applies to education sector responses to homophobic and transphobic violence. In this report, 'whole school' responses to homophobic and transphobic violence are also referred to as 'comprehensive' education sector responses, which can also be referred to as 'holistic', 'systematic', 'systemic', 'system-wide'.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== National policies ==
Progress in implementing measures to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings varies between regions and countries. The most comprehensive initiatives are being implemented in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the United States, and a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, the education sector response has been limited in the majority of countries in the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Central Asia and some areas of the Pacific. In addition, it is important to note that many countries do not have comprehensive strategies to prevent and address violence in schools in general.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

National legislation against discrimination (as a whole) has served as a basis to develop national policies – which either include, or are specific to, the education sector – that address discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In general, the education sector tends to address homophobic and transphobic violence through wider policies on violence, such as those related to bullying in schools or safe schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
In Asia, the Philippines is the only country to include specific references to violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a national law (2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNESCO, 'From Insult to Inclusion: Asia-Pacific report on school bullying, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity', UNESCO, Paris and Bangkok, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, in 2015, the Ministry of Education issued landmark guidance urging local education boards to ensure that schools cater to the needs of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a more local level, the 2004 [[Gender Equity Education Act (Taiwan)|Gender Equity Education Act]] in Taiwan of China seeks to eliminate gender stereotypes from the curriculum and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a regional report developed for this review notes that implementation measures for this Act may be inadequate to effectively prevent and address discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

All other countries in the Asia region, apart from Pakistan, have legal or policy frameworks to address violence in educational institutions or the health of minors, although they vary in their nature and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India, following a 2014 ruling by the Supreme Court recognizing the status of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], the University Grants Commission called on all universities to recognize transgender students and to include a transgender category on all application forms, academic testimonials and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity / Expression - Meeting Report', UNESCO, Bangkok, Thailand, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== North America ===
In North America, in 2002, the Supreme Court in Canada ruled that LGBT students and same-sex parents had the right to be safe from discrimination and to see their lives reflected in the school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Judgements, 'Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, 2002 SCC 86', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/&lt;/nowiki&gt; scc-csc/en/item/2030/index.do. [Accessed: 10-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Smith, 'Questioning heteronormativity: Lesbian and gay challenges to educational practice in British Columbia, Canada', Soc. Mov. Stud., vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 131–145, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, it ruled that school districts were 'liable for the discriminatory conduct of the students who harassed' and that they had a duty to provide students with 'an educational environment that does not expose them to discriminatory harassment'.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 'School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 (CanLII)', 2005. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/&lt;/nowiki&gt; doc/2005/2005bcca201/2005bcca201.html. [Accessed: 10-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario Education Act of Canada was amended in 2012 to specifically integrate attention to homophobic bullying following several years of amendments to Safe School legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 'Bill 13, Accepting Schools Act', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=2549&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [Accessed: 23-Sep- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Act strengthened legal obligations for school boards to foster positive school environments and to prevent and address inappropriate student behaviour, including homophobic or transphobic violence. For example, principals must suspend students and consider expulsion for misbehaviour that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred, including that which is based on gender, sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. School boards must provide support for victims of bullying, witnesses and perpetrators. In Quebec, legislation was adopted in 2012 for schools to provide healthy and safe learning environments, allowing every student to develop their full potential regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblée nationale du Québec, 'Bill 56: An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools', 2015. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/&lt;/nowiki&gt; projets-loi/projet-loi-56-39-2.html. [Accessed: 20-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the United States, LGBT students are not protected under federal legislation. However, in 2010, the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] issued guidance to specify that federal provisions outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex in education (Title IX) also offered some protection against bullying on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Dear Colleague Letter', 2010. [Online]. Available: http:// www2.ed.gov/about/of ces/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html. [Accessed: 12-Jul- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it extended this protection on the grounds of gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence', 2014. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/about/of&lt;/nowiki&gt; ces/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title- ix.pdf. [Accessed: 12-Oct-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] also clarified that transgender students must be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity and that failure to do so amounts to sex discrimination under Title IX.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In May 2016, the Department of Education released Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document has a list of questions and answers for schools and educators concerning Student transitions, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records, Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities, Additional Practices to Support Transgender Students, Terminology, Cited Policies on Transgender Students, and Select Federal Resources on Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education withdrew statements of support and guidance previously issued in the Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.docx|title=Dear Colleague Letter to Emily Prince from James A.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America and the Caribbean, Argentina is the only country that offers a full normative framework to tackle sexual orientation and gender identity/expression issues in educational contexts through the National Law on Integral Sexuality Education (2006) (26.150), the National Law on Education (2006) (26.206), the National Law for the Promotion of Coexistence and Tackling Social Conflict in Educational Institutions (2013) (26.892) and a federal guide for educational responses for addressing challenging situations linked to school life. The guide also contains a specific section on discrimination and harassment due to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] and the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court of Mexico]] found that bullying undermined victims' dignity, integrity and education&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Santiago, 'La violencia homofóbica y transfóbica en el ámbito escolar: hacia centros educativos inclusivos y seguros en América Latina', UNESCO, Santiago, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the education sector had a direct duty to protect students from violence based on their personal characteristics.

In Uruguay, the General Law on Education (2014) includes a general reference to non-discrimination due to sexual orientation. In El Salvador, the General Law on Youth, while not referring to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, recognizes and guarantees the right to integral comprehensive sexuality education (2013). Also the General Law on Education's article 5-A condemns inequalities and discriminatory practices between or towards students when based on traditional gendered roles (1990).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries have instruments to prevent and counter discrimination or violence, including bullying. Examples include the following:

In Chile, Law 20.609 (2012) and the Law on Education (2009) are in place to counter discrimination in general and can also be applied to a school setting. However, as none of the laws are LGBT-specific, addressing homophobic and transphobic violence is left at the discretion of individual schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Colombia, no specific policy exists to tackle homophobic and transphobic violence. Law 1620 (from 2013) and the Regulatory Decree (1965) establish minimal norms for applying the Integral Roadmap for Educational Community Living and its protocols, in order to prevent and mitigate situations affecting school community living and the exercising of human, sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Honduras, the Law Against Bullying was adopted in 2014. However, it does not refer to particular motives for bullying.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Peru, the General Law on Education (2003) establishes that integral sexuality education is part of the right to education. A Law promoting violence-free community living in educational institutions (29719) exists (2011), although it does not refer to homophobic or transphobic violence.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Cuba, El Salvador and Peru guarantee the right to comprehensive sexuality education, which should cover issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As with other regions of the world, although these rights-based policies are on the statute books in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, a regional survey of 19 states – conducted by the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights in 2011 – noted that, in the majority of cases, they are not rigorously implemented and are 'always very general, dispersed, and in some cases ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;IIDH, 'Informe Interamericano de la Educación en Derechos Humanos Un estudio en 19 países: Desarrollo en las políticas de convivencia y seguridad escolar con enfoque de derechos', Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos, San Jose, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, some countries have specific laws and policies to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings. In Belgium, the Flemish Ministry for Education and Equal Opportunities issued a Common Declaration for a Gender-Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools in 2012, establishing a framework for sexuality education and providing guidelines for schools to develop LGBT-inclusive policies.&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Department of Education, 'Gender aware and LGBT friendly policies in education', Brussels, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Government, 'The Common Declaration for a Gender Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unece.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/DAM/env/ esd/11thMeetSC/Documents/2015_Good_practices_gender_in_ESD_BE_Flanders.pdf. [Accessed: 13-Aug-2012].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, although no national policy mentions homophobic and transphobic violence, the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education's]] annual letter to principals has, since 2009, mentioned combating homophobia. Also, a 2012 governmental plan to combat homophobic and transphobic violence foresees specific actions in the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;Republique Française, 'Programme d'actions gouvernemental contre les violences et les discriminations commises à raison de l'orientation sexuelle ou de l'identité de genre', Premier Ministre, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, the Students' Statute (2012) includes protection against discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In Sweden, the Discrimination Act (2009) explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in education, and obliges pre-schools, schools and universities to take proactive measures against violence. The United Kingdom's [[Equality Act 2010|Equality Act]] (2010) makes it a duty for schools to advance equality for their LGBT students. The Act explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender reassignment and mandates that every school should have a behaviour policy preventing all forms of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Mitchell, M. Gray, K. Green, and K. Beninger, 'What works in tackling homophobic, biphobic and transphobic (HBT) bullying among and young people? Evidence review and typology of initiatives', Government Equalities Of ce, London, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The Pacific ===
In the Pacific, Australia's 2013 Sex Discrimination Act (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) builds on previous state-level legislation and provides protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and intersex status (although some exemptions exist for some religious schools).&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones, Policy and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Students. Cham, Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht and London: Springer International Publishing, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Australia, the State of Victoria's Department of Education and Early Childhood Development provides guidance to support [[sexual diversity]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;DoEECD, 'Supporting Sexual Diversity in schools', Student Wellbeing &amp; Health Support Division Of ce for Government School Education Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Melbourne, Melbourne, State of Victoria, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Fiji, the 2015 Policy on Child Protection in Schools requires schools to respect children's sexual orientation and to take action against bullying, including homophobic bullying. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education published a Guide for Sexuality Education (2015) stating that school anti-bullying procedures should directly address bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and that these incidents should be recorded as such and monitored. The comprehensive guidance also touches upon the curriculum, school uniforms, restroom facilities, procedures and policies in sports and extra-curricular activities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries in the region offer limited protection from school-related violence. Papua New Guinea alone specifically forbids such practice, while other countries protect children's health in general or offer only limited protection to children (in Tonga).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Africa ===
In Africa, a review of policies on gender, diversity and violence in schools in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland – conducted within the study supported by [[UNESCO]] in 2015 – found that countries have generic legal and policy frameworks (including in education) that provide a conducive environment to address violence in schools. In Lesotho and Swaziland, they are mostly related to child protection. Swaziland has an education sector policy where Schools as Centres of Care and Support (SCCS) are supposed to be 'protective and secure environments which accommodate all learners'. In Botswana and Namibia, [[Education For All|Education for All]] National Action Plans and other education policies clearly mention inclusive and non-discriminatory education. However, none of these policies make reference to sexual and gender diversity, except for South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Gender, diversity and violence in schools in five countries in Southern Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland (draft)', UNESCO, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only South Africa has explicit policies to deal with homophobic bullying in education. The UNESCO-supported study found that, in interview, national policy-makers in Southern Africa suggest that the overall absence of specific policies may reflect the lack of reliable evidence on the nature, prevalence and impact of homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings in the region, or that it is not considered a political priority. Where specific national legislation or policies (including in the education sector) are lacking, other entry points may exist to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. These include international or regional human rights frameworks, but also general laws and policies against violence in educational institutions (for which additional guidance can be produced to detail how they apply to homophobic and transphobic violence). Finally, national anti-discrimination laws in Southern Africa (whether or not they mention sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) may also provide good entry points for the education sector to consider adopting new policies or upgrading existing ones.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Relevant curricula and learning materials ==
{{See also|Gender inequality in curricula}}

The second element of a comprehensive response to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings is relevant curricula and learning materials. Through their content and the way that they are delivered, curricula, learning materials and extra-curricular activities in educational settings – such as sports or theatre – convey influential messages about 'normality', legitimacy and power. Curricula are never neutral. Those that do not feature sexual and gender diversity convey the implicit message that people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities/expressions are not part of society. Worse still, some curricula may explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Curricula generally take one of four approaches for sexual and gender diversity:
* '''{{'}}Hostile' curricula:''' i.e. they explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people, which reinforce negative gender stereotypes and contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence. For example textbooks were withdrawn by the government in Croatia (in 2009) and Macedonia (in 2010) because they described homosexuality as a disease.
* '''{{'}}Non-inclusive' curricula:''' These omit any representation of sexual and gender diversity in their materials and, for example, ignore these aspects when discussing historical  gures who were LGBTI. This has the result of rendering LGBTI people 'invisible'. Most curricula worldwide fall into this category.
* '''{{'}}Inclusive' curricula:''' These convey implicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity when they promote the human rights of all, regardless of personal characteristics including sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. These curricula are likely to also encourage gender equality.
* '''{{'}}Affirming' curricula:''' These convey explicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity by featuring positive representations of LGBTI people and explicitly af rming their equality in dignity and rights. They provide educators with clear  guidelines and examples on how to refer to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a sensitive way.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
Hostile and non-inclusive curricula tend to exist in contexts where homophobia and transphobia are widespread. They do nothing to prevent or reduce violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. On the contrary, hostile curricula contribute to reinforcing stereotypical and patriarchal views of gender – indirectly leading to homophobic and transphobic violence. Meanwhile, by not challenging these stereotypical and patriarchal views, non-inclusive curricula also contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. In contrast, inclusive or af rming curricula may discuss de nitions of masculinity and femininity and challenge existing stereotypes about gender and sexuality – contributing to increasing LGBTI students' feeling of belonging and safety.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kosciw, E. A. Greytak, N. A. Palmer, and M. J. Boesen, 'The 2013 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools', Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, New York, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;F. Bucx, F. Van Der Sman, and C. Jalvingh, 'Different class - Evaluation of the pilot Social safety of LGBT children at school: Summary and Conclusions', The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Research suggests that curricula featuring sexual orientation and gender identity/expression positively impact students' and teachers' beliefs and attitudes, encouraging critical thinking and increasing feelings of safety at school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also help to address violence. The literature confirms that challenging homophobia and transphobia in education is most effective when LGBTI issues are reflected and featured through teaching and lesson plans, and when LGBTI people are positively portrayed across the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;I.

'''Elliot Aronson''' (born January 9, 1932) is an American [[Psychology|psychologist]] who is best known for his experiments on the theory of cognitive dissonance and for his invention of the [[Jigsaw Classroom]], a cooperative teaching technique which facilitates learning while reducing interethnic hostility and prejudice. In his popular (1972) social psychology textbook, ''The Social Animal,'' (now in its 11th edition), he stated Aronson's First Law: "People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy," thus asserting the importance of situational factors in bizarre behavior. He is the only person in the 120-year history of the [[American Psychological Association]] to have won all three of its major awards: for writing, for teaching, and for research.&lt;ref name="f_intro"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gonzales |first1= Marti Hope |last2= Tavris |first2= Carol |last3= Aronson|first3=Joshua |editor1-last=Gonzales |editor1-first= Marti Hope |editor2-last= Tavris |editor2-first= Carol |editor3-last= Aronson |editor3-first=Joshua | year=2010|chapter=Editor's Introduction| title=The scientist and the humanist: A Festschrift in honor of Elliot Aronson |location= New York |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn= 978-1-84872-867-7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he received the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the [[Association for Psychological Science]], in which he was cited as the scientist who "fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/awards/james/citations/aronson.cfm William James Fellow Award - Elliot Aronson] (Association for Psychological Science) Accessed 2009-07-19&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Aronson as the 78th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially retired in 1994 but continues to teach and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zimbardo |first= Philip |editor1-last=Gonzales |editor1-first= Marti Hope |editor2-last= Tavris |editor2-first= Carol |editor3-last= Aronson |editor3-first=Joshua | year=2010|chapter=Honoring Elliot Aronson| title=The scientist and the humanist: A Festschrift in honor of Elliot Aronson |location= New York |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn= 978-1-84872-867-7|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Aronson grew up in extreme poverty in Revere, Massachusetts, during the [[Great Depression]]. His was the only Jewish family in the neighbourhood, and it was not rare for Aronson to be bullied on the way home from Hebrew school by anti-Semitic gangs. He believes that every life's progress is based on a combination of luck, opportunity, talent, and intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Chibnall, John T., [http://search.proquest.com/docview/851475808 "Elliot Aronson and the life of becoming."], ''American Psychological Association'', date&lt;/ref&gt; Although his high school grades were mediocre, his [[SAT]] scores were high enough to earn him a work-study scholarship at Brandeis University.&lt;ref name=autobiog /&gt;

Influenced by his father, he began his college career majoring in economics.  However, he promptly changed his major to psychology after accidentally wandering into an Introductory Psychology lecture taught by [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name="American Psychologist 1999 pg. 873-875"&gt;American Psychologist (November 1999), 54 (11), pg. 873-875&lt;/ref&gt; After attending this lecture, he realized that there was an entire science devoted to exploring the kinds of questions that had intrigued him as a child.&lt;ref name="American Psychologist 1999 pg. 873-875"/&gt; His undergraduate years at Brandeis brought him closer to a number of respected psychologists, but Maslow was his primary mentor and had the biggest impact on his early academic career.&lt;ref name="American Psychologist 1999 pg. 873-875"/&gt;
 
Aronson earned his Bachelor's degree from Brandeis in 1954. He went on to earn a Master's degree from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1956, where he worked with [[David McClelland]], and a Ph.D. in psychology from  [[Stanford University]] in 1959, where his doctoral advisor and mentor was the experimental social psychologist [[Leon Festinger]].&lt;ref name="autobiog"&gt;Aronson, E.

==Professional history==

He also served as Distinguished Visiting Professor at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="Aronson2002"&gt;{{citation|first=Joshua Michael |last=Aronson|title=Improving academic achievement: impact of psychological factors on education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bEOmHiVzDgC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=11 July 2010|date=15 April 2002|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-064455-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in a list of the 100 most influential psychologists of the 20th century published by the ''Review of General Psychology''.&lt;ref name="top100"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haggbloom|first=Steven J.|title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=2002|volume=6|issue=2|pages=139–152|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and won the William James Award from the [[Association for Psychological Science]] for his lifetime achievements.&lt;ref name="mcnulty"&gt;{{cite web|last=McNulty|first=Jennifer|title=UCSC Professor Emeritus Elliot Aronson receives lifetime achievement award from the Association for Psychological Science|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=973|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613053339/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=973|archive-date=13 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His honors include distinguished research awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]].

==Research topics==

===Cognitive dissonance===
One of Aronson's key areas of interest and research has been the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A theory of cognitive dissonance.'' Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson. Aronson advanced Festinger's theory by showing that it is most powerful when the self-concept is involved; see Tavris, C., &amp; Aronson, E. (2007), ''Mistakes were made (but not by ME): Why we justify foolish beliefs, bad decisions, and hurtful acts.'' New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson refined the theory, which posits that when attitudes and behaviors are inconsistent (dissonant), psychological discomfort results.  This discomfort motivates the person experiencing it to either change the behavior or the attitude so that consonance is restored.  In a classic experiment, Aronson demonstrated that people who undergo an embarrassing initiation to gain admission to a group develop more favorable evaluations of the group than people who are admitted after a mild or easy initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., &amp; Mills, J. (1959). The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 59, 177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Aronson's ''Theories of Cognitive Consistency'', he states: "Dissonance theory does not rest upon the assumption that man is a rational animal; rather, it suggests that man is a rationalizing animal – that he attempts to appear rational, both to others and to himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theunboundedspirit.com/festingers-cognitive-dissonance-theory-and-research-examples/|title=Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory and Research Examples|accessdate=5 Mar 2014}} The core statement from this quote is often mis-attributed to Leon Festinger. The earliest known statement of this concept is in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[Assignment in Eternity]]'': "Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jigsaw Classroom===

Aronson led the development of a classroom technique for defusing inter-group tension and promoting self-esteem.
In 1971 the newly [[desegregation|desegregated]] schools of [[Austin, Texas]] faced a crisis of violence between ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="averting"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Susan |title=No One Left to Hate: Averting Columbines |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/27/health/27CONV.html |accessdate=7 July 2010 |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 27, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126034819/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/27/health/27CONV.html |archivedate=January 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aronson, then at the University of Texas, was called in as a consultant by a school administrator who was also a former student.&lt;ref name=bdp /&gt;&lt;ref name=averting /&gt;
Aronson noticed that the schools' highly competitive atmosphere was exacerbating the already tense ethnic rivalry.&lt;ref name=bdp /&gt;
Together with his graduate students, he developed a model of teaching practice to encourage a culture of shared goals and mutual support.&lt;ref name=bdp /&gt;
In the jigsaw classroom approach, pupils are divided into small groups, mixed by [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and by ability, to work co-operatively on a task.&lt;ref name="enc_edu" /&gt;
The classroom material—for example a biography of a historical figure—is broken into sections, and one member of each group is responsible for reading each section.&lt;ref name="enc_edu" /&gt; Members with the same role from each group gather in "expert groups" to discuss their sections. They then return to their own groups and take turns to present what they have learned. They are then assessed individually on all sections of the material.&lt;ref name="enc_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brophy"&gt;{{citation|first1=Jere |last1=Brophy|title=Motivating Students to Learn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EepiejSCsqUC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=11 July 2010|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4106-1021-8|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"OVERVIEW." The Jigsaw Classroom. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This division of responsibilities means that students are motivated to listen to each other and each of them experiences a role in which they are valuable to others.&lt;ref name="enc_edu"&gt;{{citation|first1=David |last1=Levinson|first2=Peter W. |last2=Cookson|first3=Alan R. |last3=Sadovnik|title=Education and sociology: an encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yzi-6VOVcUcC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=11 July 2010|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-1615-2|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons with traditional classroom environments showed that the jigsaw classroom has positive effects on academic performance, self-esteem and attitudes towards other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|last2=Bridgeman|first2=Diane|title=Jigsaw Groups and the Desegregated Classroom: In Pursuit of Common Goals|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=5|issue=4|year=1979|pages=438–446|issn=0146-1672|doi=10.1177/014616727900500405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The technique has since been applied in hundreds of schools across North America.&lt;ref name=bdp /&gt; From its initial application at third- to fifth-grade school level, it has been expanded to other educational levels. This success encouraged Aronson to apply his research to other policy issues including energy conservation and the treatment of the elderly.&lt;ref name=bdp /&gt;
In the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], Aronson advocated for jigsaw classrooms as part of an approach to defusing the social divisions underlying school violence.&lt;ref name=averting /&gt;

===Gain-loss theory of attraction===
In 1965, Aronson proposed that interpersonal attraction and liking could be understood in terms of the balance of reward and cost. This implied that contrast—a gain or loss of positive feedback from the other person—has more effect on liking than the absolute level of feedback.  An example is how compliments are more meaningful when they come from someone who is usually critical, rather than from a reliable supporter. Another example is that a couple may feel more dedicated to their relationship if they initially disliked each other.&lt;ref name="Reisman1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reisman|first=John M.|title=Anatomy of friendship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G63aTaSNeNAC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=2 January 2011|date=September 1979|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-89197-646-2|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pratfall effect===
Aronson published a paper in 1966&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 1966"&gt;Aronson, E., Willerman, B., &amp; Floyd, J. (1966). The effect of a pratfall on increasing interpersonal attractiveness. Psychonomic Science.&lt;/ref&gt; where he described an experiment testing the effects of a simple blunder on perceived attraction. The so-called  [[Pratfall effect]] is the tendency for attractiveness to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived competence, or ability to perform well in a general sense.

==Personal life==
[[File:Elliot Aronson and guide dog 2011.jpg|thumb|Aronson with his Labrador Retriever [[guide dog]] Desi-Lu in 2011]]
Elliot is married to Vera Aronson, whom he met while they were both undergraduate research assistants under [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=f_intro /&gt; Together they have had four children: Hal, Neal, Julie and Joshua, who is himself a social psychologist.&lt;ref name=f_intro /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |work=Monitor on Psychology|volume=30|issue=6|publisher=American Psychological Association |first=Zak |last=Stambor|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun06/expectations.aspx |title=Lowered expectations|accessdate=11 July 2010|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Aronson was diagnosed with [[macular degeneration]] and, by 2003, had lost all of his central vision.&lt;ref name=mcnulty /&gt; To cope with his blindness, Aronson decided to get a guide dog, and applied at [[Guide Dogs for the Blind]] in 2010. In January 2011 he began a three-week training session with his new guide dog, Desilu, nicknamed Desi. He graduated from the program on February 12, 2011. He said, "They worked us 14 hours a day, until we were almost as smart as our dogs."&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/03/aronson-nominations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Aronson has written more than twenty books, including textbooks, popularizations and one book of children's fiction with his granddaughter Ruth Aronson. In 2010, Psychology Press published a book of essays and scholarly articles by his friends, colleagues, and former students celebrating his influence on their work: ''The Scientist and the Humanist: A Festschrift in Honor of Elliot Aronson.''

The '''Flying Start Challenge''' is a [[Competition|contest]] run by [[Aerospace]] businesses and organisations in the South West of England for local [[secondary schools]] to help develop science and [[engineering]] skills whilst highlighting the opportunities available in a career in engineering. Initiated by the Campaign to Promote Engineering, the Challenge is now entering its 12th year and still offers a great opportunity for schools to forge links with local industry. 

The sponsors are: [[Agusta Westland]], [[Airbus]], [[Atkins (company)|Atkins]], [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]], [[GKN Aerospace]], [[BAE]], [[MBDA]], [[Messier-Bugatti-Dowty]] and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]]. 

The Challenge is open to pupils in Years 7 to 9 who are organised into teams of 4 with the aim of "designing and building a hand-launched glider made from sustainable materials". Each team is supported by graduates, apprentices and trainees from the sponsor companies, with lessons on design, manufacture and testing, in addition to some practical advice on their glider designs.

Each team has the opportunity to fly their glider at a Regional Fly-off. Teams will be judged both on the distance flown and on a poster presentation detailing the design decisions made. Regional Fly-offs are held in Cheltenham, Bristol and Yeovil. 

The winning teams from the Regional Fly-Off progress to the Grand Final held at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at [[Yeovilton]]. The teams take part in a series of engineering challenges organised by the companies involved and compete to be named the best team. The winning team receive free glider flights with the winning school awarded a voucher for £1000 of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) equipment. Second place receives £500, third place £250.

'''The General Students Assembly''' is the supreme and sovereign body of the association of students in every university in [[Greece]]. It decides on every subject and exercises supervision and control over other institutions of the association. It is the supreme decision-making body of the Association (union of students), comprising all members of the club and take decisions by [[majority vote]] after an open [[debate]] on the issues. Every faculty has its own [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]], for example: General Student Assembly of the Faculty of History, General Student Assembly of the Faculty of Mathematics.

Many associations of students have a [[student council]] which is accountable to the general assembly and shall transfer to the [[academic administration|administration]] of the university its decisions and to prepare them.

The Administration of the Universities is obliged to consider every decision of the assemblies very seriously, as stated in the Law for the Functioning of Universities.

==History==

Student Unions and General Student Assemblies exist in every state university in Greece. The right to form such assemblies is guaranteed by the Law of the Universities in Greece, introduced in 1974, after the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]]. From this point on, a number of [[Civil and political rights|rights]] were given to the members of the academic community, in the spirit of [[democracy]] and freedom of expression, following the struggle against the military [[dictatorship]] in the preceding years. Since then, these associations have been leading the political activity of Greek students.

==Membership==

Every student that is registered in a university, is automatically a member of that university's Student Union and has the right to participate in assemblies.

In most of the cases, members of the Union (and therefore of the assemblies) cannot be students who:
:a) have large [[Public property|public property]]
:b) have [[Police|police status]]
:c) belong to Page semi-protected [[Fascism|fascistic]], anti-democratic organizations, cooperate with them or engage in similar activities within the university 
:d) have permanent [[Military|military status]]

==Responsibilities of the assembly==

Every university in the country has its own ''Statute of Student Union'', which describes how the union operates. Despite some minor differences, all statutes follow the same, basic directions of the functions of student assemblies:

# It has full control over the work of the Student Council
# It may discharge members from the Student Union
# It may decide on amendments to the Statute 
# It may decide on the dissolution of the Student Union
# It judges the actions of the Administration of Universities or of the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs|Ministry of Education]], proposes and demands for changes. It has the power to discuss and decide for every subject that refers to education and social life, as a whole

==Decision making==

The decisions of the assemblies are taken by majority after an open vote with raising of hands. The assembly and the decisions are not valid if less than one-third (1/3) of the students are present. In such cases, the council must announce another assembly in the next five days, with the same subjects. Then, the number of students present in this Assembly cannot be less than the one-fourth (1/4). If the number of students still isn't enough in the second attempt, the council must announce, for the third and final time, an Assembly in the next two to six  days, in which the decisions would be valid, regardless of attendance.

To take decisions on changing the “Statute of Student Union” or to dissolve the Union, an absolute majority of at least 50% of all members of the Union is required. Changing the goals of the Union requires consensus, not just voting.

The decisions of the General Assembly are absolutely mandatory for all students-members of the Union.

==Moderators==

In every Assembly, the students choose moderators in order to better organize the discussion. The moderators count the votes of the students and sign the official papers with the decisions at the end of every Assembly. They also have the responsibility to give a speaking opportunity, in succession, to anyone who asks for it, as well as to control the students who don’t respect the procedure. The moderators are the ones who declare the opening and closing of the General Student Assembly and they have the right to stop and dissolve any assembly that is too noisy and out of order.

==Frequency of the assemblies==

Regular General Student Assemblies are held after the decision of the student council twice in a school year. The choice of subjects that will be discussed is open to all the students.

Special General Student Assemblies are held for urgent and serious matters of the Union (in cases of rising student movements and protests, assemblies can be held every week). There are several ways to call a Special Assembly such as for the student council to decide it or the students to gather signatures from 1/10 of all the students in their faculty. In this case, the subject of the assembly must be concrete and the president of the student council is obliged to call for assembly no later than 3 days after the signatures are gathered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">'''Giuseppe Ferdinando Brivio''' (c. 1699, [[Milan]] &amp;ndash; c. 1758, Milan) was an Italian [[composer]], [[conducting|conductor]], [[violinist]], and [[vocal pedagogy|singing teacher]] who is chiefly known for his [[opera]]s.  His work displays a natural expression and uses figurations similar to that of [[Antonio Vivaldi]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

==Life and career==
He was born in Milan. The earliest record of Brivio was in a court document indicating his postition as a violinist at the [[Royal Palace of Milan]] in 1720. He soon after to become the music director at the Royal Palace's theatre where he remained until October 13, 1732.&lt;ref name="AO"/&gt; He later returned to the theater in c.1738 and remained active there through 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Il teatro a Milano nel Settecento - Volume 1|author=Annamaria Cascetta, Giovanna Zanlonghi|year=2008|page=528|publisher=[[Vita e pensiero (publishing)|Vita e pensiero]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Teatro Ducale his first known opera, ''Ipermestra'', premiered on 6 December 1727.&lt;ref name="AO"/&gt; While in Milan he also ran an influential school of singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Music and Musicians: (A.D. 1450-1889)|editor= Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland|publisher=[[Theodore Presser]]|year=1895|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his notable pupils were [[soprano]]s [[Giulia Frasi]] and [[Caterina Visconti (soprano)|Caterina Visconti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treatise on Vocal Performance and Ornamentation|author=Johann Adam Hiller|page=184|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brivio went on to write 5 more operas: ''L'Olimpiade'' (premiere 5 March 1737, [[Teatro Regio di Torino]]), ''Artaserse'' (premiere 2 June 1738, Teatro degli Obizzi di Padova), ''Merope'' (premiere 26 December 1738, Teatro Ducale di Milano),  and ''La Germania trionfante in Arminio'' (premiere 2 May 1739, Teatro Ducale di Milano). His music was also used in three [[Pasticcio]] mounted at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|the King's Theatre]], [[Haymarket, London]] during the 1740s, ''Gianguir'' (premiere 2 November 1742), ''Mandane'' (premiere 12 December 1742), and ''L'incostanza delusa'' (premiere 9 February 1745). The final stage work to use his music was another pasticcio, ''L'Olimpiade'', which premiered at the Teatro Marsigli-Rossi di Bologna on 10 May 1755.&lt;ref name="AO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amadeusonline.net/almanacco?r=&amp;alm_sett=&amp;alm_giorno=&amp;alm_mese=&amp;alm_anno=&amp;alm_testo=Giuseppe+Ferdinando+Brivio|title=Giuseppe Ferdinando Brivio|work=amadeusonline|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides opera, Brivio produced a small amount of instrumental music. One of his two known [[violin concerto]]s was included in a well known publication of Italian music by French parliamentarian [[Pierre Philibert de Blancheton]], alongside composers [[Angelo Maria Scaccia]] and [[Carlo Zuccari]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aeGayu9EMkMC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=%22Giuseppe+Ferdinando+Brivio%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kAXEVM3oMNWAsQTzsYGgAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Giuseppe%20Ferdinando%20Brivio%22&amp;f=false|title=The Italian Solo Concerto, 1700-1760: Rhetorical Strategies and Style History|author=Simon McVeigh and Jehoash Hirshberg|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|year=2004|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brivio died in Milan around 1758.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6772">The '''Global Assessment Certificate''' program (also known as the '''GAC''', /ʤi: eI  si:/, jee-ay-see) is a university preparation and foundation studies program that provides students from mostly non-English-speaking backgrounds with academic knowledge and skills to prepare them for western-style postsecondary study. It is owned and developed by ACT Education Solutions, Ltd. (AES),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acteducationsolutions.com&lt;/ref&gt; an international subsidiary of [[ACT, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.act.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAC is recognized for admissions and credit transfer purposes by more than 90 universities around the globe, including The University of Iowa,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uiowa.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://international.admissions.uiowa.edu/future-students/global-assessment-certificate-program&lt;/ref&gt; LIU Post,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liu.edu/CWPost/Admissions/International/Undergraduate/Start.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Idaho,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uidaho.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uidaho.edu/registrar/transfer/gac&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma State University,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.okstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://union.okstate.edu/iss/Documents/InternationalUndergraduateApplication.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Oregon University &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sou.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sou.edu//international/students/gac.html&lt;/ref&gt; (in the United States), Griffith University, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.griffith.edu.au/international&lt;/ref&gt; University Technology Sydney, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uts.edu.au/international&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.griffith.edu.au/college/admissions/academic-entry-requirements&lt;/ref&gt; Bond,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bond.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bond.edu.au/degrees-and-courses/application-enrolment/application/undergraduate/secondary-school-equivalence/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; La Trobe,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latrobe.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latrobemelbourne.edu.au/enrol-today/admissions-requirements&lt;/ref&gt; and RMIT &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmit.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Study%20at%20RMIT%2FInternational%2FEntry%20requirements%2FEnglish%20equivalency%20information/&lt;/ref&gt; (in Australia) for admissions purposes and is considered an alternative or addition to Year 12 for international students.

The GAC is licensed to teaching centers (known as ‘Approved Teaching Centers’ or ATCs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acteducationsolutions.com/en/aesl/atc.html&lt;/ref&gt;). The program is monitored and moderated by AES staff based at the organization’s regional offices in Shanghai, Jakarta and Singapore.&lt;ref name="media"&gt;http://media.act.org/documents/aes-act-brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently accredited.
==GAC course structure==

The GAC can be delivered full-time or part-time as a concurrent co-curriculum with the [[high school]] curriculum. The minimum requirements for delivery of the program are 720 hours of face-to-face instruction and 360 hours of independent study, half of which must be supervised. The program is continuously assessed and all assessments are moderated by ACT Education Solutions. 

'''Level I'''

Six mandatory modules with a total of 240 hours of face-to-face study, plus 120 hours independent study. Includes academic English, study skills, [[mathematics]], computing, and communication skills.

'''Level II'''

Two mandatory academic English modules, plus four of six specialization modules across the areas of business, computing, mathematics, science, psychology and social science. Electives in IELTS or TOEFL preparation are available.

'''Level III'''

Two mandatory academic English modules plus four of six specialization modules across the areas of business, computing, mathematics, science, psychology and social science. ACT Test preparation is also available.

==GAC GPA scale==

The GAC Grade Point Average (GPA) scale is based on a four-point scale with a passing grade of 55% (GPA 0.6). Grading criteria for each assessment are clearly stipulated in documentation provided to Approved Teaching Centers (ATCs) and teachers and directors of studies are trained by ACT Education Solutions, Limited's academic staff in the correct application of the grading criteria. All grades are finalized by ACT Education Solutions, Limited's academic staff prior to posting on ACT Education Solutions, Limited's secure online database, iTAP. Higher education institutions can verify GAC graduates' certificates and transcripts through the iTAP database.

Applying [[Mains electricity|line voltage]] across  a [[pickled cucumber]] causes it to glow. A moist pickle contains [[salt]] as a result of the [[pickling]] process, which allows it to conduct electricity. [[Sodium]] (or other) ions within the pickle emit light as a result of [[atomic electron transition]]s, although it is not clear why the luminescence occurs at one end of the pickle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|title=Martin Gardner's Science Magic: Tricks and Puzzles|publisher=Courier Corporation,|isbn=0486152901|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6gCPwPCudgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The first public seawater aquarium in Vienna was opened in 1860 by [[Gustav Jäger (naturalist)|Gustav Jäger]]. Jäger's aquarium, like its contemporaries, relied on regular delivery of natural seawater. It became a reality in 1854 with the construction of the [[Semmering railway]] linking Vienna with the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]].&lt;ref name=B104&gt;Brunner, Brendt (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AL2B_GXLfsAC The ocean at home: an illustrated history of the aquarium]''. Princeton Architectural Press. {{ISBN|1-56898-502-9}}. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of experimenting with small seawater tanks Jäger built a large aquarium for public display. He described the feelings of contemporary people who faced the unknown submarine world: "The first-time visitor ... cannot contain his inner excitement. His curiosity is so great that he can hardly enjoy the moment: I am sorry, but he looks so helpless, as if he has suddenly found himself among people whose language he neither speaks nor understands."&lt;ref name=B7&gt;Brunner, Brendt (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AL2B_GXLfsAC The ocean at home: an illustrated history of the aquarium]''. Princeton Architectural Press. {{ISBN|1-56898-502-9}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors sought new experience, but resisted believing what they saw behind the glass. The aquarium was a financial loss, and Jäger had to close it after four years of operation.&lt;ref name=B104/&gt;

The concrete tower housing the present-day aquarium was erected as a [[Flak tower#Flak tower design iterations|fire control flak tower]] in ten months between October 1943 and July 1944.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt; The tower is {{Convert|47|m|sp=us}} tall, with a footprint of {{Convert|31|by|15|m|sp=us}}, and its gross volume, including extensive foundations, reaches {{Convert|55000|m3|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=FL/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; In 1944 it was crowned with a [[Würzburg radar]] dome. In case of imminent air raid threat, the radar could be lowered into a concrete shaft with {{Convert|3.5|m|sing=on|sp=us}} thick concrete walls.&lt;ref name=FL&gt;''[http://www.haus-des-meeres.at/de/Flakturm.html Flakturm (in German)]''. Haus des Meeres. Retrieved 2010-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The subordinate gun battery tower is located inside a city block north of Mariahilfer Straße. The two towers operated as a single combat unit, in cooperation with two other pairs of flak towers built in [[Augarten]] (north) and in [[Arenberg Park]] (south-east).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Owing to prohibitively high costs of demolition, all six Viennese flak towers stand to date. As of 2009, demolition cost estimates start at 100 million Euro for each tower. - ''[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/468046/index.do?from=suche.intern.portal NS-Gedenkstätte im Flakturm (in German)]. Die Presse. April 5, 2009 (printed edition: April 7). Retrieved 2010-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the tower in Esterhazy Park was temporarily used as a hotel with 38 rooms in a [[bunker]], and then converted to a fire station.&lt;ref name=CO&gt;''[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/538363/index.do?from=suche.intern.portal Wofür die Flaktürme heute verwendet werden (in German)]''.

==History==

[[File:Haus des Meeres Feb2008.jpg|thumb|right|The gravel which lines the bottom of new fish tanks was recycled from concrete rubble.]]
In the 1960s the underground part of the bunker was used as a youth hostel, named Stadtherberge Esterhazypark.

Volunteers moved into the flak tower in November 1957. The ground floor and the bunkers were then occupied by the firefighters, which left only one and half habitable floors for the exhibition. The rest of the tower was filled with debris and open to the elements. Step by step, the aquarium expanded over the empty floors. Eventually, when the aquarium expanded to six floors, the firefighters left the buildings, and the aquarium staff was at last allowed to clear the basement of war relics.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

In 1991 the building was crowned with a lightweight wraparound box with the slogan ''Smashed to Pieces .. In the Still of the Night'' (in English and German), a memorial against war and fascism designed by [[Lawrence Weiner]]. Eventually it became an obstacle to the expansion plans. The city authorities divided whether Weiner's work was a disposable billboard or a piece of artistic heritage,&lt;ref name=M1/&gt; but by 2005 the latter viewpoint prevailed and the city picked up its maintenance costs.&lt;ref name=F3/&gt; The old elevator, installed in 1944, operated without failure until 1997. It was replaced during an extensive renovation that enabled opening of three new floors (7, 8 and 9). The glass wings which house the reptiles and tropical birds, were added in 2000 and 2007. As of 2010, the tower houses ten habitable above-ground floors plus an open sightseeing roof deck.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;''[http://www.haus-des-meeres.at/de/Flakturm/HdM-im-Flakturm12.html Das Haus des Meeres im "Flakturm"]''. Haus des Meeres. Retrieved 2010-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth floor, which recreates a flak turm control vault, houses World War Two exhibits and is open only on weekends, with advance registration of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.haus-des-meeres.at/de/Flakturm/Flakturmausstellung.html Erinnern im Innern (in German)]''.

==Expansion plans==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=March 2013}}
Further expansion and ownership of the tower is a controversial matter. The property is owned by the City of Vienna, which pays for the maintenance costs, and is determined to get rid of the financial burden. In 2008 the City proposed selling the tower to an outside investor and approved plans to build a private hotel on top of the flak tower. The plans were vocally opposed by the residents of Mariahilf. The Haus des Meeres itself wanted to retain future upward expansion rights. They proposed building three new exhibition space floors inside an all-glass capsule shaped like a [[manta ray]]. As of 2010, both these projects were canceled.&lt;ref name=CO/&gt; The Haus des Meeres received a vote of confidence from local residents&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to local [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]], the poll collected 2271 votes out of 8297 eligible residents, a record turnout for such polls. - ''[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/475513/index.do?from=suche.intern.portal Ausbaupläne: Dinieren auf dem Flakturm (in German)]''.

The six million Euro expansion project, scheduled for 2011, will add a million-liter fish tank and an open-air restaurant. The city officials are willing to consider the sale of the building to the Haus des Meeres, on condition that the new owner preserves Weiner's artwork and picks up the maintenance bill from the taxpayers.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;''[http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/wien/538202/index.do?from=suche.intern.portal "Haus des Meeres" muss ohne Riesenmanta auskommen (in German)]''.

'''Institute of Sindhology''' ({{lang-sd|'''سنڌولوجي'''}}) is one of the major resources on the history of [[Sindh]]. It was the first research institution of its kind, and brought [[Sindhology]] to the forefront of international research.&lt;ref&gt;University of Sind (1977). Vol. 1-9&lt;/ref&gt; Sindhology is referred to as knowledge ''about'' Sindh. The history and culture of Sindh has been shaped by the ''[[Indus river]]''.  The lifeline of Sindh, brings minerals and soil from the [[Himalayas]] to the region and flows into the [[Arabian Sea]] at the [[Indus River Delta]] located in Sindh. These factors define the scope of Sindhology: the study of [[antiquities]], the [[relic]]s, the [[history]], and the [[culture]] both of ancient and modern Sindh, with particular reference to Sindhi [[society]] and [[Sindhi literature|literature]]. The institute provides a repository of this knowledge in the form of a research-oriented center of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for promoting Sindhi culture, literature|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1208466|accessdate=1 July 2016|agency=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DWAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the institute goes back to the establishment of the [[Sindhi Academy]] in 1962 by the [[University of Sindh]]. The objective was to develop a facility to archive books, manuscripts, and research papers from past and present. Another objective was to promote and publish research about Sindh in the [[Sindhi language]] in addition to other languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. The research was to be promoted in all [[List of universities in Pakistan|Pakistani universities]].&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also the first time when Sindhology and its scholars were given well-deserved international attention.

In 1964, the nomenclature and the status of the Sindhi Academy were changed to the '''Institute of Sindhology''' to work on the similar patterns of [[Indology]] and [[Egyptology]]. The institute was to encourage further historical research on the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] as well as contemporary living in Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;Allana (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was provided with a small room at the old campus of [[Sindh University]] in [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. On 10 December 1972 the [[foundation stone]] of the new building was laid just off the [[Super Highway]] in [[Jamshoro]], adjacent to Indus river. The three-storey building, located 12 kilometers from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] and 150&amp;nbsp;km from [[Karachi]] was inaugurated in 1978. The construction is an amalgamation of the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]] architectures. Internally, the building is decorated with local [[Hala, Sindh|Hala]] tile-work, with two arms accommodating the Research Library and Administration Block. The central dome houses the Anthropological Research Centre (Museum), [[Art Gallery]], Film and Photographic Sections and Audio-visual Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People of the books|url=http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153067|accessdate=1 July 2016|agency=Herald|issue=DAwn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 International children’s films festival was held in Sindhology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International children’s films festival opens in Jamshoro|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1162561|accessdate=1 July 2016|agency=dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, an extension was built in celebration of the institute's Silver Jubilee to house the Bookshop facilities. Over the years, institute has transformed itself into one of the leading [[List of Research Institutes in Pakistan|research institutes]] in [[Pakistan]].

==Research==
Being affiliated with an academic institution ([[University of Sindh|Sindh University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Need to develop youths’ interest in Sindhi short stories stressed|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1158270|accessdate=1 July 2016|agency=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the institute contributes to the [[scientific research]] and academic studies in the subject of [[Sindhology]]. The first major initiative to bring he subject to international attention was a series of surveys to identify the sites of major anthropological and archaeological research across the province, carried out in cooperation with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] between 1967-71. There were also cooperations with [[UNESCO]] to explore the Sindhology aspects of the major Indus valley Civilization sites across Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;World Sindhi Congress (2005). [http://world-sindhi-congress.org/index.php?content=archeology Sindhi Academic Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404150206/http://world-sindhi-congress.org/index.php?content=archeology |date=2008-04-04 }}. Retrieved on 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Research and academic scope of the institute have broadened since then. These and many other subsequent research contributions of the institute brought it to the list of internationally recognised research centres of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gill and Smith (1982). p. 663&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sindhology 2.jpg|thumb|left|A mannequin depicting domestic life in a Sindhi village]] --&gt;
Within the institute, the Anthropological Research Center and Sindh Arts Gallery is responsible for the maintenance of the museum. The centre provides attractions both for research scholars and general public. Artifacts on display in the museum represent the history and demography of the region. The collections contain [[archaeological]] material, [[wood-work]], thread-work, [[metal-work]], leather-work, [[pottery]], [[jewellery]], [[coins]], [[armaments]], [[photograph]]s, and [[painting]]s that have been collected since the 1970s.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sindhology 3.jpg|thumb|Ancient artefacts in the museum]] --&gt;
The museum space has been divided into various sections named as general, coins, archaeological, ethnological, ethno-musical, photographic, and Indus-painting galleries respectively. There is a special gallery devoted to prominent personalities that contains portraits of more than 175 eminent writers, scholars, educationists, social workers, Philanthropists, politicians, lawyers, freedom fighters, spiritual leaders and public figures. Special corners are devoted for people such as [[Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Allama I.I. Kazi]], Hassan Ali Affendi, Pir Hussamuddin Rashdi, Syed Gulam Mustafa Shah, [[Muhammad Usman Diplai]], and [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. There are also and specific galleries for [[Benazir Bhutto]] and N.A Baloch, as well as Mir Talpur's Court.

Prominent artefacts include the [[Pump organ|harmonium]] on which [[Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla]] composed the [[Qaumi Tarana|National Anthem]] of Pakistan; the first Sindhi Typewriter, manufactured in 1926; and the statue of Rai Bahadur Odhoudas Chhabria, founder of Odhoudas Hospital of [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sindhology Music.jpg|thumb|A typical Sindhi music instrument]] --&gt;

The work is ongoing for the collection, preservation and conservation of anthropological, historical and cultural objects and specimen. Field surveys are also conducted in villages and remote areas of Sindh to access the rare articles.

===Music gallery===
The ethno-musical gallery comprises sections on performing arts, sounds, and films.

Sindhi music with its original form and rhythm has withstood the test of time. Especially, the Sindhi folk tunes continue to enrich the traditions and customs of the people of rural areas and attracts the attention of urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspects makes the Sindhi music research and preservation an integral part of the regional cultural heritage. Hence, the Institute of Sindhology has devised innovative ways to preserve this.&lt;ref&gt;Allana (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The special unit of the institute visits remote villages, recording the various items of [[Sindhi music]], [[folklore]], folk tales and tunes played on local musical instruments. The collection has been gradually growing, and is made available on tapes and cassettes in its original form and shape.

==Library==
The institute boasts a [[research library]] with many corners named after prominent Sindhi scholars. The Research section of the library continues to archive and document the regional heritage. The work started with compilation and publication of catalogues, bibliographies, directories and periodical literature. This resulted in the [[wikt:development|development]] of a directory of Sindhi writers; a source book on prominent personalities of Sindh; and, a bibliography of [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] books. The library archives have served as primary sources for many of the prominent publications on [[Sindhi people|Sindhi culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbas and Fernea (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sindhology Publication.jpg|thumb|Book published by Sindhology on [[Aror]] Archaeological site]] --&gt;
As the institute is mainly concerned with the culture and civilization of Sindh through the ages, a special Bureau of Production, Publication and Translation has been set up to highlight significant achievements through publications. More than 185 books have been published in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]], [[Arabic]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] languages. The publication of research work keeps special focus on various aspects of [[Sindh]]. There are also two Bi-annual journals in published in English and Sindhi languages under the titles of ''Sindhological Studies'' and ''Sindhi Adab'' ([[Sindhi literature]]) respectively. Some of the major publications are:
* ''Sindhi lekhkan–ji Directory'' - 1974, (A directory of the writers of Sindhi Language).
* ''Chapial Sindhi Kitaban–ji Bibliography'' - 1947-1973'' - 1976. (A bibliography of Sindhi Books published during 1947-1973).

==History==
The Intercultural Open University Foundation was established in 1981 by Jan R. Hakemulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inst.at/studies/s_0304_e.htm | title=Introduction to the Intercultural Open University|publisher=Internationale Kulturwissenschaften International Cultural Studies Etudes culturelles internationales | accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as an educational advisor with UNESCO in [[Africa]], Jan and his wife Fay A.C. DeJonge, convened a meeting of Dutch, German and English professors at Bosk House in [[Opeinde]], Netherlands. After this meeting, the group decided to provide distributed educational programs focused on the social subjects to students around the world, the Intercultural Open University Foundation was the result.&lt;ref name="Skepsis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepsis.nl/iou.html | title=De Universiteit van Opeinde | publisher=Skepter | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Nanninga, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation was the subject of controversy when John Bear, a writer on educational institutions, questioned its status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning | publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] | author=Bear, Mariah | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-58008-431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also came under attack in 2008 when [[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|CIMEA]], the Italian Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence, claimed it had "dubious professors with dubious credentials that somehow (connected it) to UNESCO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf | title=Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions | publisher=[[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|CIMEA]] | accessdate=30 June 2014 | author=Lantero, Luca | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513185433/http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf | archivedate=13 May 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CIMEA subsequently posted a letter from the Foundation's President, Board of Governors and Faculty protesting the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cimea.it/default.aspx?IDC=2621 | title=Intercultural Open University Foundation Letter to CIMEA Administration | publisher=[[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|CIMEA]] | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031734/http://www.cimea.it/default.aspx?IDC=2621 | archivedate=6 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Skepsis, a Dutch magazine which aims to debunk pseudoscience, published an article stating that the founders of the Intercultural Open University Foundation held PhD degrees from distance learning institutions. The article also stated that the Foundation awarded degrees in India for about 250 Euros while charging 8000 Euros for students from developed countries as a part of the "Robin Hood strategy: what the rich pay too much, is given to the less fortunate." by the Hakemulders. The author stated that he doubted that the professors of the IOUF could legally bear the legally protected  Dutch title doctor (dr.).&lt;ref name="Skepsis" /&gt;

IOUF Founder and President Jan Hakemulder died in August, 2008. After his death, the IOUF Board of Governors appointed Sandra Hurlong as the interim President of the Foundation. From the estate of Jan Hakemulder, an endowment was established to fund the institution. In August 2009, the IOUF announced Dr. Hurlong as the appointed President. Under her direction, the Foundation shifted its focus to graduate dual degrees programs exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ioufoundation.org/index.php/component/content/article/46-iou-news/118-dr-sandra-hurlong-appointed-president-of-the-intercultural-open-university-foundationdr-sandra-hurlong-appointed-president-of-the-intercultural-open-university-foundation | title=Dr. Sandra Hurlong Appointed President of the Intercultural Open University Foundation | publisher=Intercultural Open University Foundation | date=20 April 2009 | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humiliationstudies.org/whoweare/board.php | title=Global Advisory Board - Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies | publisher=[[Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies]] | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, IOUF signed an academic co-operation agreement with the Universidad Azteca (UAzteca).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/m_nw.pdf#Mexico | title=International Association of Universities recognized universities list | publisher=[[International Association of Universities]] | accessdate=30 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209091432/http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/m_nw.pdf#Mexico | archivedate=9 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.universidadazteca.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/official_translation_SEP_letter_en.244182621.pdf | title=Recognition of Studies' Validity for Universidad Azteca from the Mexican Ministry of Public Education | publisher=Mexican Ministry of Public Education | date=27 May 2009 | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nl.gob.mx/?P=scoe_op_nac_mexico | title=Universidades de Estado De México | publisher=Nuevo Leon Unido | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the agreement upon successful completion of the program, IOUF PhD students will be awarded an international double degree offered jointly by the Universidad Azteca and its partner, the Universidad Central de Nicaragua (UCN).&lt;ref name="Universidad Azteca" /&gt;

The '''Jagiellonian University''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Uniwersytet Jagielloński''; [[Latin]]: ''Universitas Iagellonica Cracoviensis'', also known as the '''University of Kraków''') is a research university in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]].

Founded in 1364 by [[Casimir III the Great]], the Jagiellonian University is the oldest university in Poland, the second oldest university in [[Central Europe]], and one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest surviving universities in the world]]. Notable alumni include, among others, mathematician and astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], poet [[Jan Kochanowski]], Polish king [[John III Sobieski]], constitutional reformer [[Hugo Kołłątaj]], chemist [[Karol Olszewski]], anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]], writer [[Stanisław Lem]] and the President of Poland [[Andrzej Duda]]. Among its students who did not earn a diploma were also Karol Wojtyła, future [[Pope John Paul II]] (studying Polish philology for one year), and [[Nobel laureates|Nobel]] laureates [[Ivo Andrić]] and [[Wisława Szymborska]].

The [[campus]] of the Jagiellonian University is centrally located within the [[Kraków|city of Kraków]]. The university consists of fifteen faculties, including the humanities, law, the natural and social sciences, and medicine. The university employs roughly 4,000 academics, and has more than 40,000 students who study in some 80 disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/overview|title=Overview – UJ|website=www.en.uj.edu.pl|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of the student body are women. The language of instruction is usually [[Polish language|Polish]], although several degrees are offered in either [[German language|German]] or [[English language|English]]. The university library is one of Poland's largest, and houses several medieval manuscripts, including Copernicus' [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']].

Due to its history, the Jagiellonian University is traditionally considered Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning, this standing equally being reflected in international rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/europe/poland/guide|title=Study in Poland|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=Top Universities|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/jagiellonian-university|title=Jagiellonian University|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jagiellonian University is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] and [[Europaeum]].

In 2018, ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' ranked the university within the 601–800 band globally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking World University Rankings 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding the university===
[[File:Założenie Szkoły Głównej przeniesieniem do Krakowa ugruntowane (Matejko UJ).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The founding of the University in 1364, painted by [[Jan Matejko]] (1838–1893).]]
In the mid-14th century, [[Kazimierz III the Great|King Casimir III the Great]] realised that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in [[Poland]] were rewarded when [[Pope Urban V]] granted him permission to set up a university in Kraków. A [[royal charter]] of foundation was issued on 12 May 1364, and a simultaneous document was issued by the City Council granting privileges to the ''[[Studium Generale]]''. The [[King of Poland|King]] provided funding for one chair in [[liberal arts]], two in Medicine, three in [[Canon Law]] and five in [[Roman Law]], funded by a quarterly payment taken from the proceeds of the royal monopoly on the salt mines at [[Wieliczka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Davies|title=God's Playground; A History of Poland, Vol. I: The Origins to 1795|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-231-05351-8|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the University of Kraków stalled upon the death of [[Kazimierz III Wielki|King Casimir]], its founder, and lectures were held in various places across the city, including, amongst others, in professors' houses, churches and in the cathedral school on the Wawel Hill. It is believed that, in all likelihood, the construction of a building to house the ''Studium Generale'' began on Plac Wolnica in what is today the district of Kazimierz.

After a period of disinterest and lack of funds, the institution was restored in the 1390s by [[Jogaila|King Władysław II Jagiełło]] and his wife [[Jadwiga of Poland|Saint Hedwig]], the daughter of King Louis of [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. The royal couple decided that, instead of building new premises for the university, it would be better to buy an existing edifice; it was thus that a building on Żydowska Street, which had previously been the property of the Pęcherz family, was found and acquired in 1399. The Queen donated all of her personal [[jewelry]] to the university, allowing it to enroll 203 students. The faculties of astronomy, law and theology attracted eminent scholars: for example, [[John Cantius]], [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]], [[Paweł Włodkowic]], [[Jan of Głogów]], and [[Albert Brudzewski]], who from 1491 to 1495 was one of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' teachers. The university was the first university in Europe to establish independent chairs in [[Mathematics]] and [[Astronomy]]. This rapid expansion in the university's faculty necessitated the purchase of larger premises in which to house them; it was thus that the building known today as the ''Collegium Maius'', with its quadrangle and beautiful arcade, came into being towards the beginning of the 15th century. The ''Collegium Maius''' qualities, many of which directly contributed to the sheltered, academic atmosphere at the university, became widely respected, helping the university establish its reputation as a place of learning in [[Central Europe]].

===Golden age of the Renaissance===
[[File:Kraków.Uniwersytet Jagielloński.Collegium Maius.Aula Jagiellońska.jpg|left|thumb|The main assembly hall of the university's ''Collegium Maius'']]
For several centuries, virtually the entire intellectual elite of Poland were educated at the university,&lt;ref&gt;source needed&lt;/ref&gt; where they enjoyed particular royal favour, often being provided with game from the royal hunt to satisfy their needs at mealtime. Whilst it was, and largely remains, Polish students who make up the greater part of the university's student body, it has, over its long history, educated thousands of foreign students from countries such as [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]]. During the second half of the 15th century, over 40 percent of students came from outside the [[Kingdom of Poland]].

[[File:Kraków - Collegium Iuridicum - Brama 01.JPG|upright|thumb|The main baroque entrance to the university's ''Collegium Iuridicum'']]
The first chancellor of the University was [[Piotr Wysz]], and the first professors were [[Czech people|Czech]]s, [[German people|Germans]] and Poles, many of them trained at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] in [[Bohemia]]. By 1520 Greek philology was introduced by Constanzo Claretti and Wenzel von Hirschberg; [[Hebrew]] was also taught. At this time, the ''Collegium Maius'' comprised seven reading rooms, six of which were named for the great ancient scholars: Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Galen, Ptolemy and Pythagoras. Furthermore, it was during this period that the faculties of Law, Medicine, Theology and Philosophy were established in their own premises; two of these buildings, the ''Collegium Iuridicum'' and ''Collegium Minus'', survive to this day. The golden era of the University of Kraków took place during the [[Polish Renaissance]], between 1500 and 1535, when it was attended by 3,215 students in the first decade of the 16th century, and it was in these early years that the foundations for the [[Jagiellonian Library]] were set, with the addition of a library floor to the ''Collegium Maius''. The library's original rooms, in which all books were chained to their cases in order to prevent theft, are no longer used as such. However, they are still occasionally opened to host visiting lecturers' talks.

As the university's popularity, along with that of the ever more provincial Kraków's, declined in later centuries, the number of students attending the university also fell and, as such, the attendance record set in the early 16th century was not again surpassed until the late 18th century. This phenomenon was recorded as part of a more general economic and political decline seen in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was suffering from the effects of poor governance and the policies of hostile neighbours at the time. In fact, despite a number of expansion projects during the late 18th century, many of the university's buildings had fallen into disrepair and were being used for a range of other purposes; in the university's archives there is one entry which reads: 'Nobody lives in the building, nothing happens there. If the lecture halls underwent refurbishment they could be rented out to accommodate a laundry'. This period thus represents one of the darkest periods in the university's history and is almost certainly the one during which the closure of the institution seemed most imminent.

===Decline and near closure after the partitions===

After the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]] in 1795 and the ensuing [[Napoleonic Wars]], Kraków became a [[Free City of Kraków|free city]] under the protection of the [[Austrian Empire]]; this, however, was not to last long. In 1846, after the [[Kraków Uprising]], the city and its university became part of the [[Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref name="officialhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/uniwersytet/historia|title=History|last=Waltos|first=Stanisław|publisher=Jagiellonian University|accessdate=2010-09-28}} &amp;nbsp;{{Pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrians were in many ways hostile to the institution and, soon after their arrival, removed many of the furnishings from the ''Collegium Maius''' ''Auditorium Maximum'' in order to convert it into a grain store. However, the threat of closure of the University was ultimately dissipated by ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Ferdinand I of Austria]]'s decree to maintain it. By the 1870s the fortunes of the university had improved so greatly that many scholars had returned. The liquefaction of nitrogen and oxygen was successfully demonstrated by professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski in 1883. Thereafter the Austrian authorities took on a new role in the development of the university and provided funds for the construction of a number of new buildings, including the neo-gothic ''[[Collegium Novum]]'', which opened in 1887.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; It was, conversely, from this building that in 1918 a large painting of ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was removed and [[Iconoclasm|destroyed]] by Polish students advocating the reestablishment of an independent Polish state.

[[File:BASA-1771K-1-1163-32-Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.jpeg|thumb|The university around 1930|left]]
For the 500th anniversary of the university's foundation, a monument to [[Copernicus]] was placed in the quadrangle of the ''Collegium Maius''; this statue is now to be found in the direct vicinity of the ''Collegium Novum'', outside the ''Collegium Witkowskiego'', to where it was moved in 1953. Nevertheless, it was in the Grzegórzecka and the Kopernika areas that much of the university’s expansion took place up to 1918; during this time the ''Collegium Medicum'' was relocated to a site just east of the centre, and was expanded with the addition of a number of modern teaching hospitals – this 'medical campus' remains to this day. By the late 1930s the number of students at the university had increased dramatically to almost six thousand. Now a major centre for education in the independent [[Republic of Poland]], the university attained government support for the purchase of building plots for new premises, as a result of which a number of residencies were built for students and professors alike. However, of all the projects begun during this era, the most important would have to be the creation of the Jagiellonian Library. The library's monumental building, construction of which began in 1931, was finally completed towards the end of the interwar period, which allowed the university's many varied literary collections to be relocated to their new home by the outbreak of war in 1939.

===Modern era===

On November 6, 1939, following the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]], 184 professors were arrested and deported to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] during an operation codenamed ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]''. The university, along with the rest of Poland's higher and secondary education, was closed for the remainder of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="pp2bio"&gt;{{cite book | last = Weigel|first=George |title = Witness of Hope – The Biography of Pope John Paul II | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2001|isbn=978-0-06-018793-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the university's reopening after the cessation of hostilities in 1945, the new government of Poland was hostile to the teachings of the pre-war university and the faculty was suppressed by the [[Communist Poland|Communists]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="pp2bio"/&gt; By 1957 the Polish government decided that it would invest in the establishment of new facilities near [[Jordan Park]] and expansion of other smaller existing facilities. Sadly, as was typical for the period, construction work proved slow and many of the stated goals were never achieved; it was this poor management and disregard for the university's future that eventually led a number of scholars to openly criticise the government for its apparent lack of interest in educational development. On the other hand, a number of new buildings, such as the ''Collegium Biologicum'', were built with funds from the legacy of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]].

By 1991 Poland had thrown off its Communist government and in that same year the Jagiellonian University successfully completed the purchase of its first building plot in [[Pychowice]], Kraków, where, from 2000, construction of a new complex of university buildings, the so-called Third Campus, began; its completion is currently planned for 2015. The new campus, officially named the '600th Anniversary Campus', is being developed hand in hand with the new LifeScience Park, which is managed by the Jagiellonian Centre for Innovation, the university's research consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/en/rozwoj/kampus|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public funds earmarked for the project amounted to 946.5&amp;nbsp;million [[zloty]]s, or 240&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name=ThirdCampus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kampus.uj.edu.pl/|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004 has proved instrumental in improving the fortunes of the Jagiellonian University, which has seen huge increases in funding from both central government and European authorities, allowing it to develop new departments, research centres and better support the work of its students and academics.

===International partnerships===
The Jagiellonian University maintains an academic partnership with [[Heidelberg University]], Germany's oldest university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/international/profil/partneruniversitaeten.html|title=Partneruniversitäten  – International – Universität Heidelberg|last=Watzke|first=Christian|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there are close ties between both Heidelberg's and Kraków's law schools. In conjunction with Heidelberg and [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]], the Jagiellonian University offers specializations in German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uj.edu.pl/~spn/?lang=pl|title=Schule des Deutschen Rechts —|website=www.law.uj.edu.pl|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[English-speaking world]], the Jagiellonian University has international partnerships, among others, with the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. In the French-speaking world, partners include the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[University of Montpellier]]. Other cooperation agreements exist with [[Charles University Prague]], the [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Saint Petersburg State University]], the [[Technical University of Munich]], and the [[Free University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwm.uj.edu.pl/documents/1333512/107230959/bilateral_agreements_list_30_December_2016.xlsx/7dba3d50-cbd2-47f4-ba5b-fbd987938e0f |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105175706/http://www.dwm.uj.edu.pl/documents/1333512/107230959/bilateral_agreements_list_30_December_2016.xlsx/7dba3d50-cbd2-47f4-ba5b-fbd987938e0f |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwm.uj.edu.pl/o-dziale |title=O Dziale – Dział Współpracy Międzynarodowej Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego |publisher=Dwm.uj.edu.pl |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's main library, the [[Jagiellonian Library]] (''Biblioteka Jagiellońska''), is one of Poland's largest, with almost 6.5&amp;nbsp;million volumes; it is a constituent of the Polish National Libraries system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/18320 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110613151435/http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/18320 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 June 2011 |first=Teresa |last=Bętkowska |title=Jagiellonian University: Cracow's Alma Mater |newspaper=Warsaw Voice |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is home to a world-renowned collection of [[medieval]] manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bj.uj.edu.pl/bjmanus/manus_e.html |title=BJ: Medieval manuscripts |publisher=Bj.uj.edu.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110651/http://www.bj.uj.edu.pl/bjmanus/manus_e.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus']] [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']] and the ''[[Balthasar Behem Codex]]''. The library also has an extensive collection of underground political literature (so-called ''drugi obieg'' or ''[[samizdat]]'') from [[Communist Poland|Poland's period of Communist rule]] between 1945 and 1989.

The beginning of the Jagiellonian Library is traditionally considered the same as that of the entire university – in 1364;&lt;ref name="ColCa"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/bulletin/015017-9903-04-e.html Visiting the Biblioteka Jagiellonska (Jagiellonian Library) in Cracow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908230448/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/bulletin/015017-9903-04-e.html |date=2005-09-08 }}. Last accessed on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; however, instead of having one central library it had several smaller branches at buildings of various departments (the largest collection was in ''[[Collegium Maius]]'', where works related to [[theology]] and [[liberal arts]] were kept). After 1775, during the reforms of [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]], which established the first [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education in the world, various small libraries of the University were formally centralised into one public collection in ''Collegium Maius''. During the [[partitions of Poland]], the library continued to grow thanks to the support of such people as [[Karol Józef Teofil Estreicher]] and [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]]. Its collections were made public in 1812. Since 1932, it has been recognised as a [[legal deposit]] library, comparable to the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University Library]] or [[Trinity College Library]] in [[Dublin]], and thus has the right to receive a copy of any book issued by Polish publishers within Poland. In 1940, the library finally obtained a new building of its own, which has subsequently been expanded on two occasions, most recently in 1995–2001. During the [[Second World War]], library workers cooperated with [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground universities]]. Since the 1990s, the library's collection has become increasingly digitised.

In addition to the Jagiellonian Library, the university maintains a large medical library (''Biblioteka Medyczna'') and many other subject specialised libraries in its various faculties and institutes. Finally, the collections of the university libraries' collections are enriched by the presence of the university's archives, which date back to the university's own foundation and record the entire history of its development up to the present day.

==Student associations==
In 1851, the university's first student scientific association was founded. Now, over 70 student scientific associations exist at the Jagiellonian University. Usually, their purpose is to promote students' scientific achievements by organizing lecture sessions, science [[excursion]]s, and international student conferences, such as the International Workshop for Young Mathematicians, which is organized by the [[Stanisław Zaremba (mathematician)|Zaremba]] Association of Mathematicians.

'''Lunch lady''' is an [[American English|American term]] for a woman who cooks and serves food in a school cafeteria. The equivalent [[British English]] term is "'''dinner lady'''" and is sometimes called a '''cafeteria lady'''. Sometimes, a lunch lady also patrols the school playgrounds during the lunch breaks to help maintain order.

==Notable examples==

She does not like any changes to the cafeteria's good meat-based lunch menu and she can also control food (namely meat), to the point of forming it 100% all around herself as a giant evil meat monster.
* In the series ''[[Johnny Test]]'', one of Johnny's enemies is a lunch lady. This lunch lady has greenish skin and speaks in a German accent. She can be very cruel when students don't eat her disgusting (albeit sometimes healthy) food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">'''MITx''' is the [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  A constituent program of MIT’s Office of Digital Learning, MITx produces MOOCs from MIT departments and faculty that appear on the [[edX]] platform.  MITx also supports residential experiments with scalable learning technologies and research on digital learning.  MOOCs offered through edX by MITx are open-enrollment and free to take.  In September 2012, edX and MITx introduced the option to receive an ID verified certificate on some courses.

==History==

The MITx program was announced on December 19, 2011 and originally included three components: 1) development and offering of massive open online courses, 2) research on the effectiveness of emerging digital learning tools, and 3) the development of an open source platform for offering massive open online courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-education-initiative-1219.html MIT press release, Dec. 19 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial course and platform development for MITx was undertaken under the direction of Professor [[Anant Agarwal]] in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL).

On May 3, 2012, the open platform component was spun off into [[edX]], a non-profit co-owned by MIT and Harvard and charged with platform development and the creation of a consortium of leading institutions offering MOOCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/mit-harvard-edx-announcement-050212.html MIT press release, May 5 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Agarwal was named the first president of edX.

On November 20, 2012, the MITx program was placed organizationally within the newly created MIT Office of Digital Learning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/sanjay-sarma-director-of-digital-learning-1120.html MIT press release, Nov. 20 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; which would also eventually include three other MIT organizations: [[MIT OpenCourseWare]], the Office of Educational Innovation and Technology, and Academic Media Production Services.  Materials Science professor [[Sanjay Sarma]] was named MIT’s Director of Digital Learning and Computer Science professor Isaac Chuang was named Associate Director of Digital Learning.

==Courses and programs offered==

=== X-Series ===
MITx has one of the largest offerings of MOOCs through the [[edX]] platform.  On September 17, 2013, MITx announced the first of its XSeries Certificate programs, which offer recognition for the completion of a series of related MOOC courses.  Current XSeries include [[Supply chain management|Supply Chain Management]], Education Technology and Aerodynamics.  

=== MicroMasters ===
In 2016, MITx launched a new [[MicroMasters|Micromasters]] credential in Supply Chain Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.mit.edu/micromasters Micromaster's credential in Supply Chain Management]&lt;/ref&gt;  The MicroMasters in Supply Chain from MIT is an advanced, professional, graduate-level foundation in Supply Chain Management. It represents the equivalent of 1 semester's worth of coursework at MIT. To earn a Micromaster's credential, learners must complete a sequence of 5 MOOCs, followed by a comprehensive capstone exam.

'''Miguel Eduardo "Micky" Vila Luna''' (July 7, 1943 – April 1, 2005) was an architect and painter from the [[Dominican Republic]]. Miguel Vila Luna was born in [[Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic]] on July 7, 1943. His parents were [[Ramón Vila Piola]] &lt;ref&gt;"Cápsulas genealógicasDe Santiago a Santiago: los Vila." Hoy Digital. N.p., 12 June 2010.

"Instituto Dominicano de Genealoga, Inc." Instituto Dominicano de Genealoga, Inc. N.p., 12 June 2010. Web. http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/junio2010/junio201012.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Vila was an individual linked to design, to aspects of decorative comfort, to pictorial work, but from the training of architecture and above all, in cultivated sensitivity that formed in the roots of his family life. After his early training in painting with [[Rafael Arzeno]], he took up an artistic career at an art course at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and graduated as an architect at the [[Catholic University of America]] in Washington D.C. He also attended the [[American University]] and the [[École Américaine des Beaux-Arts]] in the [[Palais de Fontainebleau]] in France. He died in April 1, 2005 in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]].

== Architectural development ==
Miguel Vila Luna was officially introduced during the so-called "''twelve years of Balaguer''", from 1966 to 1978, which mark the Dominican territory an unavoidable stage in the development of national architecture and urbanism. [[Joaquín Balaguer]], former president of the country, was able to choose well, at this stage, his architects. The list of outstanding projects designated for several specific architects is long and plentiful. Miguel Vila led a new style among Dominican professionals, in which he dedicated himself to the discipline of including [[landscaping]] in buildings. After Balaguer's two reelections, his control over the architecture was reduced. In addition, the interactional architectural scene changes drastically. A new generation of postmodernity arises including architects such as Miguel Vila, Plácido Piña, Teófilo Carbonell, Angel Giudicelli, Oscar Imbert, Gustavo Luis "Cuquito" Moré, Tácito Cordero, among others.

In those years, Miguel Vila, with his unequaled leadership among the youngest architects, produced a series of private works that imposed part of the aesthetic guidelines of [[postmodernism]]. Vila, whose work began in the early 1970s under the laws of modern architecture, gradually penetrated the study of regional architecture to his enthusiastic attachment of historicist architecture, from where he developed multiple proposals that produced a whole environment of innovations in the national scenario. &lt;ref&gt;"Convocan a su IX Bienal Internacional de Arquitectura de Santo Domingo." El Nuevo Diario. Llego la hora del arquitecto, 10 Sept. 2008. Web.http://www.elnuevodiario.com.do/mobile/article.aspx?id=119205.&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced of the aesthetic strength of architecture as a key element for a better quality of life, Miguel Vila developed particular work for space and formal capacities, which was advanced for his era. This became references for the architects of the period which reproduced his criteria of integrating architecture with the exterior.  The sequence, spatial categorization, and wealth of decorative resources were set by Vila as motivators for the coexistence. His treatment of the walls in which he rejected the edges and framed the gaps were part of his language, which was used for a whole generation. His followers became, later, protagonists of architecture committed to tropical solutions.

Since its inauguration, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic]] has undergone significant changes in its original concept of architecture. The designs of Miguel Vila, Roberto Copa, William Cox, Rafael Eduardo Selman, Jose Horacio Marranzini and his son Alejandro have been important in its development.

== Artistic style ==
In 1963, his pictorial works appeared in the XI National Biennial. In 1979, Micky recorded his first exhibition which was held in Paris, in the ''Ives Brun'' gallery. He headed a movement with the poet [[Manuel Antonio Rueda González]] that offered the following traits: a plurality of readings of the work, active participation in the spectator's interpretation, inseparability of color and form, integration of universal and local elements, and motivations to the plastic and psycho-philosophies. His artistic movement of [[futurism]] was rich in followers. His works resemble futurism and are bountiful in brilliant compositions of color and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Danilo De los.

The '''National Council of Educational Research and Training''' ('''NCERT''') is an apex resource organisation set up by the [[Government of India]] to assist and advise the [[Central government|central]] and [[States of India|state]] governments on academic matters related to school education.
The model '''textbooks''' published by the Council for adoption by school systems across India have generated '''controversies''' over the years. They have been accused of reflecting the political views of the party in power in the Government of India. In particular, during the years of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-ruled governments, they were accused of
"[[saffronisation|saffronising]]" Indian history (i.e., reflecting [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] views) and engaging in [[historical revisionism]].

The NCERT has been avoiding mentioning that most of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by the [[Marathas]] before the British [[East India Company]] conquered it in History books in India according to historian Sadanand More.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 3, 2013 |title=NCERT cuts short Shivaji's journey in std VII textbook|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/pune/report-ncert-cuts-short-shivaji-s-journey-in-std-vii-textbook-1830091 |newspaper=DNA India |location=Pune |publisher=DNA India |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT) was established in 1961 by the Government of India by combining a number of existing organisations.&lt;ref name=leading&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is an autonomous body in principle. However, it is Government-funded and its Director is appointed by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] (formerly Ministry of Education). In practice, the NCERT has operated as a semi-official organisation promoting a "State-sponsored" educational philosophy.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, national integration and unifying the various communities of India became a major concern to the Government. Education was seen as an important vehicle for the emotional integration of the nation.{{sfn|Yadav|1974|p=202}}{{sfn|Nair|2009|p=148}} The Minister of Education [[M. C. Chagla]] was concerned that the textbooks in history should not recite myths but be secular and rational explanations of the past. A committee on history education was established with the membership of [[Tara Chand (archaeologist)|Tara Chand]], [[Nilakanta Sastri]], [[Mohammad Habib]], [[Bisheshwar Prasad]], [[B. P. Saxena]] and [[P. C. Gupta]], which commissioned a number of history textbooks to be authored by the leading historians. [[Romila Thapar]]'s ''Ancient India'' for class VI was published in 1966, ''Medieval India'' for class VII in 1967. A number of other books, [[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s ''Ancient India'', [[Satish Chandra]]'s ''Medieval India'', [[Bipan Chandra]]'s ''Modern India'' and [[Arjun Dev]]'s ''India and the World'' were published in 1970's.{{sfn|Thapar|2014}}{{sfn|Nair|2009|p=148}}&lt;ref name=Gopal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopal |first=S. |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/500/500%20s.%20gopal.htm |title=The fear of history |journal=Seminar |date=January 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts were intended to be "model" textbooks which were "modern and secular," free of communal bias and prejudice. However, Deepa Nair states that they also carried a "Marxist imprint." The Marxist emphasis on social and economic issues implied a critique of culture and tradition. The value of spirituality was reduced. The Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was sympathetic to the Marxist view of history and believed in a scientific outlook on civil society. In contrast, the Hindu nationalist historiography disagreed with Marxist historiography and based Indian history in the antiquity with glories of Hindu civilization and culture. These contrary views of history set the scene for conflict.{{sfn|Nair|2009|pp=149-150}}

The textbooks faced political pressures from the inception. In 1969, a Parliamentary Consultative Committee wanted the textbook on ''Ancient India'' to state categorically that the "Aryans" were indigenous to India. But the demand was rejected by the Editorial Board as well as Thapar as the author. Further critical reactions came from Hindu and Sikh religious organisations that their respective religions and religious leaders had not been glorified. The [[Hindu Mahasabha]] and [[Arya Samaj]] claimed that the mention of beef-eating in ancient times went counter to the religious sentiments of the "Hindu nationality."{{sfn|Thapar|2014}}

Such controversies continue till today. The controversy centers around the charges of an attempted "[[saffronisation|saffronised]]" rewriting of [[India]]n history (i.e., making lessons consonant with the [[Hindutva]]).&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; Allegations of [[historical revisionism]] with a [[Hindu nationalist]] agenda arose in two periods: under the [[Janata Party]] government 1977 to 1980 and again under the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] government from 1998 to 2004. In 2012, the organization has been blamed for attempting to insult the government by publishing 'offensive' cartoons in its textbooks.

==Controversy during the Janata Party government (1977-79)==
Three months into the [[Premiership of Morarji Desai|Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai]], the Prime Minister was handed an anonymous memorandum by [[Nanaji Deshmukh]], former [[Jana Sangh]] leader and general secretary of the Janata Party, which targeted the NCERT textbooks. The books criticised were Thapar's ''Medieval India'' and Bipan Chandra's ''Modern India'', along with two other books, ''Freedom Struggle'' by Tripathi, De and Chandra, and ''Communalism and the Writing of Indian History'' by Thapar, Mukhia and Chandra. (Only the first two were NCERT textbooks.) The Prime Minister forwarded the memorandum to the Education Minister suggesting that the books be withdrawn from circulation. In August 1977, R. S. Sharma's ''Ancient India'' was published, which was also targeted. The books were said to be "anti-Indian and anti-national" in content and "prejudicial to the study of history." The main issues seemed to be that they were not sufficiently critical of certain Muslim invaders during the medieval period and that they emphasized the role of leaders like [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] and [[Aurobindo]] in the development of Hindu-Muslim antagonisms. The Hindu nationalist [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] launched a separate campaign against the books in its magazine ''[[Organiser (magazine)|Organiser]]''.&lt;ref name=Engineer&gt;
{{cite book |last=Engineer |first=Asghar Ali |authorlink=Asghar Ali Engineer |title=Indian Muslims: A Study of the Minority Problem in India |publisher=Ajanta Publications |year=1985 |ISBN=8120201396 |p=209}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=287-288}}{{sfn|Thapar|2014}}&lt;ref name=Rudolph&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Rudolph |first1=Lloyd I. |last2=Rudolph |first2=Susanne Hoeber |title=Rethinking Secularism: Genesis and Implications of the Textbook Controversy, 1977-79 |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=56 |number=1 |year=1983 |pp=15–37 |JSTOR=2758768}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum got leaked and a public debate ensued, which ran till 1979. The authors of the books argued for the legitimacy of independent interpretations as long as they were based on reliable evidence. The most hotly contested issue in the 1977 to 1979 controversy was the depiction of [[Mughal era]] (Muslim ruled) India and the role of [[Islam in India]]. [[Romila Thapar]]'s ''Medieval India'' was criticised for being too sympathetic to Muslim viewpoints and for showing too little enthusiasm for Hindu heritage.&lt;ref name=Rudolph/&gt; In November 1977, a committee of reputable historians was asked to examine the textbooks, which supported their continuance.{{sfn|Thapar|2014}} Nonetheless, the government passed an act in July 1978, withdrawing R. S. Sharma's ''Ancient India'' from the syllabus of the Central Board of Secondary Education.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=287-288}}

In the course of the controversy, both sides became deeply suspicious of the other's motivations, contributing to the intensification of Indian "[[communalism (South Asia)|communalism]]" and leaving resentments that were to resurface in the renewed controversy under BJP rule twenty years later.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Communalism and "[[saffronisation|saffronised]]" content (2002-2004)==
In 2002, under the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] government spearheaded by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) the government made an attempt at changing the NCERT school textbooks through a new National Curriculum Framework.&lt;ref name="delhi1"&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Mukherjee |first1=Mridula |last2=Mukherjee |first2=Aditya |editor1-last=Delhi Historians' Group|title=Communalisation of Education: The History Textbooks Controversy|date=Dec 2001|publisher=Jawaharlal Nehru University|url=http://www.sacw.net/India_History/DelHistorians.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2015 |ref=Sec 1 |chapter=Overview}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist historians raised objections to the new curriculum, claiming "saffronisation" of education by allegedly raising the profile of Hindu cultural norms, views and historical personalities in school textbooks.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51618.htm |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |title=India: International Religious Freedom Report 2005 |publisher=US Department of State |accessdate=10 April 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The BJP opined that their only goal was to overhaul the stagnant and saturated institutions like NCERT and free them from the alleged dynastic control and hegemony of the [[Indian National Congress]] and the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Party members also opined that their goal was not to promote sectarianism, but present a more accurate picture of Indian history and Indian culture (such as [[Ayurveda|Vedic science]]), which was being downplayed by the left wing ideologues.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDA was defeated in the elections of 2004 and the new [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] government pledged to "de-saffronise" textbooks and curricula nationwide and restore the secular character of education.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; In March, the UPA Government released new NCERT textbooks, based on the texts used before the controversial 2002 updates.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; The Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversaw this project, stated that it had made only minor modifications to the books that predated the "saffronised" era.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; In Delhi, the Directorate of Education, in collaboration with the State Council of Educational Research and Training, prepared 47 new textbooks, and other state governments were expected to do likewise.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; In June 2004, a panel, composed of [[J. S. Grewal]], [[Barun De]] and [[Shadakshari Settar|S. Settar]], was constituted by the NCERT to review the new textbooks. This panel suggested that the textbooks that were being used in school syllabuses had poor content, were presented shoddily, and contained significant amounts of irrelevant information.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; The panel recommended, to the Human Resource Development (HRD) minister, that the new books not be used until the defects could be resolved. This led the Delhi students to use textbooks that were used in school syllabuses from the pre-"saffronised" period.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt;

Press reports indicated that the rush to "de-saffronise" school texts resulted in Urdu versions not being ready for the academic year, which began in April.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; The reports asserted that this failure hurt Urdu-speaking students by depriving them of needed textbooks. The NCERT denied the claims.&lt;ref name="IRFR2005"/&gt; 

== Controversies during UPA government(2004-2014) ==
The UPA and previous Congress-led governments have been accused by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]], the dominant Hindutva party, of revising history to present a Marxist bias, and whitewashing the record of Muslim "atrocities" to acquire Muslim votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjp.org/today/July_0104/Page_13.htm |title=BJP objects to "De-toxification" of NCERT text books |publisher=BJP |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221194653/http://www.bjp.org/today/July_0104/Page_13.htm |archivedate=21 February 2005 }}

Amendments were made in history textbook for Class XII in lessons on Sikhism after protest from Sikh organisations in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/NCERT-amends-lessons-on-Sikhism/articleshow/398976.cms|title=NCERT amends lessons on Sikhism - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, there were protests for removal of controversial anti-hindi agitation and a Ambedkar cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Causes/1179/fight-for-pride.html|title=Fight for pride|website=www.theweekendleader.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncert-asked-to-remove-ambedkar-cartoon-from-textbooks-sibal/article3408163.ece|title=NCERT asked to remove Ambedkar cartoon from textbooks: Sibal|date=2012-05-11|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-12-01|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartoons (2012)==
In April 2012, The [[Republican Party of India]] (RPI) Athavale group demanded a ban on an eleventh grade text book by the NCERT saying a cartoon in the book insulted Dr. [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]]. The book, which had been originally published in 2006, wasn't recognized as part of the syllabus until 2012. On 2 April, Ramdas Athavale held a press conference and burnt copies of the page from the textbook prescribed in the political science syllabus. Athavale demanded the resignation of [[Union Minister]] for Human Resource Development [[Kapil Sibal]] who also was the president of the NCERT board. RPI workers burnt his effigy. The cartoon figures on page 18 of chapter one titled "Constitution, why and how" in the book called ''[[Indian Constitution]] at Work''. It shows Ambedkar sitting on a snail which is labelled ‘Constitution' cracking a whip. Behind him is [[Pandit Nehru]], also shown with a whip. The caption says: "Cartoonist's impression of the ‘snail's pace' with which the Constitution was made. Athavale said the cartoon insulted the architect of India's Constitution and the people responsible must be dealt with. The NCERT too had insulted him, he pointed out. The issue created uproar in both Houses of Parliament. NCERT chief advisors Yogendra Yadav and [[Suhas Palshikar]] resigned on Friday after the government issued an apology and promised to remove the cartoon. Speaking to reporters, Palshikar said it seemed like the government didn't have an option and therefore decided to agree with the protesting MPs. "The caricature was a symbol of the progressive outlook in education. This has now been undone. We are of the opinion that as advisors we can have a different opinion. Hence, we don't think it's appropriate for us to be in this position anymore." [[Suhas Palshikar]] is a professor in the Department of [[Politics]] and [[Public Administration]] at the [[University of Pune]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Cartoon issue was first raised by RPI|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3273838.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=23 September 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after that controversy had been solved, the [[Shahi Imam]] of [[Fatehpuri Mosque]], Mohd Mukarram Ahmed wrote to Kapil Sibal asking for the removal of a medieval painting of [[Archangel Gabriel]] and another of pilgrims at the [[Kaaba]] from the chapter 'The Central Islamic Lands' on the ground that they were against the [[Sharia]] law. The letter, dated 10 September 2012 has also been sent to [[Chief Minister of Delhi|Delhi Chief Minister]] [[Sheila Dikshit]], education minister Kiran Walia and NCERT chief Parvin Sinclair. "Jibril (Gabriel) is the chief angel who brought messages to the [[Prophets in Islam|Prophet]]. The painting in the book is comical in its presentation of the Archangel. Secondly, the caption for the illustration on pilgrims at the Kaba states that they are 'touching' the stone even though it's customary to kiss it. But the Jibril painting is the most objectionable and will not be tolerated," said Ahmed in his letter. However, rejecting this, Najaf Haider, an associate professor at the Centre for Historical Studies at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] said "The Gabriel painting was sourced from a 13th century text called ''Ajaib-ul-Makhluqat'', written by a renowned scholar, Qazwini. The second illustration was taken from a 15th century collection of fragmented pieces. The letter only states the paintings are against Sharia and doesn't exactly point out what's objectionable about them. Moreover, these texts (from where the paintings are sourced) were written in Muslim courts by people who were far more scholarly and pious than anyone can claim to be today."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rewriting history during the BJP Modi government (2014-2019)==

In 2006, a popular poem written by the Hindi poet [[Pash]] was included in the NCERT text book for 11th standard Hindi students. This poem was सबसे ख़तरनाक होता है हमारे सपनों का मर जाना (Sabse Khatarnak hota hai hamare sapnon ka mar jaana - meaning: ''The most dangerous thing is the demise of our dreams'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paash|last1=Avataar Singh|title=Lyrics - Sabse Khatarnak |url=https://www.amarujala.com/kavya/irshaad/paash-poetry-sabse-khatarnak-hota-hai-sapnon-ka-mar-jana |website=www.amarujala.com |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2017, the [[Narendra Modi]] [[BJP]] government ordered the poem to be removed, in the fear that it could encourage Indians to protest against the injustice they saw around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paash Ki Kavita Se Dar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC09iOr-Sds |accessdate=12 October 2018 |agency=Primetime |publisher=NDTV |date=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to controversy and protests, especially in the [[Hindi]] media.

Chapter 2: "On substituting Achievement Tests for aptitude tests in College admissions"&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Wainer refers to Cole's presidency of the ETS as "disastrous":, and criticizes the ETS's decision to rename the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] to the Scholastic Assessment Test, which he describes as "redundant and virtually meaningless".

The '''New South Wales Teachers Federation''' (also known simply as '''Federation''') is the registered trade union that covers New South Wales (NSW) public school teachers. The New South Wales Teachers Federation represents all teachers in NSW public pre-schools, infants, primary and secondary schools and TAFE (technical and further education) Institutes. Teachers in Schools for Specific Purposes, Adult Migrant Education Service (AMES) and Corrective Services are also members.

==About the union==
The New South Wales Teachers Federation is affiliated to the [[Australian Education Union]] (AEU), the national union covering public school teachers in Australia and through that organisation to [[Education International]] and the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. The New South Wales Teachers Federation is also affiliated to Unions New South Wales. The NSW Teachers Federation is not affiliated to any political party.

The New South Wales Teachers Federation is based at [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] near the [[Sydney CBD]]. The union also has regional offices in [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Dubbo]], [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales|Port Macquarie]], [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]].

The membership includes about 41,000 full-time teachers, 15,000 casual and unemployed members, and 6,000 TAFE teachers. The total membership stands at about 67,000.

The state council of the union consists of approximately 300 locally elected delegates. The union's annual conference consists of approximately 600 delegates. The NSW Teachers Federation executive is elected by the state council.

The secretariat of the Federation is composed of 47 officers who are elected by the council for a three-year term. They perform such jobs as [[union organiser|organiser]], industrial advocate, welfare officer and research officer, supporting the Federation's membership.

The three Presidential officers – President, Deputy President, and Senior Vice-President – are elected by the whole membership every two years.

The NSW Teachers Federation looks after a multiplicity of issues on behalf of teachers. It is responsible for negotiating the salaries and working conditions of its members with the New South Wales government. The union is committed to the interests of public education, although its primary concern is salaries and working conditions of its members.

Stewart House is the official charity of the NSW Teachers Federation.

==History==
{{Expand section|early internal structure (branches), internal conflict in the 1940s, major campaigns by period|date=December 2009}}

===Establishment and the early years===
Throughout its history, Federation has campaigned long and hard on issues affecting public education, teachers' salaries and teachers' working conditions, those issues which are at the heart of teaching as a profession in New South Wales.

The first Annual Conference of Federation in 1919 had listed as part of the agenda "inadequacy of teachers' salaries, understaffing of schools, unwieldiness of classes, insufficiency of accommodation, conducting of classes in sheds, corridors and unsuitable rooms to the detriment of the health of teachers and pupils". Other matters included "unhealthy congestion of school population in overgrown suburban schools, as against decentralisation into schools with a maximum enrolment of one thousand, the high percentage of unclassified and insufficiently trained teachers, inadequacy of supervision by heads of departments owing to class duties and absence of schools for the mentally disabled". Throughout this century, Federation has continued to campaign on these issues.

In the years immediately following its establishment, Federation was concerned to increase its membership. In 1920 the membership of the Federation was 5,600 or 78% of the total membership of the Department of Education. In 1996 membership is about 64,000. This number includes permanent full-time school, TAFE teachers, AMES teachers, part-time school, TAFE, AMES and casual teachers as well as those teachers in other associated groups.

It was not until 1937 that the first organiser was appointed, following an Annual Conference decision of 1936 that stated "we are firmly of the opinion that, for a really effective increase in membership, it is necessary that some person be employed for the whole of their time organising the schools". More officers were progressively appointed. There were 43 full-time administrative officers in 1996, who serviced the needs of the membership and undertook recruitment activities.

===1960s-present day===
In 1961, 241,000 signatories for a National Education Petition were presented to the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, calling for Commonwealth funding to state schools. This was the culmination of a long campaign begun in the 1940s, to encourage the Commonwealth Government to fund certain programs in State schools. To this day such programs are funded by the Commonwealth Government. This number of signatories was a record which was only broken in 1993 by a petition calling for private health insurance to be tax deductible.

Over the years to 1968, the year of Federation's first general strike, the Union campaigned on the theme of "United Action", emphasising a community of interest between different sectors of the membership and the community, in policy development. Political, industrial and professional issues concerning public education were given focus and emphasis. There were significant advances – in 1946, for example, there was a major salaries breakthrough for teachers which gave the first realistic salary increases since 1920 and set the standard for other professional workers. The average gain was over 100 pounds for men and 80 pounds for women.

The federation made a major break with the past in 1968, its 50th anniversary, when the first statewide strike was called over the conditions in which teachers were working.

[[File:NSW Teachers Federation campaign.jpg|thumb|NSW Teachers Federation campaign.]]
Since the 1990s, the NSW Teachers Federation has campaigned to support public education in the face of rapidly expanding government funding for private schools. In partnership with parents and principals, the Teachers Federation has engaged in political lobbying and advertising in support of public schools.

'''The Prayner Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Arts in Vienna''' licensed by the [[Austria]]n authorities founded in 1905, and has developed into one of the most well-known and historical conservatories in the city of [[Vienna]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} 

Currently the conservatory offers [[undergraduate]], [[graduate school|graduate]], and post-graduate degrees as well as offering adult education and pre-college education. Students of all levels can take voice or instrumental lessons, and have the opportunity to perform in the orchestra or choir. At the end of the study at Prayner Conservatory the students graduate an internationally recognized Austrian "Artistic Diploma" in the following by the Austrian authorities licensed fields of study: Piano, Singing, Violin, Violoncello, Viola, Double-Bass, Flute, Clarinet, Oboe, Bassoon, Trumped, Trombone, Horn, Tuba, Guitar, Harp, Accordion, Percussion Instruments as well as for Composition, Conducting, Accompanying classes, Chamber Music, Opera, and Orchestra Repertoire.

Conservatory's  Center location includes two existing buildings on A-1040 Mühlgasse 28-30 and A-1060 Mariahilferstrasse 51 - with its historically significant facades and relatively sound structure.

Among the facility's highlights is the innovative utilization of the existing grand Ehrbarsaal with its elegant gilt columns and ornate ceiling as the audience chamber for the new Concert Hall, augmented by state-of-the-art performance amenities.

The Prayner Conservatory has more than a hundred teachers including Maksimiljan Cencic, Kroutikova Galina([[Gal Rasche]]), Dr. Massimo Stefanizzi, Dr. [[Giorgi Latso]], Josef Stolz, Valbona Naku, Filimon Ginalis, Alexandra Karastoyanova-Hermentin, Ulf-Dieter Soyka, Victoria Loukianetz, and [[Tymur Melnyk]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">'''Richard Sass''' (1774 &amp;ndash; 7 September 1849) (or Sasse) was an English landscape painter, [[etcher]], and drawing master to royalty. He was the half brother of [[Henry Sass]], the founder of [[Sass's Academy]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Sass, Henry|volume=50|pages=310-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sass exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]] from 1791 to 1813. He was appointed teacher in drawing to the [[Charlotte, Princess Royal|Princess Charlotte]], and later landscape painter to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. In 1825 he removed to [[Paris]], where he spent the remainder of his life, altering his surname to "Sasse". He died there on 7 September 1849. He was survived by his wife Harriet (née Blake) who died in 1866, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bNMhAAAAMAAJ Harriet Blake obituary] ( The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 221, July-Dec 1866 p421).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romain Bussine''' (1830&amp;ndash;1899) was a [[France|French]] [[poet]], [[baritone]], and [[voice teacher]] who lived during the 19th century.

In 1871, together with [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Henri Duparc]], he founded the [[Société Nationale de Musique]] as a forum for promoting contemporary French [[Chamber music|chamber]] and [[orchestra]]l music. Later an argument over the performance of foreign works led to Saint-Saëns and Bussine resigning the joint presidency of the Société Nationale in 1886.

[[Gabriel Fauré]] set one of his poems as ''Après un rêve'' ("After A Dream"), op. 7, No. 1 (composed in 1877, published in 1878). The poem, based on an Italian poem titled "Levati sol che la luna è levata," is a soliloquy about a rapturous dream of a passionate encounter to which the dreamer longs to return, even though the dream is a lie. Another setting by Fauré of a poem by Bussine is ''Sérénade Toscane''; the poem is a fairly free version of a slightly sardonic Tuscan serenade.

Bussine worked for many years as a voice teacher at the [[Paris Conservatory]]. A [[baritone]], he occasionally gave recitals and performed in concerts in Paris; although he was not a prolific performer. He notably sang the role of the High Priest in the first hearing of the second act of Saint-Saëns's ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' in a private performance in 1870. Among his notable pupils were composers [[Guillaume Couture (musician)|Guillaume Couture]] and [[Achille Fortier]].  He died in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8589">'''Space Night''' (full title: ''space night - All-tag nachts'') is the name of a German television program in the early night/morning hours each day. It is a mixture of chill-out-music and images of the earth as seen from space interspersed with informative broadcasts. It was started by the [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] (BR) in 1994 and is now broadcast by [[ARD-alpha]].

==Structure==
The Space Night's structure consists of several different sub-programs. In any given month, on any given weekday, the programs will be the same. In the next month, the programs will change, but again stay the same for the same weekdays. There are no broadcasts during Friday and Saturday nights.

Space Night itself does not have any opening or closing credits; only the sub-programs may do. You can recognize a program is part of Space Night in two ways:
# some programs will show a text overlay reading "space night" in the bottom right corner
# there are no regular program forecasts injected between the programs during Space Night

The sub-programs are never all part of any single Space Night. Instead the programs from the beginning of a Space Night are repeated at the end, so that some episodes of a program may be broadcast twice during one Space Night. If a program would continue to run longer than the Space Night itself, it will be interrupted in the middle.

* Alpha-Centauri (science program by [[BR-alpha]], presented by [[physicist]] Prof. [[Harald Lesch]])
* Alpha bis Omega (''Alpha to Omega'') (discussions about theology between the physicist Harald Lesch and the [[theologian]] Thomas Schwartz. This program is almost only broadcast during Space Night itself)
* Die Erde erwacht (''The earth awakes'') (Pictures of cities and their inhabitants' doings during morning time; no audio comments)
* Earth Views (Satellite pictures of several Earth regions with interruptions by [[computer animation]]s; no audio comments but [[music]]; total of ten episodes)
* Jazz in Space (pictures from space; no audio comments but [[Jazz]] music)
* Lesch &amp; Co. (discussions between the physicist Harald Lesch and his colleague Wilhelm Vossenkuhl about [[philosophy]])
* Moonwalks (pictures of excursions across the [[Moon]])
* Space Art ([[painting]]s from the art genre called [[Space Art]]; no audio comments but music; some episodes do not have the text overlay "space night" but "space art" instead)
* Space Cowboys (pictures of missions of [[NASA]]'s programs [[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]] and [[Apollo program]]; no audio comments but music; additional text overlay showing information about each mission like the starting day, crew info, name of modules, duration, special notes, etc.)
* Was sucht der Mensch im Weltraum? (''What does man seek in space?'') (rerun of the 1968 television series featuring [[Heinz Haber]])
* Waternight (pictures of [[coral reef]]s; no audio comments but music)
* New Frontiers (stations on the way to the [[International Space Station]] (Project Mercury, Project Gemini, Apollo-Program, [[Space Shuttle]], [[Mir]]); no audio comment but [[electro music]])

==History==
Space Night started in 1994 as a replacement of the [[test card]]s which were broadcast on BR at night 
until this time. The idea originated in the fact that the German satellite ASTRO-SPAS (see [[STS-80]]) had recorded many hours of video footage in space. The BR received this footage, edited the material and added [[downtempo]] spherical music.

As BR did not want to show the same pictures 7 days a week, both [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] as well as the [[German Aerospace Center]] were addressed. They offered more hours of footage from in and around space, which were thus included.

==Cult status and music==
The broadcast quickly turned into a [[cult]]: At [[rave]]s in the mid-90s it wasn't unusual to show the images of Space Night on big TV-screens. Early in the morning after the rave it was often used to calm down, especially from 1996 and later, as Space Night's sound changed through the musical guidance by Alex Azary (a European chill-out-DJ), who provided a more electronic background music. This was a logical step that originated from Alex Azary. He headed the Club XS in Frankfurt where "chill out nights" started in 1990, supported by spherical music. Alongside, pictures of Space Night were shown, albeit the playback was a little bit slower than in the original program. The images did fit well to the then new music-genre and Alex thought it would be a good idea to show it to the people at BR. A meeting in [[Munich]] followed where he could convince them to try something new.

The compositions are also available as separate [[CD]]s, the mixdown starting from the album "Space Night II" is done by the German music label Elektrolux. In the meantime, twelve CD-albums with music to the television series have been published, with three of those clearly differing in musical style. While "Space Night Vol. 1" is an album featuring [[pop music]], "Space Night Vol. 10" features Jazz music and "Space Night Vol. 12" is a double CD with [[classical music]]. A DVD titled "Best of Earth-Views" is also available.

== Problems ==
After a change in tariffs by the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]], BR stated they would not want to continue Space Night starting in January 2013, due to the drastically increased [[royalties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research-institute.blogspot.de/2013/01/space-night-auf-br-alpha.html |title=Space Night auf BR-Alpha |author=Research-Institute |access-date=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the series was ended on January 8, 2013. Numerous viewers engaged BR to continue Space Night by using GEMA-free music. The station decided to undo the cancellation, first by rerunning older episodes starting on February 25, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.br.de/presse/inhalt/pressemitteilungen/spacenight-100.html |title=Ab 25. Februar wieder im Programm: Return of "Space Night" |author=Bayrischer Rundfunk |access-date=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to later broadcast new episodes starting in autumn of 2013. To accomplish this, BR will use music with [[Creative Commons]] licensing, encouraging their viewer to upload their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Space-Night-wird-mit-Musik-unter-CC-Lizenz-fortgesetzt-1806004.html |title=Space Night wird mit Musik unter CC-Lizenz fortgesetzt |author=Heise online |access-date=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restart was scheduled for November 1, 2013. It had to be postponed to November, 15th, because [[NASA]] was not able to provide the necessary graphical material, due to the [[Government shutdown in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Space-Night-wegen-US-Haushaltsstreit-verschoben-1978657.html |title=Space Night wegen US-Haushaltsstreit verschoben |author=Heise online |access-date=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special broadcasts==

===Moon landing===
Since the 25th anniversary of the [[Moon landing|first human landing on the moon]] the original 
version of the broadcast of the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] is shown at the exact time of the original 
airing.

===Perry Rhodan===
At the 40th anniversary of the [[Perry Rhodan]] series in 2001 there was a 'Perry Rhodan-Space Night'. [[Cover art]] by the artist Johnny Bruck (who produced the cover artwork for Perry Rhodan) was shown with modern techniques to animate still pictures, there were galaxies, planets, spaceplanes, men and aliens - a visual journey through the Perry Rhodan universe with the known music of Space Night. Following the broadcast, which was repeated for several weeks, a DVD with the title ''space night presents: Perry Rhodan 40th Anniversary - Special Sci-Fi Edition'' and a double album with the music was created.

[[File:'The_Mission_Walker".jpg|thumb|right]]

'''''The Mission Walker''''' is a non-fiction book written by American author Edie Littlefield Sundby and an [[Audie Award]] Finalist for Best Inspirational Book. It is an adventure story and personal memoir about her life and illness battling stage IV gallbladder cancer, and describes her healing 1,600-mile walk of the old, historic [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real de las Californias]] mission trail from Loreto, Mexico to Sonoma, California, with one lung. The personal story is interlaced with the story of the old [[Jesuit]] mission trail in [[Baja California]] Mexico, and the [[Franciscan]] mission trail in California, and cites more than fifty historical sources.

== Background ==
Before writing ''The Mission Walker'', Edie Littlefield Sundby was a corporate executive, entrepreneur, and mother. In March 2007, Edie was diagnosed with stage-4 adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with widespread metastasis, including liver, colon, peritoneum, and groin - and given a few months to live. While undergoing aggressive cancer treatment, she shared her reflections on life and illness, authoring essays in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Over the course of six years she endured 79 rounds of chemotherapy, multiple radical surgeries (including the removal of her right lung, half her liver, and part of her colon and stomach), and intense radiation; through it all she walked, and, in [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/walking-800-miles-away-from-cancer/ The New York Times,] she credits walking with saving her life.

==Plot==

[[File:MAP - "The Mission Walker" - Edie Littlefield Sundby's 1,600-mile walk of El Camino Real de las Californias from Loreto Mexico to Sonoma California - From GPS Pings.jpg|thumb|MAP of Edie Littlefield Sundby's 1,600-mile walk of El Camino Real de las Californias mission trail from Loreto Mexico to Sonoma California.]]

El Camino Real - which stretches from [[Loreto, Mexico]] to north of [[San Francisco, California]] - crosses through some of the most deserted, desolate landscape in the world. At sixteen hundred miles long, it covers roughly the distance between Boston and Houston, as the crow flies. But instead of traveling it via a few hours flight, imagine walking the entire way.

And instead of being the picture of health when you set out, imagine having undergone six years of aggressive chemotherapy, radiation, and invasive surgeries in your fight against stage IV cancer. And to make things extra challenging, you're down to just one lung and a fragment of the other.

When Edie Littlefield Sundby was diagnosed with metastatic cancer and given only three months to live, she vowed to fight. She sought out the best care that the medical community could offer, and she relied on the faith she had inherited from her cotton-farmer parents. But Edie also found healing through movement. Edie knew that if she was still walking, she was still alive.

Though she had never walked more than a few miles at a time, six months after her right lung was removed, Edie decided to walk the entire eight-hundred mile Historic California Mission Trail - the northern segment of El Camino Real - which links twenty-one missions from San Diego to north of San Francisco. Undeterred by physical and emotional pain, she searched for restoration and hope.

And then, two years later, her cancer returned. With no time to lose, she set out to walk the remaining eight hundred-mile El Camino Real, from its origin in Loreto, Mexico, north to the US border. If she succeeded, she would be the first person in history to walk the entire sixteen hundred-mile ''El Camino Real de las Californias'' mission trail.

Thomas Nelson, publisher of ''The Mission Walker'', describes the book as ''both an adventure story and a reflection on the universal experience of confronting our own mortality.'' [http://info.thomasnelson.com/p/the-mission-walker/#book ‘The Mission Walker’ Book]

== Reception ==

''The Mission Walker'' is a [http://www.booklistreader.com/2018/02/06/audiobooks/2018-audie-award-finalists-announced 2018 Audie Award Finalist for Best Inspirational Book.]. [[Randall Sullivan]], Executive Producer, Oprah Winfrey Network, and writer/contributing editor at [[Rolling Stone]], wrote in the introduction to the book: ''The Mission Walker is a marvelous book. Edie Littlefield Sundby writes of her battle against cancer with simple grace and enormous dignity. The journey she takes us on - her mission walk - is often arduous and at times harrowing, yet there's a spirit of uplift in even the most difficult passages... a moving meditation on the relationships between courage and faith, endurance and transcendence.''

'''''Tropico 3''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Haemimont Games]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]]. Like the previous games in the series, ''Tropico 3'' is a [[construction and management simulation]] as well as a [[political simulation game]], with emphasis on [[City-building game|city building]]. As a thematic sequel to ''[[Tropico]]''  (unlike the pirate-themed sequel, ''[[Tropico 2]]''), the game attempts to return to the roots of the series, which puts the player into the shoes of "El Presidente" – a dictator governing over an island [[banana republic]].

The [[macOS|OS X]] version of the game was released on January 26, 2012, by [[Feral Interactive]].&lt;ref name="feralinteractive.com"/&gt;

Feral Interactive is bringing a redesigned version of Tropico 3 to iPad in 2018, under the name Tropico&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/07/11/feral-interactive-tropico-ipad-details/|title=Feral Interactive releases new details about upcoming Tropico game for iPad|date=2018-07-11|work=iDownloadBlog.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Tropico screenshot.jpg|thumb|300px|Tourist district including an airport, hotels, a zoo, and others.]]

Players begin having seized power of the Caribbean island country of Tropico, where they rule as "El Presidente". The game has a campaign with 15 different missions with varying objectives.

As "El Presidente", the player's main duties include managing development on the island, by ordering construction of various resources, industry and service buildings, and determining how these buildings operate. The player can also issue several different "edicts" to influence the island, such as new laws, policies, and diplomatic actions.

There are seven different political factions on the island (communists, capitalists, militarists, environmentalists, nationalists, religious faction and intellectuals) each with various demands, such as constructing a specific building and issuing a specific edict. Due to the game's Cold War setting, the player will have to manage relations with both the United States and the [[USSR]], who will provide the player with yearly financial aid. Higher relations with a superpower will mean more aid and the possibility of an alliance, low relations will mean less aid and the danger of invasion by that superpower.

Other features include a time line editor that allows you to create your own fictitious historical events or enter real ones, custom avatar, political speeches, wide range of editing and modification functions, mission generator for random map creation, variety of online-functions such as high scores or visiting islands belonging to other players and a Latin soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/games/Tropico3/index.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718025750/http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/games/Tropico3/index.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-18 |title=Where Games Live |publisher=Kalypsomedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a variety of humor elements including running satirical commentary by fictional radio station Tropico News Today, and subtle touches such as liaisons between priests and cabaret girls. The "loading" and "saving" screens have quotes from various dictators, leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries such as [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

===Additions to [[Tropico]]===
*Numerous random world events.
*A transport system allowing citizens to travel by cars.
*[[Customization of Avatars (Computing)|Avatar customization]] and control.
*Election speeches.
*[[Oil production]] is available as an industry for educated workers.
*[[Same-sex marriages]] and [[nuclear testing]] are available as edicts, with different results and requirements.
*New faction: Nationalists, who hate immigration and prefer a dominant Tropican workforce.
*A "vintage mode" for non-rotational 3D visuals.
*Gravel roads (roads with a low speed for countryside of the island)
*Ability to construct a sculpture of El Presidente (the player's [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]) on the island.

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
''Tropico 3'' was developed by Haemimont Games for both Xbox 360 and PC. Features include a new 3D game engine and a customizable avatar which you can travel across the island, interacting with the environment and population and the use of cars, trucks and limos. Like the original ''Tropico'', the developers preserved the tongue-in-cheek humor of the game, as well as the basic game-play. In ''Tropico 3'', the issues and problems of the island are explained by Juanito the DJ in humorous ways.

==Expansions==
In March 2010, the expansion pack "Absolute Power" was announced, slated for release in Europe in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newgamenetwork.com/news/910/tropico-3-expansion-announced/|title=Tropico 3 Expansion announced|publisher=[[New Game Network]]|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion received an 8/10 on Game Zone, closing with "Absolute Power isn’t a revolution, instead taking the framework laid out by the original game and building on it with new features and a wacky new campaign. The core mechanics are still the same, and the new campaign might be a turn off to sim fans looking for something more grounded and traditional. However, if you were a fan of ''Tropico 3'' and want another reason to step into the role of El Presidente once more, then this is your 
chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hopper |first=Steven |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_absolute_power_review/ |title=Tropico 3 Absolute Power review &amp;#124; GameZone |publisher=Pc.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923111908/http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_absolute_power_review |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute Power was released on PC as an expansion pack, and is included in the Macintosh version of the game.

The expansion pack gives the player a wider selection of edicts such as 'Print money', 'Free housing', 'Delete a Faction' and 'Shoot Juanito' (which involves blowing up Juanito's ''TNT Radio''). These new edicts are called 'Megalomania edicts'; for each edict that the player releases they can gain a varying amount of megalomania score that counts at the end of the game. Also there is a new range of buildings, including 'Golden Statue' (in the likeness of 'El Presidente'), 'Garbage dump' and 'Balloon rides'. The Loyalist faction is also introduced; it is composed of the player's most loyal supporters. There is also a second radio DJ named Betty Boom who is head of the resistance movement against el Presidente.

==Editions==

===Steam Special Edition===
The "Steam Special Edition" of ''Tropico 3'' offers two additional maps for the sandbox mode and two additional costumes for the El Presidente avatar editor. The "Steam Special Edition" is only available through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It was released on October 21, 2009, in North America but was originally listed to be released on the later date of October 25, 2009. The international release was on November 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/23490/ |title=Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition on Steam |publisher=Store.steampowered.com |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropico 3'' received generally favorable reviews at [[Metacritic]], with an average of 79/100 on the PC, and 75/100 on the Xbox 360.{{r|MC_PC|MC_X360}} ''[[GameSpot]]'' commented that "playing a banana republic dictator in Tropico 3 might not be easy, but it certainly is rewarding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tropico3/review.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612071337/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/tropico3/review.html |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone's Dakota Grabowski gave the game a 7 out of 10, stating, "Containing a 15-mission campaign, short tutorial, sandbox mode and special challenges, ''Tropico 3'' has enough replay value to keep players at bay for more than a month. If that doesn’t satisfy the hunger, players are eligible to jump online and download user-created challenges to overcome. With personalities such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, ''Tropico 3'' is an educational and entertainment piece that is well-deserving of a few playthroughs by all gamers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GameZone |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/item/tropico_3_360_review |title=Tropico 3 - 360 - Review |publisher=GameZone |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universidad de Concepción''' ('''UdeC'''), is a traditional Chilean private university, the work of the Penquista community, one of the most traditional and prestigious in its country, considered complex due to its extensive research in the various areas of knowledge. Founded on May 14, 1919, it is the 3rd oldest university in Chile, and 1 of the 25 universities belonging to the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities.

Its headquarters are located in the city of Concepción, and also has 2 other campuses in [[Chillán]] and [[Los Ángeles (Chile)|Los Ángeles]]. In a citizen survey carried out in 2012, it was chosen as the symbol that most identifies Penquists.

It was the 1st University created in the center-south zone of the country, besides being the 1st to be constituted as a private law corporation and belong to the Cruz del Sur University Network; it also belongs to the G9 University Network. The University of Concepción also had a pioneering role in the reform movement of Chilean universities that took place at the end of the 60's of the 20th century. It was the 1st Chilean university that approved the University Reform in that period (1968), giving greater participation to students in university management.

Its main promoter was Chilean educator and lawyer Enrique Molina Garmendia, who sought to create the 1st secular university in Chile. As part of its educational line, the University of Concepción devotes a large part of its budget to academic research. It has in its facilities the most complete museum of Chilean art in the country, several sports centers and a network of 11 libraries, the main one occupying an area of 10,000 m² with a total of 100,000 volumes.

By 2012, the total number of graduates of this house of studies amounted to 57,000. It also teaches 23,700 students, 2,166 of them graduate programs; 72% of its professors have doctorates or master's degrees and its infrastructure, with 243,556 m² built, is one of the largest in Chile.

It is currently accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA-Chile) for the maximum period of 7 years (of a maximum of 7), from November 2016 to November 2023. Figure in the 3rd position within the Chilean universities according to the webometric classification of the CSIC (July 2017) and in the 3rd position according to the AméricaEconomía 2017 ranking as well as national and international rankings. Within the Chilean universities, it is also among the 11 that figure in the QS 2017 world university ranking, among the 10 that appear in the Times Higher Education 2017 ranking, and among the 25 that appear in the ranking of Scimago Institution Rankings (SIR) 2017, with the 3rd position nationally and 572th worldwide.

Its Concepción campus was declared a National Heritage in 2016 by the Council of National Monuments of Chile; what makes it the 1st and only University in Chile to have this recognition due to the design and architectural style of its environment that has been implemented in its buildings and campus-level environment since its foundation; the proclamation grants the university special protection and conservation of the campus and its space by the state; therefore, any intervention to the same has to be reported to the Council of Monuments, while any damage and type of vandalism that jeopardizes the integrity and security of the campus will be seriously penalized according to the law that regulates and covers the National Monuments, as well as the prompt construction of the 1st and only Bío Bío Technological Science Park (PACYT) in all of Chile located in the Bío-Bío Region, near the campus of the Universidad de Concepción; which at the same time will be in charge of the administration, organization, and projection of new ideas with a view to the future of it together with the Government of Chile; this initiative is going to be projected as a productive space of the future and a relevant pole of the development of the country, the place where all the creative potential will be housed, knowledge and innovations of high impact will be generated.

==History==
[[File:Escultura en UConce.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Sculpture in honor of the founders of the University at the University Forum.]]

===Background===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many scholars from [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] started to plead for the construction of a university for the south of [[Chile]] where it would be possible to study professional degrees outside the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However, a project of this magnitude required a high level of organization, which as yet did not exist. In February 1917, the newspaper [[El Sur (newspaper)|El Sur]] reported:
{{quote|''The idea of creating a university cannot yet be possible because of "the lack of organization of those who want to create it".''|[[El Sur (newspaper)|Diario El Sur]], 1917.}}

===Committee Pro-University===
On March 23, 1917, the first official meeting took place to realise two dreams of the citizens of Concepción: a clinical hospital and a university.

After debate, a committee was named to take charge of the construction of these two projects. The projects were closely related because the hospital would become the base of the new university's medical school. Some notable members of the committee included Enrique Molina Garmendia, Pedro Nolasco, Edmundo Larenas and Virginio Gómez.

===Foundation===
The commission then presented the documentation to [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]] that would officially create the university. These were sent and approved, and on May 14, 1919, Enrique Molina Garmendia founded the university and became its first rector.

Nowadays, the university is funded by various organisations belonging to the "University of Concepción Corporation". The Lottery is one of the main organisations. With this funding, the University of Concepción has become one of the most modern and important universities in Chile.

==Organization==

The University of Concepción is divided into three campuses, located in [[Chillán]], [[Los Ángeles, Chile|Los Ángeles]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The latter is the main and most important campus.

===Concepción Campus===

The university is located in the University District. The whole campus comprises what is known as the '''Ciudad Universitaria''' (University City), which also contains museums, sculptures and parks. Today, the campus has an area of 1,425,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 239,856 are built upon. It is the knowledge, science, culture, technology and research centre of the city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The ''[[Presencia de América Latina]]'' mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] is within the [[Casa del Arte (Concepción, Chile)|Casa del Arte]] on the university campus.

In 2010, the University of Concepción campus was named one of Chile’s most important architectural works from the first half of the 20th century. The "Obra Bicentenario" award distinguishes works that, in the last 100 years, have changed the face of Chile’s cities and most improved the quality of life of its inhabitants.

The '''Virtual Open Access Agriculture &amp; Aquaculture Repository Project''' ('''VOA3R''') was a European research project financed through the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] of the [[European Union]]. The project consortium was composed of fourteen partners from ten different countries, as well as representatives from [[FAO]] of the [[United Nations]].

The general objective of the VOA3R project was to improve the spread of European [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]] research results by using an innovative approach to sharing open access research products. The  project tasks and work packages carried out innovative experiments with open access to scientific agriculture and aquaculture contents and developed and provided services that integrated previously existing open access repositories and scholarly publication management systems by means of a federation approach.&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.wip.wiwi.uni-due.de/en/research/research-projects/voa3r/&lt;/ref&gt; The key product of the project was the VOA3R platform.

== Overview of the VOA3R Platform ==

The VOA3R platform aimed at reusing existing and mature [[metadata]] and [[semantic technology]] to deploy an advanced community-focused integrated service for the retrieval of relevant open content, and data that includes explicit models of the scholarly methods and procedures used and of the practical tasks targeted by applied research (which represent a principal information need expression for practitioners).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/factsheet/index.cfm?project_ref=250525&lt;/ref&gt; The service enabled researchers to formulate their information needs in terms of elements of the scientific methods established in their field (variables, techniques, assessment methods, kinds of objects of interest, etc.) combined with topical descriptions as expressed in metadata. The community approach enabled the enhancement of information seeking with extended evaluation elements (as for example, ratings, public reviews, social tagging and links to supporting or conflicting reports) that complement and go beyond the traditional, anonymous peer review process which results are not made available openly. The technology used would itself become [[open source]], so that the model of the service could be adopted by enterprises (including SMEs) or other kinds of institutions as a value-added, community-oriented model for open access content.

== VOA3R Main Objectives ==

The general objective of the project was to improve the spread of European agriculture and aquaculture research results by using an innovative approach to sharing open access research products.

The concrete objectives towards this were the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://voa3r.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Devising and providing a platform that integrates metadata from existing open access repositories that provides a single point of access to scholarly research in the area agriculture and aquaculture.
* Analyzing and modelling research work processes, inputs and outcomes, coming out with a detailed meta-model serving the basis for devising new search and navigation interfaces that are specific to scholarly information needs during their work processes.
* Analyzing existing and alternative approaches to the evaluation of scholarly research, using traditional peer review mechanisms as the point of departure to be contrasted with alternative, novel approaches.
* Experimenting on alternatives to peer review in the context of open access repositories, based on the meta-models for research work developed.
* Formalizing meta-models of research work, coming up with ontologies that enable new forms of search and browsing enhanced by existing semantic metadata repository tools.
* Specifying metadata profiles for partners inside and outside the project that enable them to federate with the platform.
* Adapting and/or configuring the existing systems provided by the partners to interoperate with the main integrated VOA3R service, thus achieving a significant mass of open access content.
* Running real-use pilots with target communities that enable data gathering and experimentation with the solution.
* Analyzing data and assessment results from the pilots in order to elaborate a roadmap and guidelines for the evolution of the platform and for its transfer to other domains.

'''Wadi International University''' ({{lang-ar|جامعة الوادي الدولية الخاصة}}), commonly referred to as the German Syrian University, is a private, internationally oriented university, located in [[Wadi al-Nasara]] in [[Syria]].

The university was founded by German Syrian immigrants living in Germany with strong connections to German higher education institutions. The university was initially named as WGSU, Wadi German Syrian University, but was later changed to WIU, Wadi International University. WIU made strong agreements with multiple German universities such as [[Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/home/rpoe/presse_medien/pressemitteilungen/pmi_2010/pressemitteilungen_august_2010/pm_77_2010.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Oldenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kooperation-international.de/syrien/themes/info/detail/data/10485&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brandenburg University of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tu-cottbus.de/modul/11167&lt;/ref&gt; to support its faculties and to distinguish itself from other private universities in Syria. WIU is the only university in Syria that teaches its programs in English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The university offers ten bachelor degrees, and is organized into three faculties. WIU has a student body of approximately 2500 undergraduate students.

==Dual degrees==
WIU made strong agreements with multiple German universities such as [[Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/home/rpoe/presse_medien/pressemitteilungen/pmi_2010/pressemitteilungen_august_2010/pm_77_2010.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Oldenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kooperation-international.de/syrien/themes/info/detail/data/10485&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brandenburg University of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tu-cottbus.de/modul/11167&lt;/ref&gt; to offer dual degrees in many of its bachelors. In order to achieve the dual degrees, prospective students have to finish a semester at the German university, which resulted in a very strong exchange student program. Every year a large number of students from the different departments travel to Germany to finish their respective semester in order to achieve the dual degree. The engineering and management students mostly attend the [[Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg]] and the architecture student attend the [[Brandenburg University of Technology]].

== Organization ==
The university has three faculties:

* Faculty of Engineering
* Faculty of Management
* Faculty of Pharmacy

The university offers bachelor degrees in the following majors:
* Computer Engineering      (5 Year program)
* Communications Engineering      (5 Year program)
* Business Informatics      (5 Year program)
* Architecture      (5 Year program)
* Civil Engineering      (5 Year  program)
* Business Administration      (4 Year program)
* E-Marketing      (4 Year program)
* E-Banking      (4 Year program)
* Management and E-Business      (4 Year program)
* Pharmacy      (5 Year program)

==Funds Recovered Through the Whistle-blowing Policy==
It was reported that within the first two months of the Whistle-blowing policy in Nigeria that Nigeria's Federal Government recovered over $178 million that were stolen from the government. By June 5, 2017, Federal Ministry of Finance received a total of 2,150 tips from the public, 128 tips came through the website of the ministry, 1,192 was through phone calls, 540 through SMS and 290 through email to the ministry.

==Whistle-blower Protection==
To protect whistle-blowers, civil society organizations have been engaged in a number of advocacy to ensure that people who blow whistle are protected. [[MacArthur Foundation]] is currently funding African Centre for Media &amp; Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) to launch a whistle-blower campaign known as Corruption Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=African Centre for Media &amp; Information Literacy|first1=AFRICMIL|title=X-raying Nigeria’s whistle blower policy|url=http://www.africmil.org/x-raying-nigerias-whistle-blower-policy/|website=AFRICMIL|publisher=AFRICMIL|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Premium Times|title=Group launches ‘Corruption Anonymous’ to aid whistle blower policy|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/224660-group-launches-corruption-anonymous-aid-whistle-blower-policy.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|publisher=Premium Times|date=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Health advocates have urged Nigeria government to use the recovered funds to fund immunization and other health issues in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Umeha|first1=Chioma|title=Nigerian Youths Call For Sustainable Immunisation Financing Plan|url=https://independent.ng/nigerian-youths-call-for-sustainable-immunisation-financing-plan/|accessdate=19 April 2018|publisher=Independent|date=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Trufant Foster''' (January 18, 1879 – October 8, 1950), was an American educator and economist, whose theories were especially influential in the 1920s. He was the first president of [[Reed College]].

== Career ==
Foster was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on January 18, 1879. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with an A.B. in 1901 and an A.M., 1904. Foster was an instructor of English at [[Bates College]] in Maine, from 1901–03 and served as a coach of Bates' internationally known debate program. Foster was also professor of English and Argumentation at  [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine in 1905. He authored "Argumentation and Debating", published in 1908. Foster eventually received a Ph.D. in 1911 from Teachers College,  [[Columbia University]]. His conception of "the ideal college" set out in the concluding chapter of his dissertation, led to his appointment as the first president of [[Reed College]], 1911–1919. He rejected intercollegiate sports and fostered close intellectual collaboration between faculty and students. He was director (1920–1950) of the Pollak Foundation of Economic Research, in  [[Newton, Massachusetts]], where he emphasized the need to protect consumer interests.

== Economics ==
He collaborated with his Harvard classmate [[Waddill Catchings]] in a series of economics books that were highly influential in the United States in the 1920s. His influential books, written with Catchings, were  ''Money'' (1923), ''Profits'' (1925), ''Business Without a Buyer'' (1927), ''The Road to Plenty'' (1928), and ''Progress and Plenty'' (1930).

With Catchings, he was one of the leading pre-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] economists, in the [[underconsumptionist]] tradition, advocating similar issues to Keynes such as the [[paradox of thrift]] and [[economic interventionism]]. The two are now rarely mentioned in contemporary economics texts, standing as they do in the shadow of Keynes's ''[[The General Theory]].''

Foster and Catchings rejected traditional [[laissez-faire economics]] and called for aggressive federal involvement to balance the economy lest destabilizing forces upset prosperity. The main problem was [[underconsumption]], which could be overcome by strategic government spending in [[public works]]. The theory strongly influenced the anti-depression programs of [[Herbert Hoover]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], as well as Federal Reserve Board Chairman [[Marriner Eccles]].
