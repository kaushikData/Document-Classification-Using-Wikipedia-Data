      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In [[Hindu mythology]] '''Adi''' is an [[asura]] killed by [[Shiva]] for taking the disguise of Shiva's consort [[Parvati]].

== Story ==
Adi was a powerful demon like his father [[Andhaka]]. He decided to avenge his father's death by killing Shiva. But he knew that Shiva was powerful and invincible. Adi did [[tapasya]] to please [[Brahma]]. When Brahma appeared before him, he was unable to express his desire clearly. Brahma took advantage of the ambiguity of the words and granted him the boon, but with the twist that made him invincible only when he was in the form of a demon, not in any disguise. Adi was aware of this limitation. He thought he was ready to face Shiva and kill him. Armed with the power he got from Brahma, he went to Mount [[Kailasha]], the abode of Shiva, in the guise of a snake, because snakes were allowed to enter Kailash freely. But when he tried to enter into the presence of Shiva in the guise of [[Parvati]], Shiva recognized him and killed him instantly.

== Another Version ==
Another version of the story tells us that Brahma granted him another boon that he can learn warfare under Shiva. Adi started to train under Shiva. However, after a few years he started to trouble the residents of Mount Kailasha. Adi appeared as Parvati in front of Shiva and asked him for one more chance. However Shiva realised this was Adi and killed him with his [[trishula]]. Adi begged for forgiveness and Shiva gave him [[moksha]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7178">'''Ambrosians''' are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around [[Milan]] and also a 16th-century sect of [[Anabaptist Ambrosians]].

==Orders==
[[File:AmbroseOfMilan.jpg|thumb|225px|Late Antique Mosaic of Saint Ambrose (~337-397) in [[Sant'Ambrogio]] church, [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], [[Italy]], possibly an actual portrait made in his lifetime]]

Only the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the Fratres S. Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a [[Papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Gregory XI]] addressed to the [[monk]]s of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ambrosians|volume=1|page=800}} This further references Herzog-Hauck's [[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge|''Realencyklopadie'']], i. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Ambrose]], Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found [[Religious orders#Catholic tradition|religious orders]], though he took an interest in the [[Christian monasticism|monastic life]] and watched over its beginnings in his [[diocese]], providing for the needs of a [[monastery]] outside the walls of Milan, as [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] recounts in his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: ''De virginibus'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'', ''De institutione virginis'', ''De exhortatione virginitatis'', and ''De lapsu virginis consecratae''. Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Ambrosians|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===Order of St Ambrose===
The first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some  priests. In 1375 [[Pope Gregory XI]] gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name "Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus" and adopted a habit consisting of a brown [[tunic]], [[scapular]], and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of [[prior]] who was then instituted by the [[Archbishop of Milan]]. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In 1441 [[Pope Eugene IV]] merged them into one congregation called "Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus", made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two "visitors".&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. In 1589 [[Pope Sixtus V]] united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the "Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life" (or  "Apostolini" or "Brothers of St. Barnabas"), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union  was confirmed by [[Pope Paul V]] in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by [[Pope Innocent X]] in 1650.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===Nuns===
The Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]], but were independent in government. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life.  Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

Another group of cloistered "Nuns of St Ambrose", also called the Annunciatae (Italian: ''Annunziate'') of Lombardy or "Sisters of St Marcellina", were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint [[Catharine Fieschi Adorno]], who died on September 14, 1510.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

===Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles===
{{Main|Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles}}
In some sense also "Ambrosians" are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St [[Charles Borromeo]], Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of "Priests of Peace". In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of "Oblates of St. Ambrose." They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by [[Napoleon I]] in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of "Oblates of St. Charles" and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the "Oblates of St Charles", established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.&lt;ref name="Catholic"/&gt;

'''Avalokiteśvara''' or '''Padmapani''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ʌ|v|əl|oʊ|k|ɪ|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|v|ər|ə}} {{respell|UV|əl|oh|kih|TAY|shvər|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/avalokitesvara "Avalokitesvara"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-sa|अवलोकितेश्वर}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] who embodies the [[compassion]] of all [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]]. This bodhisattva is variably depicted, described and portrayed in different cultures as either male or female.&lt;ref name="leighton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leighton |first=Taigen Dan |authorlink=Taigen Dan Leighton |title=Bodhisattva Archetypes: Classic Buddhist Guides to Awakening and Their Modern Expression |publisher=Penguin Arkana |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=158–205|oclc=37211178 |isbn=0140195564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet]], he is known as Chenrezik, and in [[Cambodia]] as "អវលោកិតេស្វរៈ".&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chinese Buddhism]], Avalokiteśvara has evolved into the somewhat different female figure '''[[Guanyin]]'''. In Japan this figure is known as '''Kanzeon''' or '''Kannon'''.

==Etymology==
The name ''Avalokiteśvara'' combines the verbal prefix ''ava'' "down", ''lokita'', a past participle of the verb ''lok'' "to notice, behold, observe", here used in an active sense; and finally ''[[ishvara|īśvara]]'', "lord", "ruler", "sovereign" or "master". In accordance with [[sandhi]] (Sanskrit rules of sound combination), ''a''+''īśvara'' becomes ''eśvara''. Combined, the parts mean "lord who gazes down (at the world)". The word ''[[loka]]'' ("world") is absent from the name, but the phrase is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Studholme p. 52-54, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It does appear in the Cambodian form of the name, ''Lokesvarak''.

The earliest translation of the name into Chinese by authors such as [[Xuanzang]] was as ''Guānzìzài'' ({{zh|c=觀自在}}), not the form used in [[East Asian Buddhism]] today, '''''[[Guanyin]]''''' ({{zh|c=觀音}}). It was initially thought that this was due to a lack of fluency, as ''Guanzizai'' indicates the original Sanskrit form was  ''Avalokitasvara'', "who looks down upon sound" (i.e., the cries of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] who need help).&lt;ref name="Red Pine 2004 pg 44-45"&gt;[[Red Pine (author)|Pine, Red]]. ''The Heart Sutra: The Womb of the Buddhas'' (2004) Shoemaker 7 Hoard. {{ISBN|1-59376-009-4}} pg 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; It is now understood that was the original form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lokesh Chandra |authorlink=Lokesh Chandra |date=1984 |title=The Origin of Avalokitesvara |url=http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol13/vol13_art13_CHANDRA.pdf |journal=Indologica Taurinensia |volume=XIII (1985-1986) |pages=189–190 |publisher=International Association of Sanskrit Studies |accessdate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205922/http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol13/vol13_art13_CHANDRA.pdf |archivedate=June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mironov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mironov|first1=N. D.|title=Buddhist Miscellanea|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1927|volume=2|pages=241–252|jstor=25221116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is also the origin of ''Guanyin'' "Perceiving sound, cries". This translation was favored by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably [[Kumārajīva]], to use the variant {{lang|zh|觀世音}} ''Guānshìyīn'' "who perceives the world's lamentations"—wherein ''lok'' was read as simultaneously meaning both "to look" and "world" (Sanskrit ''loka''; {{zh|c=世|p=shì}}).&lt;ref name="Red Pine 2004 pg 44-45"/&gt; The original form ''Avalokitasvara'' appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century.&lt;ref name="Studholme p. 52-57"&gt;Studholme p. 52-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier Sanskrit name was supplanted by the form containing the ending ''-īśvara'' "lord"; but ''Avalokiteśvara'' does not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century.

The original meaning of the name fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an ''īśvara'' shows a strong influence of [[Hinduism]], as the term ''īśvara'' was usually connected to the Hindu notion of [[Vishnu]] (in [[Vaishnavism]]) or [[Shiva|Śiva]] (in [[Shaivism]]) as the [[God|Supreme Lord]], Creator and Ruler of the world. Some attributes of such a god were transmitted to the bodhisattva, but the mainstream of those who venerated Avalokiteśvara upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god.&lt;ref&gt;Studholme p. 30-31, 37-52.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dalai Lama boy.jpg|left|thumb|14th Dalai Lama, at his enthronement ceremony, February 22, 1940 in Lhasa, Tibet]]

In Sanskrit, Avalokiteśvara is also referred to as ''Padmapāni'' ("Holder of the Lotus") or ''Lokeśvara'' ("Lord of the World"). In [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], Avalokiteśvara is ''Chenrézik'', ({{bo|t=སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས་}}) and is said to emanate as the [[Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =From Birth to Exile  | publisher =The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama  | url =http://www.dalailama.com/page.4.htm  | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020031138/http://www.dalailama.com/page.4.htm#discovery| archivedate= 20 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Karmapa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Martin  | first =Michele  | title =His Holiness the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa  | work =Music in the Sky: The Life, Art, and Teachings of the 17th Karmapa  | publisher =Karma Triyana Dharmachakra  | year =2003  | url =http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/karmapa/index.php  | accessdate =  2007-10-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014185000/http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/karmapa/index.php| archivedate= 14 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary |publisher=Dhagpo Kundreul Ling |url=http://www.dhagpo-kundreul.org/anglais/glossaire/gloss_k_en.html |accessdate=2007-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808134917/http://www.dhagpo-kundreul.org/anglais/glossaire/gloss_k_en.html |archivedate=2007-08-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other high [[lama]]s. An etymology of the Tibetan name Chenrézik is ''spyan'' "eye", ''ras'' "continuity" and ''gzig'' "to look".

===Mahayana account===
According to the ''[[Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra|Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]'', the sun and moon are said to be born from Avalokiteśvara's eyes, [[Shiva]] from his brow, [[Brahma]] from his shoulders, [[Narayana]] from his heart, [[Sarasvati]] from his teeth, the winds from his mouth, the earth from his feet, and the sky from his stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002). ''The Origins of Om Manipadme Hum: A Study of the Karandavyuha Sutra.'' State University of New York Press. pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text and others, such as the ''Longer Sukhavativyuha Sutra'', Avalokiteśvara is an attendant of [[Amitabha]].&lt;ref&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002). ''The Origins of Om Manipadme Hum: A Study of the Karandavyuha Sutra.'' State University of New York Press. pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' is generally accepted to be the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, John (2003). ''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art'': p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; These are found in the ''Lotus Sutra'' chapter 25 ({{zh|c=觀世音菩薩普門品}}). This chapter is devoted to Avalokiteśvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name. A total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokiteśvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. The chapter consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sutra, called the ''Avalokiteśvara Sūtra'' ({{zh|c=觀世音經|p=Guānshìyīn jīng}}), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, Helen (2002). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism'': p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chenrezigthangka.jpg|thumb|Four-armed [[Tibet]]an form of Avalokiteśvara.|370x370px]]

When the Chinese monk [[Faxian]] traveled to [[Mathura]] in India around 400 CE, he wrote about monks presenting offerings to Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref name="Kok Kiang 2004. p. 10"&gt;Ko Kok Kiang. ''Guan Yin: Goddess of Compassion.'' 2004. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Xuanzang]] traveled to India in the 7th century, he provided eyewitness accounts of Avalokiteśvara statues being venerated by devotees from all walks of life: kings, to monks, to laypeople.&lt;ref name="Kok Kiang 2004. p. 10"/&gt; 
[[File:Avalokiteśvara - Padmapani, Ajanta Caves (4243433392).jpg|thumb|349x349px|Avalokiteśvara / Padmapani, [[Ajanta Caves]], [[India]]]]
In [[Chinese Buddhism]] and East Asia, [[Tangmi]] practices for the 18-armed form of Avalokiteśvara called [[Cundi (Buddhism)|Cundī]] are very popular. These practices have their basis in the early Indian [[Vajrayana]]: her origins lie with a [[yakshini]] cult in Bengal and Orissa, and her name in Sanskrit "connotes a prostitute or other woman of low caste but specifically denotes a prominent local ogress ... whose divinised form becomes the subject of an important Buddhist cult starting in the eighth century".{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=204}} The popularity of Cundī is attested by the three extant translations of the ''Cundī Dhāraṇī Sūtra'' from Sanskrit to Chinese, made from the end of the seventh century to the beginning of the eighth century.&lt;ref name="Studholme, Alexander 2002 p. 175"&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002). ''The Origins of Oṃ Maṇipadme Hūṃ: A Study of the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra'': p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; In [[History of China#Late Imperial China|late imperial China]], these early esoteric traditions still thrived in Buddhist communities. Robert Gimello has also observed that in these communities, the esoteric practices of Cundī were extremely popular among both the populace and the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, Wu (2008). ''Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth-Century China'': p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tiantai]] school, six forms of Avalokiteśvara are defined. Each of the bodhisattva's six qualities are said to break the hindrances respectively of the six realms of existence: hell-beings, [[preta]]s, animals, humans, [[Asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s, and [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s.

===Theravāda account===

[[File:Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara-BMA.jpg|thumb|Bronze statue of Avalokiteśvara from [[Sri Lanka]], ca. 750 CE|349x349px]]

Veneration of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva has continued to the present day in [[Sri Lanka]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In times past both ''Tantrayana'' and ''Mahayana'' have been found in some of the ''Theravada'' countries, but today the Buddhism of Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia is almost exclusively ''Theravada'', based on the Pali Canon. The only ''Mahayana'' deity that has entered the worship of ordinary Buddhists in ''Theravada'' countries is ''Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara''. In Ceylon he is known as ''Natha-deva'' and mistaken by the majority for the Buddha yet to come, ''Bodhisattva Maitreya''. The figure of ''Avalokitesvara'' usually is found in the shrine room near the Buddha image.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya Bodhisattva; however, traditions and basic iconography (including an image of Amitābha Buddha on the front of the crown) identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/lanka/matara/we01.html|title=Art &amp; Archaeology - Sri Lanka - Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Skilton writes:&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... It is clear from sculptural evidence alone that the Mahāyāna was fairly widespread throughout [Sri Lanka], although the modern account of the history of Buddhism on the island presents an unbroken and pure lineage of Theravāda. (One can only assume that similar trends were transmitted to other parts of Southeast Asia with Sri Lankan ordination lineages.) Relics of an extensive cult of Avalokiteśvara can be seen in the present-day figure of Nātha.}}
Avalokiteśvara is popularly worshiped in [[Myanmar]], where he is called ''Lokanat'' or lokabyuharnat, and [[Thailand]], where he is called ''Lokesvara''. The bodhisattva goes by many other names. In Indochina and Thailand, he is ''Lokesvara'', "The Lord of the World." In Tibet he is ''Chenrezig'', also spelled Spyan-ras gzigs, "With a Pitying Look." In China, the bodhisattva takes a female form and is called ''Guanyin'' (also spelled Quanyin, Kwan Yin, Kuanyin or Kwun Yum), "Hearing the Sounds of the World." In Japan, Guanyin is ''Kannon'' or Kanzeon; in Korea, ''Gwan-eum''; in Vietnam, ''Quan Am''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thoughtco.com/avalokiteshvara-bodhisattva-450135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern scholarship===
Avalokiteśvara is worshipped as Nātha in Sri Lanka. [[Buddhism amongst Tamils|Tamil Buddhist]] tradition developed in [[Chola literature]], such as in Buddamitra's ''Virasoliyam '', states that the [[Vedic]] sage [[Agastya]] learnt Tamil from Avalokiteśvara. The earlier Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] recorded a temple dedicated to Avalokitesvara in the South Indian [[Mount Potalaka]], a Sanskritzation of [[Pothigai]], where Tamil Hindu tradition places Agastya having learnt the Tamil language from [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Iravatham Mahadevan (2003), ''EARLY TAMIL EPIGRAPHY'', Volume 62. pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri (1963) Development of Religion in South India - Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Layne Ross Little (2006) ''Bowl Full of Sky: Story-making and the Many Lives of the Siddha Bhōgar'', pp. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Avalokitesvara worship gained popularity with the growth of the [[Abhayagiri vihāra]]'s [[Tamraparni]]yan Mahayana sect.
[[File:Pothigai Hills Range.jpg|thumb|[[Pothigai|Pothigai Malai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], proposed as the original [[Mount Potalaka]] in [[India]]|262x262px]]

Western scholars have not reached a consensus on the origin of the reverence for Avalokiteśvara. Some have suggested that Avalokiteśvara, along with many other supernatural beings in Buddhism, was a borrowing or absorption by [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] of one or more deities from [[Hinduism]], in particular Shiva or [[Vishnu]]. This seems to be based on the name Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref name="Studholme p. 52-57"/&gt;

On the basis of study of Buddhist scriptures, ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literary sources, as well as field survey, the Japanese scholar Shu Hikosaka proposes the hypothesis that, the ancient mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the ''[[Gandavyuha|Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]'' and Xuanzang’s ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', is the real mountain [[Pothigai]] in [[Ambasamudram]], [[Tirunelveli]], [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirosaka, Shu. ''The Potiyil Mountain in Tamil Nadu and the origin of the Avalokiteśvara cult''&lt;/ref&gt; Shu also says that mount Potalaka has been a sacred place for the people of [[South India]] from time immemorial. It is the traditional residence of [[Siddhar]] [[Agastya]], at [[Agastya Mala]]. With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning at the time of the great king [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists, who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of the Hindu religion. The mixed Hindu-Buddhist cult culminated in the formation of the figure of Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref name=ML&gt;{{cite news | first=Märt | last=Läänemets| authorlink=

The name Lokeśvara should not be confused with that of [[Lokeśvararāja]], the Buddha under whom Dharmakara became a monk and made forty-eight vows before becoming [[Amitābha]].

==Mantras and Dharanis==
[[File:OM MANI PADME HUM.svg|thumb|OṂ MAŅI PADME HǕṂ. The six syllable [[mantra]] of Avalokiteśvara written in the [[Tibetan alphabet]].|262x262px]]
Mahāyāna Buddhism relates Avalokiteśvara to the six-syllable [[mantra]] {{IAST|[[om mani padme hum|oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ]]}}.
{{Anchor|Shadakshari}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], due to his association with this mantra, one form of Avalokiteśvara is called ''Ṣaḍākṣarī'' "Lord of the Six Syllables" in [[Sanskrit]]. Recitation of this mantra while using [[Buddhist prayer beads|prayer beads]] is the most popular religious practice in Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002). ''The Origins of Oṃ Maṇipadme Hūṃ: A Study of the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra'': p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between this famous mantra and Avalokiteśvara is documented for the first time in the ''{{IAST|[[Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra]]}}''. This text is dated to around the late 4th century CE to the early 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002) ''The Origins of Oṃ Maṇipadme Hūṃ: A Study of the Kāraṇḍavyūha sūtra'': p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In this sūtra, a bodhisattva is told by the Buddha that recitation of this mantra while focusing on the sound can lead to the attainment of eight hundred [[samadhi|samādhis]].&lt;ref&gt;Studholme, Alexander (2002). ''The Origins of Oṃ Maṇipadme Hūṃ: A Study of the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra'': p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra}}'' also features the first appearance of the [[dhāraṇī]] of [[Cundi (Buddhism)|Cundī]], which occurs at the end of the sūtra text.&lt;ref name="Studholme, Alexander 2002 p. 175"/&gt; After the bodhisattva finally attains samādhi with the mantra "oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ", he is able to observe 77 koṭīs of fully enlightened buddhas replying to him in one voice with the Cundī Dhāraṇī: {{IAST|namaḥ saptānāṃ samyaksaṃbuddha koṭīnāṃ tadyathā, oṃ cale cule cunde svāhā.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapislazulitexts.com/tripitaka/T20_1077|title=Saptakoṭibuddhamātṛ Cundī Dhāraṇī Sūtra|publisher=Lapis Lazuli Texts|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shingon Buddhism]], the mantra for Avalokiteśvara is {{nihongo||おん あるりきゃ そわか|On aruri kya sowa ka|lead=yes}}

The [[Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī]] is an 82-syllable dhāraṇī for Avalokiteśvara.

==Thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara==
[[File:Thousand Armed Avalokitesvara - Guanyin Nunnery - 1.jpeg|thumb|Thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara. [[Guanyin]] women's [[vihara]], [[Anhui]], China|349x349px]]

One prominent Buddhist story tells of Avalokiteśvara vowing never to rest until he had freed all sentient beings from [[saṃsāra]]. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. [[Amitābha]], seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara tries to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Tibetan Buddhist beliefs==
Avalokiteśvara is an important deity in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He is regarded in the [[Vajrayana]] teachings as a Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Еше-Лодой Рипоче. Краткое объяснение сущности Ламрима. Спб.-Улан-Удэ, 2002. С. 19 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibetan Buddhism, [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tãrã]] came into existence from a single tear shed by Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref name="leighton"/&gt; When the tear fell to the ground it created a lake, and a lotus opening in the lake revealed Tara. In another version of this story, Tara emerges from the heart of Avalokiteśvara. In either version, it is Avalokiteśvara's outpouring of compassion which manifests Tãrã as a being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen|authorlink=Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen|title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qLfqTWd8-gC&amp;pg=PA21|year=1996|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-932-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Miranda|authorlink=Miranda Shaw|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12758-1 | page = 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bokar Tulku Rinpoche|authorlink=Bokar Tulku Rinpoche|title=Chenrezig, Lord of Love: Principles and Methods of Deity Meditation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSHSPQAACAAJ|year=1991|publisher=ClearPoint Press|isbn=978-0-9630371-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iowa catlinite pipe wanampito.jpg|thumb|Protohistoric Catlinite pipe, probably late 17th century [[Ioway]], from the [[Iowa archaeology|Wanampito]] site in [[Iowa]].]]

'''Catlinite''' (also called '''pipestone''') is a type of [[argillite]] ([[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[mudstone]]), usually brownish-red in color, which occurs in a [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of [[Sioux Quartzite]]. Because it is fine-grained and easily worked, it is prized by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], primarily those of the [[Plains Indians|Plains nations]] for use in making [[ceremonial pipe]]s such as [[chanunpa]]s. Pipestone quarries are located and preserved in [[Pipestone National Monument]] outside [[Pipestone, Minnesota]], in [[Pipestone County, Minnesota]], and at the Pipestone River in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

==Name==
The term ''Catlinite'' came into use after the American painter [[George Catlin]] visited the quarries in Minnesota in 1835; but it was [[Philander Prescott]] who first wrote about the rock in 1832, noting that evidence indicated that [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] had been using the quarries since at least as far back as 1637.

==Varieties==
[[Image:Black hawk calumet.jpg|thumb|[[Ceremonial pipe]] bowl of catlinite used by [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], on display at [[Black Hawk State Historic Site]] in [[Illinois]].]]
Minnesota catlinite is buttery smooth and can be cut with a regular hacksaw or even a knife, it comes out of the ground a pinkish color often with a cream layer protecting it from the hard quartzite. It is weaker and more subject to breaking under stress than Utah pipestone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://littlefeathercenter.50megs.com/Catlinite.html/ Little Feather Interpretive Center, Pipestone.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115013916/http://littlefeathercenter.50megs.com/Catlinite.html/ |date=January 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most catlinite deposits exist beneath the level of groundwater or are in deep enough layers where the soil is constantly moist as the iron compounds which give catlinite its red color quickly convert into iron oxides when exposed to the elements and the stone degrades and breaks down.{{citation needed|reason=clarify|date=July 2015}}

The red catlinite from the Pipestone, Minnesota quarries is a soft [[claystone]] bed which occurs between layers of hard [[Sioux Quartzite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/pipe/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm Geologic Formations, Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Only hand tools are used to reach the catlinite so it takes a long time to get to it. Only enrolled Native Americans are allowed to quarry for the stone at the Pipestone National Monument, and thus it is protected from over-mining. Another quarry is located near [[Hayward, Wisconsin]] on the reservation, which the Ojibwa have used for centuries. The stone there is harder than the stone from Pipestone National Monument.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Image:Pipestone1.jpg|thumb|right|High grade red pipestone from [[Delta, Utah]].]]
Utah pipestone has a more variable range of hard and soft forms, since it occurs as layers between deposits of harder [[slate]]s. Utah pipestone is a by-product of slate mining in Delta, Utah, and several natural deposits have been mined and used for pipemaking by Native Americans in the area for millennia.

The Canadian quarry is no longer used, although there are quarries in Canada where another type of pipestone, [[Ceremonial pipe#Pipestone varieties|black stone]], is gleaned. The [[Ojibwe]] use both the red and black stone for their sacred pipes.

Catlinite is often used to make the hollow tubes in [[pipeclay triangle]]s.

==Other varieties of pipestone==
{{main|Ceremonial pipe#Pipestone varieties}}

A large range of pipestones exist, not just those in Minnesota, and numerous Native American tribes use a variety of materials in addition to catlinite for pipemaking.

===Pipe clay===
[[Smoking pipe]]s molded from wet [[clay]] are different from those where the bowl is carved from solid pipestone and then fitted with a wooden stem (as is the case with Catlinite pipes).

The [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] are social smokers, and use molded clay pipes for this purpose.

In the United Kingdom, since the 17th century "pipe-clay" has meant a pale, whitish clay. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines it as "fine white kind of clay, which forms a ductile paste with water". It is traditionally used for all sorts of polishing and whitening purposes as well as for making [[tobacco pipe]]s and pottery.

'''''Cercle Proudhon''''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁklə pʁudɔ̃}}; [[French language|French]] for '''Circle Proudhon''') was a political group founded in France on December 16, 1911 by [[George Valois]] and [[Édouard Berth]]. The group was inspired by [[Georges Sorel]] and a selective reading of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]].

==History==
The first issue of ''Cahiers du cercle Proudhon'' appeared in January &amp;ndash; February 1912 and included a ''Déclaration'':
{{quote|The founders &amp;ndash; republicans, federalists, [[Integralism|integral nationalists]], and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] &amp;ndash; having resolved the political problem or dismissed it from their minds, are all enthusiastically in favour of an organisation of French society in accordance with principles taken from the French tradition which they find in [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]'s works and in the contemporary syndicalist movement, and they are all completely in agreement on the following points:}}
{{quote|[[Democracy]] is the greatest error of the past century. If one wishes to live, if one wishes to work, if one wishes in social life to possess the greatest human guarantees for production and culture, if one wishes to preserve and increase the moral, intellectual and material capital of civilisation, it is absolutely necessary to destroy all democratic institutions.}}

Berth and Valois had been brought together by [[Georges Sorel]] when he was planning a [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]]-leaning journal ''La Cité française'' in 1910. This journal never appeared, except as heralded in a flyer entitled ''Déclaration de la Cité francaise'' signed by Sorel, Valois, Berth, [[Jean Variot]], and [[Pierre Gilbert]]. However Variot quarrelled with Valois and went on to publish material with Sorel's support in ''[[L'Indépendence]]''.

A controversial but influential book by [[Zeev Sternhell]], ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'', points to the Cercle Proudhon as a pre-existing laboratory for fascist ideas that would provide a bulwark for Nazi collaboration in Vichy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|title=Neither Right Nor Left|year=1986|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In place of the bourgeois ideology and as an alternative to democratic socialism, the Cercle Proudhon propounded a new ethic suited to the alliance of nationalism and syndicalism, those "two synthesizing and convergent movements, one at the extreme right and the other at the extreme left, that have begun the siege and assault on democracy." Their solution was thus intended as a complete replacement of the liberal order. They wished to create a new world — virile, heroic, pessimistic, and puritanical — based on the sense of duty and sacrifice: a world where a morality of warriors and monks would prevail. They wanted a society dominated by a powerful avant-garde, a proletarian elite, an aristocracy of producers, joined in alliance against the decadent bourgeoisie with an intellectual youth avid for action. When the time came, it would not be difficult for a synthesis of this kind to take on the name of fascism.}}

Many [[anarchist]]s rejected the Cercle Proudhon interpretation of Proudhon's works. For example, American [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]] argued that Cercle Proudhon purposely misrepresented Proudhon's views,
{{quote|Democracy is an easy mark for this new party, and it finds its chief delight in pounding the philosopher of democracy, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. Now, nobody ever pounded Rousseau as effectively as Proudhon did, and in that fact the Cercle Proudhon finds its excuse. But it is not to be inferred that, because Proudhon destroyed Rousseau's theory of the [[social contract]], he did not believe in the advisability of a social contract, or would uphold a [[monarchy]] in exacting an oath of allegiance (''Proudhon and Royalism'', 1913).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26204">{{History of the Philippines}}

The Sultanates of [[Mindanao (province)|Lanao]] in [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]] were founded in the 16th century through the influence of [[Shariff Kabungsuan]], who was enthroned as first [[Sultan]] of [[Maguindanao]] in 1520. The [[Maranao]]s of Lanao were acquainted with the [[Sultan|sultanate system]] when [[Islam]] was introduced to the area by [[Muslim]] missionaries and traders from the [[Middle East]], [[India]]n and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] regions who propagated Islam to [[Sulu]] and [[Maguindanao]].

Unlike in Sulu and Maguindanao, the Sultanate system in Lanao was uniquely [[decentralized]]. The area was divided into Four Sovereign States of Lanao or the ''Pat a Phangampong a Ranao'' which are composed of a number of royal houses (Sapolo ago nem a Panoroganan or The Sixteen (16) Royal Houses) with specific territorial jurisdictions within mainland Mindanao. This decentralized structure of royal power in Lanao was adopted by the founders, and maintained up to the present day, in recognition of the shared power and prestige of the ruling clans in the area, emphasizing the values of unity of the nation ([[:wikt:unity|''Kaiisaisa o Bangsa'']]), patronage (''kaseselai'') and fraternity ([[:wikt:friendly|''kaphapagaria'']]).

They had maintained and had successfully defended their Sultanate from all Spanish attempts. After the last attempt, the Spanish never again ventured in all their duration in the Archipelago for 333 years.

==The Four Sovereign States==
{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianized kingdom}}
The four sovereign states of Lanao are:
* Unayan
* Masiu
* Bayabao
* Baloi

===The Present system===
The alleged unethical integration by the republican form of government under the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] without consent by the 1st Presidency of then [[Manuel Quezon]], the 1st [[Philippine Constitution]] since 1934 has prohibited the granting of titles of nobility to [[Philippines|Filipino]] citizens. Legally, the state does not recognise the Sultanate system.

The Sultanate system in Lanao has survived colonialism and non-recognition by state authorities. Like the sultanates in present-day Sultanate of Brunei, Republic of Indonesia, Federal Government of Malaysia and the Muslim region in the Kingdom of Thailand, sultanates in Mindanao have continued to exist despite its non-recognition.

In Lanao region (composed of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte), the Sultanate system has remained important as an integral part of the Maranao society, symbolizing royal authority, cultural heritage and Islamic influence. At present, Maranaos trace their lineage, legitimacy and authority through their ''Salsila'' that has chronicled the origins of the Lanao royal houses.

Despite having no legal recognition of the Sultanate system, the Royal Houses of Lanao are now protected ethnic and traditional houses when the Philippine government legislated the [http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1997/10/29/republic-act-no-8371/ Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997] which recognizes and promotes all the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities and [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|Indigenous Peoples]] of the Philippines.

==History of the Royal Houses==
Shariff Bangkaya begot two children from his 3rd wife Bae sa Matampay namely, Dakeneq of [[Malabang]] and Shariff Laut Buisan. [[Kapitan Laut Buisan|Shariff Laut Buisan]] was installed as 6th Sultan of [[Maguindanao]] in 1597, and was married to the sister of Sultan Batara Shah Tengah of [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]]. Shariff Laut Buisan begot Gayang and Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat. Gayang was married to the grandson of [[Dimasangcay Adel]] – Shariff Matonding, whose children reigned as the Sultans and Bai a Labi of [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]], while his brother [[Shariff Muhammad Kudarat]] was installed as 7th Sultan of Maguindanao in 1619. In 1656, Sultan Kudarat declared a [[jihad]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonialist. His [[Sultanate]] was felt as far as [[Ternate]] in [[Indonesia]] and [[Borneo]], and in fact, its power reached the shores of [[Bohol]], [[Cebu]], [[Panay]], [[Mindoro]] and [[Manila]] in north.

===Spanish Campaigns in Lanao===

In 1637, [[Sebastean Hurtado-de Curcuera]] decided to send an expedition to subdue the Datus and the people of [[Lake Lanao]]. As early as September 1637, he had promised the lake area to the [[Jesuits]], who would get the same the moment it was conquered.

The conquest of the [[Maranao]]s was entrusted to Captain [[Francesco Atienza]], the Alcalde Mayor of [[Caraga]]. With fifty Spaniards and five hundred Caragans, the captain landed in Bayug, then proceeded to the Maranao territory, reaching the lake on 4, April 1639. There were about 2,000 families or 800 inhabitants. The Spaniards brought with them six collapsible boats that they fitted out in the lake.

The Datus of Lanao initially stalled the Spaniards. They promised tribute and to accepted the missionaries. The allies of the Spaniards observed the movement of inhabitants into the interior. The Maranaos could easily muster 6,000 warriors from among the four confederation of Lanao. Lack of firearms though was their disadvantage although they have their traditional weapons. Governor Almonte dispatched Major Pedro Fernandez del Rio with 70 Spaniards and 500 Visayans to join with the forces of Atienza. 

The expedition had to pass through the area of [[Butig|Dalawn, Gandamatu &lt;small&gt;(''in Macadar'')&lt;/small&gt; and Nanagen]] where Shariff Matonding, who was married to Gayang, a sister of Sultan Kudarat, they engaged and harassed the reinforments of the colonizers. After a most difficult passage made by the fierce resistance of Shariff Matonding, Major Pedro del Rio finally made it to the shores of the lake where he join the forces of Atienza. In the middle of April, Capt Atienza and part of his troops left for Bayug and fortified it with a stockade and sailed for Caraga.

In October of the same year, an additional force of 50 Spaniards and 500 Boholanos arrived under the command of Captain Pedro Bermudez de Castro who had orders to build a fort in [[Marawi]] to start imposing Spanish sovereignty.

Sultan Kudarat visited his sons-in-law in Lanao, Balindong Bsar and [[Butig|Dianaton Naim of Butig]]. He gathered all the Datus of Lanao and delivered the now legendary speech in this form:

{{Cquote|What have you done? Do you realize what subjection would reduce you to? A toilsome slavery under the Spaniards! Turn your eyes to the subject nations and look at the misery to which such glorious nation had been reduced to, look at the Tagalog and Visayan: Are you better than they? Do you think that the Spaniards consider you of better stuff? Have you not seen the Spaniards trample them under their feet? Do you not see everyday how they are obliged to work at the oars and the factories with all their rigor? Can you tolerate anyone with little Spanish blood to best you up and grasp the fruits of your labor? Allow your selves to be subjects (today) and tomorrow you will be at the oars? I, at least will be a pilot, the biggest favor they will allow a chief. Do not let their sweet words deceive you; their promises facilities their deceits, which little by little, enable them to control everything. Reflect on how even minor promises as to the chief of other nations were not honored until they become master of them all. See now what is being done to these chief and how they are being led by rod.}}

The Maranaos, inspired by the Sultan's speech took up arms against the newly built fort. They used indigenous means to get at the fort and set it on fire. Three of the Spanish boats, brought from Bayug were captured. Atienza formed a relief expedition and saved the Spaniards. The Maranao warriors after 29 days of siege left their position. Afraid to experience once more the starvation and horrors of siege warfare, the Spaniards proceeded to burn their own fort and made a retreat back to [[Iligan]].

In 1640, Capt Atienza tried once more to conquer the Maranaos. For the second time, the Spaniards burned the fields and retired to the coast, but not without losing some men on the way due to ambushes. 

The second attempt to colonize and make Catholics of the Maranaos had utterly failed. In payment for their freedom, making true Sultan Kudarat's wisdom, the Maranaos lost that years harvest but remained unmolested until the coming of the American Capt John Pershing and his troops.

===Birth of the Sultanates in Lanao===
{{Pre-hispanic History of the Philippines}}
In Lanao, the Maranaos started to be acquainted with the sultanate system in the 15th century before [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Colonial Era]] through the influence of [[Shariff Kabungsuan]], who was enthroned as first Sultan of Maguindanao in 1520, In 1640 Balindong Bsar of the house of [[Masiu]] became the first Maranao Chieftain enthroned as Sultan, with specific title as Sultan Diagaborolah. He was charged to enforce the teaching of [[Islam]] and the law and order in Lanao. On the same year Sultan Diagaborolah consulted the seven Maranao Datus on how to govern Lanao. 

They were Dianaton Naim of Butig, [[Sultan|Sultan Mardan]] of [[Lumbatan, Lanao del Sur|Macadar]]. Datu Burus of Pagayawan, Datu Ottowa of Ditsaan, Datu Acari of Ramain, Onbaor of Bansaya, Engki-Okoda of Minitepad, Alanake of Baloi. The eight wise men (including Balindong Bsar) agreed to create the four sovereign states of Lanao (''Pat a Phangampong a Ranao'') composed of the States of Unayan, Masiu, Bayabao and Baloi, and the 16th Royal houses (''Panoroganan or Royal Houses'') and on a lower level, the 28 members of the legislative body (''Pyakambaya ko Taritib''), and the area sultans. 

The socio-political system was based on the Taritib, Ijma, laws, customary laws, and adapted practices of the Maranaos. The Phangampong system was further divided into smaller socio-political units. 

The Taritib, an ancient order or law bound together the four states or principalities of Lanao into an alliance or confederation and defined their relationships. There is no central, all powerful authority but every state or principality respected the traditional alliance termed Kangiginawai.

One problem that beset the sultanate of the four confederation of Lanao was the identification of ancestral land area (''Kawali'') of each state (''Phangampong''). They were consequently defined by Datu Pascan  of Unayan, Datu Popawan of [[Bayabao]], [[Sultan of Gandamatu Muhammad Nayef as|Amiyanon Simban]] of [[Masiu]] and Datu Dilion of [[Baloi, Lanao del Norte|Baloi]]. The agreement known as ''Kiatathamana-an'' delineated the areas as: Dalama, located in the municipality of Molondo, the boundary between Bayabao and East Masiu; Sawer, Masiu municipality the boundary between East Masiu municipality and East Unayan to Madamba municipality, the boundary between West Unayan and West Masiu; and Bacayawan in [[Marantao]] municipality, the boundary between west Masiu and Bayabao. Surprisingly, there is no identified boundary between Bayabao and Baloi but the reason is that both ''Pangampong'' lineage come from the same family tree. ''Under the Kiangginawai'' (friendship) their boundary need not be established.

In 1754, the Maranaos kept on increasing their maritime strength and accelerated their attacks on the Spaniards. Leyte and Calamianes bore part of the brunt of their attacks. About nine hundred Maranaos and Iranuns once landed to raid for slaves in [[Albay]] and captured more than a hundred inhabitants. In Balayan, Batangas, they looted everything they could lay their hands on. The Maranaos and Iranuns were thus responsible to discouraged the Pintados of the [[Visayas]] to come with the Spaniards into their forays in Mindanao and Sulu. 

The Maranaos and other Moros made these attacks since most of the native troops used against them were Visayans. The events prompted the Spaniards to devise a more elaborate and effective naval system of defense as the Visayans blames the Spanish Government to be unable to defend them even after giving yearly tribute to the Crown.

In 1757, the Iranuns and Maranaos accelerated their attacks on the Spaniards. There were frequent naval encounters between them and the Spaniards. In some of them, according to reports, thousands have perished.

In a span of four years, the Maranao raids for slaves on Visayas reduced the number of tributes to the [[Spanish government]] by at least 100,000. For example, figures showed that the district of [[Panay]], it paid 1,500 tributes in 1750. By the year 1757 there only 500 tributes paid. In [[Romblon]], the number of tributes went down from 1370 to 995, while in Kalibu ([[Capiz]]) it decreased from 1,164 to 549. Many coastal towns were totally destroyed and the Visayan population was reduced considerably.

In 1759, Datu Aber Palawan and his men attacked the Spanish squadron in the northern part of [[Mindanao]]. He was martyred and buried in Radapan, Lanao (now Tarapan, Linamon, [[Lanao del Norte]]).

General [[Valeriano Weyler]], the Spanish [[Governor General]], decided to deal with the Maranaos in 1889. He ordered his troops to land in [[Malabang]] (in Lanao) to conquer the unconquered Maranaos. He had 1,242 soldiers in two columns. The first column started from Malabang while the second column started from [[Iligan]]. (This two-pronged attack on Maranao territory from the northern and western parts of Mindanao was a reminiscent of the 1639 campaign against the Maranaos). After a few bloody clashes, Marawi was occupied on August 19, 1889, but not without encountering strong resistance from the Maranaos led by Datu Amai Pakpak. In September 1891, Weyler finally terminated his campaign without actually conquering the Maranaos. 

On May 15, 1892, Friar Pablo Pastel drafted the blue print for the temporal and spiritual conquest of the [[Sultanates in Philippines]] for the gradual reduction of the political and other powers of the Sultans, Datus, Shariffs and Panditas in such a way that they would all eventually become powerless. The Spaniards considered all the Moro communities as the primary obstacle in their conquest and colonisation of the whole Archipelago. 

On June 5, 1892, the Datus of Lanao cooperated in the fortification of the section around [[Agus River]] for their mutual defense. In February 1895, systematic Maranao attacks on the Spanish forts began. As a result, the Spanish invaders launched another Spanish expedition on March 10 of the same year to attack and capture Marawi, once and for all. The march to Marawi commenced. The Spaniards found themselves faced by strong cotta under the command of the same Amai Pakpak. The Maranao warriors fought with equal bravery but lost the war with the martyrdom of Datu Akader Amai Papak, his son, 23 datus and 150 Maranao warriors. The Spaniards lost 194 men. About 3,000 Spanish troops, and countless volunteer from [[Zamboaga|Zamboanga]], [[Misamis (province)|Misamis]] and [[Sibugay]] were involved. This did not stop the Maranaos to continue fighting. 

The Spanish [[garrison|Kotah]] in Marawi was in a state of siege. Sporadic attacks on the garrison and ambushes became the order of the day. The Maranaos around the lake continued their resistance against the Spaniards even after gunboats were brought to Lake Lanao to launch a campaign against the communities around it. Maranao efforts to wrest the area from the Spanish however proved fruitless as the Spanish held on to their conquered territory until they eventually withdrew, but only after their defeat to the Americans in the [[Spanish–American War]] which commenced on May 1, 1898.

===The American Regime and the Commonwealth===
In 1899, the Sultans themselves led their people in fighting both the Spaniards and later, the [[United States|American]]s. They all ended as martyrs along with their families and warriors. In 1889, the Americans landed in Malabang (Lanao) and occupied the Spanish camp without much fanfare and named it Camp Concuera. Two years later, the Americans proceeded to the lake area but were met by Maranao warriors in Upper [[Bayang]]: Amai Barang, Mamarinta, Pitiilan, Sultan of Bayang and 300 warriors clashed with the Americans in a fierce battle. The Sultan and his men were crushed. The Sultan of Bayang perished but Captain Vicar also died. (The American camp in Upper Bayang was named after him --- Camp Vicar, Lanao). In [[Tugaya]] (Lanao), Datu Saruang and many others also died fighting against the American forces coming to their place.

During the Commonwealth regime, Amai Manabilang of Marawi challenged the authority of Justice Cayetano Arellano, of the [[Philippine Supreme Court]], in enforcing the government laws to the Maranaos. He led a campaign that Mindanao should be separated from the Philippines. The policy of attraction of the Americans in Lanao under General Pershing offered empty promises to the Maranaos who felt that the government deprived them with the continued exercise of their traditional and cultural practices and interference to their religion, customs and traditions.

&lt;!--(add a separate article about Dansalan Declaration, upload a photo of Torogan-venue of DD signing)--&gt;

On March 18, 1935, one hundred twenty Datus of Lanao, with thirty Sultans signed a strongly worded letter, popularly known as "[[Dansalan Declaration]]" to U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress]] asking them that the Filipinos should be granted independence and the Moro Province should also be given their own independence or better left under American rule until such time that they were prepared to grant their independence to be known as [[Bangsamoro Republik]].

===The Sultanates of Lanao at Present and the Mindanao Problem===
The entire Sultanates in Mindanao, Philippines at present have legally been unrecognized and practically reduced to non-entities by a provision in the [[Philippines Constitution]] prohibiting the granting of a title of nobility to a Filipino citizen. It was the responsibility of the sultans not only to defend their people and communities but also their religion. Among the Muslims in Mindanao, there is no way one can separate the sultanate from their culture and tradition.

The Royal Sultanate could play a very important role especially because by accepted tradition, constituents respect and value Sultanate authority. For example, in the Preservation of Social Order.
* When there is no source of power except the Sultan, the community is stable. The Sultan has influence and command to impose and execute the highly respected Taritib and Ijma.
* When a dispute happens and the Sultan is not personally available to settle it, he can simply send his Tobao (scarf or headdress) through his emissary and it would be enough to make the parties stay "in suspended animation" and wait until he arrives to settle their dispute.
* The Sultan has the power to ask anyone within his territory to come for questioning, for punishment if he committed an offense or for anything that is for the interest of his people. He only needs to beat his gong and it is enough for the people to come him.
* When a buffalo is stolen by a person from another area, it becomes his duty to recover and restore it to the owner.
* When conflicts between Sultanates occur, it was the duty of another Sultan to come and talk to them for peaceful settlement. The common practice used by the Sultan in settling Ridos ([[feud]]s) even until now is tracing the family lineage of the conflicting parties with the ultimate end that both parties will realize that they are relatives either by affinity or by consanguinity. ''Kambabatabata-a'' (blood relations) ''Kapamagongowa'' (friendship) ''Kapamagadata'' (respect), and other relationships of the forefathers are being recalled. In most cases, disputes are resolved with tears flowing from the persons witnessing or present in the scene.

==The 17 Ruling Royal Sultanates in Lanao==
The original number of the ruling Royal Sultans of Lanao was only fifteen (15). It is now increased to seventeen (17) with the creation of Sultan a Domalondong sa Butig  Hence, it was recently renamed as the 17 "Panoroganans of Lanao". A "Pangampong" is a principality where the head is addressed as His Royal Highness (HRH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2007/02/09/executive-order-no-602-s-2007/|title=Executive Order No. 602, s. 2007 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rutchie Cabahug-Aguhob. (2007-08-07). [http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;sec=reader&amp;rp=10&amp;fi=p070807.htm&amp;no=89&amp;date= Lanao Advisory Council members sworn in]. Philippines Information Agency Retrieved 2011-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panoroganans are the ones entitled to approve or disapprove the Taritib, Ijmas and Adats in their respective Pangampong. This gave them the title as "His Royal Highness" or now localized as "Panoroganans". They also created the 28 "Piakambaya ko Taritib" (ruled by a Sultan but not Royal Sultan) that is seemingly similar to a legislative council or body that formulates the Taritib and Ijma which are distributed by pangampong.

The places under each of the "Pat a Pangmpong a Ranao" (Four Principalities of Lanao) are:
* [[Area|Pangamponga]] [[Coastal|Unayan]] covers the south of Lake Lanao strictly from [[Buldon]], [[Barira]]'''', ;'''[[Matanog]], [[Parang]] of Shariff Kabunsuan province and the long coastal area parallel to Illana Bay going to northern up to Zamboaga-Lanao border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10766">A '''deathbed confession''' is an admittance or [[confession]] when someone is nearing death, or on their "death bed". This confession may help alleviate any [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret]]s, secrets, or [[sin]]s the dying person may have had in their life. These confessions can occur because the dying want to live the last moments of their life free of any secrets they have been holding in for a portion, or the entirety of their life. A deathbed confession can be given to anyone, but a family member is usually with their loved one during this time. Doctors and nurses may also hear a deathbed confession because they are often present in a person’s last moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Elizabeth Johnston|title=Religion: A Clinical Guide for Nurses|date=2012|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8261-0860-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These confessions can range from a confession of sins that have been committed to crimes that have been committed or witnessed. Often, these confessions are made to clear the dying’s conscience. A common type of confession is either religious or spiritually based. On the death bed, the dying will confess sins or mistakes they have made in their lifetime, and ask for forgiveness, so that they may move on to the [[afterlife]] according to their religion. Different religions have different protocols for the deathbed confession, but all religions seek to provide relief for the dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bregman|first1=Lucy|title=Death and Dying in World Religions |date=2009|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-0-7575-6838-1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; People may also confess their feelings for another person while dying. This can relieve the dying of the internal struggle with hiding how they actually feel for someone. These emotions can range from hatred to love, and everything in between.

Many confessions have involved the admittance of a crime that the dying has committed, which obviously cannot be prosecuted once the perpetrator has died. On the other hand, someone can confess that they have knowledge of or witnessed a crime that has been committed. This special kind of confession can sometimes be admissible in court to get a conviction, depending on the circumstances of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804 |website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=2011-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use for a deathbed confession in the criminal justice system is to re-open a case that may have gone cold to get [[closure (psychology)|closure]] for the victim's family or friends, even if prosecution is not an option.

== Religion ==

=== Buddhism ===
Many terminal patients look to religion or spirituality to bring comfort in their remaining time. [[Buddhism]] has been showing up in [[palliative care]] more frequently to help patients cope with death and come to peace with the end of their life. Buddhism is a philosophically based religion mainly focused on suffering: why it exists, what causes it, and how to escape it. The belief is that ignorance, anger, and attachment cause inevitable suffering to the body. Buddhism also believes that life and the body is temporary and it is a privilege used to look for [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Discussing any issues in a patient's life related to suffering can bring inner peace and relief. Buddhism does not seek to manipulate a dying patient into following a religion or forcing dying confessions, but rather to become a thought-provoking way to talk about their suffering and clear themselves of attachment to their body, to prepare for death. Talking about suffering may bring up confessions or secrets that can be released before death to journey towards enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masel|first1=Eva|last2=Watzke|first2=Herbert|last3=Schur|first3=Sophie|title=Life is Uncertain. Death is Certain. Buddhism and Palliative Care|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=August 2012 |volume=44 |issue=2|pages=307–312|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088539241200262X|accessdate=4 April 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.02.018|pmid=22871512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Many [[Christian]]s, most notably [[Catholics]], believe that sins must be [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] to a priest before death. The priest can then absolve the dying of their sins, so that they can be properly prepared for the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deathbed Confessions and Conversions|url=http://www.biblestudyguide.org/articles/death/deathbed-confessions-and-conversions.htm |website=Bible Study Guide|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admittance of sin is important to the dying individual, because this frees them from sin, purifying the soul for a happy afterlife with God in Heaven. These final confessions, sometimes along with the [[Last Rites]], are often performed by a hospital priest or [[chaplain]] when a patient's quality of life suddenly declines.

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] is largely centered around the idea of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Good karma allows the soul to move up on the incarnation hierarchy to a better life. Bad karma does the opposite; it causes the soul to have to pay for its actions in this life or the previous one. The next incarnation is less fortunate until the bad karma is cancelled out by good deeds or suffering. This heavy emphasis on karma leads many Hindus to carry out many final acts to improve their chances in the next life and reduce end of life suffering. The main ways Hindus try to increase their karma before moving onto the next life is by apologizing to people, resolving any issues with family or friends, confessions with a [[guru]] or other religious figure, religious ceremonies, sacrifices or repentance. Performing all, or some, of these actions allows the patient to think about God, while they pass and prepare for the next life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrane|first1=Susan|title=Hindu End of Life: Death, Dying, Suffering, and Karma|journal=Journal of Hospice and Palliative Nursing|date=1 November 2010|volume=12|issue=6|pages=337–342|doi=10.1097/njh.0b013e3181f2ff11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Confession in Judaism#Deathbed confession}}
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;BT Shabbos 32a&lt;/ref&gt; teaches that "if one falls sick and his life is in danger, he is told: 'Make confession, for all who are sentenced to death make confession.'" [[Semahot|Masechet Semachot]]&lt;ref&gt;Semachot lit. means "Joyous Occasions" and is used euphemistically to refer to mourning. Semachot is one of the "Smaller Tractates" that records Amoraic and Tannaic statements that were not included in the canon of the Talmud&lt;/ref&gt; adds, &lt;blockquote&gt;"When someone is approaching death, we tell him to confess before he dies, adding that on the one hand, many people confessed and did not die, whilst on the other, there are many who did not confess and died, and there are many who walk in the street and confess; because on the merit of confession you will live."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Native American spirituality ===
Many tribes of Native Americans have similar views regarding death. Death is seen as a natural transition, and a part of life. The world is seen as an interconnected web, and a person is an extension of the web, as well as all other life. After death, it is believed by many that the components of your person is returned to the web of life. Making this transition smoothly is important to both the dying, and the loved ones left behind after they have passed on. Ensuring that there are no secrets remaining is vital to a transition back to the web of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Laurie|title=Workshop teaches Native American views on death, dying and spirituality|agency=The Advocate|date=17 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==

=== Admissibility ===
{{globalize|date=January 2018}}
A deathbed confession can be [[admissible evidence]] in court under the right circumstances. If someone confesses knowledge of a crime and then dies or their condition worsens, the law does not consider the statement to be [[hearsay]] and can be used in a criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deathbed confession can be a valuable piece of evidence in a case that may not have much [[physical evidence]]. Even criminal confessions that have been secret for years can still be of use, such as in a murder case, because there is no [[statute of limitations]] on murder cases.

=== Cold cases ===
Deathbed confessions can be used to re-open [[cold cases]] to benefit the victim's family. 

==Examples==
Bridget Sullivan, who had been employed as a housekeeper by the family of [[Lizzie Borden]],  died in [[Butte, Montana]] in 1948, where she allegedly gave a deathbed confession to her sister, stating that she had changed her testimony on the stand in order to protect Lizzie from being convicted of the murders of her father and step-mother.

===Alleged confessions===
Many decades after the 1926 disappearance of a 16-year-old girl named Emma Alice Smith in [[Sussex]], in  2009, a man named David Wright claimed his deceased great-aunt Lillian Smith, a sister of Emma Alice Smith, had told her niece that in the 1950s she had taken a death bed confession from a man claiming that he had murdered Emma Alice on her way to the train station in Horam. The case was reopened, not to find a killer, but to find the body of the young girl to give her a proper burial and give her relatives some closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Jonathan|title=Time and Crime: Which Cold-case Investigations Should Be Reheated?|journal=Criminal Justice Ethics|date=2015|volume=34|issue=1|pages=18–41|doi=10.1080/0731129x.2015.1025505|url=http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/344/1/Hughes%20%20Jonas_Time%20and%20Crime_accepted%20manuscript.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sussex Police concluded that despite the alleged death-bed confession, Emma Alice Smith had not been murdered but had in fact [[elope]]d with a married man named Thomas Wills. Police concluded the pair had probably ended up in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6045">Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing '''debaptism'''.

In addition to ''de facto'' renunciation through [[apostasy]], or [[heresy]], the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 the possibility of [[formal act of defection from the Catholic Church|formal defection from the Church]] through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of "true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism."&lt;ref name=PCLT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/intrptxt/documents/rc_pc_intrptxt_doc_20060313_actus-formalis_en.html |title=Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, '&amp;#39;Actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica'&amp;#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual "debaptism", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting [[sacramental character|seal or character]] that "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection."&lt;ref name=PCLT/&gt; Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French Catholic church for "its refusal to let him nullify his baptism." He had been "un-baptized" in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normandy, a decision appealed by the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/29/146046428/on-the-record-a-quest-for-de-baptism-in-france|title=Off The Record: A Quest For De-Baptism In France : NPR|last=Beardsley|first=Eleanor|date=January 29, 2012|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2010 to 2016, 12,442 people "debaptised" in the Dutch-speaking [[Flanders|Flemish region]] of [[Belgium]] by formally leaving the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="ontdopen2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2017/09/08/ruim-800-mensen-lieten-zich-vorig-jaar--ontdopen--in-vlaanderen/# |title=Ruim 800 mensen lieten zich vorig jaar "ontdopen" in Vlaanderen |author=Belga |work=VRT Nieuws |date=8 September 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Do Ngak Kunphen Ling Tibetan Buddhist Center for Universal Peace''' (མདོ་སྔགས་ཀུན་ཕན་གླིང་།) (DNKL) is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] retreat center located in [[Redding, Connecticut]]. It offers classes and meditation retreats in the [[Gelug]] spiritual tradition of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] under the guidance of Gyumed Khensur Rinpoche Lobsang Jampa.

==Activities==
Under the guidance of Gyumed Khensur Rinpoche Lobsang Jampa, DNKL draws on the spiritual tradition of the 14th Dalai Lama and the humanitarian visions of Maurice Pate. It acts as a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, and a learning center for students residing in the United States and abroad.

On a regular basis resident and visiting lamas conduct classes on the topics of Buddhist philosophy, moral discipline, meditative concentration, and transformation wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnkldharma.org/listen/index.html Audio recordings of classes taught at DNKL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209044426/http://www.dnkldharma.org/listen/index.html |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These classes are open to people of all religious traditions and to people with no particular religious affiliation. Students take part in short and long-term group retreats, and many conduct their own solitary meditative retreats on the grounds. DNKL also hosts public talks, spiritual festivals, and other community events. One of the locally better known events is the annual animal blessing, usually held during the summer months. &lt;ref name="Kirby 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kirby | first=Rich | title=Redding Buddhist Center Offers Animal Blessing | website=Weston-Redding-Easton, CT Patch | date=2018-07-16 | url=https://patch.com/connecticut/weston-ct/redding-buddhist-center-offers-animal-blessing | access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNKL engages in humanitarian activities locally and globally, such as assisting Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns, disaster relief,  and aiding children with basic education and health needs.

==History==
The grounds of DNKL were once part of the estate of John Read, after whom the town of Redding was named. The grounds later served as the residence of [[Maurice Pate]], founding director of [[UNICEF]], and his wife, [[Martha Lucas Pate]], a scholar of religion and philosophy, and president of Sweet Briar College. After their death, Pate's organization, the Maurice Pate Institute for Human Survival, donated the 100-acre (40.5 ha) property to the Mahayana Sutra and Tantra Center of Connecticut. It was initially established in 1997 as the Godstow Retreat Center by [[Geshe Michael Roach]], with whom it is no longer affiliated due to the behavior of Roach. When Gyumed Khensur Rinpoche Lobsang Jampa came to the center as Spiritual Director in 2006, the name was changed to Do Ngak Kunphen Ling, which roughly translated from Tibetan means Tibetan Buddhist Center for Universal Peace.

The center has become notable enough to warrant a visit by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] to the area&lt;ref name="Beaulieu 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Beaulieu | first=Scott | title=The Dalai Lama Comes to Connecticut | website=NBC Connecticut | date=31 August 2012 | url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/The-Dalai-Lama-Comes-to-Connecticut-137560598.html | access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="NewsTimes 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Redding monks draw Dalai Lama to area | website=NewsTimes | date=18 October 2012 | url=https://www.newstimes.com/local/article/Redding-monks-draw-Dalai-Lama-to-area-3957692.php | access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Domvs Romana''''' is a ruined Roman-era house located on the boundary between [[Mdina]] and [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], [[Malta]]. It was built in the 1st century BC as an aristocratic town house (''[[domus]]'') within the Roman city of [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]]. In the 11th century, a Muslim cemetery was established on the remains of the domus. The site was discovered in 1881, and archaeological excavations revealed several well preserved Roman [[mosaic]]s, statues and other artifacts, as well as a number of tombstones and other remains from the cemetery. Since 1882, the site has been open to the public as a museum, which is currently run by [[Heritage Malta]]

==History and description==
===Roman house===
[[File:Sudika Rabat Domus Romana.jpg|thumb|The mosaic of the [[peristyle]]]]

The ''Domvs Romana'' is believed to have been built in the beginning of the 1st century BC, and it remained in use until the 2nd century AD. The house had a colonnaded [[peristyle]] inspired by [[ancient Greek architecture]], and its best features are the well-made polychrome [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] style [[mosaics]] found in the peristyle and the surrounding rooms, which show decorative motifs or mythological scenes. Two types of tesserae were employed: [[opus vermiculatum]], in the centre of the pavement; [[opus tessellatum]], larger tesserae to create three-dimensional designs all around the main image. The picture sought to imitate a highly popular motif which may be first painted by an artist from Sophos. The ''domus'' also shows fine painted wall plaster imitating coloured marbles and showing partly stylized architectural elements which would place them somewhere between the 1st and 2nd [[Pompeian Styles]].

Although the house was mostly destroyed over time, its mosaics have survived largely intact, and they are comparable with those found at [[Pompeii]] or [[Sicily]]. A number of 1st century AD statues of the imperial Roman family, along with coins, glassware, tableware, bath accessories, amphorae and other fine artifacts have also been found in the domus.&lt;ref name=heritagebooks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Depasquale|first1=Suzannah|last2=Cardona|first2=Neville Juan|title=Site Catalogue: The Domvs Romana – Rabat Malta|date=2005|publisher=Heritage Books|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9993270318|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim cemetery===
[[File:Islamic funerary limestone Malta.jpeg|thumb|Sarcophagus and limestone tombstones from the Muslim cemetery, now exhibited in the museum]]

In the 11th century, while Malta was part of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], the site of the domus was converted into a cemetery. At least 245 burials were discovered during the excavations, which also unearthed a number of [[limestone]] (and one marble) [[tombstone]]s with [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] or [[Kufic]] inscriptions. Some ceramics and a silver ring were also found during the excavations.&lt;ref name=heritagebooks/&gt;

==Discovery and excavations==
The ''Domvs Romana'' was discovered accidentally in 1881 by workers during a landscaping project. It was subsequently excavated by the leading archaeologists of the time, including [[Antonio Annetto Caruana]], Sir [[Themistocles Zammit]], Robert V. Galea, Harris Dunscombe Colt and Louis Upton Way.&lt;ref name=heritagebooks/&gt;

==Museum==
[[File:Malta - Mdina - Wesgha tal-Muzew - Domus Romana ex 03 ies.jpg|thumb|The ''Domvs Romana'' museum]]

After the domus was first excavated, a museum was built on the site of the [[peristyle]] of the house in order to preserve its mosaics. The museum opened in February 1882, and it was the first building in Malta that was constructed specifically to house a museum of a particular archaeological site. The museum was originally known as the '''Museum of Roman Antiquities''', and apart from the mosaics and other Roman or Muslim artifacts uncovered from the domus, it also exhibited some other Roman marble pieces which were found in the streets of Mdina. Eventually, many Roman artifacts found elsewhere in Malta were transferred to this museum.&lt;ref name=heritagemalta&gt;{{cite web|title=Domvs Romana|url=http://heritagemalta.org/museums-sites/domvs-romana/|website=[[Heritage Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105055519/http://heritagemalta.org/museums-sites/domvs-romana/|archivedate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the museum was enlarged to designs by the architect Galizia,{{clarification needed|date=January 2016}} and a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] façade and a large display room were added. The remains of the domus were included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419101304/https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum closed during [[World War II]], and it housed a restoration centre before reopening to the public in 1945.&lt;ref name=heritagemalta/&gt;

The mosaic of the peristyle was restored in the second half of the 20th century, but was unintentionally damaged in the process. Currently, [[Heritage Malta]] is carrying out a report on how to conserve the mosaic and repair it with as little damage as possible. The displays of the museum were renovated between 2002 and 2005, and again in 2011.&lt;ref name=heritagemalta/&gt;

The '''Drum Barracks''', also known as '''Camp Drum''' and the '''Drum Barracks Civil War Museum''', is the last remaining original [[American Civil War]] era military facility in the Los Angeles area.  Located in the [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] section of Los Angeles, near the [[Port of Los Angeles]], it has been designated as a California Historic Landmark, a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument and has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Since 1987, it has been operated as a Civil War museum that is open to the public.

==History==
With the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, there were concerns on the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] side about the loyalty and security of the Los Angeles area.  Many of the area's residents were recent arrivals from the Southern states, and southerner [[John C. Breckinridge]] received twice as many local votes as [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marilyn Lofthus|title=Drum Barracks: Part II – Preservation|publisher=Shoreline|date=April 1982|url=http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/14/522647.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A company of secessionists was also holding public drills in [[El Monte, California]], displaying California's Bear flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.

[[Phineas Banning]], the founder of [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] (then known as New San Pedro), wrote a letter to President Lincoln advising that the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] would lose California unless some provision was made to quell pro-Confederacy sentiment.  Initially, the Union moved a garrison from [[Fort Tejon]] to [[Camp Latham]] near [[Culver City, California]].  Later in 1861, Banning and [[Benjamin Davis Wilson]], the first mayor of Los Angeles, donated {{convert|60|acre|m2}} in Wilmington to the government for one dollar each for use in construction of a Union garrison.  By January 1862, the military command had moved from Camp Latham to Camp Drum in Wilmington, and by March 1862, all but one company of Camp Latham's troops had been moved to Camp Drum.&lt;ref name=Beats&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Twelve years: Drum Barracks as a Military Post|publisher=Drum Beats|date=Spring 1987|url=http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/11/521022.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The camp was built between 1862 and 1863 at a cost of $1 million and consisted of 19 buildings located on {{convert|60|acre|m2}} in Wilmington with another {{convert|37|acre|m2}} near the harbor.  By March 1864, official letters and papers referred to the encampment as Drum Barracks rather than Camp Drum.&lt;ref name=Beats/&gt;

Camp Drum and Drum Barracks get their name from Col. [[Richard C. Drum|Richard Coulter Drum]], then Assistant Adjutant General of the Army's [[Department of the Pacific]], stationed in San Francisco, and not after a percussion instrument.  There is no record that Col. Drum ever saw or set foot in the station bearing his name.

During the Civil War, Camp Drum was the headquarters of the [[District of Southern California]] and the home to the [[California Column]], commanded by Colonel [[James Henry Carleton]].  Between 2,000 and 7,000 soldiers were stationed at Camp Drum, and Wilmington became a thriving community with a population greater than Los Angeles during the war.

In 1862, Texas Volunteers had taken control of large portions of [[New Mexico Territory]] (which included present-day Arizona) for the Confederacy, and Colonel Carleton was ordered to retake control of the territory.  Approximately 2,350 soldiers from the California Column marched from Camp Drum and fought the [[Battle of Picacho Pass]], the westernmost battle of the Civil War.

In 1864, the federal government feared attempts by Confederate sympathizers to outfit privateers to sink ships carrying gold and silver from the [[Comstock Lode]] to aid the Union.  To deprive them of an anchorage, Company C, [[4th California Infantry]] under Captain West, occupied [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] on January 1, 1864, and put an end to gold mining by ordering everyone off the island.  A small garrison of Union troops were stationed at [[Camp Santa Catalina Island]] on the isthmus on the island's west end for about nine months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RTEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  Records of California men in the war of the rebellion 1861 to 1867 By California. Adjutant General's Office, SACRAMENTO: State Office, J. D. Young, Supt. State Printing. 1890. pg. 595–598]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their barracks remain as the oldest structure on the island in the [[Two Harbors, California|Two Harbors]] area and are currently the home of the Isthmus Yacht Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Vickery|title=Drum Barracks: Part I – Founding|publisher=The Shoreline|date=April 1982|url=http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/14/522647.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp Drum also served as a deterrent to Confederate sympathizers in the Los Angeles area, helped keep the territory loyal to the Union, and prevented Confederate use of the Los Angeles harbor.

After the Civil War, Camp Drum remained active for several years in the Indian Wars. By 1870, it had been deactivated and fallen into disrepair.&lt;ref name=Beats/&gt;  In October 1871, the ''Los Angeles Star'' reported that all remaining troops at Drum Barracks had been ordered to [[Fort Yuma]].&lt;ref name=Beats/&gt;

In 1873, the government returned the land to Banning and Wilson after auctioning off the buildings. Banning bought five of the buildings for $2,917, and Wilson bought one for $200.&lt;ref name=Beats/&gt;

==Historic designations, preservation and use as a museum==
In 1927, the Drum Barracks was designated a historic monument by the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]], and in 1935 it was officially designated as California Historic Landmark #169.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drum Barracks|publisher=State of California Office of Historic Preservation|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail.aspx?num=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1962, Drum Barracks was one of the first sites designated as a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #21), receiving the monument designation in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Historic Cultural Landmarks|publisher=City of Los Angeles|url=http://www.cityprojectca.org/ourwork/documents/HCMDatabase090707.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also designated as and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1971.

In 1963, the owner of the property offered the property for sale, and concerns arose about its potential demolition. Under the leadership of Walter Holstein, local residents formed The Society for The Preservation of Drum Barracks, raising funds to purchase the property. In 1967, under the leadership of Oliver Vickery, curator of the [[Banning House]], and Joan Lorenzen, the State of California purchased the Drum Barracks, with the Society retaining responsibility for maintenance and operation of the barracks as a historic site. In 1986, the State turned over the property to the City of Los Angeles on the condition that it be operated as a Civil War museum.&lt;ref name=Beats/&gt;

The surviving 16-room structure was the officers' quarters, which was once one of 19 similar buildings on the site. Today, the barracks is open as a museum which commemorates California's contribution to the Civil War.

==Disturbances==
The surviving building holds a local reputation as the locale of various [[paranormal]] activity, with visitors and local residents claiming to hear the sound of rattling chains or wagon wheels and horses' hooves, seeing smoke (presumably from soldiers' pipes), spotting apparitions of a woman in a [[hoop skirt]], and smelling a strong lavender violet perfume. The Drum Barracks was profiled on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' in the early 1990s in a segment called 'Civil War Ghosts'. Some of the people interviewed in that segment claimed to have seen apparitions of Civil War soldiers. In 2005 the Barracks was featured in an episode of ''[[Most Haunted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Most Haunted'' episode: 92; original airdate October 4, 2005.

[[File:Cross Procession in Novosibirsk 06.jpg|thumb|A [[Russian Orthodox]] [[priest]] who has been awarded the dignity of wearing a [[mitre]].]]

An '''Ecclesiastial award''' is an official [[award]], [[honor]] or [[Privilege (canon law)|privilege]] presented by ecclesiastical authority.  In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] certain official awards and honours may be bestowed upon members of the [[clergy]] and [[laity]]. Such awards are bestowed either by the [[ruling bishop]] under whose jurisdiction the recipient resides, or—in the case of higher awards— by a [[synod]] of bishops. 

When a bishop wishes to confer an ecclesiastical award or honor on a deacon or priest under his jurisdiction, this will normally be accomplished at the [[Little Entrance]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]]. At the end of the Third [[Antiphon]] (normally the [[Beatitudes]]), the [[procession]] with the [[Gospel Book]] will halt at the bishop's [[cathedra]] (episcopal throne). The clergyman who is to receive the award will be presented to the bishop, the [[protodeacon]] will remove the bishop's [[mitre]], the bishop will [[laying on of hands|lay his hand]] upon the head of the clergyman and say the prayer proper to that particular award. He will then confer the award and the people will exclaim, "[[Axios (acclamation)|Axios! Axios! Axios!]]" as an expression of their acknowledgment of the clergyman's worthiness for the award, similar to applause at a secular awards ceremony.

Awards differ according to the rank of the individual honored, and will vary among the ecclesiastical [[jurisdiction]]s. Awards granted to bishops and the higher awards to priests are often reserved to begin conferred by a synod of bishops.

:'''Bishops'''
*Second [[panagia]] (every bishop wears one)

*mitre
*[[Pectoral cross]]:
**Jewelled cross
**Gold cross
**Silver cross
*[[Epigonation]]

:'''Laity'''
*[[Chivalric order]] or [[medal]]
*''Gramota'' (official letter of recognition)

Some of these awards have their origin in the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[Royal court|court]], others developed later. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] these awards came to be tied to the [[stipend]] which was paid to clergymen.

It is a sacred grass of the indigenous people's of the United States. It is used as a [[Smudging|smudge]], in [[herbal medicine]] and in the production of [[distilled beverage]]s (e.g., [[Żubrówka]], [[Wisent (vodka)|Wisent]]). It owes its distinctive sweet scent to the presence of [[coumarin]].
 
This variety of grass is different from the species commonly known as buffalo grass (''[[Stenotaphrum secundatum]]'') in [[Australia]].

==Characteristics==
''Hierochloe odorata'' is a very hardy perennial, able to grow to the Arctic Circle. Its leaves do not have rigid stems, so only grow to about  {{Convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on|}} in height, and then the leaves grow outward horizontally to {{Convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on|}} long or more, by late summer. The base of the leaf, just below the soil surface, is broad and white, without hairs; the underside of the leaf is shiny, without hairs.  In the wild, the bases of the leaves are frequently purple-red colored, and this indicates a phosphorus-deficient soil.&lt;ref name="ecoseeds.com"&gt;Sweetgrass Growing information. Redwood City Seed Company. http://www.ecoseeds.com/sweetgrass.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several strains of sweetgrass — a regular strain that can be harvested once or twice a year, and a naturally occurring polyploid strain, which is much faster growing and can be harvested three to five times a year.&lt;ref name="ecoseeds.com"/&gt;

Two chemicals found in sweetgrass, [[phytol]] and coumarin, repel mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-08-mosquito-repelling-chemicals-traditional-sweetgrass.html|title=Mosquito-repelling chemicals identified in traditional sweetgrass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The name ''Hierochloe odorata'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin. ''Hierochloe'' means "holy grass" and ''odorata'' means "fragrant".  Some authors include ''[[Hierochloe]]'' in ''[[Anthoxanthum]]''; in this case this species is given the epithet ''nitens'' to avoid confusion with a different species, ''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', sweet vernal grass.&lt;ref name=BSBI/&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagation is easiest by cutting out plugs from established plants.  Grown in sun or partial shade, they do not like drought.  Seeds are usually not viable, or if they are, take two to three years to develop a robust root system.

==Distribution==
[[File:Big Mouth Spring.jpg|thumb|right|Blackfoot man holding sweetgrass braid]]
In North America ''Hierochloe odorata'' occurs  in southern Canada, northern [[Great Plains]]/[[Rocky Mountains]] and northwest of U.S., and [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=HIOD Hierochloe odorata (L.) P. Beauv.], USDA PLANTS&lt;/ref&gt; In [[continental Europe]] it occurs north from Switzerland. There is only one site in Ireland, and it is recorded in four counties of Scotland.

==Uses==
The plant is harvested by cutting grass in early to late summer at the desired length. ''Hierochloe odorata'' harvested after the first frost has little or no scent and is less desirable for basketry.  Basketweavers sun-dry cut sweet grass until it is dry and [[brittle]].  The brittle form of sweet grass must be soaked in warm water until it becomes [[pliable]].  The pliable grass is typically [[braided]] into thick threads and then redried for use.

===European traditions===
Holy grass was strewn before church doors on saints' days in northern Europe, presumably because of the sweet smell that arose when it was trodden on.  It was used in France to flavor candy, tobacco, soft drinks, and perfumes. In Europe, the species ''Hierochloe alpina'' is frequently substituted or used interchangeably.  In Russia, it was used to flavor tea. It is still used in flavored vodka, the most notable example being Polish Żubrówka.

===Native American traditions===
[[File:Making Sweet Grass Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|Making Sweet Grass Medicine, painting by [[Joseph Henry Sharp]]]]
Sweet grass is widely used by North American indigenous peoples from many different Nations. Among many of the [[Plains Indians]] is considered one of the "[[four sacred medicines]]". Though being used for many purposes, its main purpose for many tribes is to attract good spirits. It is also known as the "Hair of Mother Earth".

'''Hyderabadi Muslims''' are an [[Ethnoreligious group|ethnoreligious]] community of [[Dakhini| Dakhini Urdu]]-speaking [[Muslims]], part of a larger group of [[Dakhini Muslims]], from the area that used to be the [[Hyderabad State|princely state of Hyderabad]], India, including cities like [[Hyderabad]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Latur]], [[Gulbarga]] and [[Bidar]].

While the term "''Hyderabadi''" now only refers to residents in and around the city of [[Hyderabad]], the term Hyderabadi Muslims can refer to those native Muslim residents of the erstwhile princely state. The native language of the Hyderabadi Muslims is [[Hyderabadi Urdu]], which is a form of the [[Dakhini|Dakhini language]].

With their origins in the Muslim [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and then the [[Deccan sultanates]], [[Culture of Hyderabad|Hyderabadi Muslim culture]] became defined in the latter half of the reign of the [[Nizam|Asif Jahi Dynasty]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;in Hyderabad. The culture exists today mainly in the [[Old City (Hyderabad, India)|old city of Hyderabad]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Bidar]] and among the Hyderabadi Muslim diaspora around the world, in particular, Pakistan,&lt;ref name="TOI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-07/hyderabad/30601526_1_hyderabadis-culture-deccani |title=Hyderabadis in Pakistan still carry mohajir tag: Karen Leonard – Times Of India |publisher=The Times of India |date=7 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], USA, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="TOI_Muslims_in_Hyderabad"&gt;{{cite news| title=The Muslim question| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-11/hyderabad/30386295_1_muslim-masses-telangana-telugu-culture| publisher=articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com| date=11 November 2011| accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Hyderabad|Indian integration of Hyderabad}}

The [[Deccan plateau]] acted as a bulwark sheltering [[South India]] from the invasions and political turmoil that affected North India. This allowed the Muslim-ruled state of Hyderabad to develop a distinctive culture during the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]], brief [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule and later the [[Asaf Jahi dynasty|Asaf Jahi]] dynasty of the [[Nizam]]s.

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Osman Ali Khan|seventh Nizam]] was the richest man in the world during the late 1940s, and fifth richest person of all time according to Forbes Magazine after adjustment for inflation and currency purchasing power parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19370222,00.html|title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Nizam of Hyderabad - Feb. 22, 1937|website=TIME.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nizam]] was the Muslim ruler of the vast princely Hyderabad State. The capital city of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was primarily Urdu-speaking Muslim until the [[Hyderabad Campaign (1948)|Incorporation of Hyderabad into India]] and the subsequent rise to dominance of Telugu-speaking people of [[Telangana|Telangana State]]. The state's economy was agrarian, and Hyderabad was primarily a government and administrative hub, run mostly (but far from exclusively) by Muslims. The aristocracy, ''[[jagirdar]]s'' and ''[[deshmukh]]s'' (wealthy landowners), and even minor government officials, could afford to hire servants, usually also Muslims, in a social order similar to the class system of [[Victorian era|Victorian England]]. The Nizam allied himself with the British early on, with ensuing political stability. The Muslim upper and middle classes were free to concentrate on a care-free and leisurely lifestyle involving clothes, jewelry, food, music, literary arts, and other indulgences, little of which trickled down to the servant class, known as ''naukar'' (a word originally used for the Mughal Emperor [[Babur]]'s closest feudal retainers).

After the fall of the [[Mughal Empire]] in [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857]], many Muslim writers, poets, scholars, musicians and other eminent personalities migrated from [[Delhi]] to [[Hyderabad]] in hope of seeking patronage of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]] or the nobility. Muslims continued to emigrate to the state seeking employment in the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam's]] court, army,  [[Hyderabad Civil Service]] or educational institutions. Among those who spent significant time in Hyderabad are writers [[Dagh Dehlvi]], [[Fani Badayuni]], [[Josh Malihabadi]], [[Ali Haider Tabatabai]], religious scholar [[Shibli Nomani|Shilbi Nomani]] and classical musicians [[Tanrus Khan]] and [[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]]. 

After [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] from the [[British Raj]], [[Hyderabad State]], under the rule of the [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII|seventh Nizam]] lasted for a year, until September 18, 1948, when the Indian Army launched [[Indian integration of Hyderabad|Operation Polo]], and invaded Hyderabad state, annexing it into the [[Dominion of India|Indian Union]]. The Invasion resulted in the massacre of thousands of Hyderabadi Muslims, and mass migration mainly to the west, and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzyKngEACAAJ|title=The Destruction of Hyderabad|last=Noorani|first=A.

===Hyderabadi Muslim Identity after Integration ===

The people who migrated to [[Pakistan]] were now placed under a new term called [[Muhajir people|Muhajir]], along with other Urdu speaking immigrants from present day [[India]]. The Muhajir people began to dominate politics and business mainly in the metropolitan city of [[Karachi]] but their unique Hyderabadi Muslim Identity was lost, and has now evolved into a result of Karachi's booming cosmopolitan scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1082152|title=The Mohajir question|last=Murtaza|first=Dr Niaz|date=2014-01-23|website=www.dawn.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyderabadi Muslims who stayed in the integrated [[Hyderabad State (1948–56)|Hyderabad state]] were faced with new language issues, and a wave of immigration from other Indian states, especially after 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Av89AAAAYAAJ|title=Agricultural Development in Hyderabad State, 1900-1956: A Study in Economic History|date=1882-01-01|publisher=Keshav Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|Indian reorganization of 1956]], with states being divided on linguistic lines, Hyderabadi Muslims, in [[Telangana]], [[Marathwada]], and [[Hyderabad-Karnataka]] were faced with the learning and emerging dominance of Telugu, Marathi, and Kannada respectively, and their native language [[Dakhini]] became a home language while [[Urdu]] in the forefront of Politics in these regions became comparatively less widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHJtAAAAMAAJ|title=Journal of South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Published under the auspices of the Pakistan American Foundation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present day Hyderabadi Muslims know very little about their cultural heritage, especially those who aren't from Hyderabad city, or India. Hyderabadi Muslims are now seen as a result of Indian cosmopolitanism, and their history is being lost in Indian textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UjZlNCh-qwC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Indian+Cosmopolitanism,+Hyderabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL4anCrc7LAhXkuIMKHbk9DawQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Indian%2520Cosmopolitanism%252C%2520Hyderabad&amp;f=false|title=Making India: Colonialism, National Culture, and the Afterlife of Indian English Authority|last=Paranjape|first=Makarand R.|date=2012-09-03|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400746619|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative isolation of Hyderabad until [[Hyderabad Campaign (1948)|annexation to India]], its distinctive dialect of Urdu and the strong web of interconnecting family relationships that still characterizes Hyderabadi Muslims, sometimes leads to charges of parochialism from other Indian Muslim communities, but it also ensures a Hyderabadi Muslim identity endures among the Indian diaspora.

==Demographics and distribution==
[[File:Charminar Karachi.JPG|thumb|left|180px|A replica of the [[Charminar]] built by Hyderabadi Muslims in [[Bahadurabad]], Karachi, Pakistan]]
The largest concentration of Hyderabadi Muslims is in the [[Old City (Hyderabad, India)|old city of Hyderabad]]. After the [[Partition of India]] and the [[Operation Polo|Incorporation of Hyderabad by India]], the Muslims of the state lost their privileged status, so significant numbers chose to migrate to other countries such as [[Pakistan]], the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], the [[United States]], [[UK]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leonard07|Leonard 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leonard09|Leonard 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A section of Hyderabadi Muslims are of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] Arab origin, who came to serve in the Nizam's military. They are known as [[Chaush]] and mostly reside in the [[Barkas, Hyderabad|Barkas]] neighbourhood of Hyderabad.

==Politics==
Hyderabadi Muslims have organized themselves politically along religious lines.The most prominent example of this is the [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], currently led by [[Asaduddin Owaisi]]. The party dominates the politics in Hyderabad's [[Old City (Hyderabad, India)|Old City]], and consistently wins seats for the [[Lok Sabha]] (Lower House of Indian Parliament) and the [[Telangana Legislative Assembly]]. The party claims to represent the interests of Muslims by campaigning for greater protection of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimim.in/about-the-party/history/|title=History - All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|website=All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702085450/http://www.aimim.in/about-the-party/history/|archive-date=2 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rival breakaway faction of the AIMIM is the [[Majlis Bachao Tehreek]] that also claims to represent the interests of Muslims in Hyderabad.

Hyderabadi Muslims who have been strong supporters of secular progressive movements, such as [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian freedom fighters]] [[Maulvi Allauddin]], [[Turrebaz Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://telanganatoday.com/turrebaz-khan-the-forgotten-hero|title=Turrebaz Khan: The forgotten hero|last=Gopal|first=M.

Hyderabadi Muslims were also at the forefront of the formation of the [[Comrades Association]] in 1939, one of the first communist organizations in Hyderabad which struggled against the [[Nizam]]. Other secular members of the community include Shoaibullah Khan, the editor of the Urdu daily ''Imroz'' that was critical of the [[Razakars (Hyderabad)|Razakars]] and urged Hyderabad's integration with India (he was stabbed to death). The story of a poor Muslim peasant named ''Bandagi'' who was killed while struggling against the landlord was immortalised in the popular drama [[Ma Bhoomi]] about the [[Telangana Rebellion]]. In 1946, editor of Urdu daily'' Saltanat'' [[Sayyid Ahmedullah Qadri]] was the first journalist of [[Hyderabad state]] who wrote articles on the One nation Theory.

Hyderabadi Muslims, are noted for their hospitable nature also known as [[Culture of Hyderabad|Deccani Tehzeeb]]. While Hyderabadi Muslims take pride in their "Nawabi" language, literature, poetry, architecture, and cuisine. The performing arts are often overlooked, especially regarding Hyderabadi culture. In fact, the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims is being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Deccani-tehzeeb-is-history/articleshow/11126520.cms?referral=PM|title=‘Deccani tehzeeb is history’ - The Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/op-ed/181016/celebrating-a-long-gone-hyderabad.html|title=Celebrating a long gone Hyderabad|date=2016-10-18|work=Deccan Chronicle|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the city of [[Hyderabad]] can be attributed to one of the wives of [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], [[Bhagmati|Queen Bhagyamati]], who was a dancer in the courts of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golkonda]] kings, with whom the founder of Hyderabad had named the city in her honour, ''Bhagyanagar'', and later Hyderabad.

Apart from these, a traditional Hyderabadi Muslim wedding is identified by various local traditional elements, such as the traditional garb, [[Sherwani]] for the groom and [[Khara dupatta|Khada Dupatta]] along with jewelry for the bride, as well as [[Hyderabadi cuisine]] served at the ceremony.

Another cultural practice unique to the region is ''[[Tasmia Qwani]]'' also known as ''Bismillah Ceremony'', family ceremony in which a Muslim child is initiated to read the [[Quran]].

Other than musical forms of art, Hyderabadi Muslims have taken great honour in the writing, and reading of poetry, and annual [[Mushaira]]s and [[Mehfil]]s take place around the world, which has become a symbol of unity for Hyderabadi Muslims, and [[Urdu]] poets alike, continuing an ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://twocircles.in/2012nov14/4th_annual_mehfilehyderabad_celebrated_mississauga.html|title=4th Annual Mehfil-e-Hyderabad Celebrated in Mississauga {{!}} TwoCircles.net|website=twocircles.in|access-date=2016-03-18}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and literature===
{{main|Hyderabadi Urdu|Dakhini}}
[[File:Hyderabad City IB1142.jpg|thumb|Students at the [[Osmania University]], circa 1940's]]
One of the most identifiable markers of Hyderabadi Muslim culture is the [[Hyderabadi Urdu|local dialect of Urdu]], called [[Hyderabadi Urdu]] which in itself is a form of [[Dakhini]]. It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]], as well in some vocabulary from [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] that are not found in the standard dialect of [[Urdu]]. In terms of pronunciation, the easiest way to recognize a Hyderabadi Urdu is use of "nakko"(no) and "hau"(yes); whereas in standard Urdu its "nahi" for (no) and "haa" for (yes).

Though [[Hyderabadi Urdu]] or [[Dakhini]] are the native languages of the Hyderabadi Muslim people, most people can speak standard [[Urdu]], and often put Urdu as their mother tongue on censuses, as Dakhini is not a recognized language as such. Along with the languages they learn from birth, they can speak [[Hindi]], which is mutually ineligible with standard [[Urdu]], and taught in most Indian schools. Hyderabadi Muslims can also speak the majority languages spoken in the regions they live, namely [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Kannada]]. The other important characteristic of the natives is cultural refinement in terms of interpersonal communication, referred to as ''meethi boli'' (sweet and civilised speech). ''Tameez'', ''tehzeeb'' and ''akhlaq'' (etiquette, custom, and tradition) are considered very important and guests are treated well with a lot of ''mehmaan nawaazi'' (hospitality).

The [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahs]] were regarded as the great patrons of [[Urdu]], [[Farsi]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] language. The region saw a growth of [[Deccani Urdu]] literature, the ''[[Deccani Masnavi]]'' and ''[[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]]'' composed during those periods are among the earliest available manuscripts in the Urdu language.  The literary work of this region is influenced with the regional [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] in parallel with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of renovated words.&lt;ref name="Masud"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah, volume 216|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=50–77|year=1996|isbn=978-81-260-0233-7 |last=Hussain Khan|first=Masud}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fifth Sultan of the dynasty, [[Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah]] was  himself an [[List of Urdu poets|Urdu poet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.siasat.com/news/quli-qutub-shah-remembered-his-400th-death-anniversary-244924/|title=Quli Qutub Shah remembered on his 400th death anniversary {{!}} The Siasat Daily|website=archive.siasat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of [[Asaf Jahi Dynasty|Nizams]] saw a growth of literary growth since after printing was introduced in Hyderabad. In 1824 AD, the first collection of Urdu ''[[Ghazal]]s'' named ''Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa'' (Mahlaqa's garden of flowers) written by [[Mah Laqa Bai]], was printed and published from Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="Mah laqa bai"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women writing in India volume 1, 600 BC to the Early Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u297RJP9gvwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[The Feminist Press]]|page=120|year=1991|isbn=978-1-55861-027-9 |last1=Susie|first1=Tharu|last2=K|first2=Lalita|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Revolt of 1857]], many Urdu writers, scholars and poets who lost their patronage at [[Delhi]] made Hyderabad their home, that grew and brought reforms in the literary and poetry work. Scholars continued to migrate to Hyderabad during the reign of [[Asaf Jah VI]] and his successor [[Asaf Jah VII]]. These included [[Shibli Nomani]], [[Dagh Dehlvi]], [[Fani Badayuni]], [[Josh Malihabadi]], [[Ali Haider Tabatabai]], Zahir Dehlvi and many others.&lt;ref name="Datta"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian literature: Devraj to Jyoti, Volume 2|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|pages=1260, 1746–1748|year=2005|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0 |last=Datta|first=Amaresh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/mar/31/city-of-bards-eminent-poets-who-settled-down-in-hyderabad-1794858.html|title=City of Bards: Eminent poets who settled down in Hyderabad|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of [[Mir Osman Ali Khan|Nizam VII]] saw many reforms in literary work. For the first time in history the [[Nizams]] introduced [[Urdu]] as a language of court, administration and education. Other notable poets, scholars and writers of the early 20th century are [[Amjad Hyderabadi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.siasat.com/news/hyderabad-observe-104th-anniversary-musi-flood-349446/|title=Hyderabad to observe 104th anniversary of Musi flood  {{!}} The Siasat Daily|website=archive.siasat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Makhdoom Mohiuddin]], [[Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri]], [[Mohiuddin Qadri Zore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prlog.org/11428536-syed-mohiuddin-qadri-zore-ma-phd.html|title=Syed Mohiuddin Qadri, 'Zore'- MA, PhD.|last=Forum|first=Pak-American International|website=PRLog|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sulaiman Areeb]]. [[Maharaja Sir Kishen Pershad]], although not a Muslim himself, was steeped in Hyderabadi Muslim Culture and wrote poetry under the pen name ''Shad''.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Sir Kishen Pershad Passes Away|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=168-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AkwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6865%2C1236175|accessdate=8 February 2018|work=The Indian Express|date=14 May 1940|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Urdu]] was declared the second official language of the state of [[Telangana]]. (after [[Telugu language|Telugu]]) This move was praised by many, especially Muslims of Hyderabad who spoke [[Urdu]] as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/urdu-second-official-language-telangana-state-passes-bill-71742|title=Urdu is second official language in Telangana as state passes Bill|date=2017-11-17|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/urdu-is-second-official-language-now/article20493655.ece|title=Urdu is second official language now|date=2017-11-17|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-22|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Though, the once great dance traditions among the Hyderabadi Muslims are almost lost, two distinct, cultural practices are still popular, namely [[Marfa (music)|Marfa]], and Dholak ke Geet. [[Marfa (music)|Marfa]] was brought by the [[Siddi]] and [[Chaush]] peoples, of [[Africa]] and [[Yemen]], who were deployed in the army of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams]]. This music, is accompanied by the beating drums of a great tradition, which were once popular in national celebrations of the dissolved [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad state]], is still popular among Hyderabadi Muslims in weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/article2216021.ece#|title=‘Marfa' band of the Siddis ‘losing' its beat|date=2011-07-10|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=2016-03-18|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dholak ke geet'' is also one such great tradition. ''Dholak ke geet'' are songs, that have been orally passed down from generation to generation since the time of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams]], and is sung at weddings, accompanied by a [[Dholak]] drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8830KZLvkYsC|title=Deccan Heritage|last=Gupta|first=Harsh K.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=9788173712852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Khada Dupatta'' or ''[[Khara Dupatta]]'' (uncut veil) is an outfit composed of a ''kurta'' (tunic), ''[[chooridaar]]'' (ruched pair of pants), and 6 yard ''dupatta'' (veil) and is traditionally worn by Hyderabad brides. Sometimes the ''kurta'' is sleeveless and worn over a ''koti'' resembling a [[choli]]. The bride also wears a matching ''ghoonghat'' (veil) over her head. The accompanying jewellery is:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/235042642|title=The untold Charminar : writings on Hyderabad|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|others=Imam, Syeda.|isbn=9780143103707|location=New Delhi|oclc=235042642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sherwani''====

The ''[[Sherwani]]'' is the traditional men's garb of Hyderabad. It is a coat-like tunic with a tight-fitting collar (hook &amp; eyelet fastening), close-fitting in the upper torso and flaring somewhat in its lower half. It usually has six or seven buttons, often removable ones made from gold sovereigns for special occasions. The material is usually silk or wool. A groom may use gold brocade for his wedding sherwani, but otherwise good taste dictates understated colors, albeit with rich and textured fabrics. The sherwani is usually worn over a silk or cotton ''kurta'' (long shirt) and ''pyjamas'' (baggy pants with a drawstring at the waist).

The ''Sherwani'' is closely associated with Hyderabad, although it has spread since to the rest of India and to Pakistan. Former Prime Minister of India [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] adapted its design and turned it into his trademark ''[[Nehru Jacket]]'', further popularizing the garment.

====''Attar''====
[[Ittar|Attar]], or ''Ittar'' is a traditional perfume made from botanical sources. It is still available in the bazaars near [[Charminar]] and at the [[Moazzam Jahi Market|Moazam Jahi Market]].  Many of the older generations still prefer ''attar'' over modern [[perfume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/four-generations-later-art-ittar-losing-its-scent-hyderabad|title=Four generations later, the art of 'Ittar' is losing its scent in Hyderabad|date=2015-06-12|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/tracing-the-fragrant-attar/article3707469.ece|title=Tracing the fragrant attar|last=Chakravorty|first=Sohini|date=2012-07-31|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ittar-mingles-in-the-air-but-losing-aroma-among-youth/articleshow/62102671.cms|title=Ittar mingles in the air, but losing aroma among youth - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/The-new-scent-of-attar/articleshow/45396025.cms|title=The new scent of attar - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Mecca Masjid.1.jpg|thumb|The 400-year-old [[Mecca Masjid]] in [[Hyderabad]]]]
The majority of Hyderabadi Muslims are [[Sunni]] and the two largest minorities are [[Shia]] and [[Mahdavia|Mahdavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim society demonstrates diversity in its beliefs and practices|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Muslim-society-demonstrates-diversity-in-its-beliefs-and-practices/articleshow/53693572.cms|newspaper=Times of India|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni Muslims mostly follow the [[Hanafi]] school of [[Islamic Jurisprudence]], although the [[Chaush]] community follows the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought. Islam in Hyderabad, with historical patronizing by the rulers, has a strong Sufi influence. [[Tablighi Jamaat]] has also been active since late 1950's, with its headquarters at Jama Masjid Mallepally. [[Salafi movement|Salafis]], [[Dawoodi Bohra]] and [[Ismai'li]] are also in some areas. [[Bismillah ceremony]] is an Islam initiation ceremony held for children, unique to the region.

[[Mourning of Muharram]] is observed by the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/no-parallel-to-hyderabads-muharram-procession-in-india-523357.html|title=No parallel to Hyderabad's Muharram procession in India|last=|first=|date=|work=News18|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processions are held every year, since the time of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] as well as the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams]]. 

Religious knowledge and its propagation flourished under the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]] with institutions like the world-famous [[Jamia Nizamia]]. The largest Mosque of Hyderabad, the [[Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad|Makkah Masjid]] gathers congregations of more than two hundred thousand{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} on the occasions of [[Eid prayers]] and [[Jumu'atul-Wida|''Jumu'at-al Wida'']]. (the last Friday of [[Ramadan]]) 

Hyderabad has also produced many renowned religious scholars of representing different Islamic sects and trends, including [[Bahadur Yar Jung]], [[Muhammad Hamidullah]], [[Hashim Amir Ali]], [[Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri]], [[Sayyid Ahmedullah Qadri]], [[Abul Ala Maududi]] and [[M. A. Muqtedar Khan]].

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] employ various levels of [[church discipline|congregational discipline]] as formal controls administered by congregation elders. Members who engage in conduct that is considered inappropriate may be counseled privately by elders and congregational responsibilities may be withheld or restricted. If initial counsel is not accepted, elders may present a talk to the congregation about the type of behavior, alerting other members already aware of the individual's conduct to limit social interaction with that person.
Hearings involving "serious sin" are performed by formal ''judicial committees'', in which guilt and repentance are determined by a tribunal of elders. A variety of controls can be enforced, from ''reproof'' and restriction of congregational duties to [[excommunication]], known as ''disfellowshipping'', which includes [[shunning]] by the congregation. Individuals who are disfellowshipped may be reinstated after an extended period if they are deemed to demonstrate repentance. The practice of disfellowshipping has been criticized by many non-members and ex-members.

== Discipline involving non-judicial situations ==
At the elders' discretion, "non-judicial" situations may involve discipline of one or more of several types.

===Counsel===
''Counsel'' may be given in situations involving actions that are considered inappropriate but are not considered to be of sufficient gravity to necessitate a judicial committee. Counsel may be provided by a mature Witness in addition to self-discipline and family discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Keep Yourselves in God's Love|publisher=Watch Tower Society|pages=142–143|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pl/r1/lp-e?q=lv%20142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elders may also give recommendations or warnings to members in non-judicial situations.

===Local needs===
At conventions and assemblies, and about once each month at a local [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Midweek meeting|midweek meeting]], a short talk regarding "local needs" is presented.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Service meeting schedule, 1992-2009&lt;/ref&gt; An elder addresses matters that are relevant to the local congregation, with instructions outlining the course of action considered appropriate. No specific individuals are identified during the talk, but the talk may relate to a matter for which a member has recently been "reproved". At times, some temporary policy may be announced that might be seen as disciplinary; for example, it may be that an additional attendant is assigned outside a [[Kingdom Hall]] to discourage children from running on the sidewalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Question Box|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=March 1972|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shepherding calls===
Personal "shepherding visits" are intended to encourage members of the congregation, though may also include counsel and correction, then or on a subsequent visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Do You Accept Jehovah's Help?|magazine=The Watchtower|date=December 15, 2004|page=21|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004924#h=23:393-27:438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Charisma—Praise to Man or Glory to God?|magazine=The Watchtower|date=February 15, 1998|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two elders (or an elder and a ministerial servant) may schedule and perform a particular shepherding visit on their own or at the direction of the body of elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=How Christian Shepherds Serve You|magazine=The Watchtower|date=March 15, 1996|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Withheld recommendations or assignments ===
The body of elders may withhold its recommendation for a member to serve in a new position of responsibility, though still permitting existing responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Announcements|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=June 2005|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a ministerial servant who consistently seems insufficiently prepared for his meeting parts may have such assignments withheld for a time, even though he may continue serving as a ministerial servant or in some other "special privilege of service".{{Citation needed|reason=Old reference (to Ministry School book pg. 284) does not say anything in this regard|date=January 2017}}

=== Withheld "privileges" ===
An active Jehovah's Witness may have their congregational "privileges of service" limited, even without having committed a serious sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Let Discernment Safeguard You|magazine=The Watchtower|date=March 15, 1997|page=19|quote=Even well-meaning Christians have shared information about seemingly profitable ventures, only to find that they and those following their example lost the money they invested. As a result, a number of Christians have lost privileges in the congregation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Witnesses sometimes refer to field ministry, after-meeting cleanup, and other responsibilities as "privileges", the term "privileges of service" often implies a specific range of assignments assisting elders and ministerial servants with meeting demonstrations and other responsibilities.{{Citation needed|reason=Old reference (to Ministry School book pg. 191) does not say anything in this regard|date=January 2017}} Such limitations are usually temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Are You Reaching Out?|magazine=The Watchtower|date=September 1, 1990|page=23|quote=Even if counsel has been required, it may not be such a long time before a humble and grateful man again receives added privileges of service in the congregation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, or other appointed Witnesses can lose their "special privileges of service".&lt;ref&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses use the term "special privileges of service" for positions requiring formal appointment or approval, such as elder, ministerial servant, pioneer, Bethel (branch) service, and schools such as Gilead and Ministerial Training School; "Make Room for It", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', April 2003, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Draw Close To Jehovah|pages=268–269|publisher=Watch Tower Society|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102002051#h=28:0-30:0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an elder may be removed or choose to step aside voluntarily from his position if members of his household are not in "good standing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=October 15, 1996|page=21|title=Father and Elder—Fulfilling Both Roles}}&lt;/ref&gt; After resignation or removal from an appointed position, an announcement is made during the congregation's Service Meeting indicating that the person is "no longer serving [in that capacity]", without elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Announcements|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=February 1991|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marking ===
Members who persist in a course considered scripturally wrong after repeated counsel by elders, but who are not considered guilty of something for which they could be disfellowshipped, can be "marked", based on Jehovah's Witnesses' interpretation of 2&amp;nbsp;Thessalonians&amp;nbsp;3:14.&lt;ref name="wt041585"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=April 15, 1985|page=31|title=Questions From Readers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions for which an individual may be "marked" include [[dating]] a non-member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 1999|page=31|title=Questions From Readers}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating when not "scripturally" or legally free to marry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shepherd the Flock of God|pages=124–5|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; being [[Laziness|lazy]], critical, or dirty, [[Busybody|meddling]], taking material advantage of others or indulging in "improper" entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organized to do Jehovah's will|pages=134–6|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=2015|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/Organized-to-Do-Jehovahs-Will/|quote=This could include such things as being extremely lazy, critical, or dirty. He could be "meddling with what does not concern [him]." (2 Thess. 3:11) Or he might be one who schemes to take material advantage of others or indulges in entertainment that is clearly improper.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Marking" is indicated by means of a warning talk given to the congregation outlining the shameful course, without explicitly naming any particular individual. Members who know whose actions are being discussed may then consider the individual "marked". Though not shunned, "marked" individuals are looked upon as "bad association" and social interaction outside of formal worship settings is generally curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 1999|page=31|title=Questions From Readers|quote=Their ceasing to have social dealings and recreation with him might show him that principled people disliked his ways. ... Christians in the congregation who are thus alerted can individually decide to limit any socializing with ones who clearly are pursuing a disorderly course but who are still brothers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action is intended to "shame" the person into following a particular course of action.&lt;ref name="wt041585" /&gt;

== Discipline involving "serious sin" ==
If an active baptized Witness is considered to have committed a "serious sin" for which the individual must demonstrate formal repentance, correction (or, "discipline") is administered by the congregation's body of elders. Such situations usually involve a "judicial committee" of three or more elders.&lt;ref name="org139"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organized to Do Jehovah's Will|year=2015|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=139|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/Organized-to-Do-Jehovahs-Will/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of "serious sins" ===
Jehovah's Witnesses consider many actions to be "serious sins", for which baptized Witnesses are subject to a judicial committee hearing. Such actions include:

{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|

*[[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=15 April 2009|page=12|title=Questions From Readers|quote=Understanding that timeless truth has helped millions of Christians to repudiate the practice of abortion, seeing it as a serious sin against God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[adultery]]
*[[anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]] (even within marriage)&lt;ref name="oral_anal_sex"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=15 March 1983|page=31|title=Honor Godly Marriage!|quote=A mate's enforcing perverted acts, such as oral or anal sex, within the marriage would not constitute a Scriptural basis for a divorce that would free either for remarriage... If it becomes known that a member of the congregation is practicing or openly advocating perverted sex relations within the marriage bond, that one certainly would not be irreprehensible, and so would not be acceptable for special privileges, such as serving as an elder, a ministerial servant or a pioneer. Such practice and advocacy could even lead to expulsion from the congregation. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[apostasy]]&lt;ref&gt;"Apostasy" includes publicly challenging the group's teachings&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[bestiality]] 
*encouraging the celebration of [[birthday]]s or other prohibited celebrations&lt;ref name="birthdays"&gt;{{cite book|title=Correspondence Guidelines|page=29|publisher=Watch Tower Society|quote=An individual would not normally be disfellowshipped for celebrating a birthday. However, if someone persists in strongly advocating the celebrating of birthdays or actively solicits birthday associated business, thus openly encouraging such celebrations and hence creating division, disfellowshipping may be in order.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[blood transfusion]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;mdash;Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|pages=182&amp;ndash;184|quote=Consistent with that understanding of matters, beginning in 1961 any who ignored the divine requirement, accepted blood transfusions, and manifested an unrepentant attitude were disfellowshipped from the congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[boxing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shepherd the Flock of God|page=71|publisher=Watch Tower Society|quote=If a Christian took up professional boxing and refused to stop despite repeated counsel, judicial action would be appropriate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=1 July 1981|pages=30–31|title=Questions From Readers|quote=If a Christian were to become a professional boxer, this would put him in conflict with God's counsel...

If a baptized Witness teaches contrary to Witness doctrines, it is considered apostasy and grounds for disfellowshipping. A 1981 letter to overseers—reproduced in a book by former Governing Body member [[Raymond Franz]]—directed that a member who "persists in believing other doctrine", even without promoting such beliefs, may also be subject to disfellowshipping.&lt;ref name="to_all_overseers"&gt;''To All Circuit and District Overseers'', September 1, 1980, "Keep in mind that to be disfellowshipped, an apostate does not have to be a promoter of apostate views. ... if a baptized Christian abandons the teachings of Jehovah, as presented by the faithful and discreet slave, and persists in believing other doctrine despite Scriptural reproof, then he is apostatizing. ... [If] he continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided through the 'slave class,' then appropriate judicial action should be taken. ... [If] something reasonably substantial comes to the attention of the elders along this line, it would be appropriate to make a kindly, discreet inquiry so as to protect the flock." Letter reproduced in ''Crisis of Conscience'', Raymond Franz, 1983, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Elders usually try to reason with the individual before such action is taken.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 6/1/98 p. 19 par. 17 "Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith"!&lt;/ref&gt; If a person believes that a teaching should be adjusted or changed, he is encouraged "to be patient and wait on Jehovah for change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000642?q=waiting+Attitude&amp;p=par "Show a Waiting Attitude!"] ''The Watchtower'' September 1, 2000 page 11.

===Procedures===
Evidence for actions that can result in congregational discipline is obtained by voluntary confession to the elders or by witnesses of the violation. A minimum of two witnesses is required to establish guilt, based on their understanding of Deuteronomy 17:6 and Matthew 18:16, unless the person confesses voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;''Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Members are instructed to report serious sins committed by others members.&lt;ref&gt;August 15, 1997 ''Watchtower'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to report a serious sin of another member is viewed as sharing in the sins of others, a sin before God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight in the Scriptures|volume=2|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=969|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200004132#h=49:186-57:288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses are instructed that pledges of confidentiality may be broken to report what they believe to be transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;"A Time to Speak--When?" ''Watchtower'', September 1, 1987, pp. 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

A congregation's body of elders considers confessions or credible allegations of serious sin, and decides whether a ''judicial committee'' will be formed to address the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"New Arrangements for Congregation Organization", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1977, pages 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; A judicial committee, usually consisting of three elders, investigates the details of the alleged sin further. The committee arranges a formal ''judicial hearing'' to determine the circumstances of the sin, whether the accused is repentant, and whether disciplinary actions will be taken.&lt;ref&gt;""Gifts in Men" to Care for Jehovah’s Sheep", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1999, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Elders, Judge With Righteousness", ''The Watchtower'', July 1, 1992, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshipping—A Loving Provision?", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1995, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain situations, a body of elders may handle a situation involving "serious sin" by a baptized Witness without a judicial committee:
* ''Minor or newly baptized'' - A minor or newly baptized Witness might commit one or two acts of "serious sin" involving tobacco or [[binge drinking|overdrinking]];&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah’s Sheep Need Tender Care", ''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1996, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Watchtower|title=Questions From Readers|date=July 15, 2006|pages=30–31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006528}}&lt;/ref&gt; repercussions as for [[#Discipline involving non-judicial situations|'non-judicial' situations]] may still be imposed.
* ''Repentance'' - The body of elders may believe the sinner's repentance has been established and accepted. For example, if a member committed a "serious sin" several years ago, had formally repented in prayer, and the sin did not involve scheming.&lt;ref&gt;"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', October 1972, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses are strongly discouraged from waiting years to resolve such matters;&lt;ref&gt;"Make Wise Use of Your Christian Freedom", June 1, 1992, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; even if years have passed since the serious sin, it is typical for a judicial committee to be formed, and there may still be repercussions as for ‘non-judicial’ situations.
* ''Judicial abeyance'' - Elders may become aware of a "serious sin" committed by a baptized Witness who has been inactive for some time and is not perceived as a Jehovah’s Witness. If the alleged sinner is not associating with active Witnesses, the elders may indefinitely postpone a judicial committee and formal hearing unless and until the individual renews their association with the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;""A Time to Speak"—When?", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1987, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial committee===

A person accused of a serious sin is informed of the allegations and invited to attend a judicial committee meeting. The individual is permitted to bring witnesses who can speak in their defense; observers are not allowed,&lt;ref name="flock"&gt;''Pay Attention to Yourselves and All the Flock'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1991, page 110-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and the hearing is held privately even if the accused individual requests that it be heard openly so all may witness the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' Commentary Press, 2007, page 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether accused individuals have always had the option to call witnesses. The judicial committee hearing accusations that resulted in the disfellowshipping of Canadian Witness James Penton in February 1981 refused Penton's request to have a lawyer present and to call witnesses. See James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'' (Welch Publishing, 1986, page 71).&lt;/ref&gt; Recording devices are not permitted at the hearing.&lt;ref name="flock" /&gt; If the accused repeatedly fails to attend an arranged hearing, the committee will proceed but will not make a decision until evidence and testimony by witnesses are considered.&lt;ref name="flock" /&gt;

The committee takes the role of prosecutor, judge and jury when handling its cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, 1997, page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no admission of guilt, the individual is informed of the source of the charges and witnesses are presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all witnesses are dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused.&lt;ref name="flock" /&gt;

The committee may determine that there was no "serious sin", or that mitigating circumstances absolve the accused individual. The committee may then proceed with discipline such as is described for 'non-judicial' situations.&lt;ref&gt;"New Arrangements for Congregation Organization", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1977, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the committee may decide that a serious sin was committed, in which case, the committee gives verbal admonitions and gauges the individual's attitude and repentance. The committee then decides whether discipline will involve formal reproof or disfellowshipping.

===Reproof===
''Reproof'' involves actions for which a person could be disfellowshipped, and is said to be an effort to 'reach the heart' and convince a person of the need to hate the sanctioned actions&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 12/1/76 p. 723 par. 15 How Wise Reprovers Aid Erring Ones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 9/1/81 p. 23 par. 9 Repentance Leading Back to God&lt;/ref&gt; and repent.&lt;ref&gt;"Imitate Jehovah—Exercise Justice and Righteousness", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1998, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Reproof is considered sufficient if the individual is deemed repentant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 9/15/87 p. 13 par. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 9/1/81 p. 26 par. 23 Repentance Leading Back to God&lt;/ref&gt;
Reproof is given before all who are aware of the transgression. If the conduct is known only to the individual and the judicial committee, reproof is given privately. If the sin is known by a small number, they would be invited by the elders, and reproof would be given before the sinner and those with knowledge of the sin. If the action is known generally by the entire congregation or the wider community, an announcement is made that the person "has been reproved".&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 12/1/76 p. 733 par. 14 Giving Reproof "Before All Onlookers"&lt;/ref&gt; A related [[#Local needs|''local needs'']] talk may be given, separately to the announcement, without naming anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organized to Do Jehovah's Will|year=2015|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=135|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/Organized-to-Do-Jehovahs-Will/|quote=Elders will use discernment in determining whether a particular situation is sufficiently serious and disturbing to others to warrant a warning talk. The speaker will provide appropriate counsel concerning disorderly conduct, but he will not name the disorderly one. Consequently, those who are aware of the situation described in the talk will take care to avoid socializing with such an individual, although they will continue spiritual association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all cases of reproof, restrictions are imposed,&lt;ref name="org139" /&gt; typically prohibiting the individual from sharing in meeting parts, commenting during meetings, and giving group prayers. A reproved Witness cannot enroll as a pioneer or auxiliary pioneer for at least one year after reproof is given.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Kingdom Ministry'' March 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Always Accept Jehovah’s Discipline|journal=The Watchtower|date=November 15, 2006|page=30|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006845#h=27:0-28:0|quote=During the time that an individual who has been judicially reproved is healing spiritually... it would be beneficial for the repentant one to listen rather than comment at meetings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disfellowshipping===
All members are expected to abide by the beliefs and moral standards of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=How Baptism Can Save Us|magazine=The Watchtower|date=Jan 15, 1989|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious violations of these requirements can result in ''disfellowshipping'' (similar to [[excommunication]]) and subsequent [[shunning]] if not deemed repentant.&lt;ref name="wt091581"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Disfellowshiping—How to View It|magazine=The Watchtower|date=September 15, 1981|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JWshun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Shun Former Members of Their Religion?|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/shunning/|website=JW.ORG|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|accessdate=29 January 2017|quote=A baptized Witness makes a practice of breaking the Bible’s moral code and does not repent, he or she will be shunned or disfellowshipped...

Disfellowshipped people who reject improper conduct and demonstrate a sincere desire to live by the Bible’s standards are always welcome to become members of the congregation again.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a judicial committee decides that a baptized Witness has committed a serious sin and is unrepentant, the person is disfellowshipped. A person who believes that a serious error in judgment has been made may appeal the decision. Requests for appeal must be made in writing and within seven days of the decision of the judicial committee. Their shunning policy is based on their interpretation of scriptures such as 1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians&amp;nbsp;5:11–13; Matthew&amp;nbsp;18:15–17; and 2&amp;nbsp;John&amp;nbsp;9–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Keep Yourselves in God's Love|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=You May Gain Your Brother|magazine=The Watchtower|date=October 15, 1999|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witness literature states that avoiding interaction with disfellowshipped former adherents helps to:&lt;ref name="wt111506"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=November 15, 2006|page=27|title=Always Accept Jehovah's Discipline}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*avoid reproach on God's name and organization by indicating that violations of the Bible's standards in their ranks are not tolerated;
*keep the congregation free of possible corrosive influences;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Jealous for the Pure Worship of Jehovah|magazine=The Watchtower|date=September 15, 1995|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

Shunning is also practiced when a member formally resigns membership or is deemed to indicate by their actions—such as accepting a blood transfusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/790967.stm|title=Jehovah's Witnesses drop transfusion ban|quote="transfusions have been relegated to 'non-disfellowshipping events' ...

Such individuals are said to have ''disassociated'',&lt;ref name="wt101586" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wt091581" /&gt; and are described by the Watch Tower Society as "lawless" in a spiritual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Do You Hate Lawlessness?|magazine=The Watchtower|date=February 15, 2011|page=31|quote=Do we share Jesus' view of those who have become set in their lawless course? We need to give thought to these questions: 'Would I choose to associate regularly with someone who has been disfellowshipped or who has disassociated himself from the Christian congregation?

When a person is disfellowshipped or is deemed to have disassociated, an announcement is made at the next [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Midweek meeting|midweek meeting]] that the named individual "is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses". Congregation members are not informed whether a person is being shunned due to "disfellowshipping" or "disassociation", or on what grounds. Shunning starts immediately after the announcement is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock|pages=121–122|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shepherd the Flock of God|page=104|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notification form is sent to the local branch office and records of the disfellowshipping are saved in the congregational records. Both are kept until at least five years after reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter|publisher=Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses|recipient=All bodies of elders|subject=Re: Correspondence from branch office and congregation file |date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Branch Organization Manual|page=98|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to adhere to the directions on shunning is itself considered a serious offense. Members who continue to speak to or associate with a disfellowshipped or disassociated person are said to be sharing in their "wicked works"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pay Attention to Yourselves and all the Flock|page=103|quote=2&amp;nbsp;John&amp;nbsp;11 ("For he that says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.")}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may themselves be disfellowshipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Botting| first = Heather |author2=[[Gary Botting]] | title = The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1984| pages = 91| isbn = 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are made in some cases, such as business relations and immediate family household situations.&lt;ref name="JWshun" /&gt; If a disfellowshipped person is living in the same home with other baptized family members, religious matters are not discussed, with the exception of minors, for whose training parents are still responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Keep Yourselves in God's Love"|year=2008|publisher=Watch Tower Society|pages=207–208|quote=We do not have spiritual or social fellowship with disfellowshipped ones. ... In some instances, the disfellowshipped family member may still be living in the same home as part of the immediate household. Since his being disfellowshipped does not sever the family ties, normal day-to-day family activities and dealings may continue. Yet, by his course, the individual has chosen to break the spiritual bond between him and his believing family. So loyal family members can no longer have spiritual fellowship with him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Can You Help a 'Prodigal' Child?|date=October 1, 2001|pages=16–17|journal=Watchtower}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disfellowshipped family members outside the home are shunned.&lt;ref name="wt091581" /&gt; Disfellowshipped individuals can continue attending public meetings held at the Kingdom Hall, though they are shunned by the congregation.&lt;ref name="meetings"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Awake!|title=Safeguard Your Heart|date=8 July 1970|page=28|quote=And if he seeks reinstatement, he must show his sincerity by attending congregation meetings with no one speaking to him, all the while giving evidence of repentance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reinstatement====
Disfellowshipped individuals may be reinstated into the congregation if they are considered repentant of their previous actions and attitude. If a disassociated or disfellowshipped individual requests reinstatement, a judicial committee, (the committee originally involved, if available) seeks to determine whether the person has repented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=April 15, 1991|page=21|title="An Overseer Must Be ... Self-Controlled"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals must demonstrate that they no longer practice the conduct for which they were expelled from the congregation, as well as submission to the group's regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=August 1, 1998|page=16|title=Imitate Jehovah—Exercise Justice and Righteousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=May 1, 1998|page=15|title=The Challenge of Following in His Footsteps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wt111506" /&gt; Individuals disfellowshipped for actions no longer considered serious sins, such as organ transplants, are not automatically reinstated. Attending meetings while being shunned is a requirement for eventual reinstatement.&lt;ref name="wt081582"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=August 15, 1992|page=31|title=A Step on the Way Back}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meetings" /&gt; Once a decision is made to reinstate, a brief announcement is made to the congregation that the individual "is reinstated as one of Jehovah's Witnesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organised to Do Jehovah's Will|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=2016|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elders are instructed to make an attempt each year to remind disfellowshipped individuals of the steps they can take to qualify for reinstatement.&lt;ref name="JWshun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wt081582" /&gt; No specific period of time is prescribed before this can happen; however, the Watch Tower Society suggests a period of "perhaps many months, a year, or longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shepherd the Flock of God|page=119|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Correspondence Guidelines|pages=109–110|publisher=Watch Tower Society|quote=The elders are careful to allow sufficient time, perhaps a year or even longer, for the disfellowshipped person to demonstrate that his profession of repentance is genuine. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=October 1, 1998|page=18|title=Imitate Jehovah's Mercy|quote=Although it seems that the wrongdoer in Corinth was reinstated within a relatively short period of time, this is not to be used as a standard for all disfellowshippings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Watch Tower Society stated that about one third of those disfellowshipped eventually return to the group, based on figures gathered from 1963 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Divine Mercy Points the Way Back for Erring Ones|magazine=The Watchtower|date=August 1, 1974|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2014}}

Congregational restrictions are imposed on reinstated individuals. Participation at religious meetings, including commenting from the audience, is initially not permitted; such "privileges" may be gradually permitted over time if the individual is considered to have "progressed spiritually".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shepherd the Flock of God|page=121|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinstated individuals may be ineligible for many years from serving in positions of responsibility such as an elder, ministerial servant or pioneer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Circuit Overseer Guidelines|pages=72–73|publisher=Watch Tower Society|quote=depending on the gravity of the wrongdoing, this might take five, ten, or more years.

Neither would he qualify to serve as an auxiliary or regular pioneer or be assigned to help with the literature, accounts, magazines, attendants, or similar assignments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legality====
In June 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the Witnesses' right to shun those who fail to live by the group's standards and doctrines, upholding the ruling of a lower court. The court concluded that, "Shunning is a practice engaged in by Jehovah's Witnesses pursuant to their interpretation of canonical text, and we are not free to reinterpret that text. ... We find the practice of shunning not to constitute a sufficient threat to the peace, safety, or morality of the community as to warrant state intervention. ... the defendants are entitled to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. ... Courts generally do not scrutinize closely the relationship among members (or former members) of a church. Churches are afforded great latitude when they impose discipline on members or former members. ... The members of the Church Paul decided to abandon have concluded that they no longer want to associate with her. We hold that they are free to make that choice. ... Although we recognize that the harms suffered by Janice Paul are real and not insubstantial, permitting her to recover for intangible or emotional injuries would unconstitutionally restrict the Jehovah's Witnesses free exercise of religion. ... The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religion requires that society tolerate the type of harms suffered by Paul as a price well worth paying to safeguard the right of religious difference that all citizens enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Paul v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York Inc |vol=819 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=875 |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=http://openjurist.org/819/f2d/875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit|magazine=The Watchtower|date=April 15, 1988|pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Religion: The Right To Shun|magazine=Time|date=June 29, 1987|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964816,00.html|quote=The Constitution's guarantee of "free exercise," said the appeals panel, applies even to unpopular groups and practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the case, the ''Washington University Law Quarterly'' remarked, "The Ninth Circuit's extension of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an emotional injury, which is often times as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an absolute privilege against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head and use it as a means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ptasiewicz|first1=Seth|title=The Ninth Circuit's Eleventh Commandment to Religious Groups: Thou Shalt Not Be Liable for Thine Intentional Intangible Torts: Paul v.

== Unbaptized publishers ==
An unbaptized individual who has previously been approved to share in Jehovah's Witnesses' formal ministry, but who subsequently behaves in a manner considered inappropriate may lose privileges, such as commenting at meetings, receiving assignments, or even accompanying the congregation in the public ministry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 11/15/88 p. 18 par. 14 Helping Others to Worship God&lt;/ref&gt;

If an unbaptized individual is deemed unrepentant of actions for which baptized members might be disfellowshipped, an announcement would be made that the person "is no longer a publisher of the good news."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 11/15/88 p. 19 par. 17 Helping Others to Worship God&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals were previously shunned, but formal restrictions are no longer imposed on unbaptized individuals, though association is generally curtailed. The elders might privately warn individuals in the congregation if the unbaptized person is considered to pose "an unusual threat".&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 11/15/88 p. 19 par. 19 Helping Others to Worship God&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical view==
The only way to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to disassociate or be disfellowshipped, and both entail the same set of prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Sociologist Andrew Holden has claimed that fear of family break-up or loss causes people who might otherwise freely leave the group to remain members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | pages = 150, 156–157 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'' chap. 15 p. 232 "Development of the Organization Structure"&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contend that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search Of Christian Freedom'', pp.374–390. Franz claims the Watch Tower organization ignores the "clear principle of openness in the conduct of judicial proceedings" and cites the Watch Tower Society publication, ''Insight on the Scriptures'', Vol 1, p. 518, which states that "publicity that would be afforded any trial at the gate would tend to influence the judges toward care and justice in the trial proceedings and in their decisions".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Raymond Franz]], a letter dated September 1, 1980, from the Watch Tower Society to all circuit and district overseers advised that a member who "merely disagrees in thought with any of the Watch Tower Society's teachings is committing apostasy and is liable for disfellowshipping."&lt;ref name="Franz 2004. pp. 341-2"&gt;[[Raymond Franz#Leaving New York and starting a new life|Franz, Raymond]]. ''[[Crisis of Conscience]]''. 4th ed. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 2004. pp. 341-2. {{ISBN|0-914675-24-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter states that one does not have to "promote" different doctrines to be an apostate, adding that elders need to "discern between one who is a trouble-making apostate and a Christian who becomes weak in the faith and has doubts."&lt;ref name="Franz 2004. pp. 341-2"/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
The "'''Jewish state'''" is a political term used to describe the [[nation state]] of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104177.html|title=Defining 'Jewish state': The term was coined by Theodor Herzl, founder of the modern Zionist movement. For some, the term has different meanings|date=2 October 2010|work=The Washington Post|first=Glenn|last=Kessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Israel came into existence on 14 May 1948 as the [[homeland for the Jewish people]]. It was also defined in its declaration of independence as a "Jewish state," a term that appeared in the United Nations partition decision of 1947 as well.  The related term "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" dates from 1992 legislation by the Israeli [[Knesset]].

Since its establishment, Israel has passed many laws which reflect on the Jewish identity and values of the majority (about 75% in 2016) of its citizens. However, the secular versus religious debate in Israel in particular has focused debate on the Jewish nature of the state. Another aspect of the debate is the status of minorities in Israel, most notably the Israeli Arab population.

In pre-modern times, the religious laws of [[Judaism]] defined a number of prerogatives for a [[Halachic state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kohler|first1=George Y.|title=Reading Maimonides' philosophy in 19th Century Germany the guide to religious reform|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9400740352|page=146|quote=Maimonides' Messiah is a mortal, worldly kind whose task it is to build a sovereign Jewish state}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Theodor Herzl]] who in 1896 wrote ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State'') giving birth to the modern [[Zionist]] movement, he envisioned a state based on European models, which included religious institutions under the aegis of the state. In order to avoid alienating the Ottoman Sultan, there was no explicit reference to a Jewish state by the Zionist Organisation that he founded. The phrase "national home" was intentionally used instead of "state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1942 [[Biltmore Conference|Biltmore Program]] of the Zionist Organization explicitly proposed "that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth." In 1946, the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], also known as the [[Grady-Morrison Committee]], noted that the demand for a Jewish State went beyond the obligations of either the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate, and had been expressly disowned by the Chairman of the Jewish Agency as recently as 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angch05.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. Chapter V: the Jewish Attitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which brought the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]] to an end in 1948, referred to a "Jewish state" and an "Arab state."

The term "Jewish state" has been in common usage in the media since the establishment of Israel, and the term was used interchangeably with Israel.  [[George W. Bush]] used the term in his speeches and in an exchange of letters with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Reference+Documents/Exchange+of+letters+Sharon-Bush+14-Apr-2004.htm Exchange of letters between PM Sharon and President Bush]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama]] has also used the phrase, for instance in a speech in September 2010 to the U.N. General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ObamaUNSpeech&gt;Remarks by the President to the United Nations General Assembly,  23 September 2010 [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/09/23/remarks-president-united-nations-general-assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government of Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a "Jewish state" a precondition in the peace negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Israel agrees to free 400 Palestinian prisoners before Annapolis summit  |author=[[Aluf Benn]] |date= 12 November 2007 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-agrees-to-free-400-palestinian-prisoners-before-annapolis-summit-1.233026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the government of his successor [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. However, Palestinians regard a "Jewish state" as a trap, a new demand that did not come up during years of negotiations in the 1990s or in peace treaties reached with Egypt and Jordan. The Palestine Liberation Organization recognized the State of Israel as part of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Palestinians regard acceptance of the demand as giving up the [[Palestinian right of return|right of return.]]&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;Washington Post, 2 October 2010: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104177.html?wprss=rss_world Defining 'Jewish state': For many, term has different meanings]&lt;/ref&gt;

This apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that Israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters.&amp;nbsp;... It is important to note that from a multicultural point of view, this self-restrained secularism allows Muslim law to be practiced in Israel for personal matters of the Muslim community.

In Israeli public life, tensions frequently arise among different streams of Judaism: Ultra-Orthodox, National-Religious, ''Mesorati'' (Conservative), Reconstructionist Progressive (Reform), and varying combinations of traditionalism and non-observance. Despite this variety in religious observances in society, Orthodox Judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams. This boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between Israel nationalism and state building.&amp;nbsp;... Since the founding period, in order to defuse religious tensions, the State of Israel has adopted what is known as the 'status quo,' an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion, and that conflict between the observant and non-observant sectors would be handled circumstantially. The 'status quo' has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular Jews in Israel. This situation was designed to appease the religious sector, and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments.&amp;nbsp;... On one hand, the Declaration of Independence adopted in 1948 explicitly guarantees freedom of religion. On the other, it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the definition of the state as [[Jewish and democratic state|Jewish]] creates a strong connection as well as a conflict between state law and religious law. Political interaction of different parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the British Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Englard|first=Izhak|date=Winter 1987|title=Law and Religion in Israel|jstor=840166|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|publisher= American Society of Comparative Law|volume=35|issue=1|pages=185–208|doi= |quote="The great political and ideological importance of religion in the state of Israel manifests itself in the manifold legal provisions concerned with religions phenomenon. ...

==Homeland for the Jewish people==
The 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], referred to "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". The 1922 [[Churchill White Paper]] clarified that "Phrases have been used such as that Palestine is to become 'as Jewish as England is English.' His Majesty's Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view. They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded 'in Palestine.'"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iAyPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Arab-Israeli Conflict: An Introduction and Documentary Reader]'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a national [[homeland for the Jewish people]] is enshrined in Israeli national policy and reflected in many of Israel's public and national [[institutions]]. The concept was adopted in the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948 as the objective of the establishment of modern Israel. The principle was given legal effect in the [[Law of Return]], which was passed by the [[Knesset]] on 5 July 1950, and stated "Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an [[aliyah|oleh]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/Text_of_Law_of_Return.html Text of Law of Return]&lt;/ref&gt; This was modified in 1970 to include non-Jews with a Jewish grandparent, and their spouses.

==Jewish state or a state of Jews?==
{{see also|Jewish and democratic state}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
There has been ongoing debate in Israel on the character of the state, regarding whether it should enshrine more [[Jewish culture]], encourage [[Judaism]] in schools, and enshrine certain laws of [[Kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]] observance. This debate reflects a historical divide within [[Zionism]] and among the Jewish citizens of Israel, which has large [[secularism|secular]] and traditional/[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] minorities as well as a majority which lies somewhere in between.

Secular Zionism, the historically dominant stream, is rooted in a concept of the Jews as a [[people]] that have a right to [[self-determination]]. Another reason sometimes submitted for such establishment was to have a state where Jews would not be afraid of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] attacks and live in peace. But such a reason is not a requirement of the self-determination right and so is subsidiary to it in secular Zionist thinking.

[[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]], who believe that religious beliefs and traditional practices are central to [[Jewish peoplehood]], counter that assimilating to be a secular "nation like any other" would be [[oxymoron]]ic in nature, and harm more than help the Jewish people.  They seek instead to establish what they see as an "authentic Jewish commonwealth" which preserves and encourages Jewish heritage.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Drawing an analogy to [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]] who [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other cultures and abandoned Jewish culture, whether voluntary or otherwise, they argue that the creation of a secular state in Israel is tantamount to establishing a state where Jews assimilate ''en masse'' as a nation, and therefore anathema to what they view as Jewish national aspirations. Zionism is rooted in a concept of the Jews as a [[nation]]. In this capacity, they believe that Israel has a mandate to promote Judaism, to be the center of Jewish culture and center of its population, perhaps even the sole legitimate representative of Jews worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Partisans of the first view are predominantly, though by no means exclusively, secular or less traditional.  Partisans of the second view are almost exclusively traditional or Orthodox, although they also include supporters who follow other streams of Judaism or are less traditional but [[Conservatism|conservative]] and would not object to a more prominent state role in promoting Jewish beliefs—although not to the point of creating a purely [[Halachic state]].

The debate is therefore characterized by significant polarities.  Secular and religious Zionists argue passionately about what a Jewish state should represent. [[Post-Zionism|Post-Zionists]] and Zionists argue about whether a Jewish state should exist at all.  Because Israel was created within the sphere of international law as the instrument for Jewish self-determination, these polarities are captured by the questions: should Israel maintain and strengthen its status as a state for the Jewish people, or transition to being a state purely for "all of its citizens", or identify as both? And, if both, how to resolve any tensions that arise from their coexistence.  To date, Israel has steered a course between [[secularism]] and [[Jewish identity]], usually depending on who controls the Israeli [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]].

On 19 November 2008, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Tzipi Livni]] addressed the [[United Jewish Communities]] General Assembly in Jerusalem. In her speech, she announced: "These two goals of Israel as [[A Jewish and Democratic State|a Jewish and a democratic state]] must coexist and not contradict each other. So, what does that mean, a Jewish state? It is not only a matter of the number of Jews who live in Israel. It is not just a matter of numbers but a matter of values. The Jewish state is a matter of values, but it is not just a matter of religion, it is also a matter of nationality. And a Jewish state is not a monopoly of rabbis. It is not. It is about the nature of the State of Israel. It is about Jewish tradition. It is about Jewish history, regardless of the question of what each and every Israeli citizen does in his own home on Saturdays and what he does on the Jewish holidays. We need to maintain the nature of the State of Israel, the character of the State of Israel, because this is the ''raison d'être'' of the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2008/Address_FM_Livni_UJC_GA_19-Nov-2008 Address by FM Livni to the UJC GA] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 19 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Jewish commonwealth==
Advocates of Israel becoming a more narrowly Jewish commonwealth face at least the following practical and theoretical difficulties:

# How to deal with the non-Jewish [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab minority in Israel]] (and the [[Palestinian refugee|non-Jewish majority]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]).
# How to alleviate concerns of Jews in Israel who favor a relatively secular state.&lt;ref name=hagalil&gt;[http://www.hagalil.com/GuShalom/shonoth/demokrat.htm Halacha and Democracy] (haGalil)&lt;/ref&gt;

# How to integrate the [[economy of Israel|economy of the state]] in line with [[halakha|Jewish law]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Theorists who grapple with these issues focus on the future of the State of Israel and realize that although the sovereign political state has been established, there is still much work to be done in relation to the ''identity'' of the state itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1448&amp;subject=181 The State of Israel in Halachic Thought] by Gerald J. Blidstein (WZO)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Arabs’ opinion== 
A poll commissioned by the [[Israel Democracy Institute]] in 2007 found that 75% of [[Arab-Israeli]]s would support a constitution that maintained Israel as [[a Jewish and democratic state]] with equal minority rights:

A vast majority of Israeli Arabs would support a constitution that maintained Israel's status as [[a Jewish and democratic state]] while guaranteeing equal rights for minorities, according to a poll whose results were published on Sunday 29 April 2007.&lt;ref name="Poll" /&gt; Among the 507 people who participated in the poll, some 75 percent said they would agree with such a definition while 23 percent said they would oppose it.&lt;ref name="Poll"&gt;[http://jewschool.com/2007/04/30/12246/75-of-israeli-arabs-support-jewish-state-with-true-minority-rights/ Poll of Arab-Israelis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The notion that Israel should be constituted in the name of and maintain a special relationship with a particular group of people, the Jewish people, has drawn much controversy vis-à-vis minority groups living in Israel—the large number of [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] [[Palestinians]] residing in Israel and, to the extent that those territories are claimed to be governed as part of Israel and not as areas under military occupation, in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. For example, the Israeli [[National Anthem]], [[Hatikvah]], refers to Jews by name as well as alluding to the concept of [[Zionism]], and it contains no mention of Palestinian Arab [[culture]]. This anthem therefore excludes non-Jews from its narrative of national identity. Similar criticism has been made of the [[Israeli flag]] which resembles the [[Tallit]] (a Jewish prayer shawl) and features a [[Star of David]], universally acknowledged as a symbol of [[Judaism]]. Critics of Israel as a Jewish state, particularly a [[nation state]], have suggested that it should adopt more inclusive and neutral symbolism.

In the course of the [[Cold War]], the [[Soviet Union]], its satellite states and agencies, as well as many African, Asian and Arab states,  presented the concept of Zionism and the Jewish state as an embodiment of [[racism]], [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]]. In 1975, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379]], which equated Zionism with racism, was passed by a vote of 72 to 35. It was partially revoked by [[UN General Assembly Resolution 4686]] in 1991 by a vote of 111 to 25.

[[Linguistics|Linguist]] and political commentator [[Noam Chomsky]] makes a distinction between the concept of "a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine" and that of "a Jewish state" in his interview on [[C-SPAN]], saying that he has always supported a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine, which is different from a Jewish state. He says that there is a strong case to be made for an ethnic homeland, but he has always been opposed to a Jewish state, for the same reasons he would be opposed to "a Christian state, or a [[White people|White]] state, or an [[Islamic republic]]". Chomsky believes the concept of a Jewish State (or Muslim, Christian or White State) directly contradicts the concept of a democratic state as it is understood in the Western tradition, because liberal democracy is founded upon a principle in which there is no privileged citizen.&lt;ref name=cspan-noam&gt;{{cite AV media

Some Jewish nationalists base the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state on the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] and ancient historical ties to the land, asserting that both play particular roles as evidence under international law, as well as a fear that a hostile Arab world might be disrespectful of a Jewish minority—alleging a variety of possible harms up to and including [[genocide]]—were Israel to become a post-national "state for all its citizens." They also note that many European and Asian states such as Republic of Ireland, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, and Finland maintain identities based on ethnicity and culture, and often provide simpler immigration procedures to individuals with ethnic ties to them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

To many Arab and Muslim leaders, following the popular usage in their communities, even referring to Israel by its proper name has political and cultural implications, resulting in use of [[circumlocution]]s such as "the [[Zionist entity]]".

'''Louis William Rogers''' (May 28, 1859 – April 18, 1953), commonly known as "L.W.," was an [[United States|American]] teacher, [[brakeman|railway brakeman]], [[trade union]] functionary, [[socialism|socialist]] political activist, and newspaper editor. Rogers is best remembered in this context as one of the key officials of the [[American Railway Union]] jailed in conjunction with the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. After more than two decades in and around the labor movement, Rogers shifted his activity to [[mysticism]] as a prominent lecturer, writer, and long-time President of the [[Theosophical Society in America]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Louis William Rogers was born in the state of [[Iowa]] in the [[Midwestern United States]] on May 28, 1859. Trained as a [[teacher]], Rogers taught in the public schools of Iowa and [[Kansas]] for a period of five years, beginning late in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=Gompers&gt;Stuart B. Kaufman, Peter J. Albert, and Grace Palladino (eds.), ''The Samuel Gompers Papers: Volume 4: A National Labor Movement Takes Shape, 1895-98.'' Urbana, IL: Illinois University Press, 1991; pp. 547-548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers later went to work as a brakeman, a crew member of a locomotive train who helped regulate the speed through the manual application of brakes.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; He worked across a number of midwestern railways, including the [[St. Louis–San Francisco Railway|Kansas City, Springfield &amp; Memphis]], the [[Wabash Railroad|Wabash &amp; Western]], the [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]], and the [[Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy]].&lt;ref name=RNR&gt;''Railway News Reporter,'' Dec. 1890, quoted in "L.W. Rogers," ''Railroad Trainmen's Journal,'' vol. 8, no. 12 (Dec. 1892), pp. 878-879.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers was fired from his position on the latter road during the [[Burlington railroad strike of 1888]], when he supported the locomotive engineers striking the road.&lt;ref name=RNR /&gt; Following his dismissal Rogers toured the Burlington route engaging in public speeches on behalf of the strikers, traveling from Illinois all the way to Colorado on his mission.&lt;ref name=RNR /&gt;

Leaving actual railway work after his dismissal from the Burlington &amp; Quincy, Rogers launched his first newspaper, the ''Railroad Patriot'' in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; The paper proved to be short-lived, terminating publication the following year.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

With his newspaper having folded, in 1889 Rogers moved to the state of [[Colorado]], where he first became active in the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen]] (BRB), known from 1890 as the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen]] (BRT).&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; He edited two short-lived newspapers in Colorado, the ''Denver Patriot'' and the ''Vona Herald" as the 1880s came to a close.&lt;ref name=RNR /&gt; 

In September 1889, Rogers was chosen as a delegate to the national convention of the BRB, which selected him as editor of the official organ of the union, the ''Railroad Brakemen's Journal.''&lt;ref name=RNR /&gt; He continued in this capacity until the end of 1892.&lt;ref&gt;"L.W. Rogers," ''Railroad Trainmen's Journal,'' vol. 8, no. 12 (Dec. 1892), pp. 878-879.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s Rogers also became a public lecturer on [[Freethought]] and its underlying philosophical doctrine of [[Rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

Early in the 1890s Rogers returned to the Midwest, moving first to [[Galesburg, Illinois]], then to Chicago, and finally  in 1892 to [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; There Rogers established a new newspaper, the ''Age of Labor,'' which he published and edited until its 1893 merger with ''The Labor Advocate,'' one of the prominent labor newspapers of the day.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

In 1893 Rogers helped to establish the [[Wisconsin State Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

===American Railway Union activities===
[[File:Eugene Debs Martin Elliott 300.jpg|thumb|right|300px|L.W. Rogers with his fellow officers of the American Railway Union: Elliott, Keliher, Hogan, Burns, Goodwin, and Debs.]]
[[File:WoodstockILCourtHJail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|McHenry County Courthouse and Jail in Woodstock, Illinois as they appear today.]]

As a veteran trade unionist and railway worker, Rogers found the 1894 establishment of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU) by former [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] official [[Eugene V. Debs]] to be irresistible — an attempt to create an [[industrial union]] joining workers in the myriad of railway crafts into a centralized and therefore powerful organization. Rogers became active in the ARU, was named to the organization's 7 member Executive Board, and was appointed editor of the organization's weekly newspaper, ''[[Railway Times]].''&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

This position as an ARU executive put Rogers in harm's way, however, as a victim of the process set in motion when the U.S. government sought to end the bitter 1894 [[Pullman Strike]] launched by the ARU by means of [[injunction|judicial injunction]].

On July 2, 1894, United States Attorney General [[Richard Olney]] and his assistant Edwin Walker instructed Chicago US Attorney Thomas M. Milchrist to file a [[bill in equity]] with the combined US District and Circuit Courts summarizing the harm allegedly done to the railroads and to commerce by the ARU [[strike action|strike]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Papke, ''The Pullman Case: The Clash of Labor and Capital in Industrial America.'' Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 1999; pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; District Court Judge [[Peter S. Grosscup]] and Circuit Court Judge [[William A. Woods]] actively worked with the petitioner to shape and refine the injunction request, which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges on that same day ordered that 10,000 copies of their newly granted injunction be printed and distributed by [[federal marshal]]s along the striking railroad lines.&lt;ref name=Papke41&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The ARU was thereby ordered to cease and desist interfering with or hindering trains on any involved railroad or any train carrying [[U.S. Mail]].&lt;ref name=Papke41 /&gt;

When the strike was not terminated two weeks after issuance of the injunction, the government returned to court charging that ARU head Gene Debs, Vice President George W. Howard, Secretary [[Sylvester Keliher]], and Editor Rogers were in [[contempt of court]] for failing to abide by the injunction.&lt;ref&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This July 17 hearing did not actually find the four to be in contempt, but nevertheless presiding judge William H. Seaman ordered the defendants to be temporarily held pending another hearing on July 23.&lt;ref name=Papke44&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Bail was set at $3,000 each.&lt;ref name=Papke44 /&gt;

Rogers and his three ARU associates surrendered to authorities the same afternoon that the so-called "body attachment order" was issued.&lt;ref name=Papke44 /&gt; To the surprise of contemporary observers, all four ARU officials waived the right to post bail and were immediately jailed.&lt;ref name=Papke44 /&gt; Rogers later recalled that the substantial amount set for bail was not the cause of this decision, declaring, "If it was $2, I'd go to jail. This is a mighty test between labor and capital, and we will fight it to the finish."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to an indefinite end to the period of incarceration, this decision was quietly reversed on July 25, 1894, when bail was posted and Debs, Rogers and the other ARU leaders freed from the [[Cook County Jail]].&lt;ref name=Const72&gt;J. Robert Constantine (ed.), ''Letters of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 1, 1874-1912.'' Urbana, IL: Illinois University Press, 1990; pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Trial was set to begin on September 5.&lt;ref name=Const72 /&gt;

On December 14, 1894, fully three months after the trial of the ARU had been held, Judge Woods finally issued a lengthy ruling. Wood found the union and its leaders guilty of having conducted an illegal strike in violation of the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debs was sentenced to 6 months in jail as leader of the ARU, while Rogers and the other defendants in the case were sentenced to terms of 3 months.&lt;ref name=Papke50&gt;Papke, ''The Pullman Case,'' pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentences were not to be served in Chicago's [[Cook County Jail]], but rather in [[McHenry County Jail]] in neighboring [[Woodstock, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=Papke50 /&gt; These sentences were served, starting in June 1895, with Rogers and the other 5 members of the ARU Executive Board gaining their release on August 22.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine (ed.), ''Letters of Eugene V. Debs: Vol. 1,'' pg. 98, fn. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Debs was released three months later. Additional civil penalties were assessed against the union.

===Later labor activism===

Upon his release, the ARU having been effectively crushed in the failed Pullman strike, Rogers moved to [[Pueblo, Colorado]], where he worked as an organizer for the [[American Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; He also edited yet another labor newspaper in 1896, the ''Industrial Advocate.''&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

With the launch of the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] in 1897, an organization springing in large part from activists loyal to Gene Debs and his ARU, Rogers became involved in the affairs of that organization. He returned to Chicago to edit the new political party's official organ, ''The Social Democrat'' for a time, and helped to manage the massive speaking tours of Debs, one of the renowned [[orator]]s of the day, for the next two years.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

While remaining involved in socialist politics, Rogers remained a participant in the economic labor movement as well, serving as President of the [[Michigan Federation of Labor]] from 1898 to 1899.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

===Theosophy===

In the 20th Century, Rogers turned his attention to a new interest, [[mysticism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. In 1903 Rogers joined the [[Theosophical Society in America]] (TSA).&lt;ref name=Quest&gt;Robert Bonnell and Leatrice Kreeger-Bonnell, [http://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/1509 "Memories of L.W. Rogers,"] ''Quest,'' vol. 92, no. 6 (Nov.-Dec. 2004), pp. 224-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers was soon absorbed by the Theosophical movement, lecturing extensively and publishing numerous books and [[pamphlet]]s on [[reincarnation]], [[afterlife|life after death]], [[karma]], and sundry matters of [[idealism|philosophical idealism]].

As one of the most prominent American exponents of esoteric mysticism, Rogers would be elected Vice President of the TSA in 1918, serving in that capacity until 1920, when he would ascend to the Presidency of that organization.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt; Rogers would remain as President of the Theosophical Society for more than a decade, standing down in 1931.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

Following his time at the helm of the TSA, Rogers served as the editor of two of the organization's periodicals — ''Ancient Wisdom,'' which he edited from 1935 to 1936, and ''The Voice,'' from 1951 to 1952.&lt;ref name=Gompers /&gt;

===Death and legacy===

Louis Rogers died on April 18, 1953 in Santa Barbara, California.

'''Lifechanyuan International Family Society''' is a community that was founded in April 2009 by '''Xuefeng''' in Yunnan province, China. From 2009 to 2016, it had been called “the Second Home”, which implied that the community was a sweet and harmonious family home apart from each one’s home of origin, and this “Second Home” also applied a new and different lifestyle.  It was forcibly disbanded in 2016 by the Chinese government.  In 2017 Xuefeng moved to Canada where he set up a new community.

==Doctrine==

Lifechanyuan is the integration of Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, science, and Mao Zedong.   It is not a religion, rather a way of life through communal living and through preserving the environment. Lifechanyuan follows the path of the Greatest Creator, and the core values of Lifechanyuan are to revere the Greatest Creator, revere life, and revere nature.  It requires that its members read the [https://www.scribd.com/document/87670493/Lifechanyuan-Chanyuan-Corpus-The-Greatest-Creator Chanyuan Corpus] and follow the [http://www.smcyinternationalfamily.org/category/800-values/ 800 values for the new era human beings].  There is no marriage allowed in the community.

===Chanyuan Celestial's===

In order to become a Chanyuan Celestial you must be:

1. a civilized person.

2. a kind person.

3. a wise person.

4. a diligent person.

5. a person with great ideals.

6. a person wanting to be a celestial being.

7. a person who keeps promise.

8. a person who loves to bring delighted, joyful, free and happy life to others.

==History==

===Founding of Lifechanyuan===

In 2009, Xuefeng came back to China and established "The Second Home of Lifechanyuan" people group. It had been growing great, with in excess of one hundred and fifty (150) individuals on three ranches in Yunnan Province before it got disbanded by the Chinese government in 2017 In January 2017, in foresight of a promising future, Xuefeng changed the group's name to "Lifechanyuan International Family Society".

==Life in the Community==

There is no marriage allowed as they view it as patriarchal and Xuefeng views marriage as an outdated concept. However committed relationships are allowed.

Each member works for six to eight hours a day(farming, cleaning, or cooking) and share meals together.  Each member gets his or her own bedroom but shared common space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9150">In the academic study of [[theology]], the '''Master of Divinity''' ('''MDiv''', ''magister divinitatis'' in [[Latin]]) is the [[first professional degree]] of the pastoral profession in [[North America]]. It is the most common [[academic degree]] in [[seminary|seminaries]] and [[divinity school]]s (e.g. in 2014 nearly 44% of all US students in schools accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools]] were enrolled in an MDiv program).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ats.edu/member-schools/member-school-list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 - 2015 Annual Data Tables|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data-tables/2014-2015-annual-data-tables.pdf|website=The Association of Theological Schools|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=17 September 2015|location=Table 2.10-B Head Count Enrollment by Degree Category and Program United States|page=31|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[Christian denomination]]s and in some other religions the degree is the standard prerequisite for ordination to the priesthood or pastorship or other appointment, ordination or licensing to professional ministry. At accredited seminaries in the United States this degree requires between 72 and 106 [[credit hour]]s of study (72 being the minimum determined by academic accrediting agencies and 106 being on the upper end of certain schools that wish to ensure a broader study of the related disciplines).

Christian MDiv programs generally include studies in Christian ministry and theology. In 1996 the [[Association of Theological Schools]] established the standard that all accredited MDiv programs should include the following four content areas: Religious Heritage, Cultural Context, Personal and Spiritual Formation, and Capacity for Ministerial and Public Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Gorman|first1=Robert T.|title=Reflections of an 'Investigative Journalist'  on the Four Content Areas of the MDiv|journal=Theological Education|date=2007|volume=43|issue=1|pages=1–2|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/publications-presentations/theological-education/2007-theological-education-v43-n1.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2015|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|issn=0040-5620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coursework usually includes studies in [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], theology, [[philosophy]], [[church history]], [[pastoral theology]], [[Hebrew Bible]] (Old Testament), and [[New Testament]] studies. Many programs also contain courses in [[church growth]], [[ecclesiology]], [[evangelism]], [[systematic theology]], [[Christian education]], [[liturgy|liturgical studies]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[canon law]], and [[patristics]].&lt;ref&gt;For an example of an MDiv degree outline see {{cite web|title=Master of Divinity (MDiv) Degree Outline|url=http://fuller.edu/Academics/School-of-Theology/Masters-Degrees/Master-of-Divinity-Degree-Outline-Fall-2014/|website=Fuller Theological Seminary|publisher=Fuller Theological Seminary|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree may or may not include a [[thesis]].

==Requirement for ordination==
The MDiv is a requirement for ordination in many denominations. For example, the [[United Methodist Church]], one of the largest Protestant Christian denominations in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifteen Largest Protestant Denominations|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-1-the-changing-religious-composition-of-the-u-s/pr_15-05-12_rls_chapter1-03/|website=Pew Research Center Religion &amp; Public Life|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=17 September 2015|date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose students in 2014 made up 9% of all MDiv students enrolled in schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 - 2015 Annual Data Tables|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data-tables/2014-2015-annual-data-tables.pdf|website=The Association of Theological Schools|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=17 September 2015|location=Table 2.16 Church/Denominational Affiliation of Students Currently Enrolled, 2014 United States|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires candidates for ordination as elder to earn an MDiv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church|date=2012|publisher=The United Methodist Publishing House|location=Section IX ¶335|isbn=978-1-426-71812-0|page=260|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requires candidates for ordination as deacon to earn either an MDiv or a master's degree in another field with additional theological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church|date=2012|publisher=The United Methodist Publishing House|location=Section VII ¶330|isbn=978-1-426-71812-0|page=248|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
The Master of Divinity has replaced the [[Bachelor of Divinity]] in most United States seminaries as the [[first professional degree]], since the former title implied in the American academic system that it was on a par with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or other basic [[undergraduate education]] even though a [[bachelor's degree]] previously was and remains a prerequisite for entrance into graduate divinity programs. The Commission on Accrediting of the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] accredits most Christian schools in North America and approves the degree programs they offer, including the MDiv.

The MDiv is a significantly more extensive program than most taught (as opposed to research-based) [[master's degrees]]. In the United States the degree usually consists on average of 90 [[semester]] hours, as opposed to the usual 36 or 48. Ordination in most [[Mainline Protestant|mainline Protestant denominations]] and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] thus requires seven or eight years of education past high school: the first four in undergraduate studies leading to a bachelor's degree (which may or may not be in a related field) and then three or four years of seminary or divinity school education leading to the MDiv.

The MDiv stands in contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] (MA) in theology and [[Master of Theological Studies]] (MTS), the usual academic degrees in the subject (which tend not to include "pastoral" or "practical" courses), and the [[Bachelor of Sacred Theology]] (STB), [[Licentiate in Sacred Theology]] (STL), [[Master of Theology]] (MTh), [[Master of Sacred Theology]] (STM), and [[Master of Religion]] (MRel), which are also academic degrees. Schools with [[Pontifical faculties]] in North America often award both the MDiv and STB at the same time after a three-year period of graduate studies.

==Enrollment differences between genders==
Although in 2014 women made up approximately 53% of all students enrolled in ministerial non-MDiv degree programs at US schools accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools]], they constituted only approximately 29% of all MDiv students in the same schools in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 - 2015 Annual Data Tables|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data-tables/2014-2015-annual-data-tables.pdf|website=The Association of Theological Schools|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=17 September 2015|ref=Table 2.12-B Head Count Enrollment by Race or Ethnic Group, Degree, and Gender, 2014 United States|location=Table 2.12-B Head Count Enrollment by Race or Ethnic Group, Degree, and Gender, 2014 United States|page=37|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group with the most parity in MDiv enrollment numbers between men and women at those schools in that time period were African American students, among whom enrollment numbers were almost equal between genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 - 2015 Annual Data Tables|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data-tables/2014-2015-annual-data-tables.pdf|website=The Association of Theological Schools|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=17 September 2015|ref=Table 2.12-B Head Count Enrollment by Race or Ethnic Group, Degree, and Gender, 2014 United States|location=Table 2.12-B Head Count Enrollment by Race or Ethnic Group, Degree, and Gender, 2014 United States|page=37|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
For the 2014–2015 academic year the average cost per year for MDiv tuition and fees at a school accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools]] was $14,673.50 in the US and $9,493.25 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 - 2015 Annual Data Tables|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data-tables/2014-2015-annual-data-tables.pdf|website=The Association of Theological Schools|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=17 September 2015|location=Table 4.1 Average Tuition and Fees Charged for Selected Degree Programs by Full-Time Equivalent Enrollment|page=139|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Material religion''' is a framework used by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] examining the interaction between [[religion]] and [[material culture]]. Its specific focus is on the place of objects, images, spaces, and buildings in religious communities.

Some scholars within the study of religion have criticised the material religion approach for often seeking to reintroduce the [[phenomenology of religion]] into the discipline.

==Definition==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history, is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world. It always has been and always will be. We can make sense out of the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion, because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human. We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.|source=— Scholar of religion S. Brent Plate, 2014{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=7}} }}

The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate was of the view that "religion must be understood as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices".{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=15}} He stated that "to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies."{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=8}}

==History==

The material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S. Brent Plate, David Morgan, etc.

In 2005, the peer-reviewed journal ''Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief'' was launched. In their editorial statement, the editors described it as "a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices."{{sfn|Editors|2005|p=5}}

==Criticism==
The anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] suggested that the term "material religion" was [[tautology (grammar)|tautological]], in that "religion is inherently material in its very constitution."{{sfn|Coleman|2009|p=360}}

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson suggested that the material religion framework could be an alternative means to explore religion, in contrast to the dominant [[world religions]] paradigm which they regarded as problematic.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|pp=12–13}} They nevertheless thought that material religion represented "phenomenology by stealth".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|p=13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">[[File:Signification of moles.jpg|thumb|''The Signification of Moles'', illustration of an 18th-century chapbook.]]
'''Moleosophy''' or '''moleomancy''' is a technique of [[divination]] and [[fortune telling]] based upon the observation and interpretation of bodily marks — primarily those of the ''melanocytic nevus'' condition (i.e. [[melanocytic nevus|mole]]s).

Although [[divination]] by moles, birthmarks and blemishes has been practiced in many societies throughout history, it has never achieved the status of [[oneiromancy|dream divination]], [[astrology]], or even [[palmistry]]. As such, it has generally been classed a species of [[superstition]] or [[folklore]], rather than a pseudo-science.

==Classical Mole Divination==
Despite a cultural predeliction for [[physiognomy]], which developed in a considerable literature, mole divination was not a major feature of Greco-Roman culture, and references to the practice are rare. Birthmarks enjoyed a somewhat higher status, and are mentioned. [[Seleucus I Nicator]], the first Macedonian king of Syria, was said to have received from Apollo an anchor-shaped birthmark on his thigh, which was also borne by his descendants.

A short Greek manual of mole interpretation survives from antiquity, appended to the end of a much longer work on divination by twitches ascribed to the legendary Greek seer [[Melampus]]. Although the treatise on moles lacks an author, and differs in style from the work on twitches, it is customarily also referred to as by pseudo-Melampus. The text is titled ''Peri Elaion tou Somatos'' "On the Olives of the Body," the term presumably being applied to moles because of their similarity in shape and color. There are indications, however, that the text also covers birthmarks, as "fiery" red "olives" are mentioned.

In general, the work relies on fairly straightforward analogical association. A mark on the back of the throat portends beheading. One on the lips portends overeating. A mark on the nose—which the Greeks like many other cultures associated with the privates—portends the recipient will be "insatiate in lovemaking." Some distinctions are made between men and women, left and right.

A later Turkish translation of the Ps-Melampus text, ascribed to "Leo the Wise," was translated into French  by  Jean Nicolaides (''Les Livres de Divination Traduits sur un Manuscrit Turc Inédit'', 1889).

{{short description|Caves in Mangalore, Karnataka, India}}
The '''Pandava Caves''' are located near [[Kadri Manjunath Temple|Kadri Manjunath temple]] in [[Mangalore]], [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ourkarnataka |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/OKC_ThisWeek/okcthisweek.htm |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians found that the current temple was a [[Buddhist monastery]] known as ''Kandarika'' [[Vihara]]. The shrine had a standing [[Buddha]] image in it. This image was replaced by the King ''Kundvarma'' of the ''Alupa'' dynasty, who was a devotee of [[Shiva]]. However it was not the Buddha but a [[bodhisattva]] who was historically integrated with Shiva. Historians concluded that the vihara was originally a centre of the cult of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaini |first=ed. by Padmanabh S. |title=Collected papers on Buddhist studies |year=2001 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |location=Delhi |isbn=81-208-1776-1 |pages=148–149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlyDot9RyGcC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22kadri%22+%22caves%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AKfOUaiBEMaGrAeL9oCoAQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kadri%22%20%22caves%22&amp;f=false |edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temple was one of the famous centres of learning and pilgrimage until the 11th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sadasivan |first=S.N. |title=A social history of India |year=2000 |publisher=APH Pub.

This document contains the informatio, or life story, of the Servant of God under investigation, as well as a series of documents and [[testimony|testimonies]] to support the cause (summarium).

Chondoism is represented in politics by the [[Chondoist Chongu Party|Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way]],&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt; and is regarded by the government as Korea's "[[ethnic religion|national religion]]"&lt;ref name="Chondoism, National Religion"/&gt; because of its identity as a ''[[minjung]]'' (popular)&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 110"/&gt; and "revolutionary [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt;

==History==
===Before 1945===
{{see also|Religion in South Korea#Ancient Korea}}
In ancient times, most [[Koreans]] believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by ''[[mu (shaman)|mu]]'' (shamans). [[Buddhism]] was introduced from the Chinese [[Former Qin]] state in 372 to the northern Korean state of [[Goguryeo]],&lt;ref name="Korea, 300 to 600 CE"&gt;Asia For Educators: ''[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/tps/300ce_ko.htm#buddhism Korea, 300 to 600 CE]''. Columbia University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and developed into [[Korean Buddhism|distinctive Korean forms]]. At that time, the [[Korea]]n peninsula was divided into [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|three kingdoms]]: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, [[Baekje]] in the southwest, and [[Silla]] in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552.&lt;ref name="Korea, 300 to 600 CE"/&gt; In Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant, while Buddhism became more widespread in Silla and Baekje (both areas comprehended in modern South Korea).

In the following unified state of [[Goryeo]] (918–1392), that developed from Goguryeo incorporating the southern kingdoms, Buddhism flourished even becoming a political force.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeersch, Sem. (2008). ''The Power of the Buddhas: the Politics of Buddhism during the Koryŏ Dynasty (918–1392)''. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, the influence of Chinese [[Confucianism]] penetrated the country and led to the formation of [[Korean Confucianism]] that would have become the state ideology and religion of the following [[Joseon]] state.

The Joseon kingdom (1392–1910), strictly [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]], harshly suppressed Korean Buddhism&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 120-138"&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 120–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"&gt;Tudor, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Korean shamanism.&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15"/&gt; Buddhist monasteries were destroyed and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains.&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"/&gt; These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sorae korea church 1895.jpeg|thumb|150px|A Protestant church at Sorae (now [[Ryongyon County]], [[South Hwanghae Province]]) in 1895.]]

In this environment, [[Christianity]] began to rapidly gain foothold since the late 18th century, due to an intense missionary activity that was aided by the endorsement at first by the ''[[Silhak]]'' and ''[[Seohak]]'' intellectual parties, and then at the end of the following century by the [[king of Korea]] himself and the intellectual elite of the crumbling Joseon state, who were looking for a new social factor to invigorate the Korean nation.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 155–161&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The [[intelligentsia]] was looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"/&gt; It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries who offered a solution to the plight of Koreans.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"/&gt; Christian communities already existed in Joseon, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 157-158"&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[king of Korea]] and his family tacitly supported Christianity.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt; From the late nineteenth century, the northwest of Korea, and [[Pyongyang]] in particular, became a stronghold of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Pyongyang was called the "Jerusalem of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GC16Dg03.html|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=North Korea's missionary position|work=Asia Times Online|date=16 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dawn of the 20th century, almost the totality of the population of [[Korea]] believed in the [[Korean shamanism|indigenous shamanic religion]] and practiced [[Confucian]] rites and [[jesa|ancestral worship]].&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"&gt;Pyong Gap Min, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean Buddhism]] was nearly dead, reduced to a tiny and weak minority of monks, despite its long history and cultural influence, because of 500 years of suppression by the ruling Neo-Confucian [[Joseon]] kingdom,&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt; which also disregarded traditional cults.&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15"&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire]] (1910–1945) the already formed link of Christianity with [[Korean nationalism]] was strengthened,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161"/&gt; as the Japanese tried to impose [[State Shinto]] and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161"/&gt; At the same time, numerous [[Korean shamanism#Branching|religious movements]] that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably [[Chondoism]], flourished.&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"/&gt; Christianity became widespread especially in the north of the peninsula,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Chondoism]]&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"&gt;Carl Young. ''Into the Sunset: Ch’ŏndogyo in North Korea, 1945–1950''. On: ''Journal of Korean Religions'', Volume 4, Number 2, October 2013. pp. 51–66 / 10.1353/jkr.2013.0010&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to counter Christian influence.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the division===
[[File:2013 Temple of Modern Buddhism Group in North Korea (10390588824).jpg|thumb|150px|Delegation of the group "Modern American Buddhism", of [[Korean American]]s in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;Uri Tours: [http://uritours.com/blog/entry/buddhist-temple-tour-in-north-korea Exclusive Buddhist Temple Tour of North Korea]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Pohyonsa]] in 2013.]]
The Korean peninsula was [[division of Korea|divided into two states]] in 1945, the [[history of North Korea|communist north]] and the [[history of South Korea|anti-communist south]]. Most of the Korean Christians, that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; fled to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 163"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, most of Korean Chondoists remained in the newly formed North Korea.&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"/&gt; At the time of the partition they were 1.5 million, or 16% of North Korea's population.&lt;ref&gt;Park, 2009. p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; They participate to the [[politics of North Korea]] through the [[Chondoist Chongu Party|Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way]]. In 1994 the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association organised an impressive ceremony at the newly constructed Mausoleum of [[Dangun]] (mythical founder of the Korean nation) near [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;Corfield, 2013. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some estimates&lt;ref name="Religious Intelligence UK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chryssides, Geaves. 2007. p. 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thearda.com"/&gt; in 2005 in North Korea there are 3,846,000 (16% of the total population) believers of [[Korean shamanism]], 3,245,000 (13.5%) [[Cheondoism|Chondoists]], 1,082,000 (4.5%) [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and 406,000 (1.7%) [[Christian]]s.

In 2007 there were approximately 800 Chondoist churches throughout the country and a large central building in Pyongyang, 60 Buddhist temples (maintained more as cultural relics than places of worship), and 5 Christian churches—three Protestant churches, one Catholic church, and one Russian Orthodox church, all of which located in Pyongyang.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. pp. 145-146"&gt;Baker, 2008. pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Korea Conference of Religions for Peace held an inter-Korean meeting at [[Mount Kumgang]], North Korea, and another is planned in 2017 in Pyongyang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/06/june-15-committee-granted-permission-to-contact-north-korea/|title=June 15 Committee granted permission to contact North Korea|author=JH Ahn|website=NK News|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and politics==
{{further|Freedom of religion in North Korea}}

===''Juche'' ideology===
{{main article|Juche#Religious features of Juche}}
Different official attitudes toward organized religion are reflected in various [[constitution]]s. Article 14 of the 1948 constitution noted that "''citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall have the freedom of religious belief and of conducting religious services''". Article 54 of the 1972 constitution stated that "''citizens have religious liberty and the freedom to oppose religion.''" Some observers argued that the change occurred because in 1972 the political authorities no longer needed the support of the much-weakened organized religions. In the 1992 constitution, Article 68 grants freedom of religious belief and guarantees the right to construct buildings for religious use and religious ceremonies. The article also states that "''no one may use religion as a means by which to drag in foreign powers or to destroy the state or social order''". North Korea has been represented at international religious conferences by state-sponsored religious organizations such as the Korean Buddhist Federation, the [[Korean Christian Federation]], and the Chondoist Church and [[Chondoist Chongu Party|Chondoist Party]].

This [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of the Kims]], together with the doctrine of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance) are said by some to have religious overtones.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Juche appeared in the 1960s as an idea of national autonomy but it has developed universal characters.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt; The doctrine proclaims that human beings should break free of any dependency on spiritual ideas and realize that, working together, they can achieve all their goals without supernatural assistance.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt; It promises believers that, through joining the Juche community, they can overcome death and become immortals.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Juche teachings, human beings only exist in social contexts.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt; There is no human that is utterly alone, who has no relationships or interactions with other humans.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt; Human beings will continue to exist even after physical death only if the society that defines them continues to exist.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt;

Some scholars see Juche as having [[Confucianism|Confucian]] features, but without the Confucian ancestral kinship structuration of society.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt; Rather, Juche's aim is a national community.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt; Moreover, Juche has as its spiritual focus the [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|mythified figure]] of [[Kim Il-sung]].&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 147"/&gt; He gained mythical connotations already in the 1930s for his [[hero]]ic actions against the Japanese occupators.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 148"&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In Juche writings, Kim Il-sung and his successors are at times portrayed as divine beings.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 148"/&gt; In addition, the North Korean Juche calendar counts the years starting from the birth of Kim Il-sung in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies see [[Christianity|Christian]] influences in Juche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Mathesius | first = Konrad | title =Peering Behind the Curtain on the Question of Political Religion in the DPRK |year=2008 |url = http://congress.aks.ac.kr/korean/files/2_1358297184.pdf|publisher= AKS | work = Congress | place = KR | accessdate = 2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 1992, discussions about unification and compatibility of Juche and Christianity took place between North Korean, South Korean and Korean American theologians.&lt;ref name="Sebastian C. H 2014"&gt;Sebastian C. H. Kim, Kirsteen Kim. ''A History of Korean Christianity''. Cambridge University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|9780521196383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park Seung-deok, a Juche scholar from Pyongyang, concluded that Juche and Christianity share common goals and values.&lt;ref name="Sebastian C. H 2014"/&gt;

===North Korean anti-religion campaigns===
It is very difficult for outside observers to know what has happened to North Korean religious bodies over the past 60 years due to the extreme isolation of the state. One interpretation has held that all open religious activity in North Korea was persecuted and eradicated after Kim Il-sung took power, only to be revived in the present as part of a political show.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Ryu | first = Dae Young | title = Fresh wineskins for new wine: a new perspective on North Korean Christianity | journal = Journal of Church and State | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation has held that religion survived and has genuinely been revived in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt;

Kim Il-sung criticized religion in his writings, and North Korean propaganda in literature, movies and other media have presented religion in a negative light. Kim Il-sung's attack on religion was strongly based on the idea that religion had been used as a tool for imperialists in the Korean peninsula. He criticized Christians for collaborating with the [[United Nations]]' forces against him during the [[Korean War]], although he praised Christians who supported him.

Accounts from the Korean War speak of harsh persecution of religion by Kim Il-sung in the areas he controlled.&lt;ref name = "Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt; Prior to the war, the Christian population of the Korean peninsula was most heavily concentrated in the north; during the war, many of these Christians fled to the South. Some interpretations have considered that the Christian community was often of a higher socio-economic class than the rest of the population, which may have prompted its departure for fear of persecution.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt; The large-scale destruction caused by the massive air raids and the suffering experienced by North Koreans during the Korean War helped foster hatred of Christianity as being the American religion.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt;

Religion was attacked in the ensuing years as an obstacle to the construction of [[communism]], and many people abandoned their former religions in order to conform to the new reality.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006"/&gt; On the basis of accounts from the Korean War as well as information from defectors, an interpretation has held that the North Korea was the only state in the world to have completely eradicated religion by the 1960s.&lt;ref name= "Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt; Buddhism was thought to have been eradicated, under this interpretation and its reappearance later was thought to be a show. The Federation of Korean Christians in North Korea (created in 1970), under this interpretation, has been considered{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} a fake organization meant to present a favourable image to the outside world.

Other interpretations have thought that they do represent genuine faith communities that survived the persecutions. An interpretation has considered that these religious communities may have been believers who genuinely adhered to Marxism–Leninism and the leadership of Kim Il-sung, thus ensuring their survival.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006"/&gt; This interpretation has been supported by recent evidence gathered that has shown that the North Korean government may have tolerated the existence of up to 200 pro-communist Christian congregations during the 1960s, and by the fact that several high-ranking people in the government were Christians and they were buried with high honours (for instance [[Kang Yang Wook]] was a Presbyterian minister who served as vice president of North Korea from 1972 to 1982, and Kim Chang Jun was a Methodist minister who served as vice chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006"/&gt;).  Differing interpretations often agree on the disappearance of religion under Kim Il-sung in the first few decades of his rule. The government never made an open public policy statement about religion, leading to unresolved speculation among scholars as to what exactly the government's position was at any point in time.&lt;ref name="Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt;

==Main religions==

===Cheondoism===
{{Main article|Cheondoism}}
Chondoism (천도교 ''Ch'ŏndogyo'') or Cheondoism ([[religion in South Korea#Cheondoism|South Korean spelling]]) is a religion with roots in [[Confucianism|Confucianised]] [[Korean shamanism|indigenous shamanism]]. It is the religious dimension of the ''[[Donghak]]'' ("Eastern Learning") movement that was founded by [[Choe Je-u]] (1824–1864), a member of an impoverished [[yangban]] (aristocratic) family,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of "foreign religions",&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"/&gt; which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of ''[[Seohak]]'', the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century).&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"/&gt; Choe Je-u founded Chondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of ''Sangje'' or ''[[Haneullim]]'', the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"/&gt;

The Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"/&gt; The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Chondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled.&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"/&gt;

Chondoism is the sole religion to be favoured by the North Korean government.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt; It has political representation as the [[Chondoist Chongu Party|Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way]],&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt; and is regarded by the government as Korea's "[[ethnic religion|national religion]]"&lt;ref name="Chondoism, National Religion"&gt;KCNA: ''[http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2007/05/23/chondoism-national-religion/ Chondoism, National Religion]''. North Korea Economy Watch 5/23/2007.&lt;/ref&gt; because of its identity as a ''[[minjung]]'' (popular)&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 110"&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and "revolutionary [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]" movement.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. p. 146"/&gt;

===Korean shamanism===
{{Main article|Korean shamanism}}
Korean shamanism, also known as "Muism" (무교 ''Mugyo'', "''mu'' [shaman] religion")&lt;ref&gt;Used in: Chang Soo-kyung, Kim Tae-gon. ''Korean Shamanism – Muism''. Jimoondang, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Sinism" (신교 ''Singyo'', "religion of the ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shin]]'' ({{hanja|神}}) [gods]"),&lt;ref&gt;Used in: Margaret Stutley. ''Shamanism: A Concise Introduction''. Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; is the ethnic religion of Korea and the Koreans.&lt;ref name=JYL4&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although used synonymously, the two terms aren't identical:&lt;ref name=JYL4 /&gt; Jung Young Lee describes Muism as a form of Sinism – the [[shamanism|shamanic]] tradition within the religion.&lt;ref name=JYL5&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for the religion are "Sindo" (신도 "Way of the Gods") or "Sindoism" (신도교 ''Sindogyo'', "religion of the Way of the Gods").&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Cognates of Japanese ''[[Shinto]]'' and Chinese ''[[Shendao]]''.}}

In contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or ''[[mu (shaman)|mu]]'' ({{hanja|巫}}) is known as a ''mudang'' ({{hangul|무당}} {{hanja|巫堂}}) if female or ''baksu'' if male, although other names and locutions are used.&lt;ref name=JYL4 /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Another term is ''dangol'' ({{hangul|당골}}). The word ''mudang'' is mostly associated, though not exclusively, to female shamans due to their prevalence in the Korean tradition in recent centuries. Male shamans are named ''baksu mudang'' ("healer ''mudang''"), shortened ''baksu'', in Pyongyang shamanism. It is reasonable to believe that the word ''baksu'' is an ancient authentic designation for male shamans.&lt;ref name="Lee 3-4"&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;}} Korean ''mu'' "shaman" is synonymous with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'', which defines priests both male and female.&lt;ref name=JYL5 /&gt; The role of the ''mudang'' is to act as intermediary between the [[spirit]]s or [[gods]], and the human plain, through ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'' (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the faith is the belief in ''[[Haneullim]]'' or ''[[Hwanin]]'', meaning "source of all being",&lt;ref name=JYL18&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and of all gods of nature,&lt;ref name=JYL5 /&gt; the [[Absolute (philosophy)|utmost]] [[god]] or the supreme mind.&lt;ref name=JYL17&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mu'' are [[myth]]ically described as descendants of the "Heavenly King", son of the "Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 5–12&lt;/ref&gt; However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to [[Dangun]], male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation.&lt;ref name=JYL13&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean Muism has similarities with Chinese [[Chinese shamanism|Wuism]],&lt;ref name=JYL21&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese [[Shinto]], and with the [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian]], [[Mongolian shamanism|Mongolian]], and [[Manchu shamanism|Manchurian]] religious traditions.&lt;ref name=JYL21 /&gt; As highlighted by anthropological studies, the Korean ancestral god Dangun is related to the [[Ural-Altaic]] [[Tengri]] "Heaven", the shaman and the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JYL 17-18"&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mudang'' is similar to the Japanese ''[[miko]]'' and the Ryukyuan ''[[Ryukyuan religion#Yuta|yuta]]''. Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as Chondoism in North Korea. According to various [[sociology|sociological studies]], many Christian churches in Korea make use of practices rooted in shamanism as the Korean shamanic theology has affinity to that of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Kim. ''[http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/2/117.full.pdf Korean Religious Culture and Its Affinity to Christianity]''. Korea University, Sociology of Religion, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the twilight years of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a [[demonisation]] of the traditional religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults.&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-7"&gt;Kendall, 2010. pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot Muism.&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-7"/&gt;

There is no knowledge about the survival of Korean shamanism in contemporary North Korea.&lt;ref name="Walter, Fridman. 2004. p. 654"&gt;Walter, Fridman. 2004. p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; Many northern shamans, displaced by war and politics, migrated to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Walter, Fridman. 2004. p. 654"/&gt; Shamans in North Korea were (or are) of the same type of those of northern and central areas of South Korea ([[Mu (shaman)#Kangshinmu—initiated or chosen priests|''kangshinmu'']]).&lt;ref name="Walter, Fridman. 2004. p. 654"/&gt;

==Minor religions==

===Buddhism===
[[File:Pohyun Temple Myohyang Mountain - North Korea (10390584455).jpg|thumb|150px|Buddhist service at [[Pohyonsa|Pohyon Temple]], at [[Mount Myohyang]] in [[Hyangsan County]], [[North Pyongan Province]].

{{Main article|Korean Buddhism}}
Buddhism (불교 ''Pulgyo'') entered Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|period of the three kingdoms]] (372, or the 4th century).&lt;ref name="Korea, 300 to 600 CE"/&gt; Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the [[Silla]] (668–935) and subsequent [[Goryeo]] (918–1392) states. [[Confucianism]] was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as [[Korean Confucianism]] in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent [[Joseon]] kingdom (1392–1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 120-138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"/&gt; from which it began to recover only in the 20th century.

Buddhists are a minority in North Korea, and their traditions have developed differently from those of [[religion in South Korea#Buddhism|South Korean Buddhists]] after the division of the country. Buddhism in North Korea is practiced under the auspices of the official [[Korea Buddhist Federation]], an organ of the North Korean state apparatus. North Korean Buddhist monks are entirely dependent on state wages for their livelihood as well as state authorization to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=89,3618,0,0,1,0 |title= Another Korea Buddhism in North Korea | publisher= Buddhist channel TV |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the leader of the Korean Buddhist Federation is Yu Yong-sun.&lt;ref name="Buddhist leader"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2899428 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629142550/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2899428 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 June 2013 | title=Buddhist leader gets North’s South policy spot | publisher=JoongAng Ilbo | date=5 January 2009 | accessdate=2013-05-20 | last=Jeong | first=Yong-soo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only 60 Buddhist temples in the country, and they are viewed as cultural relics from Korea's past rather than places of active worship.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. pp. 145-146"/&gt; Also, there is a three-year college for training Buddhist clergy. A limited revival of Buddhism is apparently taking place. This includes the establishment of an academy for Buddhist studies and the publication of a twenty-five-volume translation of the [[Korean Tripitaka]], or Buddhist scriptures, which had been carved on 80,000 wooden blocks and kept at the temple at [[Myohyangsan]] in central North Korea. Recently, South Korean Buddhist leaders have been allowed to travel to North Korea and participate in religious ceremonies or give aid to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/555811.html |title= Buddhists from both Koreas hold ceremony on Mt.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Christianity in Korea}} {{Further|Roman Catholicism in North Korea}}
[[File:Jangchung Catholic Church (15524500676).jpg|thumb|[[Changchung Cathedral]], seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pyongyang]].]]
[[File:2011 Russian Orthodox Church in Pyongyang.jpg|thumb|[[Church of the Life-Giving Trinity (Pyongyang)|Church of the Life-Giving Trinity]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Pyongyang.]]
[[File:Bongsu Church (15549074452).jpg|thumb|Attendees at the Protestant [[Bongsu Church]] in Pyongyang.]]
[[Christianity]] ({{korean|hangul=그리스도교|mr=Kurisudogyo|context=north}}) became very popular in northern Korea from the late 18th century to the 19th century. The first Catholic missionaries arrived in 1794, a decade after the return of [[Yi Sung-hun]], a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Choi Suk-woo. ''Korean Catholicism Yesterday and Today''. On: ''Korean Journal'' XXIV, 8, August 1984. pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; He established a grassroots lay Catholic movement in the peninsula. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary [[Matteo Ricci]], who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the ''[[Silhak]]'' ("Practical Learning"), were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Han-sik. ''The Influence of Christianity''. On: ''Korean Journal'' XXIII, 12, December 1983. pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as ''[[Seohak]]'' ("Western Learning"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Silhak school.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Ok-hy. ''Women in the History of Catholicism in Korea''. On: ''Korean Journal'' XXIV, 8, August 1984. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited the proselytisation of Christianity. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced.

Protestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans this time with the tacit support of the royal government.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt; [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 157-158"/&gt; During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Catholicism and Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self-government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt;

A large number of Christians lived in the northern half of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called "[[Manchurian revival]]")&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt; where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162"/&gt; Before 1948 [[Pyongyang]] was an important Christian center: The city was known as the "Jerusalem of the East".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea's irreconcilable relationship with Christianity | author = Andrei Lankov | work = NK News – North Korea News | date = 9 September 2013 | accessdate = 2016-02-29 | url = https://www.nknews.org/2013/09/north-koreas-irreconcilable-relationship-with-christianity/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Korean Communists came from a Christian background. [[Kim Il-sung]]'s mother was a Presbyterian deaconess. He attended a mission school and played the organ in church. In his memoir ''With the Century'' he wrote: "I do not think the spirit of Christianity that preaches universal peace and harmony contradicts my idea advocating an independent life for man".&lt;ref name="Revolution and Revival: Ideology and Faith in North Korea | Sino-NK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinonk.com/2017/06/23/revolution-and-revival-ideology-and-faith-in-north-korea/|title=Revolution and Revival: Ideology and Faith in North Korea|first=Christopher|last=Richardson|publisher=SinoNK|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, with the establishment of the communist regime in the north, however, most Christians fled to South Korea to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 163"/&gt; Christianity came to be discouraged by the North Korean government because of its association with America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ryu, Dae Young (2006), "Fresh wineskins for new wine: a new perspective on North Korean Christianity", ''Journal of Church and State'' '''48''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, North Korea produced its own translation of the Bible, which has since been used by Southern missionaries attempting to evangelize the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The good things in North Korea: Taking a moment to recognize good art, good scholarship and good people|url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/06/the-good-things-in-north-korea/|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Did Our North Korean Bible Translation Come From?|url=http://dotheword.org/2014/05/14/where-did-our-north-korean-bible-translations-come-from/|first=Timothy|last=Dillmuth|publisher=Do the Word|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, it became apparent that Christians were active in the governmental elite.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In those years three new churches, two Protestant and one Catholic, were opened in Pyongyang.

Other signs of the regime's changing attitude towards Christianity included holding the "International Seminar of Christians of the North and South for the Peace and Reunification of Korea" in [[Switzerland]] in 1988, allowing papal representatives to attend the opening of the Changchung Cathedral of Pyongyang in that same year, and sending two North Korean novice priests to study in [[Rome]]. A Protestant seminary in Pyongyang taught future leaders of the North Korean government.&lt;ref name = "Ryu, Dae Young 2006" /&gt; A new association of Roman Catholics was established in June 1988. A North Korean Protestant [[pastor]] reported at a 1989 meeting of the [[National Council of Churches]] in Washington that his country has 10,000 Protestants and 1,000 Catholics who worship in 500 home churches. In 1992 and 1994, American evangelist [[Billy Graham]] visited North Korea. He met Kim Il-sung, giving him a Bible, and preached at [[Kim Il-sung University]]. In 2008, his son [[Franklin Graham]] visited the country.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Graham Evangelistic Association: Janet Chismar, ''[http://billygraham.org/story/the-graham-family-legacy-in-north-korea/ The Graham Family Legacy in North Korea]''. July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolution and Revival: Ideology and Faith in North Korea | Sino-NK" /&gt;In 1991, North Korea even tried to invite the pope in an attempt to escape international isolation, but eventually dropped the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prominent Defector on N.Korea's Relationship with Religion|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/05/25/2018052501734.html|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korean Christians are officially represented by the [[Korean Christian Federation]], a state-controlled body responsible for contacts with churches and governments abroad. In Pyongyang there are five church buildings:&lt;ref name="Baker, 2008. pp. 145-146"/&gt; the Catholic [[Changchung Cathedral]], three Protestant churches inaugurated in 1988 in presence of [[South Korea]]n church officials, and a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church consecrated in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.orthodox.cn/news/20060814pyongyangbeijing_en.htm | title = The Church of the Life-Giving Trinity consecrated in Pyongyang. The Russian Orthodox Church delegation on a visit to the KPDR | publisher = Orthodox Church in China | place = [[China]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internationally supported [[Pyongyang University of Science and Technology]], which opened in 2010, operates with a Christian ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyongyang University of Science and Technology: President’s Welcome|url=https://pust.co/index.php/about-pust/presidents-welcome/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804092602/https://pust.co/index.php/about-pust/presidents-welcome/|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian aid groups, including the [[American Friends Service Committee]], the [[Eugene Bell Foundation]], and [[World Vision]], are able to operate in the country, but not allowed to proselytize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/03/true-believers-faith-based-ngos-in-north-korea|title=True believers: Faith-based NGOs in North Korea|first=Nazanin|last=Bagherzadeh|publisher=NK News|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Christmas was celebrated in North Korea, but with the religious overtones downplayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christmas in N.

According to [[Open Doors]], North Korea is the country where Christians are persecuted the most.&lt;ref name="Open Doors Germany"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nordkorea | website=Open Doors Germany | url=https://www.opendoors.de/verfolgung/laenderprofile/nordkorea/ | language=de | accessdate=2017-01-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120101312/https://www.opendoors.de/verfolgung/laenderprofile/nordkorea/ | archivedate=2017-01-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{main article|Islam in Korea}}
There is a [[mosque]] in the Iranian embassy in Pyongyang called Ar-Rahman Mosque, the only mosque in the country. The mosque was likely built for the embassy staff, but visits by other foreigners are deemed possible, too.&lt;ref name="nkne_Iran"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Iran Build's Pyongyang's First Mosque | author = Chad O'Carroll | work = NKNews | date = 22 January 2013 | accessdate = 29 July 2015 | url = http://www.nknews.org/2013/01/iran-buillds-pyongyangs-first-mosque/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Friday prayers, most Muslims would pray at Ar-Rahman Mosque regardless of their differences in sect.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The show premiered on [[BBC Two]] on 28 June 2010 and ended on 28 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a232596/rev-star-dismisses-dibley-comparisons.html |title='Rev.' star dismisses 'Dibley' comparisons |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's working titles were ''The City Vicar'' and ''Handle with Prayer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_city_vicar/details/ |title=The City Vicar - Production Details |publisher=comedy.co.uk |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series revolves around a [[Church of England]] priest, played by [[Tom Hollander]], who becomes the vicar of an inner-city London church after leaving a small rural [[Suffolk]] parish.

Hollander said: "we wanted to define ourselves in opposition to the cliché of a country vicar, partly because we wanted to depict England as it is ''now'', rather than having a sort of bucolic-y, ''over the hills and far away'', bird-tweeting England – we wanted the complications of the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic inner-city, where everything is much harder."&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, speaking on ''South Bank Sky Arts Winners'' interview, 16 February 2011, Sky Arts 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[The Reverend]] Adam Smallbone is an [[Anglican]] priest who has recently moved from a small rural parish to the "socially disunited" St Saviour in the Marshes in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[East End of London|East London]]. Unable to turn anyone away from his pastoral care, Smallbone is faced with a series of moral challenges as he balances the needs of genuine believers, people on the streets, and drug addicts, as well as the demands of social climbers using the church to get their children into the best schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_city_vicar/ |title=The City Vicar |publisher=comedy.co.uk |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam has an impossibly difficult job being a modern city vicar. His wife Alex, who has her own career as a solicitor to worry about, provides fantastic support for him, seeing through his life as a priest, whilst not being involved with his work. He is also supported by [[lay reader]] Nigel, who believes he should be running the church. In supervision is [[Archdeacon]] Robert, who puts pressure on Adam to increase the congregation and church income.

Parishioners include Colin, a heavy drinking, unemployable lost soul who is Adam's most devoted parishioner; Adoha, well known for her romantic intentions towards the clergy; and Mick, who is homeless and appears on Adam's doorstep in different situations asking for money.

==Future==

Interviewed in late April 2014, Tom Hollander has said that he did not know whether there would be a fourth series, and that after the third series "we all want to just pause". He added that "The idea of not doing it any more is sad but also quite attractive, because you wouldn't want for it to ever get worse."&lt;ref&gt;Mirror Online: [https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/rev-series-3-finale-tom-3456580 Rev series 3 finale: Tom Hollander reveals show won't be returning any time soon - Mirror Online], accessdate: 30 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Secular Culture &amp; Ideas'' is supported by the [[Center for Cultural Judaism#Posen Project|Posen Foundation]], a non-profit that works internationally to promote Jewish culture and support Jewish education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''Shepseskaf-ankh''' (''[the king] [[Shepseskaf]] may live'') was ancient Egyptian physician and priest. He was the Head of the Physicians of Upper and Lower Egypt and served the pharaoh household during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|fifth dynasty]].

His tomb was discovered by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] archaeologists in [[Abusir]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131025-tomb-abusir-discovery-physician-ancient-egypt-archaeology-science/ Tomb of Ancient Egyptian Physician Discovered], National Geographic, Oct 25th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepseskaf-ankh held a number of important titles, many of them connected to his position as physician at the royal court, but he also held several important priestly titles. His titles:

*''acquaintance of the king''
*''overseer of the healing substances of the great house'' (this title was so far not yet attested)
*''wab priest of the king''
*''great of the physicians of Upper and Lower Egypt''
*''priest of Re in [[Sun temple of Userkaf|Nekhenre]]'' (Nekhenre is the name of the [[sun temple]] of king [[Userkaf]])
*''priest of Re in Setibre'' (Setibre is the name of the sun temple of king [[Neferirkare]])
*''priest of Re in Sesepibre'' (Sesepibre is the name of the sun temple of king [[Niuserre]])
*''priest of Horus of Shenut''
*''priest of Heka''
*''priest of Hathor in all places''
*''priest of Khnum. who is the first in the house of life and in the house of protection''
*''priest of the Red Crown''
*''keeper of the king's secrets''
*''physician of the great house''&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Bárta: ''Tomb of the chief physician Shepseskafankh'', in: ''Pragues Egyptological Studies'', XV (2015), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial of Shepseskaf-ankh was discovered at Abusir. It is a [[mastaba]] with eight burial shafts. The mastaba measures 21/90 × 11.50 m. It is still to about 1.6 m high. The outer walls were built of stones. At the east side there is a cult chapel. The only decorated part is a [[false door]] inscribed with the titles of Shepseskaf-ankh and showing his person standing.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Bárta: ''Tomb of the chief physician Shepseskafankh'', in: ''Pragues Egyptological Studies'', XV (2015), p. 15-21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Vivekananda'''  ({{IPA-bn|ʃami bibekanɔndo|lang|Swami_Vivekananda.ogg}}; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born '''Narendranath Datta''' ({{IPA-bn|nɔrendronatʰ dɔto|lang}}), was an [[India]]n [[Hindu]] [[monk]], a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic [[Ramakrishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneindia.com/feature/swami-vivekananda-a-short-biography-1980622.html|title=Swami Vivekananda: A short biography|work=www.oneindia.com|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.culturalindia.net/reformers/vivekananda.html|title=Life History &amp; Teachings of Swami Vivekanand|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the Western world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/research/international-yoga-day-2017-how-swami-vivekananda-helped-popularise-the-ancient-indian-regimen-in-the-west-4715411/|title=International Yoga Day: How Swami Vivekananda helped popularise the ancient Indian regimen in the West}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Georg|2002|p=600}} and is credited with raising [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] awareness, bringing [[Hinduism]] to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Clarke|2006|p=209}} He was a major force in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]] in India, and contributed to the concept of [[nationalism]] in [[colonial India]].{{Sfn|Von Dense|1999|p=191}} Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{Sfn|Georg|2002|p=600}} He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, "Sisters and brothers of America&amp;nbsp;...,"{{Sfn|Dutt|2005|p=121}} in which he introduced Hinduism at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893.

Born into an aristocratic [[Bengali Kayastha]] family of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his [[guru]], Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in [[British India]]. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of [[Hindu philosophy]] in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|patriotic saint]] and his birthday is celebrated there as [[National Youth Day (India)|National Youth Day]].

Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as [[Shiva]], [[Rama]], [[Sita]], and [[Hanuman|Mahavir Hanuman]].{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}} He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.{{Sfn|Sen|2003|p=20}} Naren was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his ghosts".{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=2}}

==Education {{anchor|Early and college education}}==
In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]'s [[Vidyasagar College|Metropolitan Institution]], where he went to school until his family moved to [[Raipur]] in 1877.{{sfn|Banhatti|1995}} In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]] entrance examination. {{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=4}} He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature.{{Sfn|Arrington|Chakrabarti|2001|pp=628–631}} He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the [[Puranas]]. Narendra was trained in [[Indian classical music]],{{Sfn|Sen|2003|p=21}} and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta|General Assembly's Institution]] (now known as the Scottish Church College).{{Sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}} In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.{{Sfn|Sen|2003|pp=104–105}}{{Sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p=106}} Narendra studied the works of [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Georg W. F.

[[William Hastie]] (principal of Christian College, Calcutta, from where Narendra graduated) wrote, "Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He is bound to make his mark in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopaedia of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dNOT9iYxcMC&amp;pg=PA1066|page=1066|editor1=K.R.Gupta|editor2=Amita Gupta|publisher=Atlantic|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Several incidents have been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from [[Pickwick Papers]]. Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In another incident with Dr.[[Paul Deussen]]'s at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologized to Dr.Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day claiming that he had read them. The librarian refused to believe him until cross examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was being truthful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life And Philosophy Of Swami Vivekananda|author=G. S Banhatti|publisher=Atlantic |year=2015|pages=156,157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK5862eV7_EC&amp;pg=PA156|quote=(7) (156)Haripada Mitra related, "One day, in the course of a talk, Swamiji quoted verbatim some two or three pages from Pickwick papers.I wondered at this, not understanding how a sannyasin could get by heart so much from a secular book.....Vivekanada was a champion of good memory...Once in America, his reference to a point in Swedish history was challenged by a Swede , but Vivekananda calmly insisted that his reference was correct. The next day, the Swede, having conceded the point and apologized....Yet another similar occasion took place at Dr.Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany."Some time during the day, the professor found the Swami turning over the pages of a poetical work. He spoke to him but got no response. When Swami came to know of it afterwards, he apologized, saying that he was so absorbed in reading that he had not heard him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation until in the course of the conversation the swami quoted and interpreted verses from the book. Dr.Deussen was dumbfounded, and asked the Swami how he could accomplish such a feat of memory....(157) With Vivekananda's remarkable memory goes hand in hard his power of fast reading already referred to. Early in life he developed this faculty. During his convalescence at Meerut in 1891, he called for some books by Sir John Lubbock from a local library and returned them the next day saying he had read them. The librarian did not believe this, but on cross examining  the Swami regarding the contents of the books, he was convinced that his assertion was true. Later similar instances occurred and this power came to be established as his  normal practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts have called Narendra a ''shrutidhara'' (a person with a prodigious memory).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/swami-vivekanandas-114th-death-anniversary-lesser-known-facts-about-this-monk-327208-2016-07-04&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual apprenticeship - influence of Brahmo Samaj===
{{See also|Swami Vivekananda and meditation}}

In 1880 Narendra joined [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]'s ''[[Nava Vidhan]]'', which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Narendra became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}}{{sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=20}} From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's [[Band of Hope]], which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}}

It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the ''Upanisads'' and of the Vedanta."{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} [[Rammohan Roy]], the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by [[unitarianism]], strived toward an [[Universalism|universalistic]] interpretation of Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} His ideas were "altered [...] considerably" by [[Debendranath Tagore]], who had a [[romanticism|romantic]] approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the ''Vedas''.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46-47}} Tagore also brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} Sen was influenced by [[transcendentalism]], an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with unitarianism, which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen strived to "an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality", introducing "lay systems of spiritual practice" which can be regarded as prototypes of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda popularised in the west.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=49}}

The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God."{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}} He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him.{{sfn|Sen|2006|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p=106}} At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said "My boy, you have the ''[[Yogi]]''{{'}}s eyes."{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=31}} According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying "Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense."{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}} Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=49}} It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=50}}

===With Ramakrishna===

{{Main|Relationship between Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda}}
{{See also|Swami Vivekananda's prayer to Kali at Dakshineswar}}
In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=101}}

Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem, ''[[The Excursion]]''.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of [[Dakshineswar]] to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=43}}{{Sfn|Ghosh|2003|p=31}}{{Sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=18}}

They probably first met personally in November 1881,{{refn|group=note|The exact date of the meeting is unknown. Vivekananda researcher Shailendra Nath Dhar studied the ''Calcutta University Calendar of 1881—1882'' and found in that year, examination started on 28 November and ended on 2 December{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=30}}}} though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=43}} At this time Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when [[Ram Chandra Datta]] accompanied him to [[Surendra Nath Mitra]]'s, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture.{{Sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=21}} According to Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.{{Sfn|Paranjape|2012|p=132}}

In late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=43}} This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=232}} Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}} He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as "mere figments of imagination"{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}} and "hallucinations".{{Sfn|Rolland|1929a| pp = 169–193}} As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of [[Kali]].{{Sfn|Arora|1968|p=4}} He even rejected the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of "identity with the absolute" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea.{{Sfn|Rolland|1929a| pp = 169–193}} Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: "Try to see the truth from all angles", he replied.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}}

Narendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college.&lt;!--Ref verification needed--&gt;{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=8}} He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence,{{Sfn|Sil|1997|p=38}} but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.{{Sfn|Sil|1997|pp=39–40}}

One day Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess.{{Sfn|Kishore|2001|pp=23–25}}{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|pp=25–26}}{{Sfn|Sil|1997|p=27}} Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his [[Guru]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}}

In 1885, Ramakrishna developed [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]], and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in [[Cossipore]]. Narendra and Ramakrishna's [[Disciples of Ramakrishna|other disciples]] took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced ''[[Nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]]''.{{Sfn|Isherwood|1976|p=20}} Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order.{{Sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p= 98}} He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}}{{Sfn|Isherwood|1976|p=20}} Ramakrishna asked him to care for the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader.{{Sfn|Rolland| 1929b| pp= 201–214}} Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.{{Sfn|Rolland| 1929b| pp= 201–214}}{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=17}}

===Finding of first Ramakrishna Math at Baranagar===

After Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live.{{Sfn|Sil|1997|pp=46–47}} Many returned home, adopting a ''[[Grihastha]]'' (family-oriented) way of life.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=18}} Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at [[Baranagar]] into a new ''math'' (monastery) for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by "holy begging" (''mādhukarī''). The math became the first building of the [[Ramakrishna Math]]: the monastery of the [[Monasticism|monastic order]] of Ramakrishna.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=232}} Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|p=40}} Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery:{{Sfn|Chetananda|1997|p=38}}
{{quote|We underwent a lot of religious practice at the Baranagar Math. We used to get up at 3:00&amp;nbsp;am and become absorbed in ''[[japa]]'' and meditation. What a strong spirit of detachment we had in those days! We had no thought even as to whether the world existed or not.}}

In 1887, Narendra compiled a Bengali song anthology named ''[[Sangeet Kalpataru]]'' with Vaishnav Charan Basak. Narendra collected and arranged most of the songs of this compilation, but could not finish the work of the book for unfavourable circumstances.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=33}}

===Monastic vows===
In December 1886, the mother of Baburam{{refn|group=note|A brother monk of Narendranath}} invited Narendra and his other brother monks to [[Antpur]] village. Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend few days. In Antpur, in the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|p=40}} They decided to live their lives as their master lived.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|p=40}} Narendranath took the name "Swami Vivekananda".{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=10}}

{{Main|Swami Vivekananda's travels in India (1888–1893)}}
In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a ''Parivrâjaka''— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go".{{Sfn|Rolland|2008|p=7}} His sole possessions were a [[kamandalu]] (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the ''[[Bhagavad Geeta]]'' and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''.{{Sfn|Dhar|1976|p=243}} Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns.{{Sfn|Richards|1996|pp=77–78}}{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p= 12}} He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation.{{Sfn|Richards|1996|pp=77–78}}{{Sfn|Rolland|2008|pp=16–25}} Living primarily on [[bhiksha]] (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, ''[[dewans]]'', [[raja]]s, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, ''[[paraiyar]]s'' (low-caste workers) and government officials.{{Sfn|Rolland|2008|pp=16–25}} Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name "Vivekananda", as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri,{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=24}} which means "the bliss of discerning wisdom," from Sanskrit ''[[viveka]]'' and ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ānanda]]''.{{Sfn|Gosling|2007|p=18}}

==First visit to the West (1893–1897)==
Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=15}} and visited several cities in Japan (including [[Nagasaki]], [[Kobe]], [[Yokohama]], [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]] and [[Tokyo]]),{{Sfn|Paranjape | 2005 | pp = 246–248}} [[China]] and [[Canada]] en route to the [[United States]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=15}} reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893,{{Sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=158}}{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=15}} where the "[[Parliament of Religions]]" took place in September 1893.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=110}} The Congress was an initiative of the [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian]] layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, [[Charles C.

[[File:Statue of Swami Vivekananda (near Gateway of India).jpg|thumb|Statue of Swami Vivekananda near [[Gateway of India]], [[Mumbai]].]]
Vivekananda wanted to join, but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a ''[[bona fide]]'' organisation would be accepted as a delegate.{{Sfn|Minor|1986|p=133}} Vivekananda contacted Professor [[John Henry Wright]] of [[Harvard University]], who invited him to speak at Harvard.{{Sfn|Minor|1986|p=133}} Vivekananda wrote of the professor, "He urged upon me the necessity of going to the [[Parliament of Religions]], which he thought would give an introduction to the nation".{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|On learning that Vivekananda lacked credentials to speak at the Chicago Parliament, Wright said "To ask for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens".{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=16}}}} Vivekananda submitted an application, "introducing himself as a monk 'of the oldest order of ''sannyāsis'' ... founded by Sankara,'"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=112}} supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was also a member of the Parliament's selection committee, "classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order."{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=112}}

The Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] as part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].{{Sfn|Houghton|1893|p=22}}{{Sfn|Bhide|2008||p=9}}{{Sfn|Paul|2003|p=33}} On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=27}} He was initially nervous, bowed to [[Saraswati]] (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his [[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Addresses at The Parliament of Religions/Response to Welcome|speech]] with "Sisters and brothers of America!".{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=17}}{{Sfn|Paul|2003|p=33}} At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand.{{Sfn|Paul|2003|p=34}} According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of "the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance, of and universal acceptance".{{sfn|McRae|1991|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|McRae quotes "[a] sectarian biography of Vivekananda,"{{sfn|McRae|1991|p=16}} namely Sailendra Nath Dhar ''A Comprehensive Biography of Swami Vivekananda, Part One'', (Madras, India: Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, 1975), p. 461, which "describes his speech on the opening day".{{sfn|McRae|1991|p=34, note 20}}}} Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the "[[Shiva mahimna stotram]]": "As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!" and "Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me."{{sfn|McRae|1991|pp=18}} According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, "it was only a short
speech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament."{{Sfn|McRae|1991|pp=18}}{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=234}}

Parliament President   [[John Henry Barrows]] said, "India, the Mother of religions was represented by Swami Vivekananda, the Orange-monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors".{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=17}} Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the "cyclonic monk from India". The ''New York Critique'' wrote, "He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them". The ''[[New York Herald]]'' noted, "Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send [[Christian missionary|missionaries]] to this learned nation".{{Sfn|Farquhar|1915|p = 202}} American newspapers reported Vivekananda as "the greatest figure in the parliament of religions" and "the most popular and influential man in the parliament".{{Sfn|Sharma|1988|p=87}}
The ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'' reported that Vivekananda was "a great favourite at the parliament... if he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded".{{Sfn|Adiswarananda|2006|pp=177–179}} He spoke [[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Addresses at The Parliament of Religions|several more times]] "at receptions, the scientific section, and private homes"{{sfn|McRae|1991|p=17}} on topics related to Hinduism, [[Buddhism]] and harmony among religions until the parliament ended on 27 September 1893. Vivekananda's speeches at the Parliament had the common theme of universality, emphasising religious tolerance.{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=18}} He soon became known as a "handsome oriental" and made a huge impression as an orator.{{Sfn|Thomas|2003|pp=74–77}}

He founded the [[Vedanta Society]] of New York in 1894.{{Sfn|Gupta|1986|p=118}} By spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health.{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}} He ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and [[yoga]]. Beginning in June 1895, Vivekananda gave [[Inspired Talks|private lectures]] to a dozen of his disciples at [[Wellesley Island|Thousand Island Park]] in New York for two months.{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}}

During his first visit to the West he travelled to the UK twice, in 1895 and 1896, lecturing successfully there.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=30}} In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become [[Sister Nivedita]].{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}} During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met [[Max Müller]], a noted [[Indologist]] from [[Oxford University]] who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=234}} From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met [[Paul Deussen]], another Indologist.{{Sfn|Chetananda|1997|pp=49–50}} Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in [[Eastern Philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and a similar position at [[Columbia University]]); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}}

His success led to a change in mission, namely the establishment of Vedanta centres in the West.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=120}} Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=119-123}} An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his "four yogas" model, which includes [[Raja yoga]], his interpretation of Patanjali's [[Yoga sutras]],{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=123-126}} which offered a practical means to realise the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=119-123}} In 1896 his book ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=125-126}}{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=149-180}}

Vivekananda attracted followers and admirers in the US and Europe, including [[Josephine MacLeod]], [[William James]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Lord Kelvin]], [[Harriet Monroe]], [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Emma Calvé]] and [[Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz]].{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}}{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}}{{Sfn|Chetananda|1997|pp=49–50}}{{Sfn|Chetananda|1997|p=47}} He initiated several followers : Marie Louise (a French woman) became [[Swami Abhayananda]], and Leon Landsberg became Swami [[Kripananda]],{{Sfn|Burke|1958|p=618}} so that they could continue the work of the mission of the [[Vedanta Society]]. This society still is filled with foreign nationals and is also located in [[Los Angeles]].{{Sfn|Thomas|2003|pp=78–81}} During his stay in America, Vivekananda was given land in the mountains to the southeast of [[San Jose, California]] to establish a retreat for Vedanta students. He called it "Peace retreat", or, ''Shanti Asrama''.{{Sfn|Wuthnow|2011|pp=85–86}} The largest American centre is the Vedanta Society of Southern [[California]] in [[Hollywood]], one of the twelve main centres. There is also a Vedanta Press in Hollywood which publishes books about Vedanta and English translations of Hindu scriptures and texts. {{Sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=392}} Christina Greenstidel of [[Detroit]] was also initiated by Vivekananda with a [[mantra]] and she became [[Sister Christine]],{{sfn|Vrajaprana|1996|p=7}} and they established a close father–daughter relationship.&lt;ref name="Sarada society"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |title=A Monumental Meeting | periodical= Sri Sarada Society Notes |last=Shack | first=Joan |url=http://www.srisarada.org/notes/512.pdf |location=Albany, New York |year= 2012 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the West, Vivekananda revived his work in India. He regularly corresponded with his followers and brother monks,{{refn|group=note|Brother monks or brother disciples means other disciples of Ramakrishna who lived monastic lives.}} offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service,{{Sfn|Kattackal|1982|p=219}} and were strongly worded.{{Sfn|Majumdar|1963|p=577}} He wrote to [[Akhandananda]], "Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes of the town of Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying "Ramakrishna, O Lord!"—unless you can do some good to the poor".{{Sfn|Burke|1985|p=417}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1963|p=227}} In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical ''[[Vedanta Kesari|Brahmavadin]]'' to teach the Vedanta.{{Sfn|Sheean|2005|p=345}} Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' was published in ''Brahmavadin'' in 1889.{{Sfn|Sharma|1988|p=83}}&lt;!--But 1889 is ''before'' 1895.--&gt; Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from [[England]] with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from [[Naples]] on 30 December 1896.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=33–34}} He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted the rest of her life to the education of Indian women and India's independence.{{Sfn|Isherwood|Adjemian|1987|pp=121–122}}{{Sfn|Dhar|1976|p=852}}

==Back in India (1897–1899)==
The ship from Europe arrived in [[Colombo]], [[British Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) on 15 January 1897,{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=33–34}} and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo he gave his [[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Lectures from Colombo to Almora/First Public Lecture in the East (Colombo)|first public speech in the East]]. From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from [[Colombo]] to [[Pamban]], [[Rameswaram]], [[Ramnad]], [[Madurai]], [[Kumbakonam]] and [[Madras]], delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop so they could hear him.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=33–34}} From [[Madras]] (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and [[Almora]]. While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule. These lectures, published as ''[[Lectures from Colombo to Almora]]'', demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology.{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=20}}

On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for social service. Its ideals are based on ''[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Karma-Yoga|Karma Yoga]]'',{{Sfn|Thomas|1974|p=44}}{{Sfn|Miller|1995 |p=181}} and its governing body consists of the trustees of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] (which conducts religious work).{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=34–35}} Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at [[Belur Math]].{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=234}}{{Sfn|Ganguly|2001|p=27}} Vivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the [[Himalayas]] (near Almora), the ''[[Advaita Ashrama]]'' and another in Madras. Two journals were founded: ''[[Prabuddha Bharata]]'' in English and ''Udbhodan'' in Bengali.{{Sfn|Kraemer|1960|p=151}} That year, [[famine]]-relief work was begun by [[Swami Akhandananda]] in the [[Murshidabad]] district.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=234}}{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=34–35}}

Vivekananda earlier inspired [[Jamshedji Tata]] to set up a research and educational institution when they travelled together from [[Yokohama]] to Chicago on Vivekananda's first visit to the West in 1893. Tata now asked him to head his [[IISc|Research Institute of Science]]; Vivekananda declined the offer, citing a conflict with his "spiritual interests".{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IISc looks to Belur for seeds of birth|last=Lulla|first=Anil Buddy |date=3 September 2007|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=6 May 2009|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070903/asp/nation/story_8268384.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Kapur|2010|p=142}} He visited Punjab, attempting to mediate an ideological conflict between [[Arya Samaj]] (a reformist Hindu movement) and ''sanatan'' (orthodox Hindus).{{Sfn|Virajananda |2006|p=291}} After brief visits to Lahore,{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=34–35}} Delhi and Khetri, Vivekananda returned to Calcutta in January 1898. He consolidated the work of the math and trained disciples for several months. Vivekananda composed "[[Khandana Bhava–Bandhana]]", a prayer song dedicated to Ramakrishna, in 1898.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=35–36}}

Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899{{Sfn|Virajananda |2006|p=450}} accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established [[Vedanta Society|Vedanta Societies]] in San Francisco and New York and founded a ''shanti ashrama'' (peace retreat) in California.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=41–42}} He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=xv}} His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the ''[[lingam]]'' and the authenticity of the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=41–42}} Vivekananda then visited [[Brittany]], Vienna, [[Istanbul]], Athens and [[Egypt]]. The French philosopher [[Jules Bois]] was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=41–42}}

After a brief visit to the [[Advaita Ashrama]] in Mayavati Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Varanasi]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=43–44}} Declining health (including [[asthma]], [[diabetes]] and chronic [[insomnia]]) restricted his activity.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=45–46}}

==Death==
On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death){{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|pp=218, 274, 299}} Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught ''Shukla-Yajur-Veda'', Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils,{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=283}}{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=46}} later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed;{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=283}} he died at 9:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. while [[meditation|meditating]].{{Sfn|Bharathi|1998b|p=25}} According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained [[mahasamādhi]];{{Sfn|Sen|2006|p= 27}} the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death.{{Sfn|Virajananda |1918|p=81}} His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his ''[[brahmarandhra]]'' (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained ''mahasamādhi''. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years.{{Sfn|Virajananda|2006|pp=645–662}} He was cremated on a [[sandalwood]] [[funeral pyre]] on the bank of the [[Ganga]] in Belur, opposite where [[Ramakrishna]] was cremated sixteen years earlier.&lt;ref name="Towards the end"&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards the end|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda_biography/13_towards_the_end.htm|publisher=www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and philosophy==
{{Main|Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
{{Advaita}}

Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy.{{Sfn|Jackson|1994|pp=33–34}} Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent.{{refn|group=note|According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of form and formless,{{sfn|Taft|2014}} regarding the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive.&lt;ref group=web name="GM" /&gt; Ramakrishna: "When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying - I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active - creating, preserving and destroying - I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one."&lt;ref group=web name="GM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Ramakrisha The Great Master, by Swami Saradananda, (tr.) Swami Jagadananda, 5th ed., v.1,  pp.558-561, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras.|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/sri-ramakrishna-the-great-master/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita "reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism".{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}{{refn|group=note|Sooklalmquoytes Chatterjee: "Sankara's Vedanta is known as Advaita or [[non-dualism]], pure and simple. Hence it is sometimes referred to as Kevala-Advaita or unqualified monism. It may also be called abstract monism in so far as Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is, according to it, devoid of all qualities and distinctions, nirguna and nirvisesa [...] The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna (Chatterjee, 1963 : 260)."{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}} Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:{{Sfn|Jackson|1994|pp=33–34}}
{{quote|Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy—by one, or more, or all of these—and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.}}

Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|1996|pp=1–2}} He wanted "to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest".&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda life and teaching"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda life and teaching|url=http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|publisher=Belur Math|accessdate=23 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330175816/http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|archivedate=30 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it.{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=93}} He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have ''[[shraddhā]]'' (faith). Vivekananda supported ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (celibacy),{{Sfn|Seifer |2001|p=164}} believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|2001|loc=Conversations and Dialogues, Chapter "VI – X Shri Priya Nath Sinha", Vol '''5'''}} He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life&amp;nbsp;– think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced".{{Sfn|Kashyap|2012|p=12}}

==Influence and legacy==
{{Main|Influence and legacy of Swami Vivekananda}}
Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}} [[Agehananda Bharati]] explained, "...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly".{{Sfn|Rambachan|1994|pp=6–8}} Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal.{{Sfn|Shattuck|1999|pp=93–94}} However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism.{{Sfn|Shattuck|1999|pp=93–94}}

In the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal. In the words of social reformer [[Charles Freer Andrews]], "The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India".{{Sfn|Bharathi|1998b|p=37}} Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening.{{Sfn|Bharathi|1998b|pp=37–38}} His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. [[Sri Aurobindo]] regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually.{{Sfn|Bhide|2008||p=69}} [[Mahatma Gandhi]] counted him among the few Hindu reformers "who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition".{{Sfn|Parel|2000|p=77}}
[[File:Vivekananda Circle Mysore.jpg|thumbnail|Vivekananda Circle, Mysore]]
The first governor-general of independent India, [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]], said "Vivekananda saved Hinduism, saved India".{{Sfn|Shetty|2009|p=517}} According to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], a proponent of armed struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], Vivekananda was "the maker of modern India";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article on Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.ramakrishna.eu/EnglishVivekananda.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's "love for his country a thousandfold".

In him everything is positive and nothing negative". Rolland wrote, "His words are great music, phrases in the style of Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses. I cannot touch these sayings of his, scattered as they are through the pages of books, at thirty years' distance, without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock. And what shocks, what transports, must have been produced when in burning words they issued from the lips of the hero!"{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|p=2}}

[[Jamshedji Tata]] was inspired by Vivekananda to establish the [[Indian Institute of Science]], one of India's best-known research universities.{{Sfn|Kapur|2010|p=142}} Abroad, Vivekananda communicated with orientalist [[Max Müller]], and scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] was one of those influenced by his Vedic teachings.

===Lectures===
Although Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali,{{Sfn|Das|1991|p=530}} he was not a thorough scholar,{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=150}} and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were "mainly delivered [...] impromptu and with little preparation".{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=150}} His main work, ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'', consists of talks he delivered in New York.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=149-150}}

===Literary works===
According to Banhatti, "[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist",{{Sfn|Banhatti|1963|p=273}} composing many songs and poems, including his favourite,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} "[[Kali the Mother (poem)|Kali the Mother]]". Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

''[[Bartaman Bharat]]'' meaning "Present Day India"{{sfn|Mittra|2001||p=88}} is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him, which was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=118}} In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every [[India]]n as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=465}}

[[File:Dopvagga - Livrustkammaren - 6381.tif|thumb|Charles XI's cradle, [[Livrustkammaren]]]]
Swedish royal [[baptism]]s are, and have long been, a great event that has been surrounded by attention and ceremonies. According to the 1668 canon law a child was to be baptized within eight days after the birth. [[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark|Ulrika Eleonora]] and [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] had their children baptized in different rounds, first straight after the birth, and then a bit later at the formal ceremony.

== History ==
In 1864 it was determined that all baptisms should take place within six weeks from the birth, a tradition that was maintained by the Royal family until the baptism of [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]] in 1946. He was baptized first eleven weeks after his birth. The royal children, [[Victoria of Sweden|crown princess Victoria]], [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|prince Carl Philip]] and [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland|princess Madeleine]] were also baptized between eleven and fifteen weeks after they were born. The baptism of royal children is about more than tradition. The order of succession states that all members of the royal family must "confess to the true evangelic faith", or the right to the throne is lost. Many royal baptisms have taken place in the [[Royal Chapel (Sweden)|Royal Chapel]], with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangström|first1=Lena|title=Kanonsalut och vaggor: kungliga födslar och dop|date=2012|publisher=Livrustkammaren/Atlantis|isbn=9789173535588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Silver was long to equate with the colour white in royal ceremonies. White long had a deep symbolic meaning in Christian contexts, the colour stood for light, virginity and purity. Silver cloths were therefor often used for [[swaddling]] infants and to carry as a canopy over parts of the baptism party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangström|first1=Lena|title=Kanonsalut och vaggor: kungliga födslar och dop|date=2012|publisher=Livrustkammaren/Atlantis|isbn=9789173535588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charles XI's cradle ==
In 1655 the future Charles XI received a cradle as a christening gift from his mothers parents. It is exhibited at the [[Livrustkammaren|Royal Armoury]] in Stockholm, and it is the only item that still is in use. The cradle is made out of sculptured, gold plated and painted wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangström|first1=Lena|title=Kanonsalut och vaggor: kungliga födslar och dop|date=2012|publisher=Livrustkammaren/Atlantis|isbn=9789173535588}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last time it was used was at [[Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland|Princess Estelle's]] baptism on May 22, 2012. A special parade cradle for princesses had been used since 1830, but when Estelle was born it was as an heir to the throne, so for her baptism Charles XI's cradle was taken out of the Royal Armoury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSH|url=http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultDetailView/result.tab.link&amp;sp=10&amp;sp=Scollection&amp;sp=SfieldValue&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=1&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=SdetailView&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=F&amp;sp=SdetailBlockKey&amp;sp=1|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The [[Chandabhoy Galla Case]]==
[[File:Mausoleum 51st and 52nd Dai.jpg|left|thumb|Mausoleum 51st and 52nd Dai]]
{{main article|Chandabhoy Galla Case}}
The [[Chandabhoy Galla Case]] is celebrated case in the history of religion where a human being is challenged for the representative of God on earth who is infallible and immaculate. The case was filed by the Advocate General of Mumbai at the behest of Adamjee Pirbhai family members against Syedna Taher Saifuddin. The case was filed in 1917 and decided in 1921. The claim was based on the belief of  Imam as representative of the Prophet, and through him the representative of God, having withdrawn from the world, someone must represent him, and so ultimately the Deity on earth.  The Dai, according to community religious belief, is that representative. The ownership of the Chandabhoy ‘Galla’( box kept for  religious offerings) was denied on the plea of improper succession.  &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0226056767]; Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras; By Jonah Blank;  p-236,2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0857735268]; History   A Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community; edited by Farhad Daftary  2010 - Social Science; egal battle with dissidents:-'chandbhai case, 
internal dissent: legitimacy of nass on abdul qadi nazmuddin –nazim dai 50 yearts'. &lt;/ref&gt;

Concluding this extraordinary case then Advocate general Strangman remark about Syedna Taher saifuddin recorded is as follows &lt;ref&gt; [http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/MULLAJI_CASE.html]; MULLAJI CASE (CHANDABHOY GULLA CASE)-19l8-19l9&lt;/ref&gt; :

"Looking back on the proceedings, I think what impressed me the most, even more than the extravagance of the claims, was the personality of the Mullaji, a frail looking figure possessed nevertheless of an iron will, great determination, and organising capacity.  At the time he assumed office the administration must have been extremely slack.  Yet he managed in a very few years not only to pull the administration together but to obtain a hold upon his followers greater perhaps than that of any of his predecessors."

During testimony of 51st Dai Syedna Taher Saifuddin, he clarified about knowledge classes of 'Zahir', 'Tavil' and, 'Hakikat' present in community. First two are known to many but third one namely 'Hakikat' content some religious truths known to very few. Some of which are known to only 2 or 3 persons in community, and there is also knowledge which is available with Dai only, and he gets it from his predecessor Dai.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fatemidawat.com/assets/images/Published%20Works/Dawat%20History%20and%20Biography/Excerpt%20of%20STS%20testimony%20in%20Gulla%20case.pdf];Record

==Death==
Saifuddin died on 12 November 1965 in [[Matheran]], [[Maharashtra]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matheranmemorialhall.com/importance.php (Webzone, H. H. Dr Syedna Taher Saifuddin Memorial Foundation, www.matheranmemorialhall.com, 22 February reverted)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227113233/http://matheranmemorialhall.com/importance.php |date=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mausoleum is known as [[Raudat Tahera]] located in Mumbai, and was constructed by his successor, Mohammed Burhanuddin.

'''Temnin el-Foka'''  ({{lang-ar|تمنين الفوقا}}) is a village in [[Baalbek District]] in [[Lebanon]].

==History==
Temnin el-Foka has a  [[nymphaeum]].&lt;ref name="Longfellow2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brenda Longfellow|title=Roman Imperialism and Civic Patronage: Form, Meaning and Ideology in Monumental Fountain Complexes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRNfu372CyQC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-19493-8|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is close to the [[spring (hydrology)|spring]] of [[Ain el-Jobb]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXchNqgyNdkC|accessdate=1 November 2012|year=1967|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nymphaeum is an arched watercourse built of large stones that has been constructed {{convert|4|m|ft}} deep into a [[hill]]. It leads to a [[cistern]] underground. A [[gulley]] has formed at the outflow, where a boundary pillar is carved with the image of a [[goddess]]. It resembles a similar [[cippus]] at [[Kafr Zabad]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"/&gt;

The '''Temple of the Five Immortals''' or '''Five Immortals Temple''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|五|仙|庙}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Wuxianmiao'')&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lindsey Wei(2009), "The Valley Spirit", Singing Dragon Publications {{ISBN|978-1-84819-131-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Daoist]] temple located in [[Shiyan]]'s [[Zhangwan District]] in [[China]]'s [[Hubei]] [[provinces of China|Province]]. The temple is situated on the Heavenly Horse ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|天|马}}}}, ''Tianma'') peak of White Horse Mountain ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|白|马|山}}}}, ''Báimǎ shān'') in the [[Wudang Mountain]]s. The Wudang Mountains are home to a famous complex of Taoist temples and the monasteries and associated with the god Xuan Wu. The Temple of the Five Immortals is one of the very few temples in the Wudang mountain range which is still maintained by real Daoist monks who dedicate their life to explore the great Dao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Ancient%20Building%20Complex%20in%20the%20Wudang%20Mountains Building Complex in the Wudang Mountains]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wudang was named a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/705|title=Ancient Building Complex in the Wudang Mountains|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and Overview ==
Inside the Hubei Province, looming above the Yellow Dragon River,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hubei/|title=Hubei Travel Guide: Map, Location, Climate, Natural Scenery|work=travelchinaguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 1048 meters elevation, sits the Temple of the Five Immortals. The grounds are located approximately one hour hiking distance from the nearest village, at the base of the mountain. The nearest city is located about a one-hour bus journey from the village. Locals have been using this temple for generations as a place of worship and prayer and many believe the Five Immortals to be their heavenly protectors. On special days of celebration, many hike to the temple to pay homage there, or to carry daily necessities to the residing Taoists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== The Temple ==
The temple was erected approximately 1000 years ago during a time of great conflict. It was known then as ‘The Sanctuary’. People who were seeking refuge from the war fled to this fortress and were protected by five Daoists who later became known as ‘The Five Immortals’. The Temple has been maintained throughout the many centuries that have passed between then and now. An Abbot remains still and continues to impart the knowledge passed on by the five immortals to the students that are now arriving from all parts of the globe.

== The Restoration Project ==
Although the temple has been maintained throughout the ages, much of it suffered great damage and has been in a state of disrepair for much time. In 1995, Master Li Shifu came to practice as an Abbot here and to train disciples in the arts of Daoism. Since he has arrived, the restoration project has begun. It has been a slow and challenging process due to the state of dilapidation but improvement and development has been consistent over the last two decades and the temple is gradually increasing its capacity to host more students.

== A Brief History of Recent Times ==
The current structure is approximately 100 years old. It is a small and relatively unknown and humble estate. Knowledge of the Temple has not yet reached much of the wider world community. It is known mostly by the local mountain people. There are usually fewer than three practicing Daoists residing there. It is a simple, peaceful place to practice and potentially cultivate immortality.

== Five Immortals ==
According to the ancient legends, the Five Immortals were endowed with great wisdom. 
# The Great Master of this lineage or The First Immortal, was deeply engaged in his studies of the Book of Changes (known in China as ‘Yi Jing’). He was also adept in Confucian Analects and the practices of virtue, compassion and forbearance in times of great conflict. He pursued the heavens, nurturing and protecting humanity and the constants. 
# The Second Immortal was the most advanced in Gong-Fu and the Martial Arts practices which he preserved in the interest of protecting the people by martial virtue and physical strength.  
# The third immortal was the master of coursing qi, meditating on stillness and cultivating internal alchemy, with an emphasis on the grasp of life and the reversal of yin and yang. 
# The Fourth of the Immortals was the master of herbal medicine and healing. He rescued humans from their sufferings and healed the heart. He was proficient in distinguishing between cause and effect. 
# The Fifth Immortal was a musical expert who was devoted to preserving the rhapsodies, songs and tunes of the lineage.
The Immortals were known by the locals as the protector Gods of their families and relatives. On special days of celebration, the local people would climb the mountain to offer gratitude and reverence or to haul daily necessities to the residing Daoist monks. It is about one hours journey on foot from the village to the temple. The Immortals teach people the virtue of morality and compassion and the essence of heart-mind. They teach people to cultivate integrity and to nurture the innate nature of the self. The masters have revealed their supernatural abilities to help people in need and so crowds of people from the surrounding areas often climb to carry sacrificial offerings to them.&lt;ref&gt;The Empty Vessel magazine "The Journal of Daoist Philosophies and Practice" summer 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Abbot ==
Xing De (Daoist name)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wudangwhitehorse.com/wudang-lineage/li-song-feng/|title=Li Song Feng|work=Wudang White Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Date of Birth: 1964, Henan Province, Shang Qiu.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  
Xing De traveled extensively in his youth, seeking out many grandmasters in the mountains of China. He was accepted by many elders and has received many names. In 1991 he began his journey as an official devotee of Taoism. In 1996 he committed himself to a life of renunciation in White Horse Mountain (Wudang, Hubei Province).&lt;ref&gt;Warrior Guards the Mountain: The Internal Martial Traditions of China, Japan and South East Asia Paperback – January 15, 2013 by Alex Kozma (Author) {{ISBN|978-1848191242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the practices of cultivating Internal Alchemy from the grandmasters and devoted much of his time to mantras, rituals, talismans and Taoist Medicine for which he received transmissions from the elders. He became the Abbot of Five Immortals Temple in 2000. He is a priest of the Mount Wudang Dragon Gate Sect and Pure Yang Sect and he is a Master of Jing Chan Ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;official temple page about the [http://www.fiveimmortals.com/mount-wudang-master/ Abbot]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
As we enter 2015, the quantity of pilgrims is increasing and more tourists are arriving on the Wudang Mountain. This once sacred place of hermitage is slowly changing as people seek escape from the chaos of the cities. The solace of the mountain drives them en masse at weekends and during holidays into the holy grounds. The mountain remains quiet during the winter months but tourists, pilgrims and explorers arrive in great numbers during the summer months. The disturbance caused by these arrivals is considered necessary for a true cultivation in this modern world. They are considered to be important source material to promote potential and refinement in the midst of the chaos one must encounter on The Path.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;brief history of [http://www.reed.edu/luce/wudang/wudang_3.html Wudang shan]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Creation'' structure}}
'''''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]''''', the [[oratorio]] by [[Joseph Haydn]], is '''structured''' in three parts. He composed it in 1796–1798 on German text as '''''Die Schöpfung'''''. The work is set for soloists, chorus and orchestra. Its movements are listed in tables for their [[Form (music)|form]],  [[Voice type|voice]], [[Key (music)|key]], [[Tempo|tempo marking]], [[time signature]] and source. 
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Libretto ==

The origin of the [[libretto]] is not known. Haydn received the booklet in English in London on his second extended stay in 1795 from his impresario [[Johann Peter Salomon]]. According to Haydn, it was passed by a certain Lidley, or perhaps [[Thomas Linley the elder|Thomas Linley]], and was attributed to him, but may be written by an unknown author. Back in Vienna, Haydn passed it to his friend and sponsor Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]], who translated and organized it.{{r|jacobs}}

The sources for the libretto are the two [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation narrative]]s from the [[Book of Genesis]], some [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', an [[epic poem]] in ten volumes, first published in 1667. The libretto is structured in three parts, the first dealing with the Creation of the universe and the plants, the second with the Creation of the animals, and of man and woman, and the third with [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], showing an idealized love in harmony with the "new world".{{r|jacobs}}{{r|luzern}}

== Music ==

Haydn had composed [[Symphony|symphonies]], [[opera]]s, [[string quartet]]s and more [[chamber music]] for the court at [[Eszterháza]]. For the oratorio he used the vocal means of contemporary opera, [[recitative]], [[aria]], ensemble and chorus. The orchestra plays a decisive role in structure and [[tone painting]].{{r|jacobs}}

The oratorio has five solo roles, in Part I and II the three archangels [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] ([[soprano]]), [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]] ([[tenor]]) and [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] ([[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), in Part III Adam (bass) and Eve (soprano). The final movement needs an additional [[alto]] soloist. The chorus is in four parts, [[SATB]].{{r|jacobs}} Haydn used three soloists, some conductors prefer different soloists for Adam and Eve.

[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Haydn, portrait by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1791]]
Haydn set most of the narration from the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in [[Recitative#Secco|secco recitative]]. The rendering of the words is simple, different for example from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s approach in the parts of the [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] in his Passions. Haydn exceptions are the two recitatives opening Part I and II, which are accompanied by the orchestra. For each day, the recitative is followed by a contemplation of it, typically in accompanied recitative and aria, and affirmed by a choral movement.

As Bach in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]'' and Handel in ''[[Messiah structure|Messiah]]'', Haydn saves the soprano voice for a late appearance. Whereas Bach and Handel reserve the high voice for the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]], Haydn has Gabriel be the first to proclaim the wonder of the Wunderwerk (miraculous work).

Differently from Handel, who keeps solo and choral singing mostly separate in his operas and oratorios, Haydn strives for an interaction of solo and chorus, as in his late [[List of Masses by Joseph Haydn|Masses]] and contemporary [[opera]]. In the conclusion of Part I, ''Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes'' (The heavens are telling the glory of God), which covers the first two verses of [[Psalm 19]], the second verse, "To day that is coming speaks it the day ...", is given to the soloists, who sing to each other. This [[Trio (music)|trio]] section is repeated, leading to a choral repetition of verse 1, the second time a bit faster (Più allegro) and concluded by an elaborate [[fugue]], crafted on its second part, "and the firmament sheweth his handywork". In ''Vollendet ist das große Werk'', the chorus frames a slow trio section by two different fast movements. In ''Von deiner Güt, o Herr und Gott'' (By thy goodness, O bounteous Lord), the soloists sing a duet, accompanied by [[Tuplet#Triplets|triplets]], while the choir with the timpani sings simultaneously, as a soft foundation in even rhythm speaking of eternity, ''Gesegnet sei des Herren Macht'' (Forever blessed be his pow'r).{{r|luzern}}

The orchestra plays a distinct role in [[word painting]]. For example, flute and clarinet imitate the singing of the birds, trombones and contrabassoon articulate the roaring of the lion. When God speaks in person, "Seid fruchtbar" (be fruitful), the bass voice is accompanied by the low strings only. The solemn sound is reminiscent of the string quartet accompanying the [[Vox Christi]] (voice of Christ) in Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''. The cellos have the melody speaking of human love, three flutes illustrate Paradise.

Richard Wigmore summarizes: "In our own sceptical and precarious age we can still delight, perhaps with a touch of nostalgia, in Haydn’s unsullied optimism, expressed in some of the most lovable and life-affirming music ever composed."{{r|jacobs}}

== General notes ==

The following tables are organized by a number and first line of the movements. Different numbering of the movement exists. The voices are sometimes abbreviated S for soprano, T for tenor, B for bass. The modulating keys of many recitatives are written in accidentals. Recitatives typically come without a tempo marking. If no source is given, the text is derived from ''Paradise Lost''. The book of Genesis is abbreviated "Gen", the Book of Psalms "Ps". The English translations are taken from the edition of the Oxford University Press, 1991.

'''''The Tale of Orpheus and Erudices his Quene''''' is a poem by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[northern renaissance]] poet [[Robert Henryson]] that adapts and develops the Greek myth which most famously appears in two classic Latin texts, the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Ovid]] and the ''[[Georgics]]'' of [[Virgil]].

{{thelema}}
Within the modern system of [[Thelema]], developed by [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] in the first half of the 20th century, '''Thelemic mysticism''' is a complex mystical path designed to do two interrelated things: to learn one's unique [[True Will]] and to achieve union with the All. The set of techniques for doing so falls under Crowley's term [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|Magick]], which draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including [[Yoga]], Western ceremonial ritual (especially [[invocation]]s and [[eucharist]]ic ceremony), the [[Qabalah]], and several [[divination]] systems, especially the [[Thoth Tarot|tarot]] and [[astrology]].

The path to mystical attainment or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] was initially developed by Crowley largely based on the meditation/mystical techniques found in [[Buddhism]] and also the [[Tree of Life]], especially as it was examined by [[Eliphas Levi]] in the 19th century and later by various members in the occult society, [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|the Golden Dawn]]. In 1904, Crowley claimed to have transcribed, via "direct-voice transmission" from a "praeternatural intelligence" named [[Aiwass]], [[The Book of the Law]], which he eventually called the central sacred text of [[Thelema]], heralding a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]] for mankind.

Between 1907 and 1911, Crowley wrote a series of other small texts which he considered to be "inspired" in that they were written ''through'' him rather than ''by'' him, which were afterwards collected together and termed the [[Holy Books of Thelema|Holy Books]]. The final text added to the list was ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'', a vivid account of Crowley's [[Astral projection|astral travel]]s through the thirty [[Enochian]] Aethyrs. These texts formed the final mystical backbone of Crowley's system.

==Essential practices==

Within the system that Crowley developed, the core task for the adept is the discovery and manifestation of [[True Will|Will]], defined at times as a grand destiny and at other times as a moment to moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. This Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Therefore, the enlightened Thelemite is one who is able to eliminate or bypass the consciousness-created desires, conflicts, and habits, and tap directly into the Self/Universe nexus. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as the stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor "lust of result."

The ability to accomplish this [[Great Work]] requires a great deal of preparation and effort, according to Crowley's system. The programme consists of several key elements, including a thorough knowledge of the [[Hermetic Qabalah]] (especially the [[Tree of Life]]), disciplined concentration (i.e. [[meditation]]), the development of one's Body of Light (or [[astral body]]) (in order to experience other spiritual realms) and the consistent and regular invocation of certain deities or spiritual beings.

===Learning the Tree of Life===

The [[Tree of Life]] is a tool used to categorize and organize various mystical concepts. At its most simple level it is composed of ten spheres, or emanations, called [[Sephirot (Kabbalah)|sephiroth]] (sing. "sephira") which are connected by twenty-two paths. The sephiroth are represented by the planets and the paths by the characters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which are subdivided by the five elements, the seven classical planets, and the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]].

Within the western magical tradition, the Tree is used as a kind of conceptual filing cabinet. Each sephira and path is assigned various ideas, such as gods, cards of the Tarot, astrological planets and signs, elements, etc. Within Thelema, the seminal book which defines all these correspondences is Crowley's [[Liber 777]], although there have been other influential writers on the topic, including [[Israel Regardie]] and [[Eliphas Levi]].

The path of attainment is largely defined by the Tree of Life. The aspirant begins in [[Malkuth]], which is the everyday material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at [[Kether]], the sphere of Unity with the All. Through various exercises and practices, he or she attains certain spiritual and mental states that are characterized by the various sephiroth that ascend the Tree. Crowley considered a deep understanding of the Qabalah to be essential to the Thelemite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart; you must know it backwards, forwards, sideways, and upside down; it must become the automatic background of all your thinking. You must keep on hanging everything that comes your way upon its proper bough.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Magick Without Tears, ch. IV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The art of using it consists principally in referring all our ideas to it, discovering thus the common nature of certain things and the essential differences between others, so that ultimately one obtains a simple view of the incalculably vast complexity of the Universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The whole subject must be studied in the Book 777, and the main attributions committed to memory: then when by constant use the system is at last understood—as opposed to being merely memorised—the student will find fresh light break in on him at every turn as he continues to measure every item of new knowledge that he attains by this Standard. For to him the Universe will then begin to appear as a coherent and a necessary Whole.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Little Essays Towards Truth, "Man"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Part of the reason why the Qabalah is so important is that it is the key to understanding the Holy Books. Most of them, including [[The Book of the Law]], are written in abstract, poetic, and often obscure language. Through the use of the Qabalah, and especially the function of [[gematria]] (a form of numerology), the normally opaque meaning of the texts can be made clear. Thelemites can also make use of gematria to link words and concepts and to validate revelations given to them in magical operations, such as astral travel.

===Concentration===

Another key element to Thelemic mysticism is the ability to concentrate. This skill has two modalities: the first is the rapid, accurate, and efficient movement of thought (which is the realm of magick) and the other is the stopping of thought altogether (which is accomplished in Yoga). In the first, it is the manipulation of all ideas into one idea, and in the second is the taking of that one thought and reducing it to nothing. Of this skill, Crowley writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For concentration does indeed unlock all doors; it lies at the heart of every practice as it is of the essence of all theory; and almost all the various rules and regulations are aimed at securing adeptship in this matter.  All the subsidiary work—awareness, one-pointedness, mindfulness and the rest—is intended to train you to this.&lt;ref&gt;Magick Without Tears, ch. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concentration is essentially the prerequisite for all sustained success, not only in spiritual practices, but in day-to-day life as well. The general program for developing concentration is borrowed almost completely from the practice of Yoga within the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] systems. Crowley gives a general overview of the techniques in two books: ''[[Eight Lectures on Yoga]]'' [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/yoga/] and in the section called "Mysticism" in his opus, [[Magick (Book 4)]].

===Body of Light and astral travel===

The '''Body of Light'''—Crowley's term for the [[subtle body]]—is the theoretical aspect of self that can leave the corporeal body and carry one's senses and consciousness during [[Astral projection|astral travels]]. Crowley writes of it in ''Book 4'': "The work of the Body of Light—with the technique of [[Yoga]]—is the foundation of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|Magick]]." 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of Light must be developed and trained with exactly the same rigid discipline as the brain in the case of mysticism. The essence of the technique of Magick is the development of the Body of Light, which must be extended to include all members of the organism, and indeed of the cosmos [...] The object is to possess a Body which is capable of doing easily any particular task that may lie before it. There must be no selection of special experience which appeals to one's immediate desire. One must go steadily through all possible pylons.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, ABA: chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crowley explains that the most important practices for developing the Body of Light are:

# The fortification of the Body of Light by the constant use of rituals, by the assumption of god-forms, and by the right use of the Eucharist.
# The purification and consecration and exaltation of that Body by the use of rituals of invocation.
# The education of that Body by experience. It must learn to travel on every plane; to break down every obstacle which may confront it.

The benefit of astral travel is essentially one of education...it is akin to exploring one's own spiritual universe ("Every Magician possesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself"&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Crowley,Book 4, Apx. 3&lt;/ref&gt;) and understanding the fundamental components, so that the adept can eventually master it. The general object is the "control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find one's way about it, to penetrate such sanctuaries as are guarded from the profane, [and] to make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to acquire knowledge and power, or to command service".&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Also, "one's apprehension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for Angels, Archangels, and Gods are derived therefrom by analysis. One must have pure materials if one wishes to brew pure beer."&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; It is vital to understand that all this must be in service to the [[Great Work]] of discovering one's [[True Will]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the Magician therefore adventure himself upon the Astral Plane with the declared design to penetrate to a sanctuary of discarnate Beings such as are able to instruct and fortify him, also to prove their identity by testimony beyond rebuttal. All explanations other than these are of value only as extending and equilibrating Knowledge, or possibly as supplying Energy to such Magicians as may have found their way to the Sources of Strength. In all cases, naught is worth an obol save as it serve to help the One Great Work"&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crowley was also willing to admit that what was experienced during "astral travel" was not relevant in terms of what is "real" or "unreal." Ultimately, the only value to this practice is in the utility it provides to the adept.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'reality' or 'objectivity' of these symbols is not pertinent to the discussion. [...] The Magician must not accept [my] account of the Astral Plane, [my] Qabalistic discoveries, [my] instructions in Magick. They may be correct in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly true for any save [myself], even as no two artists can make identical pictures of the same subject [...] What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality [...] The true, the final test, of the Truth of one's visions is their Value. The most glorious experience on the Astral plane, let it dazzle and thrill as it may, is not necessarily in accordance with the True Will of the seer; if not, though it be never so true objectively, it is not true for him, because not useful for him.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Body of Light is more important than simply for astral travel—it is the storehouse of all experiences.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Magick, on the contrary, one passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes "unreal" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the Body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called 'initiation': finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Magick Without Tears, Ch. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Magick ritual===
{{main|Magick (Aleister Crowley)}}

According to Crowley, there is a single definition of the purpose for ritual magick: to achieve Union with God through "the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm." [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/chap1.html] Since this process is so arduous, it is also acceptable to use magick to develop the self (i.e. one's Body of Light) or to create ideal circumstances for the Work (e.g. having access to a place in which to do ritual undisturbed). There are many kinds of magick, but the categories of ritual that are recommended by Crowley include (all quotes are from ''Book 4''):

# '''[[Banishing]]'''—the elimination of unwanted forces. "The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of purification, firstly, of himself, secondly, of his instruments, thirdly, of the place of working."
# '''[[Invocation]]''', where the magician identifies with the Deity invoked. There are three methods:
#* ''[[wikt:devotion|Devotion]]'' —where "identity with the God is attained by love and by surrender, by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant (and illusionary) parts of yourself." (e.g. Liber Astarte [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib175.html])
#* ''[[Calling forth]]''—where "identity is attained by paying special attention to the desired part of yourself: positive, as the first method is negative."  (e.g. assumption of god-forms)
#* ''[[Drama]]''—where "identity is attained by sympathy. It is very difficult for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel; but for those who can do so, this method is unquestionably the best."  (e.g. many [[initiation]]s and the [[Gnostic Mass]])
# '''[[Evocation]]'''—which is bringing a spiritual being ''before'', not ''into'', the magician (e.g. [[Goetia]])
# '''[[Eucharist]]ic [[ritual]]'''—which "consists in taking common things, transmuting them into things divine, and consuming them." (e.g. The Mass of the Phoenix [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib44.html])
# '''[[Consecration]]'''—"the active dedication of a thing to a single purpose."
# '''[[Divination]]s'''—such as the use of the [[Thoth Tarot|Tarot]] or other tools used to gather information.

==Mystical milestones within the A.A. System==

Crowley often wrote that every adept's path will be unique. He also wrote that two major milestones are fundamental to Thelemic mysticism, which he called the knowledge of and conversation with one's [[Holy Guardian Angel]] and the crossing of the [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]]. Crowley wrote, "the two crises—the Angel and the Abyss—are necessary features in every career. The other tasks are not always accomplished in [any given order]".&lt;ref&gt;Confessions, ch.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The Holy Guardian Angel===
{{main|Holy Guardian Angel}}

Even though the Holy Guardian Angel (or HGA) is, in a sense, the “higher self”, it is often experienced as a separate being, independent from the adept. In the system of the [[A∴A∴]] magical order, the single most important goal is to consciously connect with one’s HGA, a process termed “Knowledge and Conversation.” By doing so, the magician becomes fully aware of his own [[True Will]]. For Crowley, this event was the single most important goal of any adept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step—crossing of the Abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, ''Magick Without Tears, Ch.83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In most of his writings, Crowley described the Holy Guardian Angel as one's "Silent Self", at times equitable with one's deepest unconscious. In later writings, he insisted that the HGA is an entirely separate and objective being. Whichever position is taken, the object remains the same—to gain an intimate spiritual connection so that one's True Will can become fully known and manifested. When using the Tree of Life as a guide, this event occurs in the Sphere of [[Tiphareth]].

Crowley wrote Liber Samekh [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib800.html] as an example of a ritual designed specifically for attaining the Knowledge and Conversation with one’s HGA. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: “INVOKE OFTEN.” Another detailed description of the general operation is given in ''The Vision and the Voice,'' Aethyr 8 [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib8.html].

===Crossing the Abyss===
{{main|Abyss (Thelema)}}
After one attains Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel, the adept may choose to then reach the next major milestone: the crossing of the Abyss, the great gulf or void between the phenomenal world of manifestation and its noumenal source, that great spiritual wilderness which must be crossed by the adept to attain mastery.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least ''in posse'', but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus ''Insane Delusions''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Little Essays Towards Truth: Man&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Choronzon]] is the Dweller in the Abyss; he is there as the final obstruction. If he is met with the proper preparation, then he is there to destroy the ego, which allows the adept to move beyond the Abyss. If unprepared, then the unfortunate traveller will be utterly dispersed into annihilation. Both Choronzon and the Abyss are discussed in Crowley's ''Confessions'' (ch. 66):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an individual. The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equally inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the word—that is, meaningless but malignant, in so far as it craves to become real. These forms swirl senselessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils, and each such chance aggregation asserts itself to be an individual and shrieks, "I am I!" though aware all the time that its elements have no true bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusion just as a horseman, meeting a dust devil, brings it in showers of sand to the earth.&lt;ref name="Confessions, chapter 66"&gt;Confessions, chapter 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, just on the other side of the Abyss awaits [[Babalon]]. She calls the adept to surrender completely, so that he or she may cross over.

===Babalon, the City of the Pyramids, and the Night of Pan===
{{main|Babalon|Night of Pan}}
Choronzon is the dweller within the Abyss, and his purpose is to trap the traveller in a meaningless world of illusion. However [[Babalon]] is just on the other side, beckoning (in the sphere of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] on the Tree of Life). If the adept gives himself to her—the symbol of this act is the pouring of the adept’s blood into her [[Holy Grail|graal]]—he becomes impregnated in her (a state called "Babe of the Abyss"), then he is reborn as a Master and a Saint that dwells in the City of the Pyramids.

The ''[[City of the Pyramids]]'' is the home to those adepts that have crossed the great [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]], having spilled all their blood in the [[Holy Grail|Graal]] of [[Babalon]]. They have destroyed their earthly ego-identities, becoming nothing more than piles of dust (i.e. the remaining aspects of their True Selves without the self-sense of "I"). Within, they take on the name or title of Saint or Nemo (Latin for ''No-Man'' or ''No-One''). In the system of [[A∴A∴]] they are called Masters of the Temple. It is a step along the path of spiritual purification, and a spiritual resting place for those who have successfully shed their attachments to the mundane world.

Of these adepts, it is written in ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'' (Aethyr 14):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
These adepts seem like Pyramids—their hoods and robes are like Pyramids [...] And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is no more.  There is no more knowledge.  There is no more bliss.  There is no more power.  There is no more beauty.  For this is the Palace of Understanding: for thou art one with the Primeval things.' [http://www.ehostarea.com/liber/L_418.txt]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Master of the Temple accordingly interferes not with the scheme of things, except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to do. Why should he struggle against imprisonment, banishment, death? [...] The Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests that all these matters are of no importance to Him. It may be of importance to His Work that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions, chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was instantly blotted in blackness. Mine Angel whispered the secret words whereby one partakes of the Mysteries of the Masters of the Temple. Presently my eyes beheld (what first seemed shapes of rocks) the Masters, veiled in motionless majesty, shrouded in silence. Each one was exactly like the other. Then the Angel bade me understand whereto my aspiration led: all powers, all ecstasies,  ended in this—I understood. He then told me that now my name was Nemo, seated among the other silent shapes in the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan; those other parts of me that I had left for ever below the Abyss must serve as a vehicle for the energies which had been created by my act. My mind and body, deprived of the ego which they had hitherto obeyed, were now free  to manifest according to their nature in the world, to devote themselves to aid mankind in its evolution. In my case I was to be cast out into the [[Chesed|Sphere of Jupiter]]. My mortal part was to help humanity by Jupiterian work, such a governing, teaching, creating, exhorting men to aspire to become nobler, holier, worthier, kinglier, kindlier and more generous.&lt;ref name="Confessions, chapter 66"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The City exists under the ''[[Night of Pan]]'', or N.O.X. The playful and lecherous [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] is the [[Greek god]] of nature, lust, and the masculine generative power. The Greek word ''Pan'' also translates as ''All'', and so he is “a symbol of the Universal, a personification of Nature; both Pangenetor, "all-begetter," and Panphage, "all-devourer" (Sabazius, 1995). Therefore, Pan is both the giver and the taker of life, and his Night is that time of symbolic death where the adept experiences unification with the All through the ecstatic destruction of the ego-self. In a less poetic symbolic sense, this is the state where one transcends all limitations and experiences oneness with the universe.

===Magus and Ipsissimus===

Only a few reach the final two stages, The penultimate is the becoming of a Magus (symbolized by entering [[Chokmah]] on the Tree of Life), whose essential duty is to communicate a new Truth to mankind. Of the Magi, Crowley writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many magical teachers but in recorded history we have scarcely had a dozen Magi in the technical sense of the word. They may be recognized by the fact that their message may be formulated as a single word, which word must be such that it overturns all existing beliefs and codes. We may take as instances the Word of Buddha—''Anatta'' (absence of an atman or soul) [...] Mohammed, again, with the single word ''Allah'' [...] Similarly, Aiwass, uttering the word ''Thelema'' (with all its implications), destroys completely the formula of the Dying God.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions, ch. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The state of being a Magus is described in Crowley's ''Liber B vel Magi''. [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib1.html] Elsewhere, he admits the possibility of someone reaching this rank without uttering a new magick Word. Such a Magus, he says, would identify himself or herself with the Word of the current Aeon and work to establish it. In ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'', Crowley suggests (without actually saying so) that the Secret Chiefs of the [[A∴A∴]] have reached at least the rank of Magus, in some sense. [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/mwt/mwt_09.html]

The state of Ipsissimus is the very highest possible (symbolized by the sphere of [[Kether]] on the Tree of Life). Relatively little is openly written of this state of enlightenment

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations whatsoever, existing in the nature of all things without discriminations of quantity or quality between them. He has identified Being and not-Being and Becoming, action and non-action and tendency to action, with all other such triplicities, not distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions, or between any one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or without conditions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to express its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within the veils of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep silence during his human life as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members of the Order.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that is, his being is entirely free from internal or external necessity. His work is to destroy all tendencies to construct or to cancel such necessities. He is the Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta)."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being: He has no will in any direction, and no Consciousness of any kind involving duality, for in Him all is accomplished; as it is written 'beyond the Word and the Fool, yea, beyond the Word and the Fool'."&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, apx: II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Thracian religion''' includes the religious practices of the [[Thracians]]. Little is known about their mythology and rituals, but some of their gods are depicted in statuary or described in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] sources.

==Cults==
One notable cult, attested from [[Thrace]] to [[Moesia]] and [[Scythia Minor]], is that of the "[[Thracian horseman]]", also known as the "Thracian Heros", at [[Varna|Odessos]] (Varna) attested by a [[Thracian language|Thracian]] name as ''Heros Karabazmos'', a god of the [[underworld]]  usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurker |first=Manfred |title=Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons |page=151 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoloff"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicoloff |first=Assen |title=Bulgarian Folklore |year=1983 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaac |first=Benjamin H. |title=The Greek Settlements in Thrace Until the Macedonian Conquest |year=1986 |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deities==
[[File:Zalmoxis Aleksandrovo.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the main fresco of the [[Aleksandrovo kurgan]]. The figure is identified with Zalmoxis.]]
Known Thracian deities include:
* [[Sabazios]], the Thracian reflex of Indo-European [[Dyeus]], identified with  Heros Karabazmos, the "Thracian horseman". He gained a widespread importance especially after the Roman conquest. This could be akin to Sleipnir, the horse ridden by Odin, in Norse mythology. After Christianity was adopted, the symbolism of Heros continued as representations of [[Saint George]] slaying the [[dragon]] (compare [[Uastyrdzhi]]/[[Tetri Giorgi]] in the [[Caucasus]]).&lt;ref name="Nicoloff"/&gt;
* [[Zibelthiurdos]] (also "Zbelsurdos", "Zibelthurdos"): a god recognized as similar to the Greek [[Zeus]] as a wielder of lightning and thunderbolts.
* [[Kotys (deity)|Kotys]] ("Cotys", "Cotto", "Cottyto", "Cottytus"), a goddess worshipped with much revelry by Thracian tribes such as the [[Edonians]] in the festival [[Cotyttia]].&lt;ref&gt;Detschew, Dimiter. Die Thrakische Sprachreste. Wien, 1957: p. 258 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; A cult of Cottyto existed in [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Athens]]. According to Greek sources her priests were called ''[[baptes]]'' or "washers" because their pre-worship purification rites involved bathing. Her worship included midnight [[Orgia|orgies ''(orgia)'']]. Her name is believed to have meant "war, slaughter", akin to [[Old Norse]] ''[[Höðr]]'' "war, slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;Also cognate: [[Irish language|Irish]] ''cath'' "war, battle", early German ''Hader'' "quarrel", Greek ''kótos'' "hatred", [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''kotora'' "fight, brawl", [[Sanskrit]] ''śatru'' "enemy, nemesis", and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''kattu'' "spiteful". See Orel, Vladimir. ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology''. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pleistoros]]

Several Thracian deities show close analogy to the Greek cult of [[Dionysus]], [[Orpheus]] and [[Persephone]] (the [[Dionysian Mysteries]]):
* [[Bendis]] was a [[Thrace|Thracian]] goddess of the moon and the hunt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Thrakios/Bendis.html Theoi Project - Bendis]&lt;/ref&gt; whom the Greeks identified with [[Artemis]], and hence with the other two aspects of formerly Minoan goddesses, [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]].
* [[Semele]] is probably the Mother Earth goddess akin to Lithuanian Zemyna and Latvian Semes, both of which are 'Mother Earth' goddesses. Likely there has been an early Semele Goddess in proto-Slavic mythology as 'earth' to this day is "земля" (zemlja) in Russian, "земља" (zemlja) in Serbian and "земя" (zemja) in Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Also compare Phrygian 'Zemelo'.  

Known Dacian theonyms include:
* [[Zalmoxis]], identified by some with the thunder-god [[Gebeleizis|Gebeleïzis]],&lt;ref&gt;Hdt. 4.94, Their belief in their immortality is as follows: they believe that they do not die, but that one who perishes goes to the deity Salmoxis, or Gebeleïzis, as some of them call him.&lt;/ref&gt; an important god of the Dacians&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898),(Zalmoxis) or Zamolxis (Zamolxis). Said to have been so called from the bear's skin (zalmos) in which he was clothed as soon as he was born. He was, according to the story current among the Greeks on the Hellespont, a Getan, who had been a slave to Pythagoras in Samos, but was manumitted, and acquired not only great wealth, but large stores of knowledge from Pythagoras, and from the Egyptians, whom he visited in the course of his travels. He returned among the Getae, introducing the civilization and the religious ideas which he had gained, especially regarding the immortality of the soul. Herodotus, however, suspects that he was an indigenous Getan divinity ( Herod.iv. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; and Thracians.&lt;ref&gt;XCV. This Zamolxis, as I have been informed by those Greeks who inhabit the Hellespont and the Euxine, was himself a man, and formerly lived at Samos, in the service of Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus; having obtained his liberty, with considerable wealth, he returned to his country. Here he found the Thracians distinguished equally by their profligacy and their ignorance; whilst he himself had been accustomed to the Ionian mode of life, and to manners more polished than those of Thrace; he had also been connected with Pythagoras, one of the most celebrated philosophers of Greece. He was therefore induced to build a large mansion, to which he invited the most eminent of his fellow-citizens: he took the opportunity of the festive hour to assure them, that neither himself, his guests, nor any of their descendants, should ever die, but should be removed to a place, where they were to remain in the perpetual enjoyment of every blessing. After saying this, and conducting himself accordingly, he constructed a subterranean edifice: when it was completed, he withdrew himself from the sight of his countrymen, and resided for three years beneath the earth.—During this period, the Thracians regretted his loss, and lamented him as dead. In the fourth year he again appeared among them, and by this artifice gave the appearance of probability to what he had before asserted.

XCVI. To this story of the subterraneous apartment, I do not give much credit, though I pretend not to dispute it; I am, however, very certain that Zamolxis must have lived Many years before Pythagoras : whether, therefore, he was a man, or the deity of the Getse, enough has been said concerning him. These Getse, using the ceremonies I have described, after submitting themselves to the Persians under Darius, followed his army.
  - Herodotus page 117 Published by P.P. Berresford, 1828&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Derzelas]] (also "Darzalas") was a chthonic god of health and human spirit's vitality.

[[Kogaionon]] was the name of a holy mountain of the Dacians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">'''Time and fate deities''' are personifications of [[time]], often in the sense of human lifetime and human [[destiny|fate]], in polytheistic religions. 
In monotheism, Time can still be personified, like [[Father Time]].

[[File:Torngarsuk.png|thumb|Torngarsuk as depicted in the [[Dictionnaire Infernal]], 1863 edition.]]

In [[Inuit mythology]], '''Torngarsuk''' (or '''Torngasak''') is a very powerful sky god, one of the more important deities in the Inuit pantheon.

Torngarsuk is listed as a demon or spirit in the ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' - a.k.a. '''Tornatik''', '''Torngarsoak''', '''Torngasoak''', '''Tungrangayak''','''Tornasuk''' etc. is a mischievous demon/spirit worshiped by offering in [[Greenland]] and the northeastern regions of [[Canada]].

==Description==
Torngarsuk is the master of whales and seals and most powerful supernatural being in Greenland. He appears in the form of a bear, or a one-armed man, or as a grand human creature like one of the fingers of a hand.  He is considered to be invisible to everyone but the [[angakoq]]s (the [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|medicine men or shamans among Eskimo peoples]]).

These conflicting descriptions leave us unsure as to his form, but as a grand spirit or demon Torngarsuk is invoked by fishermen and by the angakoqs when one falls ill. There are other spirits invisible to everyone but the Anguekkok, who teach men how to be happy. They see Torngarsuk as their benefactor; when the Anguekkok call upon him, they ask that if he does not come that he leave them "in the land of plenty".

==Familiar==
Each Anguekkok keeps a [[familiar spirit]] in a leather bottle which he evokes &amp; consults like an [[oracle]]. This familiar spirit seeks Torngarsuk in a cave and brings good fortune as well as healing power.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, the term or phrase ''Tornasuk'' &amp; ''angekok'' are best known from a simple &amp; short reference to this part of Inuit mythology &amp; ideology by H.P. Lovecraft - in his famous short-story "The Call of Cthulhu", where these ideas are portrayed as part of an "Eskimo diabolist" cult who revere Cthulhu as an avatar or tangible form of Torngarsuk.

The '''Universal Pantheist Society''' is one of the world's first official organizations dedicated to the promotion and understanding of modern [[pantheism]]. The Society does not require its members to hold to any particular creed about Pantheism and recognizes that there are a variety of beliefs that fall under the title [[pantheism]]. The Society encourages individuals in finding ways of spiritual practice in keeping with the general spirit of [[pantheism]]. Its motto is ''We seek renewed reverence for the Earth and a vision of Nature as the ultimate context for human existence...''[http://www.pantheist.net/]
==Background== 
The Universal Pantheist Society seeks to bring together Pantheists of various traditions and understandings, believing that standing together can help create a stronger community and provide greater intellectual stimulation for its participants.  

The Society, founded in 1975, was the first organization to recognize Pantheism as a religion (organized under U.S. 501(c)(3) statutes). It is a membership organization that has been serving Pantheists worldwide since 1975. The UPS social networking site welcomes all varieties of pantheists, [[Religious naturalism|religious naturalists]], eco-humanists and other like-minded advocates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universalpantheist.ning.com/ Universal Pantheist Society] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pantheism]] (Gr. pan=all, theos=God), is the title used to denote any paradigm that postulates 'God is all' Pantheism identifies the Universe (Nature) with God.  Various forms of pantheism have religious foundations; others have been based upon naturalistic, scientific, or poetic points of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pantheism Columbia Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Pantheist Vision'' publication ==
The Society is overseen by a Board of Directors and publishes a Journal, '''''Pantheist Vision'''''&lt;!-- title redirects to this article --&gt;, which presents articles relating to the modern philosophy and practice of pantheism. Edited by Society co-founder Harold Wood, the Journal, a quarterly publication, features member-submitted articles, personal interpretations of pantheism from both members and notable figures, book reviews and essays by the editor . There are also occasionally special publications a recommended Pantheist reading list and book store. [http://www.pantheist.net/society/pantheist_vision.html]
