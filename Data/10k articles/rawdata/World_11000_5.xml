'''Balkania''' was the name of a proposed state in the [[Balkans]], suggested by the [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo Albanian]] politician [[Adem Demaçi]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="aimpress" /&gt; Intended as an alternative to Serb-Albanian ethnic conflict, it would have transformed the [[Rump state|rump]] [[third Yugoslavia]] into a democratic [[confederation]] consisting of [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name="bbnet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ex-yupress" /&gt;

The proposal became moot when in 2006 [[Montenegro]] [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|declared independence]], and after [[International recognition of Kosovo|still disputed]] Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] in 2008.

The Cluster Munitions '''Ban Advocates''' are a group of individuals whose lives have been affected by [[cluster munitions]], a particular type of [[explosive weapon]] that has been banned for its indiscriminate area effects and risk from [[unexploded ordnance]]. They come from [[Afghanistan]], [[Albania]], [[Cambodia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Iraq]], [[Lao PDR]], [[Lebanon]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Serbia]] and [[Vietnam]]. The Ban Advocates took an active role in the Oslo Process on cluster munitions that led to the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]], a treaty banning cluster munitions and providing innovative provisions to assist the victims of these weapons. The Ban Advocates initiative was launched in October 2007 by [[Handicap International]] Belgium, a founding member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]]. The Ban Advocates spoke in front of the international community on many occasions. According to the Irish Minister for Justice, "The indomitable spirit of the Ban Advocates, overcoming terrible injuries to bear witness to the horrors of cluster munitions, inspired us throughout." The [http://www.banadvocates.org/ Ban Advocates blog] provides regular updates on their work around the world.

'''Cameroon Radio Television''' ('''CRTV''') is a major [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting company in [[Cameroon]].

CRTV is a government-controlled radio and television service in Cameroon. It started as Cameroon Television (CTV) and later merged with the radio service to become known as CRTV. It covers all the ten regions of Cameroon rendering it the indomitable broadcaster amongst a number of private television stations in the country. Its coverage of events is generally viewed as pro-government.

On 29 June 2016, Charles Ndongo was named new General Manager of CRTV by a presidential decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crtv.cm/fr/latest-news/top-news-24/crtv-charles-ndongo-becomes-new-gm-17417.htm|title=CRTV: Charles Ndongo becomes new GM|publisher=CRTV|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He replaces Ahmadou Valmouke at a time when the country is on the verge of switching to a digital Television Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch-africa.com/govt/charles-ndongo-named-new-crtv-manager/|title=Charles Ndongo named new CRTV manager|publisher=Tech Crunch Africa|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the coverage is done in French, although there is some English programming as well, given that the country is bilingual. CRTV programmes include home-produced documentaries, magazines, news analysis, and imported series from Asia and Brazil.

The '''coats of arms of [[Lillehammer]]''' was approved by Royal resolution on April 4, 1898. It was created by the artist [[Andreas Bloch]] (1860–1917). The design depicts a [[Birkebeiner]] (soldier of a Norwegian faction during a war in the 12th and 13th centuries). This motif was chosen following a public competition. The official coat of arms also features a golden [[mural crown]] with three towers.

[[File:Hierogamia de Los Casares.gif|thumb|right|160px|One of the many [[paleolithic]] [[hierogamy|hierogamies]] of Los Casares, in that representing a sexual act.]]
'''Cueva de los Casares''' is a [[cave]] in [[Riba de Saelices]] ([[Guadalajara (province)|Province of Guadalajara]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]]). Discovered in 1933, it contains a number of [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, and is most notable for a series of paintings depicting what some have argued is the earliest representation of human understanding of the [[biological reproduction|reproductive process]], featuring images of copulation (perhaps mediated by a mysterious [[shaman]] figure), pregnancy, childbirth, and family life. [[Mammoth]]s and other animals feature frequently in the illustrations. It was declared ''[[Bien de Interés Cultural]]'' in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consulta a la base de datos de bienes inmuebles |url=https://www.mecd.gob.es/bienes/buscarDetalleBienesInmuebles.do?brscgi_DOCN=000005297&amp;brscgi_BCSID=b5c753d7&amp;language=es&amp;prev_layout=bienesInmueblesResultado&amp;layout=bienesInmueblesResultado |website=Gobierno de España |accessdate=2 June 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many representations of animals, anthropomorphs (human-like figures), and ideomorphs (including penises, vulvas, tools, and more abstract images).

The cave and its paintings are little known to scholars outside Spain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="614">In [[Greece]] the all-numeric form for dates is in the little [[endianness]] order of "day month year".  Years can be written with 2 or 4 digits. For example, either 24/5/2004 or 24/5/04.

The [[12-hour notation]] is used in verbal communication, but the [[24-hour format]] is also used along with the 12-hour notation in writing.  The [[minutes]] are usually written with two [[Numerical digit|digits]]; the hour numbers are written with or without a leading zero.

'''Kleines Theater ''' is a small theatre in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], dedicated to "Kleinkunst" ([[:de:Kleinkunst|in German]]). The theatre was founded in 1984 as "Das Kleine Theater Schallmoos", headed by Claus Tröger.

A second venue called ''Theater Metropolis'' was built but had to be closed after a bankruptcy in 1999. Ferdinand L. Jansky took over in 2000 with a volunteer leadership of the theatre. It showcases contemporary theatre and cabaret. Theatre for children and youth is regularly performed at the venue, in collaboration with kindergartens and schools.

'''''Kobzar''''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Кобзар, "The bard"), is a book of [[poem]]s by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[poet]] and [[Painting|painter]] [[Taras Shevchenko]],&lt;ref&gt;''"Kobzar." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2011.''&lt;/ref&gt; first published by him in 1840 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Taras Shevchenko was nicknamed ''The [[Kobzar]]'' after the publishing of this book. From that time on this title has been applied to Shevchenko's poetry in general and acquired a [[Symbolic system|symbolic meaning]] of the Ukrainian national and literary revival.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\K\O\KobzarIT.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication consisted of a collection of eight works: "Думи мої, думи мої, лихо мені з вами"(''My thoughts, my thoughts, you are my doom''), "Перебендя" ([[Perebendya]]), "Катерина" (''Kateryna''), "Тополя" (''[[Poplar tree]]''), "Думка" (''Thought''), "Нащо мені чорні брови" (''Why should I have Black Eyebrows''), "До Основ'яненка" (''To Osnovyanenko''), "Іван Підкова" (''[[Ivan Pidkova]]''), and "Тарасова ніч" (''Taras's night'').
[[Image:First Kobzar.jpg|thumb|right|157px|The first publication of ''Kobzar''.]]

The author also published two more books under the same name in 1844 and 1860. Also, in 1844, another version of the original ''Kobzar'', titled ''Chyhyrynskyi Kobzar'', was republished with an addition of the poem "Гайдамаки" (''Haydamaky'').

Publication of the work was forbidden by the [[Ems Ukase]], which forbade the publishing of Ukrainian-language literature. This prompted the publication of the work in non-Russia-ruled lands, such as in [[Prague]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]) and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"/&gt;

==Word definition==

Literally, '''kobzar''' in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] means a bard, although not a regular one, but rather the one who along with singing plays on a [[musical instrument]], [[kobza]]. In the contemporary [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] the word is being more associated with the famous Ukrainian series of poetic literary works and for which [[Taras Shevchenko]] was given the same nickname. Kobza is roughly similar to a [[guitar]].

A car bomb, targeting an armored vehicle transporting police personnel, exploded close to a bus terminal in the Bağlar district of Diyarbakır, Turkey, killing at least seven police officers and wounding 27 more people, including 13 officers, according to a joint statement by Turkish officials and the police. The attack comes one day before Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu's scheduled visit to the city. There has been no claim of responsibility. CNN points out both Kurdish rebels and ISIL militants have claimed similar recent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/loud-explosion-rocks-turkey-diyarbakir-160331142831391.html|title=Car bomb kills police in Turkey's Diyarbakir|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/explosion-reported-in-turkeys-diyarbakir-4-deaths-reported/2016/03/31/104ed32c-f754-11e5-958d-d038dac6e718_story.html|title=Sorry, we can’t seem to find the page you’re looking for.|date=31 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/europe/turkey-diyarbakir-bomb.html|title=Car Bomb Kills 7 Turkish Police Officers in Diyarbakir|date=1 April 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-turkey-blast-idUKKCN0WX1XP|title=Car bomb kills seven police in Turkey's Diyarbakir - officials|author=Orhan Coskun and Seyhmus Cakan|date=31 March 2016|work=Reuters UK|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/31/europe/turkey-violence/|title=7 police killed in Diyarbakir, Turkey, bombing - CNN.com|author=Greg Botelho and Gul Tuysuz, CNN|date=31 March 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35937596|title=Turkey Diyarbakir: Bomb kills police in south-eastern city|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/03/31/7-officers-killed-27-wounded-in-diyarbakir-terror-attack-on-police-vehicle-in-southeastern-turkey|title=7 officers killed, 27 wounded in Diyarbakır terror attack on police vehicle in southeastern Turkey|date=31 March 2016|work=DailySabah|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24857">'''Monarchy in ancient India''' was sovereignty over a territory by a King who functioned as its protector, a role which involved both secular and religious power. The meaning and significance of kingship changed dramatically between the [[Vedic Period|Vedic]] and [[Vedic Period#The later Vedic period|Later Vedic]] period, and underwent further development under the influence of [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]]. Although there is evidenceand into the Later Vedic period, by the time of composition of the {{IAST|[[Brāhmaṇa]]}} literature, traces of elective kingship had already begun to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Altekar, A.S. ''State and Government in Ancient India'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, the king evolved from the equivalent of a [[tribal chief]] to a fully divine [[god-king]] on whose sacrifices the kingdom depended for prosperity and on whose legislation society depended for order.

==Kingship and the Vedas==

Vedic ideas about the establishment of the office of king ultimately draw upon legends about the coronation of one god as king of all others. Legends abound as to which of the gods won this position;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Aitareya Brahmana|A. Br.]], 1.14; [[Taittiriya Brahmana|T. Br.]] 2.2.7.2; [[Jaiminiya Brahmana|J. Br.]] 3.152.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|Ṛg Veda}}]]'', [[Indra]], [[Agni]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], [[Yama]], and [[Varuna|{{IAST|Varuṇa}}]] are all addressed as "King."  Indeed, kingship in the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|Ṛg Veda}}]]'' largely manifests only in the form of gods as kings. Hymns directly addressed to earthly kings, like 10.173-10.175, are the exception rather than the rule. In these hymns, the king is said to have been "established" by Indra and "made victorious" by Soma and [[Savitr|{{IAST|Savitṛ}}]]. Although this implies a close dependence of the king upon the gods, the rarity of the figure of the human king in the ''{{IAST|Ṛg Veda}}'' agrees with the idea that kings at this time were basically on a level with tribal chiefs and were not viewed as divine.&lt;ref&gt;see Sharma, Ram Sharan. ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India.'' p. 162; 186&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a provocative line at 10.124.8 which mentions people electing their king, and 3.4.2 in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' seems to confirm this. Also, several hymns in the ''{{IAST|Ṛg Veda}}'' demonstrate the importance of the ''samiti'' (10.166.4, 10.191), the governing assembly, further indicating that the early Vedic king ruled in a tribal setting where decision making by assembly still played a major role.

As was stated above, the king was not considered divine in the early Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;Altekar, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the {{IAST|Brāhmaṇas}} were composed, however, the king was increasingly associated with the gods through his qualities and the rituals he performed.&lt;ref&gt;Altekar, p. 89-90; see also Sharma, p. 165 one example from the [[Satapatha Brahmana|{{IAST|Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa}}]] in which the king is equated with [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Also by this time, kingship had transitioned to a hereditary position and the ''samiti'' began to wane in importance.&lt;ref&gt;See Sharma, p. 64; 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingship in Dharma Literature==
{{See also|Raja}}

===Divinity of the King===
[[File:Aihole inscription of Ravi Kirti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Royal inscription extolling the conquests of Badami [[Chalukya]] King [[Pulakeshin II]] dated to 634 CE]]
By the time of the composition of the ''[[Laws of Manu|Mānava Dharmaśāstra]]'', the divinity of the king had become well established. In ''Manu'' 7.4, the king is said to be made out of divine particles of several gods, including Yama, Indra, {{IAST|Varuṇa}}, and [[Kubera]]. This may be seen as closely related to the earlier belief that at his coronation, the king assumed various aspects of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;See Alterkar, p.78; Lingat, Robert. ''The Classical Law of India''. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  At ''Manu'' 7.8, it is stated that even an infant king must never be treated with disrespect, because he is in reality a god on earth.  ''[[Nāradasmṛti|Nārada]]'' 18.49-50 echoes this sentiment, saying that the king's divinity is apparent in the force of his decrees: his words are law as soon as he utters them. This is in contrast to earlier [[Dharmasutra|Dharmasūtra]] texts, which seem to stress the king's subordinate status in comparison to [[Brahmin]]s and make no mention of his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Gautama'' 11.1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===King as Protector===
The Dharmasūtras and [[Dharmaśāstras]] agree that it is the special duty of the king to protect, to punish, and to preserve dharma for those in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;In the Dharmasūtras, see ''{{IAST|Vasiṣṭha}}'' 19.1; ''Gautama'' 8.1-3; in the Dharmaśāstras, see ''Manu'' 7.2-4; ''Nārada'' 18.31; ''[[Yajnavalkya Smriti|Yājñavalkya]]'' 1.323&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a new myth of the creation of kingship not found in the Dharmasūtras and differing from those found in previous Vedic literature is seen in the Dharmaśāstras. At ''Manu'' 7.2, it is stated that the [[Svayambhu|Self-existent Lord]] created the king to restore order to the chaotic world which had existed without him. Then the Lord created Punishment (spoken of as a deity), because through punishment the world is subdued (''Manu'' 7.22). By performing his duty as protector and punisher, the king flourishes (''Manu'' 7.107). The weak and helpless (i.e. widows, children, the mentally ill, the destitute) were to receive royal protection.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 8.27-29; ''[[Visnusmrti|{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}]] 3.65&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond protecting his subjects against each other, the king, as a [[Kshatriya|{{IAST|kṣatriya}}]], also had a duty to protect his subjects against external threats and wage war with rival kingdoms.  ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.87, for instance, states that a king, when challenged, must never back down from a battle; indeed, doing battle is his [[dharma]].

===''{{IAST|Varṇa}}'' of the King===
As was stated above ''Manu'' 7.2 specifically states that a {{IAST|kṣatriya}} who has received vedic initiation is eligible to become a king. Elsewhere, any [[twice-born]] person is forbidden to live in a country ruled over by a Śudra (4.61); likewise, Brahmins are forbidden to accept gifts from any king not of proper royal lineage (4.84). Yet commentators like [[Medhātithi]], Kullūka, and [[Vijñāneśvara]] essentially overturned such rules about the king's lineage, stating that any person recognized as having power over a territory is to be understood as king, regardless of his ''{{IAST|[[varṇa]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of this, see Lingat, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority of the King===
The basis of the king's authority is a matter of some discrepancy in the Dharma literature. Some authors of dharma texts make it seem as though the king's power lies solely in his adherence to dharma and its preservation. His edicts are powerful only in that they are in accordance with the Law; his legal decisions should be based on what is stated in the śāstras alone, not on his own will and authority. Furthermore, the king really only enforces what his Brahmin advisers declare to be dharma.&lt;ref&gt;On this, see, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.28-31 and ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.29; see also the discussion in Altekar, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''{{IAST|Vasiṣṭha Dharmasūtra}}'', for example, is explicit that Brahmins will state what is dharma for the three ''{{IAST|[[varṇa]]s}}'', and the king will govern accordingly (1.39-41). In other texts however, or even in passages in the same texts, the authority of the king involves the application of his own reason and will. So, in contrast to ''Manu'' 7.28-31, 8.44-45 in the same text states that the king should rely on his own powers of deduction in the administration of justice. Reasoning as a means of reaching a judgment even appears as early as the ''Gautama Dharmasūtra'' (11.23-24). But by the time of the ''{{IAST|[[Nāradasmṛti]]}}'', royal decree had been placed above all other sources of law as the most powerful, abrogating all the rest.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.10&lt;/ref&gt; The power behind royal decrees is thus located increasingly in the king himself, even though he is still urged to preserve dharma.

Indeed, while certain sources do mention that the king kept a cohort of religious advisers to consult in regards to various religious matters, the king remained a power unto himself for the simple fact that he bore the results of his actions and decisions, an idea grounded in the reciprocity shared between the king and his subjects: the king's salvation "depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire". Similarly, his subjects depend on him, for if he "protects them as he should," his people may devote themselves "to their duties".&lt;ref&gt;Lingat, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while power was increasingly located within the king, his role was maintained within a set of boundaries and the role he played within society did not extend into previously untouched areas. For example, within the matter of spiritual salvation (i.e. [[moksa]]), the king played no direct role at all; it is not his responsibility to "propound any superstitious idea, to lay down any part of righteousness," or to help define "what is or is not religion" nor determine its practice.&lt;ref&gt;Derrett, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the king was to act as the enforcer and sometimes intermediary through which the "imperial sacrificial ceremonies" occurred. Indeed, a special "affinity with the gods," most notably Indra, resulting from his role in personally conducting special sacrifice and ensuring others likewise performed the rites is mentioned as a source of the king's authority. Examples of such sacrifices include the ''[[Rajasuya]]'' ("the king's inauguration sacrifice"), the ''[[Asvamedha]]'' ("the horse sacrifice"), and the ''Aindramahabhisheka'' ("The Great Consecration of Indra").&lt;ref&gt;Ghosal, p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statecraft===

Following in the tradition of the [[Arthaśāstra]], Manu and Yājñavalkya, in defining ''rājadharma'' (law of or for the king) go into great detail regarding how the king is to set up his government and manage his kingdom. In ''Manu'', for example, the discussion of how the king should choose his ministers directly follows the description of qualities a king should cultivate.  ''Manu'' 7.54 advises the king to choose seven or eight counselors who are learned and of noble birth, without specifically defining their ''{{IAST|vaṛṇa}}''. Out of these, however, one individual should be chosen as a prime minister, and the text specifies that this individual is to be a Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 7.58;  ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' 3.70; ''Yājñavalkya'' 1.312&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti|Yājñavalkya]]'' 1.310, on the other hand, advises that all [[mantri]]ns be Brahmins.

Lower officials (''amātya''s) should be assigned to duties based on their personal attributes, including honesty, intelligence, and cleverness.&lt;ref&gt;''Manu'' 7.60-62. Arthaśāstra 1.8 gives a description of the differences between ''mantrin''s an ''amātya''s. See also Ganguly, D. K. ''Aspects of Ancient Indian Administration''. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the tasks to be overseen by the ''amātya''s were collecting taxes, supervising the royal mines, and collecting tolls for use of public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;See ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' 3.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Manu follows {{IAST|[[Kauṭilya]]}} in saying that [[diplomat|envoy]]s (''dūta'') should be chosen based on cleverness and the ability to decipher hints and gestures, i.e., to read a rival king's appearance for clues as to his intentions and general disposition.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 7.67, ''Arthaśāstra'' 1.15.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the envoy was vital for both diplomacy and reconnaissance. The importance of the role of the envoy can be seen in ''[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti|Yājñavalkya]]'' 13.328, where an involved set of preparations in made for both the dispatching and return of the dūta, including the meeting of the king with all his ministers.

As to the organization of his kingdom, a king, according to Manu, should place [[constable]]s between ever second, third, and fifth village, and at the hundredth village. Superintendents with jurisdiction over one, ten, twenty, a hundred, and a thousand villages should also be appointed (''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' 3.9-10 has one, ten, a hundred, and a whole district).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 7.114-115&lt;/ref&gt;  Any problems arising in villages are to be reported to progressively higher superintendents; {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} states that when a solution is not reached by a lower superintendent, the problem must be reported to the next highest superintendent and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 7.116-117; ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' 3.11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===The King and Legal Procedure===

According to Nārada, the king is the highest venue of [[legal procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.7&lt;/ref&gt;  This would indicate that only the most important of cases would be heard directly by the king, i.e. cases for which a decision had not been reachable in local community or guild courts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lariviere, in his translation of the ''{{IAST|[[Nāradasmṛti]]}}'', takes this to be the verse's import. See Lariviere, ''The {{IAST|Nāradasmṛti}}: Critically Edited with an Introduction, Annotated Translation, and Appendices''. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manu and {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} both state that the king may either try cases himself (accompanied, of course, by Brahmin jurists), or he may appoint a Brahmin judge to oversee trials for him.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Viṣṇusmṛti|{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}]]'' 3.72-73; ''Manu'' 8.9; see also ''{{IAST|Vasiṣṭha}}'' 16.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Manu even allows that a non-Brahmin ''[[dvija]]'' can be appointed as a legal interpreter, but under no circumstances may a [[Śudra]] act as one.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 8.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma texts uniformly stress that the king be impartial in his judgments. Manu states that a king who is partial and unjust in his inflicting of punishment will himself be punished (7.27), saying at 8.128 that punishing one who does not deserve to be punished condemns the king to hell. Elsewhere, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} and Nārada stress that both the king and his judges be unbiased in their hearing of cases.&lt;ref&gt;See ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' 3.74;  ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.28 and 1.58&lt;/ref&gt;  This had religious as well as strictly legal implications; according to ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.65, a king who follows proper procedure in hearing lawsuits is ensured fame in this world and heaven in the afterlife.

In the ''{{IAST|[[Bṛhaspatismṛti]]}}'', the king is advised to hear cases in the morning, dressed in his regalia after having performed morning [[Ritual purification|ablutions]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''{{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}'' 1.21&lt;/ref&gt;  This contradicts with ''Manu'' 8.2, which states that the king's clothing during his daily hearing of court case should be modest.

Much as an envoy is to decipher the disposition of a rival king through bodily and gestural clues, the king is advised to note a litigant's external clues while hearing cases to discern his disposition.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Manu'' 8.25&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Manu'' 8.62-72 distinguishes who the king may or may not have questioned as a witness in connection with a trial; a greatly expanded list is given at ''Nārada'' 1.159. Upon hearing contradictory testimony from witnesses, the king is advised at ''Manu'' 8.73 to rely on what the majority of witnesses say, or else the testimony of witnesses of superior qualities; if discrepancy persists, the testimony of Brahmins is to be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;''Nārada'' 1.209-210 replaces "testimony of Brahmins" with testimony of those witnesses with the best memories. If those with the best memories disagree, the testimony is to be disqualified.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Nārada'' 1.142 states that the king should dismiss witnesses whose testimonies continuously contradict each other.

Following this inquiry, the case may be decided upon.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Nārada'' {{IAST|Mātṛkā}} 1.30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
The king's right to tax was the logical next step after the theory of absolute ownership of lands by the king. Manu describes the king as the absolute lord of the land and as such, the king was entitled to his share in the produce of the lands. The permission of the king was needed to buy, sell and donate land.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, K.R. ''Public Finance in Ancient India'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the land was the people’s own, with the king only claiming absolute ownership. As long as the people worked the land and paid their taxes, they would be fine, but otherwise, the king could exercise his power and confiscate the land.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilateral contract===
This understanding was part of a bilateral contract made between the king and the people. The people would work the land and give taxes to the king for protection. The contract implies that the people submitted to a sovereign authority that they created, they volunteered to pay the tax, the tax rate was fixed by the people, the taxes are paid to the king as a wage for his protection and the king has to answer to the people. From this it can be concluded that the king has the right to tax, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes, and the duty is conditional on the performance of the king in his duties.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the king’s performance in protection in relationship to taxation is so important that some texts require the king to compensate for any stolen goods he failed to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, U.N. ''Contributions to the History of the Hindu Revenue System'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
The king had limitations on how he could tax. He had to know when to tax as some times were better than others. The amount the person was taxed was to be determined by the nature of the person. If they had gotten rich from doing wrong, they were to be highly taxed, those who were prosperous were to be taxed little by little and those who could not pay should never be taxed. The limit people could pay in taxes should not be crossed. Only profits and surpluses should be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Increases should be done gradually and at the proper time. The king should use the taxes to help benefit the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 62-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of taxes===
====Bali====
In the early Vedic period the king collected taxes regularly from his subjects. The taxes were called bali and consisted of 1/6 the agricultural produce or cattle for a given person.&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of bali was tributes extracted from conquered enemies by the king. There was a system in place to collect these taxes, but the exact details have been lost to time.&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Even when other forms of taxes appeared in the later periods, bali was still present. It was used a special tax that was used differently by different kingdoms in order to gain additional revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land revenue====
This was the main tax in the post-Vedic period as it evolved out of bali. It was important source of income for the state and it was employed in every kingdom since its founding. This tax entailed the state receiving 1/6 of the produce of the land. This tax was of the profits made from the land, not the gross produce. People could pay the tax either in the good produced or with money. There  Also a survey would be done to assist in the proper collection of the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irrigation tax====
The state had to look over and protect the natural sources of water. Also they had to build and maintain irrigation devices such as canals. If water was taken from rivers, tanks, lakes or wells a rate of a fourth of the produce was taken.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toll charges====
Duties placed on goods imported from foreign lands, produced in country parts and within the city. The rates varied between 4% and 20%. Marriage and religious commodities were except. There were other types of toll charges including: a water ferry toll, toll to enter the city, road toll and a use of harbor toll.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sales tax====
There were two types of sale taxes. One was a general tax of 10% placed on all goods. The other taxes placed on special goods such as jewels, land auctions and immovable objects. The punishment of tax evasion was the confiscation of the goods purchased.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor tax====
Everyone was expected to contribute to the common good. For poor people who could not pay their taxes in kind or with money, they would have to work in state factories. Also one day of each month, each person, including Brahmins, had to work solely for the king, called Visti.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poll tax====
This is a tax levied on individuals. There were two forms of the poll tax. The first was a general tax was levied on every member of a family. The second was a special tax that undesirable foreigners had to pay to enter a city.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other taxes====
*Customs duty
*Excise tax
*Salt tax
*Excise profit tax
*Trade tax
*Professional tax
*Income tax
*Gambling tax
*General property tax (Kara)&lt;ref&gt;Ghoshal, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;
*Construction tax (Vāstuka)
*Survey tax (Rajju)
*Police tax (Chorarajju)
*Tax on villages on the water (Klŗpta)
*General tax on villages (Piņdakara)
*Emergency tax (Praņaya)
*Celebration tax (Utsanga)
*War tax (Senābhakta)&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, p. 95-111&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Pastorius''' was a failed [[Nazi Germany|German]] intelligence plan for [[sabotage]] inside the [[United States]] during [[World War II]]. The operation was staged in June 1942 and was to be directed against strategic American economic targets. The operation was named by [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], chief of the German ''[[Abwehr]]'', for [[Francis Daniel Pastorius]], the leader of the first organized settlement of Germans in America.

==Background==
After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, followed by [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|Nazi Germany's declaration of war on the United States]] four days later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-declares-war-on-the-united-states|title=Germany declares war on the United States - Dec 11, 1941 - HISTORY.com|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|United States' declaration of war on Germany]] in response), [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] authorized a mission to sabotage the American war effort and to make [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]]s on civilian targets to [[Demoralization (warfare)|demoralize]] the American civilian population inside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow Enemies: Hitler's Secret Terrorist Plot Against the United States |author=Alex Abella, Scott Gordon |date=January 2003 |page=17 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=1-5857-4722-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was headed by Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], chief of the German ''Abwehr''. Canaris recalled that during [[World War I]], he organized the sabotage of French installations in Morocco, and entered the United States with other German agents to plant bombs in New York arms factories, including the [[Black Tom explosion|destruction of munitions supplies at Black Tom Island]], in 1916. He hoped that Operation Pastorius would have the same kind of success they had in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peculiar Liaisons in War, Espionage, and Terrorism of the Twentieth Century |author=John Craig |date=2 February 2004 |page=170 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=0-8758-6331-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agents==
Recruited for Operation Pastorius were eight German residents who had lived in the United States. Two of them, [[Ernst Burger]] and [[Herbert Hans Haupt|Herbert Haupt]], were American citizens. The others, [[George John Dasch]], Edward John Kerling, [[Richard Quirin]], Heinrich Harm Heinck, Hermann Otto Neubauer, and Werner Thiel, had worked at various jobs in the United States. All eight were recruited into the Abwehr [[military intelligence]] organization and were given three weeks of intensive sabotage training in the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] school on an estate at [[Quenzsee|Quenz Lake]], near [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The agents were instructed in the manufacture and use of [[Explosive material|explosives]], [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]], [[Blasting cap|primers]], and various forms of mechanical, chemical, and electrical delayed timing devices. Considerable time was spent developing complete background "histories" they were to use in the United States. They were encouraged to converse in English and to read American newspapers and magazines so no suspicion would be aroused if they were interrogated while in the United States.&lt;ref name="Foes"&gt;{{cite book |title=Insidious Foes: The Axis Fifth Column and the American Home Front |author=Francis MacDonnell |date=2 November 1995 |page=131 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-1950-9268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:US Coast Guard station, Amagansett, New York - 20070609 crop.jpg|left|thumb|287px|Amagansett Coast Guard station at Atlantic Avenue Beach in [[Amagansett, New York]]. The station was moved in 1966 to a private residence to protect it from demolition. In May 2007, the structure was moved back to near its original location.]]

Their mission was to stage sabotage attacks on American economic targets: [[hydroelectric plant]]s at [[Niagara Falls]]; the [[Alcoa|Aluminum Company of America]]'s plants in [[Illinois]], [[Tennessee]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[McAlpine Locks and Dam|locks]] on the [[Ohio River]] near [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; the [[Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)|Horseshoe Curve]], a crucial railroad pass near [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], as well as the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[Altoona Works|repair shops]] at Altoona;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainweb.org/horseshoecurve-nrhs/Guide.htm Horseshoe Curve, NRHS - Railfan's Guide to the Altoona Area](Requires Java 1.6 as of 1 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[cryolite]] plant in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]; [[Hell Gate Bridge]] in New York; and [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. The agents were also instructed to spread a wave of terror by planting explosives on [[bridge]]s, [[Train station|railroad station]]s, water facilities, and [[Public space|public places]]. They were given [[counterfeit]] [[birth certificate]]s, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] Cards, [[Conscription|draft]] deferment cards, nearly $175,000 in American money, and [[driver's license]]s, and put aboard two [[U-boat]]s to land on the east coast of the U.S.&lt;ref name="Foes" /&gt;

Before the mission began, it was in danger of being compromised, as George Dasch, head of the team, left sensitive documents behind on a train, and one of the agents when drunk announced to patrons at a bar in [[Paris]] that he was a secret agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dobbs |first= Michael |title= Saboteurs: The Nazi Raid on America |publisher= [[Alfred A.

On the night of June 12, 1942, the first submarine to arrive in the U.S., {{GS|U-202||2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/boats/u202.htm|title=The Type VIIC boat U-202 - German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; landed at [[Amagansett, New York]], which is about 100 miles east of [[New York City]], on [[Long Island]], at what today is Atlantic Avenue beach. It was carrying Dasch and three other saboteurs (Burger, Quirin, and Henck). The team came ashore wearing [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|German Navy uniform]]s so that if they were captured, they would be classified as [[prisoners of war]] rather than [[espionage|spies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/content/articles/2013/01/Kent_66_Vand_L_Rev_153.pdf Judicial Review for Enemy Fighters: The Court’s Fateful Turn in Ex parte Quirin, the Nazi Saboteur Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001757/http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/content/articles/2013/01/Kent_66_Vand_L_Rev_153.pdf |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gq-pOED4TSUC&amp;pg=PT98&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices |author=Noah Feldman |date=8 November 2010 |page=186 |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA]] |isbn=0-4465-8057-0 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also brought their explosives, primers and incendiaries, and buried them along with their uniforms, and put on civilian clothes to begin an expected two-year campaign in the sabotage of American defense-related production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/nazi/nazi.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation: George John Dasch and the Nazi Saboteurs], FBI Famous Cases&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dasch was discovered amidst the dunes by unarmed [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guardsman]] John C. Cullen, Dasch seized Cullen by the collar, threatened him, and stuffed $260 into Cullen's hand.&lt;ref&gt;
Elke Frenzel, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,716753,00.html Hitler's Unfulfilled Dream of a New York in Flames] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 16 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Cullen reported the encounter to his superiors after returning to his station. By the time an armed Coast Guard patrol returned to the site, the Germans, weary from their trans-Atlantic trip, were gone and had taken the [[Long Island Rail Road]] train from the [[Amagansett (LIRR station)|Amagansett station]] into [[Manhattan]], New York City, where they checked in and stayed at a hotel. The Coast Guard then discovered German equipment buried in the beach and reported it to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[FBI]]. A massive [[Manhunt (military)|manhunt]] for the German agents was conducted; however, they did not know where exactly the Germans were going.

The other four-member German team headed by Kerling landed without incident at [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida]], south of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] on June 16, 1942. They came on {{GS|U-584||2}}, another submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/boats/u584.htm|title=The Type VIIC boat U-584 - German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group came ashore wearing [[bathing suit]]s but wore German Navy hats. After landing ashore, they threw away their hats, put on civilian clothes, and started their mission by boarding trains to [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Battle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1372973/Revealed-The-secret-Nazi-operation-Pastorius-land-German-soldiers-U-S-soil-sabotage-war-effort-world-war-two.html |title=Hitler sent German U-boat carrying secret agents to terrorise New York during World War Two (but it got wedged off Long Island) |author=Kevin Dougherty |date=5 April 2011 |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two teams were to meet on July 4th in a hotel in Cincinnati to coordinate their sabotage operations.&lt;ref&gt;Page 130, The Florida Historical Quarterly, Volume 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission betrayed==
Dasch called Burger into their upper-story hotel room and opened a window, saying they would talk, and if they disagreed, "only one of us will walk out that door—the other will fly out this window." Dasch told him he had no intention of going through with the mission, hated [[Naziism]], and planned to report the plot to the FBI. Burger agreed to defect to the United States immediately.&lt;ref name="McCann2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph T. McCann|title=Terrorism on American Soil: A Concise History of Plots and Perpetrators from the Famous to the Forgotten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2p6mqd7xRMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2006|publisher=Sentient Publications|isbn=978-1-59181-049-0|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobbs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Dobbs|title=Saboteurs: The Nazi Raid on America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWOKF8-fZtAC&amp;pg=PA119|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-42755-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15th, Dasch phoned the New York office of the FBI from a [[Payphone|pay-telephone]] on Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]] explaining who he was and asked to convey the information to [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. When the FBI agent was trying to figure out if he was talking to a [[Crank (person)|crackpot]], Dasch hung up. Four days later, he took a train to [[Washington, D.C.]] and checked in at the [[Mayflower Hotel]]. Dasch walked into FBI headquarters, asked to speak with Director Hoover. He eventually spoke to Assistant Director D.M. Ladd.&lt;ref name="Dobbs2007"/&gt; He finally convinced the FBI by dumping his mission's entire budget of $84,000 on the desk of Assistant Director D. M. Ladd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Helluva Town: The Story of New York City During World War II |author=Richard Goldstein |date=13 April 2010 |page=40 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=1-4165-8996-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, he was taken seriously and interrogated for hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=949 Damn Interesting » Operation Pastorius]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Burger, none of the other German agents knew they were betrayed. Over the next two weeks, Burger and the other six were arrested.  FBI Chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] made no mention that Dasch had turned himself in, and claimed credit for the FBI for cracking the spy ring.&lt;ref name="wapomonument" /&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Fearful that a civilian court would be too lenient, President Roosevelt issued Executive Proclamation 2561 on 2 July 1942 creating a [[military tribunal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16281|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: Proclamation 2561—Denying Certain Enemies Access to the Courts|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prosecute the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-07-12/story/agents-picked-ponte-vedra-landing-point-1942 |title=A Look Back: Nazi agents picked Ponte Vedra as landing point in 1942 |author=Jessie-Lynne Kerr |date=12 July 2010 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed before a seven-member military commission, the Germans were charged with the following offenses:

:* 1) Violating the [[law of war]];
:* 2) Violating Article 81 of the [[Articles of War#United States of America|Articles of War]], defining the offense of corresponding with or giving intelligence to the enemy;
:* 3) Violating Article 82 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of spying; and
:* 4) Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in the first three charges.

The trial was held in Assembly Hall #1 on the fifth floor of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in Washington D.C. on 8 July 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage |author=Joseph E. Persico |page=204 | publisher=[[Random House]]| date=22 October 2002 | isbn=0-3757-6126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for the accused, who included [[Lauson Stone]] and [[Kenneth Royall]], attempted to have the case tried in a civilian court but were rebuffed by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'', 317 U.S. 1 (1942), a case that was later cited as a precedent for the trial by military commission of any [[unlawful combatant]] against the United States.

The trial for the eight defendants ended on 1 August 1942. Two days later, all were found guilty and sentenced to death. Roosevelt commuted Burger's sentence to life in prison and Dasch's to 30 years because they had turned themselves in and provided information about the others. The others were executed on  8 August 1942 in the [[electric chair]] on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail and buried in a [[potter's field]] in the [[Blue Plains (Washington, D.C.)|Blue Plains]] neighborhood in the [[Anacostia]] area of Washington.

==Aftermath==
The failure of Operation Pastorius led Hitler to rebuke Admiral Canaris and no sabotage attempt was ever made again in the United States. During the remaining years of the war, the Germans only once more dispatched agents to the United States by submarine. In November 1944, as part of [[Operation Elster]] a German submarine, [[German submarine U-1230|U-1230]], dropped two [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]] spies off the coast of [[Maine]] to gather intelligence on American manufacturing and technical progress. The FBI captured both men shortly after.&lt;ref name="Miller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Miller|title=A True Story of An American Nazi Spy: William Curtis Colepaugh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndSkplZUUh8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22There+is+not+one+word+of+reference+to+sabotaging+the+atom+bomb%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifjZb-wJrVAhWDgj4KHXZ9CXcQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22There%20is%20not%20one%20word%20of%20reference%20to%20sabotaging%20the%20atom%20bomb%22&amp;f=false|date=27 February 2013|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-8219-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agents benefited from the calmer state of public nerves in the later years of the war and received prison sentences rather than execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Insidious Foes: The Axis Fifth Column and the American Home Front |author=Francis MacDonnell |date=2 November 1995 |page=133 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-1950-9268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] granted executive clemency to Dasch and Burger on the condition that they be deported to the [[American Zone of Occupation#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of occupied Germany]]. They were not welcomed back in Germany, as they were regarded as traitors who had caused the death of their comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shoot or hang themselves? |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7859070.html|newspaper=Der Spiegel|number=15|language=German|date=6 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had been promised pardons by Hoover in exchange for their cooperation, both men died without ever receiving them. Dasch died in 1992 at the age of 89 in [[Ludwigshafen]], [[Germany]]. Burger died in 1975.

Sometime in the 1960s or 1970s, the [[National Socialist White People's Party]] placed an unauthorized monument to the executed spies in a thicket in southwest Washington, D.C. on National Park Service land. It went largely unknown and ignored for several decades; the Park Service removed the monument in 2010.&lt;ref name="wapomonument"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cox |first=John Woodrow |date=June 23, 2017 |title=Six Nazi spies were executed in D.C.

'''Radio Singapore International''' ([[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''RSI'''; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 新加坡国际广播电台 [[Pinyin]]: Xīnjiāpō Guójì Guǎngbō Diàntái; {{lang-ms|Radio Internasional Singapura}}) was the official [[international broadcasting]] station of [[Singapore]] and the largest radio international broadcasting company in Singapore existing from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2001. The predecessor of '''[[MediaCorp Radio]]''' successor of the radio broadcasting arm of the '''[[Singapore Broadcasting Corporation]]''' ('''SBC''') was privatised on 1 January 1994 at 00:00 am ([[UTC+8]]) in conjunction with New Year's Day 1994 at midnight into three individual companies, one of which was TCS and RCS. RCS subsequently went through a group restructure under the '''[[MediaCorp|SIM Group of Companies]]''' based parent by '''[[MediaCorp|Singapore International Media]]''' ('''SIM''') on 1 January 2002 and became '''MediaCorp Radio'''.

'''Radio Singapore International''' ('''RSI''') was a [[shortwave radio]] station that broadcast out of Singapore. The station which was run by ''''[[Radio Corporation of Singapore]]''' ('''RCS''') now '''MediaCorp Radio''' broadcast in [[English language|English]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

The English service operated on shortwave between 1100hrs - 1400hrs UTC daily on 6080&amp;nbsp;kHz and 6150&amp;nbsp;kHz (49m Band). A "'''Live'''" audio stream was also available on its website. Its signal was carried "'''Live'''" for an hour daily on Singapore's main English news station '''[[938LIVE]]''' (FM 93.8&amp;nbsp;MHz).

RSI's news and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programming cover [[finance|financial]], [[economics|economic]], and [[politics|political]] developments around the world, but primarily around [[Southeast Asia]].

RSI's lifestyle programmes cover a variety of areas, from [[culture]] and [[travel]] to the [[Internet]] and [[technology]]. Music played on the station ranges from classic and oldies, to contemporary and easy listening.

Sakuntala Gupta was Senior Programme Director of RSI (English).

A '''rokosz''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈrɔkɔʂ}}) originally was a [[Meeting|gathering]] of all the [[Poland|Polish]] ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility), not merely of deputies, for a ''[[sejm]]''.  The term was introduced to the [[Polish language]] from [[Hungary]], where analogous gatherings took place at a field called Rákos. With time, "rokosz" came to signify an armed, semi-legal, rebellion by the szlachta of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] against the king, in the name of defending threatened liberties.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The nobles who gathered for a ''rokosz'' formed a "[[confederation (Poland)|confederation]]".&lt;ref name=bardach&gt;Juliusz Bardach, Boguslaw Lesnodorski, and Michal Pietrzak, ''Historia panstwa i prawa polskiego'' (Warsaw: Paristwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1987, p.225-226&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of the rokosz, in the later sense, derived from the [[medieval]] right to resist royal power. The rokosz took its authority from the right to refuse obedience to the king, as stipulated in the [[Privilege of Mielnik]] (''przywilej mielnicki'', signed October 23, 1501) and later in the [[Henrician Articles]] of 1573.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Two of the best-known rokoszes are the 17th-century [[Zebrzydowski Rebellion]] and the 16th-century [[Chicken War]].

'''Saint Peter's Battery''' ({{lang-mt|Batterija ta' San Pietru}}) was an [[artillery battery]] in [[Kalkara]], [[Malta]], built by Maltese insurgents during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|French blockade]] of 1798–1800. It was part of [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments]] encircling the French positions in [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]].

The battery was located about 300m to the rear of [[Capuchin Convent Battery]], and was probably manned by militia from [[Żejtun]]. It possibly had a vaulted underground chamber which served as a barracks. Other details about the battery or its armament are unknown.

Like the other French blockade fortifications, St. Peter's Battery was dismantled, possibly sometime after 1814. No traces of it can be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798–1800|journal=Arx – Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|page=29|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hBuv3cHQ?url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TAI was established in 2011 by Malte Humpert. Inspired by the 2006 documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth|An
Inconvenient Truth]], the writings of polar historian [[Charles Emmerson]], and polar scientist [[Alun Anderson]], Humpert created TAI in order to provide a platform for developing informed policy to respond to the rapid changes underway in the Arctic region.
In 2016, TAI was shortlisted by Prospect Magazine’s [[Think Tank]] Awards for best Energy and Environment Think Tank in the United States.&lt;ref name="Prospect"/&gt;  In 2015 and 2016, TAI was ranked 61 of 1,835 in Top Think Tanks in the United States by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Global Go To Think Tank Index Report.&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt;

== Activities ==
TAI is involved in 10 areas of Arctic policy research:
* [[Natural resources of the Arctic|Business and Economics]]

The '''United States Antarctic Program''' (or '''USAP'''; formerly known as the '''United States Antarctic Research Program''' or '''USARP''' and the '''United States Antarctic Service''' or '''USAS''') is an organization of the [[United States]] government which has presence in the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]]. Founded in 1959, the USAP manages all U.S. scientific research and related logistics in Antarctica as well as aboard ships in the [[Southern Ocean]].

The body's goals are:&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;&lt;ref name="program"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf08535/nsf08535.htm|title=Antarctic Research nsf08535|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...to understand the Antarctic and its associated [[ecosystems]]; to understand the region's effects on, and responses to, global processes such as climate; and to use Antarctica's unique features for scientific research that cannot be done as well elsewhere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Programs and services==
[[File:UnitedStatesAntarcticProgramChristchurch01 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]] servicing the United States Antarctic Program at Christchurch International Airport, Christchurch, New Zealand.]]
The U.S. Antarctic Program, funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Office of Polar Programs, supports only research that can be done exclusively in Antarctica or that can be done best from Antarctica.&lt;ref name="program"/&gt; The scientific disciplines encompassed by the USAP are astronomy, atmospheric sciences, biology, earth science, environmental science, geology, glaciology, marine biology, oceanography, and geophysics.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt; Currently, the USAP maintains three year-round research stations in Antarctica, the [[McMurdo Station]], the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]], and the [[Palmer Station]]. In addition, the USAP operates several summer research camps and several research vessels that sail in the Antarctic waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/usap.jsp|title=United States Antarctic Program|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vrio''' (formerly '''DirecTV Latin America''') is an [[U.S.|American]] operator of a subscription television service in Latin America and is a subsidiary of [[AT&amp;T International|AT&amp;T Latin America]]. It produces TV content, and owns several TV channels. It is one of Latin America's most popular [[pay TV]] services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/09/20/directvs-latin-america-pay-tv-is-booming/#497e8cbf4320|title=

==History==
[[File:DirecTV Satellite Antenna.jpg|left|thumb|DirecTV SF6 2-LNB "Round" [[satellite dish]] only in [[Latin America]]]]
[[SKY México|SKY Mexico]] was founded on 25 July 1996, a joint venture between [[British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB), [[News Corporation]], [[Liberty Media]] and [[Televisa|Grupo Televisa]] and was later launched on 15 December 1996. By May 2000, the company had extended throughout the rest of [[Latin America]], launching in [[Central America]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]] but during Argentina's [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|economic crisis]], on 10 July 2002, with over 52,000 subscribers, Sky Argentina ceased all operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnamericas.com/news/telecomunicaciones/Sky_Argentina_cesa_operaciones_el_10_de_julio Sky Argentina cesa operaciones el 10 de julio]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the course of the decade, most Sky operations in Latin America were rebranded to [[DIRECTV]], with the exception of the Mexican and Brazilian operations, that in 2005 absorbed the DirecTV keeping the Sky name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediosenmexico.blogspot.com/2007/09/octubre-de-2004-directv-se-va-de-mxico.html DirectTV se va de México]&lt;/ref&gt;

==DirecTV Chile==
The Chilean subsidiary of Vrio, which is a television system broadcast through satellite, which has operated in the country since 1994. DIRECTV bought SKY Chile and renamed it DIRECTV. It signed an agreement with GTD Manquehue to offer full telephone, television, and internet services throughout the country.

* During the second quarter of 2011, the company was positioned as the second fastest growing pay TV company in Chile, registering 23.8% of the total market.
* In 2012, the company led the pay TV market with an 18.7% market share.
* Between 2012 and 2015, DIRECTV Chile received the "Consumer Loyalty" award NPS.
* Between December 2012 and March 2013, the company was consolidated as the first paid television company that has grown the most in the country.
* Between 2011 and 2016, DIRECTV Chile received the National Customer Satisfaction Award ProCalidad as the best pay TV service.

In 2012, it made an agreement with Club Deportivo Universidad Católica to carry the brand name DirecTV on their jerseys. In 2015, it made an agreement with Colo-Colo to also carry the DIRECTV logo.

==Illegal placement of advertisement==
On January 19, 2016, the Secretary of Environment of [[Bogotá]], sanctioned DIRECTV Colombian subsidiary, Directv Colombia Ltda., with a sum of [[Colombian peso|$]]118&amp;nbsp;million for placing advertisement without the proper permission from the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/sancion-a-directv-por-publicidad-exterior-ilegal/16485402?ts=42 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The company violated Decree 959, of the year 2000, that regulates where companies can place public publicity.

==Aborted public offering and Name change==
On September 15, 2017, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources, that AT&amp;T, the owner of DIRECTV's U.S. and Latin American divisions, had hired an advisor to consider offering DIRECTV Latin America on the public stock market. The principal motive was cited as the need to reduce the debt load AT&amp;T would assume if it took over Time Warner as planned. Since that date, the U.S. Dept. of Justice filed suit to block that acquisition on antitrust grounds, a trial is scheduled to start on March 19, 2018 before Judge Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and a decision is not expected before June–July. However, even if the deal is blocked, AT&amp;T might dispose of the division as not core to its business.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-m-a-latamdivestiture-exclusive/exclusive-att-weighs-divestiture-of-latin-american-tv-assets-sources-idUSKCN1BR008&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2018, the IPO was cancelled.

DirecTV Latin America have been renamed '''Vrio''' as of 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://about.att.com/pages/company_profile_latin_america&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Trade Organization''' ('''WTO''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] that regulates [[international trade]]. The WTO officially commenced on 1 January 1995 under the [[Marrakesh Agreement]], signed by 124 nations on 15 April 1994, replacing the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which commenced in 1948. It is the largest international economic organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter00/krueger.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm World Trade Organization – UNDERSTANDING THE WTO: BASICS]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The WTO deals with regulation of trade in goods, services and intellectual property between participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating [[trade agreement]]s and a [[dispute resolution]] process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence to WTO agreements, which are signed by representatives of member governments&lt;ref name="underst"&gt;''[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/understanding_e.pdf Understanding the WTO]'' Handbook at WTO official website.

Studies show that the WTO boosted trade,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and that barriers to trade would be higher in the absence of the WTO.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The WTO has highly influenced the text of trade agreements, as "nearly all recent [preferential trade agreements (PTAs)] reference the WTO explicitly, often dozens of times across multiple chapters... in many of these same PTAs we find that substantial portions of treaty language—sometime the majority of a chapter—is copied verbatim from a WTO agreement."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was established{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} in 1947 after [[World War II]] in the wake of other new multilateral institutions dedicated to international economic cooperation – such as the [[World Bank]] (founded 1944) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (founded 1944 or 1945). A comparable international institution for trade, named the [[International Trade Organization]] never started as the [[United States|U.S]]. and other signatories did not ratify the establishment treaty,&lt;ref&gt;P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmeter-Mavroidis, ''Dispute Settlement'', 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRS-2007-pg 4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/98-928.pdf |title= The World Trade Organization: Background and Issues |last= Fergusson |first= Ian F. |date= 9 May 2007 |publisher= [[Congressional Research Service]] |page= 4 |accessdate= 15 August 2008 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so GATT slowly became a ''de facto'' international organization.&lt;ref name="B81"&gt;It was contemplated that the GATT would apply for several years until the ITO came into force. However, since the ITO never materialized, the GATT gradually became the focus for international governmental cooperation on trade matters, with economist Nicholas Halford overseeing the implementation of GATT in members' policies. (P. van den Bossche, ''The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization'', 81; J.H. Jackson, ''Managing the Trading System'', 134).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===GATT Negotiations before Uruguay===
{{See also|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade}}
 
Seven rounds of negotiations occurred 
under [[GATT]]. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing [[tariff]]s. Then the [[Kennedy Round]] in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT [[Dumping (pricing policy)| anti-dumping]] Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies represented the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]], which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because not all GATT members accepted these [[plurilateral agreement]]s, they were often informally called "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.&lt;ref name="GY"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm The GATT Years: from Havana to Marrakesh], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to establish some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.&lt;ref name="F17"&gt;Footer, M. E. ''Analysis of the World Trade Organization'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay Round: 1986-1994 ===
{{main article|Uruguay Round}}
[[File:Bush Lula133635.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Doha Development Round |Doha Round]], the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] blamed [[Brazil]] and [[India]] for being inflexible and the [[European Union|EU]] for impeding agricultural imports.&lt;ref&gt;B.S.

Well before GATT's 40th anniversary, its members concluded that the GATT system was straining to adapt to a new [[globalization |globalizing]] world economy.&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;P. Gallagher, ''The First Ten Years of the WTO'', 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UR"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm The Uruguay Round], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries' policies on world trade GATT could not manage etc.), the eighth GATT round – known as the Uruguay Round – was launched in September 1986, in [[Punta del Este]], Uruguay.&lt;ref name="G4" /&gt;
 
It was the biggest negotiating mandate on trade ever agreed: the talks aimed to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review.&lt;ref name="UR"/&gt; The Final Act concluding the [[Uruguay]] Round and officially establishing the WTO regime was signed 15 April 1994, during the ministerial meeting at [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], and hence is known as the [[Marrakesh Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto_e.htm|title= Legal texts – Marrakesh agreement| publisher= WTO|date= |accessdate= 30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The GATT still exists as the WTO's umbrella treaty for trade in goods, updated as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations (a distinction is made between ''GATT 1994'', the updated parts of GATT, and ''GATT 1947'', the original agreement which is still the heart of GATT 1994).&lt;ref name="G4" /&gt; GATT 1994 is not however the only legally binding agreement included via the Final Act at Marrakesh; a long list of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions and understandings was adopted. The agreements fall into six main parts:

* the Agreement Establishing the WTO
* the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods&lt;ref&gt;including the GATT 1994 and the [[Trade Related Investment Measures]] (TRIMS)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]]
* the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]
* dispute settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/scujil/vol2/iss1/2/|title= "Resolving Trade Disputes, the Mechanisms of GATT/WTO Dispute Resolution" by Daniel H. Erskine|website= digitalcommons.law.scu.edu|access-date= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the WTO's [[WTO#Principles of the trading system| principle relating to tariff "ceiling-binding" (No. 3)]], the Uruguay Round has been successful in increasing binding commitments by both developed and developing countries, as may be seen in the percentages of tariffs bound before and after the 1986–1994 talks.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;

===Ministerial conferences===
[[File:Geneva Ministerial Conference 18-20 May 1998 (9305956531).jpg|thumb|The [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1998]], in the [[Palace of Nations]] ([[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]).]]
 
The highest decision-making body of the WTO, the [[Ministerial Conference]], usually meets every two years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/minist_e/min11_e/min11_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It brings together all members of the WTO, all of which are countries or customs unions. The Ministerial Conference can take decisions on all matters under any of the multilateral trade agreements. Some meetings, such as the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1996|inaugural ministerial conference]] in Singapore and the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2003|Cancun conference]] in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn= 916768|title= Five Years of China WTO Membership. EU and US Perspectives about China's Compliance with Transparency Commitments and the Transitional Review Mechanism|publisher= Papers.ssrn.com|date= |accessdate= 30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved arguments between developed and developing economies referred to as the "[[Singapore issues]]" such as [[agricultural subsidies]]; while others such as the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999|Seattle conference]] in 1999 provoked large demonstrations. The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2001| fourth ministerial conference]] in [[Doha]] in 2001 approved China's entry to the WTO and launched the [[Doha Development Round]] which was supplemented by the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005| sixth WTO ministerial conference]] (in [[Hong Kong]]) which agreed to phase out agricultural export subsidies and to adopt the [[European Union]]'s [[Everything but Arms]] initiative to phase out tariffs for goods from the Least Developed Countries.

The Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) is set to be held in Astana, Kazakhstan, in 2020. The decision was taken by consensus at the General Council meeting on 26 July 2018 and marks the first time a Ministerial Conference is to be organized in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kazakhstan to host WTO’s next Ministerial Conference |url=https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news18_e/minis_26jul18_e.htm |website=www.wto.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doha Round (Doha Agenda): 2001- ===
{{Main article|Doha Development Round}}

The WTO launched the current round of negotiations, the [[Doha Development Round]], at the fourth ministerial conference in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] in November 2001. This was to be an ambitious effort to make globalization more inclusive and help the world's poor, particularly by slashing barriers and subsidies in farming.&lt;ref name="Ec65"&gt;{{Cite journal |date= 27 July 2006|work= [[The Economist]]|title= In the twilight of Doha|page= 65|url= http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7218551|publisher= The Economist|postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial agenda comprised both further [[trade liberalization]] and new rule-making, underpinned by commitments to strengthen substantial assistance to developing countries.&lt;ref name=ECdoha&gt;European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/eu-and-wto/doha/index_en.htm The Doha Round]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Among the various functions of the WTO, these are regarded by analysts as the most important:
* It oversees the implementation, administration and operation of the covered agreements.&lt;ref name="iisd-functions"&gt;[http://www.iisd.org/trade/handbook/3_2.htm Functions of the WTO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183405/http://www.iisd.org/trade/handbook/3_2.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, IISD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WTOmain-functions"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/eol/e/wto01/wto1_11.htm Main Functions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230121730/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/eol/e/wto01/wto1_11.htm |date=30 December 2006 }}, WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt;
* It provides a forum for negotiations and for settling disputes.&lt;ref name="B17"&gt;A Bredimas, ''International Economic Law'', II, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere_decision-making"&gt;C. Deere, [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YZ7ZWccshjkJ:www.wto.org/english/forums_e/public_forum_e/ Decision-making in the WTO: Medieval or Up-to-Date?]&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, it is WTO's duty to review and propagate the national trade policies, and to ensure the coherence and transparency of trade policies through surveillance in global economic policy-making.&lt;ref name="WTOmain-functions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere_decision-making"/&gt; Another priority of the WTO is the assistance of [[developing countries|developing]], least-developed and low-income countries in transition to adjust to WTO rules and disciplines through technical cooperation and training.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;[http://www.wto.int/english/tratop_e/devel_e/teccop_e/tct_e.htm WTO Assistance for Developing Countries], WTO official site {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612192912/http://www.wto.int/english/tratop_e/devel_e/teccop_e/tct_e.htm |date=12 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The WTO shall facilitate the implementation, administration and operation and further the objectives of this Agreement and of the Multilateral Trade Agreements, and shall also provide the framework for the implementation, administration and operation of the multilateral Trade Agreements.
# The WTO shall provide the forum for negotiations among its members concerning their multilateral trade relations in matters dealt with under the Agreement in the Annexes to this Agreement.
# The WTO shall administer the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.
# The WTO shall administer Trade Policy Review Mechanism.
# With a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policy making, the WTO shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the international Monetary Fund (IMF) and with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and its affiliated agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, Aparijita. [http://www.preservearticles.com/201012291900/functions-and-objectives-of-wto.html]. "What are the functions and objectives of the WTO?". Retrieved on 13 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above five listings are the additional functions of the World Trade Organization. As globalization proceeds in today's society, the necessity of an [[International Organization]] to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. The World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today's globalized society.
 
The WTO is also a centre of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/reser_e.htm Economic research and analysis], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF and the World Bank.&lt;ref name="B17"/&gt;

==Principles of the trading system==
The WTO establishes a framework for trade policies; it does not define or specify outcomes. That is, it is concerned with setting the rules of the trade policy games.&lt;ref name="H42"&gt;B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; Five principles are of particular importance in understanding both the pre-1994 GATT and the WTO:
# '''Non-discrimination'''. It has two major components: the [[most favoured nation]] (MFN) rule, and the [[national treatment]] policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO member has to grant the most favourable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members.&lt;ref name="H42"/&gt; "Grant someone a special favour and you have to do the same for all other WTO members."&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm#seebox Principles of the Trading System], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favourably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).&lt;ref name="H42"/&gt;
# '''Reciprocity'''. It reflects both a desire to limit the scope of [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] that may arise because of the MFN rule, and a desire to obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from [[unilateralism|unilateral]] liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialise.&lt;ref name="H43"&gt;B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Binding and enforceable commitments'''. The tariff commitments made by WTO members in a multilateral trade negotiation and on accession are enumerated in a schedule (list) of concessions. These schedules establish "ceiling bindings": a country can change its bindings, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, which could mean compensating them for loss of trade. If satisfaction is not obtained, the complaining country may invoke the WTO dispute settlement procedures.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H43"/&gt;
# '''Transparency'''. The WTO members are required to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM).&lt;ref name="H44"&gt;B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 44&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of [[Import quota|quotas]] and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;
# '''Safety values'''. In specific circumstances, governments are able to [[Trade restriction|restrict trade]]. The WTO's agreements permit members to take measures to protect not only the environment but also public health, animal health and plant health.&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;[http://wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_stand_for_e.htm Understanding the WTO: What we stand for]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three types of provision in this direction:
# articles allowing for the use of trade measures to attain non-economic objectives;
# articles aimed at ensuring "fair competition"; members must not use environmental protection measures as a means of disguising protectionist policies.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Paolo Davide and Cima, Elena, World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development? (1 December 2015). Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR), Vol. 27, No. 1, 2015. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2704398
&lt;/ref&gt;
# provisions permitting intervention in trade for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="H44"/&gt;
 
Exceptions to the MFN principle also allow for preferential treatment of [[Developing country|developing countries]], regional [[free trade area]]s and [[customs union]]s.&lt;ref name=underst/&gt;{{rp|fol.93}}
 
==Organizational structure==
The General Council has the following subsidiary bodies which oversee committees in different areas:
 
;Council for Trade in Goods: There are 11 committees under the jurisdiction of the Goods Council each with a specific task. All members of the WTO participate in the committees. The Textiles Monitoring Body is separate from the other committees but still under the jurisdiction of Goods Council. The body has its own chairman and only 10 members. The body also has several groups relating to textiles.&lt;ref name="WTO subsidiary bodies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org1_e.htm#fourth|title=Fourth level: down to the nitty-gritty|publisher= WTO official site|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
;Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights: Information on intellectual property in the WTO, news and official records of the activities of the TRIPS Council, and details of the WTO's work with other international organizations in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel2_e.htm|title=Intellectual property – overview of TRIPS Agreement|publisher=Wto.org|date=15 April 1994|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
;Council for Trade in Services: The Council for Trade in Services operates under the guidance of the General Council and is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). It is open to all WTO members, and can create subsidiary bodies as required.&lt;ref name="WTO-Services council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/s_coun_e.htm|title=The Services Council, its Committees and other subsidiary bodies|publisher= WTO official site|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
;Trade Negotiations Committee: The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) is the committee that deals with the current trade talks round. The chair is WTO's director-general. {{As of|2012|06}} the committee was tasked with the [[Doha Development Round]].&lt;ref name="WTO-TNC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dda_e/tnc_e.htm|title=The Trade Negotiations Committee|publisher=WTO official site|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Service Council has three subsidiary bodies: financial services, domestic regulations, GATS rules and specific commitments.&lt;ref name="WTO subsidiary bodies"/&gt; The council has several different committees, working groups, and working parties.&lt;ref name="WTO-chart"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org2_e.htm|title=WTO organization chart| publisher=WTO official site|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are committees on the following: Trade and Environment; Trade and Development (Subcommittee on [[Least developed country|Least-Developed Countries]]); [[Regional Trade Agreement]]s; Balance of Payments Restrictions; and Budget, Finance and Administration. There are working parties on the following: Accession. There are working groups on the following: Trade, debt and finance; and Trade and technology transfer.
 
==Decision-making==
The WTO describes itself as "a rules-based, member-driven organization—all decisions are made by the member governments, and the rules are the outcome of negotiations among members".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/thewto_e.htm#decision_making Decision-making] at WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO Agreement foresees votes where consensus cannot be reached, but the practice of consensus dominates the process of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jiel.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/51.short Decision-Making in the World Trade Organization] Abstract from ''Journal of International Economic Law'' at Oxford Journals&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Richard Harold Steinberg]] (2002) argues that although the WTO's consensus governance model provides law-based initial bargaining, trading rounds close through power-based bargaining favouring Europe and the U.S., and may not lead to [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Richard H. "In the Shadow of Law or Power? Consensus-based Bargaining and Outcomes in the GATT/WTO." ''International Organization.'' Spring 2002. pp. 339–74.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Dispute settlement==
{{Main article|Dispute settlement in the WTO}}
The WTO's dispute-settlement system "is the result of the evolution of rules, procedures and practices developed over almost half a century under the GATT 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c1s2p1_e.htm |title=1.2 The Dispute Settlement Understanding|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the WTO members agreed on the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) annexed to the "Final Act" signed in Marrakesh in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Dawyer, ''The WTO Dispute Settlement System'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; Dispute settlement is regarded by the WTO as the central pillar of the multilateral trading system, and as a "unique contribution to the stability of the global economy".&lt;ref&gt;S. Panitchpakdi, ''The WTO at ten'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; WTO members have agreed that, if they believe fellow-members are violating trade rules, they will use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking action unilaterally.&lt;ref name="UnSD"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm Settling Disputes:a Unique Contribution], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The operation of the WTO dispute settlement process involves case-specific panels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s3p1_e.htm |title=3.3 Panels|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s1p1_e.htm |title=3.1 The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Appellate Body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s4p1_e.htm |title=3.4 Appellate Body|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director-General and the WTO Secretariat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s2p1_e.htm |title=3.2 The Director-General and the WTO Secretariat|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; arbitrators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s5p1_e.htm |title=3.5 arbitrators|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advisory experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s6p1_e.htm |title=3.6 Experts|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The priority is to settle disputes, preferably through a mutually agreed solution, and provision has been made for the process to be conducted in an efficient and timely manner so that "If a case is adjudicated, it should normally take no more than one year for a panel ruling and no more than 16 months if the case is appealed... If the complainant deems the case urgent, consideration of the case should take even less time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c1s3p3_e.htm |title="Mutually Agreed Solutions" as "Preferred Solution"|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; WTO member nations are obliged to accept the process as exclusive and compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c1s3p3_e.htm |title=1.3 Functions, objectives and key features of the dispute settlement system|publisher=WTO official website |date=2005 |accessdate=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to a 2018 study in the ''Journal of Politics'', states are less likely and slower to enforce WTO violations when the violations affect states in a diffuse manner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johns|first=Leslie|last2=Pelc|first2=Krzysztof J.|date=2018-04-25|title=Free Riding on Enforcement in the World Trade Organization|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/697463|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/697463|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because states face collective action problems with pursuing litigation: they all expect other states to carry the costs of litigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2016 study in ''International Studies Quarterly'' challenges that the WTO dispute settlement system leads to greater increases in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaudoin|first=Stephen|last2=Kucik|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Pelc|first3=Krzysztof|date=2016-04-15|title=Do WTO Disputes Actually Increase Trade?|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/60/2/294/1753910?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=60|issue=2|pages=294–306|doi=10.1093/isq/sqw009|issn=0020-8833}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, the dispute settlement system cannot be used to resolve trade disputes that arise from political disagreements. When Qatar requested the establishment of a dispute panel concerning measures imposed by the UAE, other GCC countries and the US were quick to dismiss its request as a political matter, stating that national security issues were political and not appropriate for the WTO dispute system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ameinfo.com/money/economy/the-first-middle-east-victims-are-oil-exporters/|title=A US-less WTO: The first Middle East victims are oil exporters|website=ameinfo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Accession and membership==
{{Main article|World Trade Organization accession and membership}}
 
The process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country's stage of economic development and current trade regime.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/accessions.html Accessions Summary], Center for International Development&lt;/ref&gt; The process takes about five years, on average, but it can last longer if the country is less than fully committed to the process or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]], while the longest was that of Russia, which, having first applied to join GATT in 1993, was approved for membership in December 2011 and became a WTO member on 22 August 2012.&lt;ref name=rusmem&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news11_e/acc_rus_16dec11_e.htm Ministerial Conference approves Russia's WTO membership] WTO News Item, 16 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan also had a long accession negotiation process. The Working Party on the Accession of [[Kazakhstan]] was established in 1996 and was approved for membership in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_kazakhstan_e.htm|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second longest was that of Vanuatu, whose Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was established on 11 July 1995. After a final meeting of the Working Party in October 2001, Vanuatu requested more time to consider its accession terms. In 2008, it indicated its interest to resume and conclude its WTO accession. The Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was reconvened informally on 4 April 2011 to discuss Vanuatu's future WTO membership. The re-convened Working Party completed its mandate on 2 May 2011. The General Council formally approved the Accession Package of Vanuatu on 26 October 2011. On 24 August 2012, the WTO welcomed Vanuatu as its 157th member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_vanuatu_e.htm Accession status: Vanuatu]. WTO. Retrieved on 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; An offer of accession is only given once consensus is reached among interested parties.&lt;ref name="M64"&gt;C. Michalopoulos, ''WTO Accession'', 64&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2017 study argues that "political ties rather than issue-area functional gains determine who joins" and shows "how geopolitical alignment shapes the demand and supply sides of membership".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Christina L.|last2=Wilf|first2=Meredith|date=10 May 2017|title=Joining the Club: Accession to the GATT/WTO|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691058|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=964–978|volume=79|issue=3|doi=10.1086/691058|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "findings challenge the view that states first liberalize trade to join the GATT/WTO. Instead, democracy and foreign policy similarity encourage states to join."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
===Accession process===
[[File:WTO enlargement.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|WTO accession progress:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/status_e.htm|title=Summary Table of Ongoing Accessions|date=April 2014|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=World Trade Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{legend|#008000|Draft Working Party Report or Factual Summary adopted}} {{legend|#0000ff|Goods or Services offers submitted}} {{legend|#eeee00|Working party meetings}} {{legend|orange|Memorandum on Foreign Trade Regime submitted}} {{legend|#ff1111|Working party established}}]]
 
A country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council, and has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic policies that have a bearing on WTO agreements.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org3_e.htm#join Membership, Alliances and Bureaucracy], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; The application is submitted to the WTO in a [[memorandum]] which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;C. Michalopoulos, ''WTO Accession'', 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After all necessary background information has been acquired, the working party focuses on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. The working party determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation, and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;
 
The final phase of accession involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other working party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. The new member's commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, even though they are negotiated bilaterally.&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt;
 
When the bilateral talks conclude, the working party sends to the general council or ministerial conference an accession package, which includes a summary of all the working party meetings, the Protocol of Accession (a draft membership treaty), and lists ("schedules") of the member-to-be's commitments. Once the general council or ministerial conference approves of the terms of accession, the applicant's parliament must ratify the Protocol of Accession before it can become a member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/acces_e.htm How to Become a Member of the WTO], WTO official site&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries may have faced tougher and a much longer accession process due to challenges during negotiations with other WTO members, such as Vietnam, whose negotiations took more than 11 years before it became official member in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Napier | first1 = Nancy K. | last2 = Vuong | first2 = Quan Hoang | title = What we see, why we worry, why we hope: Vietnam going forward | publisher = Boise State University CCI Press | year = 2013 | location = Boise, ID | page =140 | isbn = 978-0985530587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Members and observers===
The WTO has 164 members and 23 observer governments.&lt;ref name="memberlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm|title=Members and Observers|publisher=World Trade Organization|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia became the 163rd member on 14 July 2016, and Afghanistan became the 164th member on 29 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/liberia-clears-last-hurdle-to-wto-accession|title=Liberia clears last hurdle to WTO accession {{!}} International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|website=www.ictsd.org|access-date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news16_e/acc_afg_29jun16_e.htm|title=Afghanistan to become 164th WTO member on 29 July 2016|access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to states, the European Union, and each EU country in its own right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/european_communities_e.htm|title=The European Union and the WTO|website=World Trade Organization|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a member. WTO members do not have to be fully independent states; they need only be a customs territory with full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations. Thus Hong Kong has been a member since 1995 (as "Hong Kong, China" since 1997) predating the People's Republic of China, which joined in 2001 after 15 years of negotiations. The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) acceded to the WTO in 2002 as "Separate Customs Territory of China: [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]" ([[Chinese Taipei]]) despite its [[Political status of Taiwan|disputed status]].&lt;ref name="J109"&gt;Jackson, J. H.

As of 2007, WTO member states represented 96.4% of global trade and 96.7% of global GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/cbt_course_e/c1s1p1_e.htm|title=Accession in perspective|accessdate=22 December 2013|publisher=World Trade Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], followed by [[Algeria]], are the economies with the largest GDP and trade outside the WTO, using 2005 data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/cbt_course_e/annex1_e.doc|title=Annex 1.

A number of international intergovernmental organizations have also been granted observer status to WTO bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/igo_obs_e.htm International intergovernmental organizations granted observer status to WTO bodies] at WTO official website&lt;/ref&gt; 12 [[UN member states]] have no official affiliation with the WTO {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}.

==Agreements==
The WTO oversees about 60 different agreements which have the status of international legal texts. Member countries must sign and ratify all WTO agreements on accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/legal_e.htm|title=Legal texts – the WTO agreements| publisher=WTO|date=|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion of some of the most important agreements follows. 

The [[Agreement on Agriculture]] came into effect with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. The AoA has three central concepts, or "pillars": domestic support, [[market access]] and [[export subsidies]]. 

The [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] was created to extend the multilateral trading system to [[tertiary sector of industry|service sector]], in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995. 

The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm Understanding the WTO - Intellectual property: protection and enforcement]. WTO. Retrieved on 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]]—also known as the SPS Agreement—was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of GATT, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on members' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases). 

The [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]] is an international [[treaty]] of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the end of 1994. The object ensures that technical negotiations and standards, as well as testing and certification procedures, do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/ursum_e.htm#dAgreement|title=A Summary of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round|publisher=Wto.org|date=|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation|Agreement on Customs Valuation]], formally known as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of GATT, prescribes methods of customs valuation that Members are to follow. Chiefly, it adopts the "transaction value" approach.
 
In December 2013, the biggest agreement within the WTO was signed and known as the [[Bali Package]].&lt;ref name="Global Trade Deal Reached"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/business-news/government-trade/global-trade-deal-reached-7303060?module=latest-articles | title=Global Trade Deal Reached | publisher=WWD | date=7 December 2013 | accessdate=8 December 2013 | author=Zarocostas, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office of director-general==
[[File:Cwr lake facade2.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the World Trade Organization in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].]]
The procedures for the appointment of the WTO director-general were published in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.wto.org/imrd/directdoc.asp?DDFDocuments/t/WT/L/509.doc |title=WT/L/509 |publisher=WTO |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are four deputy directors-general. {{As of|2018|06|13}}, under director-general Roberto Azevêdo, the four deputy directors-general are

According to a 2017 study in the ''Journal of International Economic Law'', "nearly all recent [preferential trade agreements (PTAs)] reference the WTO explicitly, often dozens of times across multiple chapters. Likewise, in many of these same PTAs we find that substantial portions of treaty language—sometime the majority of a chapter—is copied verbatim from a WTO agreement... the presence of the WTO in PTAs has increased over time."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allee|first=Todd|last2=Elsig|first2=Manfred|last3=Lugg|first3=Andrew|date=2017|title=The Ties between the World Trade Organization and Preferential Trade Agreements: A Textual Analysis|url=https://academic.oup.com/jiel/article-abstract/20/2/333/3876178/The-Ties-between-the-World-Trade-Organization-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–363|doi=10.1093/jiel/jgx009|issn=1369-3034|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
