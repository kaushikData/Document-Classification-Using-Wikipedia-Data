The music for the film was written by Adam Rubenstein and Scott [[CHOPS]] Jung, the pioneering Chinese-American hip-hop producer and member of [[Mountain Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2986300/|title=9-Man (2014)|date=27 April 2014|work=IMDb|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

The documentary follows several modern-day 9-man teams throughout one season framed by a historical portrait of [[Chinatown]] history and the game of 9-man. The first act of the film introduces the Boston Knights, Washington CYC (Chinese Youth Club), Toronto Connex and the Boston Freemasons as they begin the season preparing for competition with other teams. As the first act closes you are introduced to a character from New York Haiyan Townsmen, and east coast regional teams compete in the New York Mini tournament crowning an early season favorite. The second act of the film introduces the history of the game—traveling to Toisan ([[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]]), China—and its modern day rules, which include limiting participation by players who are not "100% Chinese." The sport and isolation of the game are revealed as direct descendant of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and racism faced by the community. The final act of the film unites the characters, teams and conflicts at the [[NACIVT]] championship tournament in Boston's Chinatown, setting up Olympian [[Kevin Wong]] as the player to beat. As teams fight for the title, they also bring to light the cultural belonging and loss of the modern Chinatown and 9-man community. The film concludes with a scene featuring the funeral of a beloved community member and another scene where 9-man leaders contemplate moving the tournament to a new city—with no Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;9-man.vhx.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Spoonful of Sherman''''' is a musical revue which premiered on January 6, 2014 at the [[St. James Theatre, London|St. James Theatre]] in London and which is currently poised for its first UK/Ireland tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cheesman, Neil|title=First Tour Dates Announced for A Spoonful of Sherman|url=https://www.londontheatre1.com/news/191663/first-tour-dates-announced-for-a-spoonful-of-sherman/|accessdate=5 January 2018|publisher=''London Theatre 1''|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally produced, written and emceed by [[Robert J. Sherman]], ''A Spoonful of Sherman'' first served as the UK book launch for Sherman's [[Robert B. Sherman|father]]'s (posthumously released) autobiography: ''[[Moose: Chapters From My Life]]'' for which Sherman was also the book's editor.  After each performance of that original run, Sherman participated in a book signing after the show.  The show was billed as "A Celebration of the Life, Times and Songs of [[Robert B. Sherman]]" and was received extremely well by the crowd and the critics alike.  The cast consisted of four rising [[West End theatre]] stars including Charlotte Wakefield, [[Emma Williams (actress)|Emma Williams]], [[Stuart Matthew Price]] and [[Greg Castiglioni]].  Musical Direction was provided by Colin Billing and the show was directed by [[Stewart Nicholls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk/events/a-spoonful-of-sherman/|title=St James Theatre - Events: A Spoonful of Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting was designed by the show's Stage Manager Andrew Holton. In the 2017 version of the show, focus of the show's narrative shifted to both [[Sherman Brothers]]' lives as well as to the life of their father, [[Al Sherman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcolina|first1=Cindy|title=BWW Interview: Robert J. Sherman Talks A SPOONFUL OF SHERMAN|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/BWW-Interview-A-Spoonful-of-Sherman-with-the-Shows-Creator-and-Narrator-Robert-J-Sherman-20170822|accessdate=September 8, 2017|publisher=''BroadwayWorld.com''|date=August 22, 2017|language=English|quote=In that 2014, earlier incarnation of the show, my dad was the protagonist, the focus of the story I was trying to tell. In 2017 though, I knew we needed to shift the focus so that it also incorporated my uncle and grandfather's stories too.  So the protagonist shifted. The new protagonist became "THE IDEA of The Sherman Brothers". It sounds like a peculiar sort of protagonist, I suppose - even to us "writer types".  But when you realise that it was very much my grandfather's mission to have his two sons collaborate on songs together, very much in his footsteps, then you understand that the "idea of The Sherman Brothers" has a life and a personality of its own.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The show was produced by [[MusicWorld (UK)]] in association with the [[St. James Theatre, London|St. James Theatre]], James Albrecht, Creative Director.  Joanne Benjamin and Clive Chenery of The Entertainment Business provided General Management.

===2014 Productions===
''A Spoonful of Sherman'' received outstanding notices, garnering four stars from Clive Davis of the [[London Times]]&lt;ref name=davis&gt;Davis, Clive.

Songs written by the younger Robert Sherman were also included in the show as well) but the focus of the evening was the music and lyrics of Robert B. Sherman and the [[Sherman Brothers]].  "In deciding what songs to select, particular emphasis was put on material that would propel the narrative of Robert B. Sherman's life story forward.  My narration would then fill in the gaps.  Of course almost all of the famous stuff made it in. ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]]'' , ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and "[[It's A Small World (After All)]]" were represented, but I'm particularly pleased that we were able to include some unexpected gems in the mix as well."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/groups/SHERMANBROTHERS/ Robert J.

===2017 Production===
''A Spoonful of Sherman'' returned to London, playing August 7 - 20, 2017 at "Live at Zédel". [[Helena Blackman]] and [[Daniel Boys]] starred alongside pianist/singer Christopher Hamilton. Narrating the show once again was [[Robert J. Sherman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanks-Farmer|first1=Caroline|title=A Spoonful of Sherman – Live at The Zedel until 20th August|url=https://www.carnstheatrepassion.com/review-spoonful-sherman/|website=Carns Theatre Passion|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brasseriezedel.com/live-at-zedel/a-spoonful-of-sherman|title=A Spoonful of Sherman|publisher=Live At Zedel (2017)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hewis|first1=Ben|title=Casting announced for A Spoonful of Sherman at Live at Zedel|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/casting-a-spoonful-of-sherman-live-at-zedel_43856.html|accessdate=25 July 2017|publisher=''What's On Stage''|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=News Desk|title=Cast Announced For A SPOONFUL OF SHERMAN Live at Zédel|url=http://www.westendwilma.com/news-spoonful-of-sherman-zedel/|accessdate=25 July 2017|publisher=''West End Wilma''|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the book for the two 2014 productions largely remained the same, in the 2017 version, Sherman modified his script, removing emphasis on his father, [[Robert B. Sherman]]'s life and making the story more about both [[Sherman Brothers]] (Robert and [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard]]) and their Tin Pan Alley era songwriter father, [[Al Sherman]].  New musical arrangements were provided by [[Rowland Lee (composer)|Rowland Lee]].  Robert J. Sherman explained that changes had to do with the evolution of the show's purpose for being.  In 2014 the show was designed merely to serve as a "happy memorial" to his recently deceased songwriter father, Robert B. Sherman.  But as the show grew, it began to take on a life of its own, the purpose, and therefore, the focus of the show needed to change as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=A Spoonful of Sherman Magic|url=http://www.sardinesmagazine.co.uk/atd/profiles/blog.php?blogID=1178&amp;castingID=77|accessdate=22 February 2018|publisher=''Sardines Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 UK/Ireland Tour===
On December 20, 2017, producers [[James Yeoburn]] of United Theatrical and Robert J. Sherman announced the launch of the first ''A Spoonful of Sherman'' UK/Ireland.  The tour premiered on February 14, 2018 at the EM Forester Theatre in [[Tonbridge, Kent]] with its press night held on March 27 in [[Greenwich Theatre|Greenwich]]. The tour was a radical departure from the previous three productions.  The evolution could be described as a morphing from a clever cabaret to a fully realized albeit minimalist, stage musical.  Cast members for the tour include [[Sophie-Louise Dann]], [[Mark Read (singer)|Mark Read]], Glen Facey, Jenna Innes and Ben Stock. Directing and choreographing is [[Stewart Nicholls]].  A new book was devised by Robert Sherman. Stage and costume design is by Gabriella Slade and new musical arrangements and musical supervision is by [[Rowland Lee (composer)|Rowland Lee]].

==Origin of the Name==
''A Spoonful of Sherman'' is derived from the title of the popular song "[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]" from the successful 1964 [[Walt Disney]] musical motion picture, ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.  The song was written by the [[Sherman Brothers]].

==Critical praise for ''A Spoonful of Sherman''==
*  Pete Shaw of '''[[Broadway Baby]]''' gave the show 5 stars ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ writing: "There’s a light bulb moment in A Spoonful Of Sherman when you realise its magic lies not within its high production values, exquisite lighting, fantastic set, immaculate choreography or supremely talented cast, but with the memories these songs ignite...Ultimately, A Spoonful Of Sherman is a feel-good musical journey executed with polished flair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Pete|title=A Spoonful Of Sherman|url=http://broadwaybaby.com/shows/a-spoonful-of-sherman/724174|website=BroadwayBaby.com|accessdate=30 March 2018|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Clive Davis of '''[[The London Times]]''' gave the show 4 Stars ★ ★ ★ ★, writing that it was: “A show that strings together one joyous hit after another, delivered by a first-rate quartet of singers.”&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;
* [[Mark Shenton]] of '''[[The Stage]]''' wrote, "There’s plenty to both surprise and delight here."&lt;ref name="shenton"/&gt;
*  '''UK Theatre Web''' gave the show 5 Stars ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ writing: “It really was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Riffs and mash-ups on Winnie The Pooh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Mary Poppins and a smashing Al Sherman Medley made the evening all too short, all too few songs, all the more memorable. I feel privileged to have been there. A truly scrumptious smorgasbord of smash hits by the Sherman Brothers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/news/A-Spoonful-of-Sherman/1556.html|author=Weston, Orlando|title=Robert J Sherman at the St James Theatre|date=January 14, 2014|work=uktw.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''North West End''' gave the show 5 stars ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ writing: "The Sherman Brothers might have said that a song must be Singable, Sellable and Sincere.

*  Jonathan Baz gave the show 4 Stars ★ ★ ★ ★ in 2014 writing: “It is a wonder that this charming show has not been staged before. Amidst all of Broadway’s giant songwriting partnerships, none reaches out to the child within us quite like the legacy of the Sherman Brothers. Cleverly crafted songs that speak of hope against adversity, written in verses that talk to every age.

*  Rhiannon Lawson of '''What's On Stage''' gave the show 4 Stars ★ ★ ★ ★ and wrote: "If you love a bit of nostaligia, enjoy flying a kite, singing with orangutans, feeding the birds or wondered what the wonderful thing about Tiggers is, you will have a Truly Scrumptious evening at A Spoonful of Sherman. Leaving the theatre with a spring in my step, I don't expect my sugar rush from this evening to be over for some time.&lt;ref name="Lawson, Rhiannon"/&gt;
* [[Phil Willmott]] of '''London Box Office''' gave the 2017 Zedel production 5 Stars ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ commenting: "Sherman himself has a charming and unassuming stage persona and when he's joined by the glossily accomplished trio of [[Helena Blackman]], [[Daniel Boys]], and singer/accompanist Christopher Hamilton the four have an enjoyably quirky chemistry on stage. Helena Blackman has a soaring gorgeous voice and is adept at conveying every nuance of a lyric. Aspiring musical theatre performers really should study her technique and Daniel Boys combines a rich and sumptuous vocal range with a delightful playfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willmott|first1=Phil|title=Review: A SPOONFUL OF SHERMAN at Zédel Brasserie|url=https://www.londonboxoffice.co.uk/news/post/review-spoonful-sherman|accessdate=September 8, 2017|publisher=''London Box Office''|date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  '''Traffic Light Theatregoer''' wrote "Robert J. [Sherman]'s more recent works such as "[[Bumblescratch|Music Of The Spheres]]"...made ''A Spoonful Of Sherman'' a full-bodied experience for us. Helena Blackman soaring soprano easily encompassed a range of 20th century song styles from perky 1920s to near operetta to the limpid notes and musical hall idiom of Sherman Brothers' songs.

'''''Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana 2'''''|イリスのアトリエ エターナルマナ2|Irisu no Atorie Etānaru Mana Tsū}}, is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by Japanese developer [[Gust Co. Ltd.]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]. The game is the sequel to ''[[Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana]]''.

==Gameplay==
Although ''Atelier Iris 2''{{'}}s combat system is an improvement from its predecessor's,  out-of-battle gameplay is less complex and the alchemy and invention systems were merged.
Battles are primarily [[turn-based]]. The game is unique in having two playable, switchable characters: Felt and Viese. Felt focuses on exploration and battle, and Viese on item creation and support. Only Viese can use alchemy, although Felt collects alchemical recipes.

''Atelier Iris 2'' has an item-customization and -creation scheme known as [[alchemy]]. By obtaining a recipe and the necessary ingredients, items can be synthesized for equipment or to progress in the game. Alchemy is divided into three categories: ''mana'' items, accessories and alchemy items.

Each character is equipped with a weapon and can equip two accessories and two alchemy items. 
As the player progresses through the game they will obtain a large number of Mana elements, which can be used to synthesize ''mana'' items.

Field play was simplified from the game's predecessor. Instead of possessing a number of tools to solve puzzles, each character has the ability to jump and absorb ''mana''.

Japanese voice-overs can be enabled.

==Plot==
Felt and Viese, alchemists-in-training on the floating continent of Eden, are the game's main characters. Viese becomes a full-fledged alchemist, and when she finds Felt at the Belkhyde Gate (a sealed gateway to another world), they go to a forest so Viese can make a pact with an elemental spirit. They find the Azure Azoth, an [[Excaliber]]-like sword, and Felt succeeds in pulling it out.

He hears a voice telling him he must go to Belkhyde (which has been unsealed by the Azure Azoth) because Eden is in turmoil. After parting from Viese, he staggers across the Tatalian desert before collapsing and being found by Noin. Noin claims to be part of the Simsilt, an army fighting to liberate Belkhyde from the Empire. Felt and Noin rescue Max, leader of the Simsilt, from the Riesevelt lighthouse and move to Agito Cove (Simsilt's base). Felt and Viese learn about the Share Ring, which allows a user to send items to another. Hagel (the blacksmith) is recruited, and they are rescued by the dragon man Gray. Felt returns to Agito, travels to the eastern continent and sees the sea for the first time.

During the journey to Altena Church, Felt finds the girl who tried to kill him poisoned in a forest. After bringing her to Max's Camp, Viese develops a cure for Fungo's poison. Felt and the others go to Altena Church and are stopped by Chaos, who defeats Felt and Fee and is chased by Gray. When they reach Altena Church, the purposes of the Azoths, Eden and the Gardo Continental Drive are revealed. When Viese finds a map of workshops scattered across Belkhyde, this becomes the focus of the rest of the game.

Felt looks for Chaos, who was not present at the battle. He finds an Altena Nun on the bridge leading to the western continent who tells him that Chaos arrived at Altena Church. When Felt arrives, he finds Mother Eizlen frozen by the Crimson Azoth's spell (which killed Max earlier). Felt fights Chaos in the lower levels of Altena Church (where the Gardo Continental Drive is stored), and is fossilized with the Exzanosis spell. Viese begins to worry about Felt, and follows him to Belkhyde.

After the restoration of the Azure Azoth, Felt dissipates the mist which Palaxius spread over Eden. After chasing him to the Temple of Creation, Felt and his friends learn about Iris (the reincarnation of Lilith) and defeat Palaxius. Iris is freed, and everyone finds a place in the world.

==Characters==
Similar to its predecessor, ''Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny'' has several playable characters.  Three characters can be in a battle party at once, with the player free to switch the others in and out at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">'''Audience superior position''' is a term in [[literary theory]] to describe when the audience of a narrative work knows more than one or more characters in the narrative work.&lt;ref name="Write to TV"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Martie| title = Write to TV: Out of Your Head and Onto the Screen| publisher = Focal Press| year = 2007| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9_x98ufdB-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example in film might be when the audience knows the killer is hiding in the closet while the [[protagonist]] does not.

Another example of audience superior position is the use of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp48.Dramatic.Irony.html WordPlayer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the audience may know [[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]] is headed for a tragic ending before Oedipus himself does.

Audience superior may also be used for [[foreshadowing]] or dramatic tension. The audience is aware there is a shark in the film [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] long before the protagonists accept this fact.

==Audience inferior position==

'''Audience inferior position''' is when the audience knows less than one or more of the characters in a narrative work. A key example is in murder mysteries, when the detective solves the crime before the audience. If the audience were to solve the crime before the detective, the audience would lose all interest in following the story.

==Audience equal position==

Much of the time in narrative works, the audience knows exactly as much as the characters they are following, and are not given more or less information by the author.

'''''Be There or Be Square''''' ({{zh|s=不见不散|t=不見不散|p=Bújiàn búsàn}}) is a 1998 [[Chinese cinema|Chinese]] [[romantic comedy]] [[film]] directed by [[Feng Xiaogang]], produced by Beijing Forbidden City Film Co. Ltd., Beijing Film Studio, Zhongji Modern Commercial, Beijing Zhengtian Media &amp; Culture Centre, and Sleiman/Tyrol Films.

[[Ge You]] and [[Xu Fan]] star as [[Beijing]] natives working in [[Los Angeles]], whose paths constantly cross in a foreign city. They attempt to balance work with friendship/love in spite of mounting disasters each time they meet.

==Plot==

Freelancer Liu Yuan (Ge You) is a carefree Beijing native seeking out a living in Los Angeles, working as an occasional film extra and part-time insurance agent. While helping a Beijing film crew scout for a suburban mansion, he encounters Li Qing (Xu Fan), a former acquaintance [[house sitting]] for a wealthy Taiwanese family. Liu convinces Li Qing she lacks the requisite skills to survive in an American city, and buys her an air ticket to fly back to Beijing. The two part at the airport, expecting never to meet again.

The two run into each other a year later in L.A. As it turns out Li did not leave the U.S.; instead, she now rents a cheap apartment and works as a cleaner. Still his former carefree self living in a [[travel trailer]], Liu has turned to selling cemetery plots. Their relationship seems "jinxed" as the two encounter a hold-up at a restaurant, then the unlucky duo end up arrested by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] after they worked for a traveling agency without realizing it is actually a human smuggling ring in disguise. Li Qing finds their relationship unnerving enough to stop contact, vowing never to meet Liu again.

A year passes. Liu Yuan puts a classified ad in local Chinese language newspaper looking for Li, who now has her own florist shop and is teaching Mandarin part-time to Chinese Americans. Li remembers their relationship fondly and the two set up a Mandarin school for LAPD cops who patrol the LA Chinatown area. Through various mishaps, Liu makes no secret of his romantic interest in Li, but it is only after an elaborate hoax from Liu that Li realizes she values him as well.

However, news arrives from Beijing that Liu's mother has suffered a serious [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Liu heads back to Beijing to fulfill his filial duties and parts with Li, not wanting to pressure her to follow him home as Li has just obtained a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] after years of hard work in the US.

On the airplane heading home, Liu has a troubled dream that he will not see Li again until decades later at an old folks' home. When he wakes up he finds to his delight Li Qing sitting next to him. Just then, the airplane meets with technical mishap and seems to be heading for a crash – another mishap in their long line of "hexed" meet-ups. In the face of imminent death, the couple profess their love for each other, but miraculously, the technical problem is resolved just moments after their mutual love declarations. The two decide to get hitched immediately on landing – but only after Li discovers Liu is sporting dentures after their first kiss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10690">'''Body horror''' or '''biological horror''' is a subgenre of [[Horror film|horror]] which intentionally showcases graphic or psychologically disturbing violations of the human body.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruz |first1=R. A. L. |title=Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biological Horror |journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television |date=2012 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=160–168 |doi=10.1080/01956051.2012.654521}}&lt;/ref&gt; These violations may manifest through aberrant sex, mutations, mutilation, zombification, gratuitous violence, disease, or unnatural movements of the body. Body horror was a description originally applied to an emerging subgenre of American horror films, but has roots in early Gothic literature and has expanded to include other media.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Halberstam, J. (1995). ''Skin shows: Gothic horror and the technology of monsters''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Body horror falls into one of three "gross" genres or "genres of excess" which also includes [[pornography]] and [[melodrama]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=L. |title=Film Bodies: Gender, Genre, and Excess |journal=Film Quarterly |date=1991 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=2–13 |doi=10.2307/1212758}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film scholar [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]], the success of these body genres "is often measured by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen on the screen".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, an audience may experience feelings of terror through horror, sympathy through melodrama, or sexual arousal through pornography. Body horror specifically focuses on the limits and transformative capabilities of the human body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cardin, Matt. (2017). Horror Literature Through History: an Encyclopedia of the Stories That Speak to Our Deepest Fears [2 Volumes]. Santa Barbara, California : Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

Body horror often overlaps with, but is distinct from, other horror subgenres. For example, while elements of mutilation may be present in body horror, other similar subgenres such as [[Slasher film|slasher]], [[Splatter film|splatter]], or [[Monster movie|monster]] horror may also share this trope, but differ in message and intent.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, X. A. (2016). ''Horror Film and Affect: Towards a Corporeal Model of Viewership'' (Vol. 47), p. 16. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A common difference in the body horror genre is that violations or distortions of the body are rarely the result of immediate or initial violence. Instead, they are generally marked by a loss of conscious control over the body through mutation, disease, or other tropes involving uncontrolled transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, Peter. (2009). The A–Z of Horror Cinema. A–Z Guides 100. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre can invoke intense feelings of physical and psychological disgust, or squick, and play upon anxieties of physical vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://therumpus.net/2017/01/the-future-of-body-horror-can-our-art-keep-up-with-our-suffering/|title=The Future of Body Horror: Can Our Art Keep up with Our Suffering?|date=2017-01-26|work=The Rumpus.net|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to common tropes used within the broader horror genre, some tropes specific to the body horror subgenre may include invasion, contagion, mutation, transformation, disease, mutilation, or other unnatural or violent distortions of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror|title=Body Horror - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The terminology "body horror" was first used by Phillip Brophy in his 1989 article "Horrality: The Textuality of the Contemporary Horror Film."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=P.|date=1983|title=Horrality - The Textuality of the Contemporary Horror Film|url=http://www.philipbrophy.com/projects/rstff/Horrality_C.html|journal=Art &amp; Text, Melbourne, 1983|volume=3|issue=Having read the referenced article, the term 'body horror' isn't used...}}&lt;/ref&gt; He coined this term to describe an emerging subgenre which occurred during a short golden period for contemporary horror film.&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, Philip. ''"die body crap cut me up smiling"''. ''Philipbrophy.com''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.philipbrophy.com/projects/rstff/Horrality_H.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brophy coined the term to specifically describe a trend within cinema, film director [[Stuart Gordon]] notes that the body horror trope had existed prior to its adaptation to the screen, most notably within fictional writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of Body Horror|last=Kane, Paul and Marie O'Regan|first=|publisher=Running Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Fiction ===
[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) is an early example of the body horror subgenre within fictional writing. The success of [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] in the 19th century in combination with the birth of [[science fiction]] as a literary form is thought to be the origin of body horror as a literary genre.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to Halberstam: "By focusing on the body as a locus of fear, Shelley's novel suggests that it is people (or at least bodies) who terrify people... the landscape of fear is replaced by sutured skin."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Film ===
Canadian filmmaker [[David Cronenberg]] is considered a principal originator of body horror through early films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' and ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'', and his remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''. However, body horror tropes existed within film prior to official recognition of the genre. Early examples of the body horror genre arose out of 1950s American horror cinema including ''[[The Blob]]'' and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'', both of which set the standard for the genre due to the films primary focus on bodily mutilation and visceral special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gehennaandhinnom.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/a-quick-history-of-body-horror-in-cinema/|title=A Quick History of Body Horror in Cinema|date=2017-04-07|work=Gehenna &amp; Hinnom Books|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary films of the horror genre (those produced after 1968), including body horror, are considered to be [[Postmodernist film|postmodern]] in contrast to classical horror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinedo|first1= I|date=1996|title= Recreational terror: Postmodern elements of the contemporary horror film|journal=Journal of Film and Video|pages=17–31|jstor=20688091|volume=48|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, delineations between the genres are difficult to define, since postmodernism is concerned with blurring boundaries between categories.

The body horror genre is widely represented throughout [[Japanese horror]] and within contemporary media, such as [[anime]].&lt;ref&gt;Gateward, F. (2002). Bubblegum and heavy metal. ''Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice: Cinemas of Girlhood'', (29)269, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s 1988 film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' is an early example of body horror within anime. The film utilizes the genre to explore "notion of the adolescent body as a site of metamorphosis, a metamorphosis that can appear monstrous both to the figure undergoing it and to the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Napier, S. J. (2001). Akira and Ranma 1/2: The Monstrous Adolescent. In ''Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke'' (pp. 39–62). Palgrave Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics and graphic novels ===
Many [[manga]] authors, or [[mangaka]], such as [[Junji Ito]], specialize in writing within the horror genre and utilize body horror tropes in combination with narrative storytelling devices of [[Japanese horror]].&lt;ref&gt;Bush, L. (2001). ''Asian Horror Encyclopedia: Asian Horror Culture in Literature, Manga, and Folklore''. iUniverse.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly influenced by [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P Lovecraft]], Ito's manga depict obscene body horror through both aesthetic and narrative in order to invoke feelings of [[Abjection|abject]] terror.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In contrast, Canadian cartoonist [[Michael DeForge]] incorporates recurring body horror aspects within his work through less graphic aesthetic and narrative styles.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T. (2014). "Aw Dude, Gross": The Mundane Body Horror of Michael DeForge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Films and media that fall under the body horror subgenre reflect a specific corporeal societal anxiety and may provide social commentary about history and influence contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/movies/do-horror-films-filter-the-horrors-of-history.html|title=Do Horror Films Filter The Horrors of History?|last=Dewan|first=Shaila K.|date=2000-10-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and censorship ==
Since the 18th century, the horror genre has been popular among readers but dismissed as controversial by critics who saw the genre and its thematic elements threatening or dangerous to society.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, L. A. (2010). ''Gothic Realities: The Impact of Horror Fiction on Modern Culture''. McFarland.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Owing to the use of graphic and gratuitous violence or themes that may be considered [[taboo]], horror media that fall within the body horror genre are often [[Censorship|censored]] or [[Ban (law)|banned]] across a variety of countries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/banned-and-brutal-14-beyond-controversial-horror-movies-w446601|title=Banned and Brutal: 14 Beyond-Controversial Horror Movies|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|Human Centipede]] films have been referred to as "torture porn" and widely criticized to include overly "exploitative, gratuitous portrayals of destructive sexual perversion. That assessment was concretized when several countries – including the UK and Australia – officially banned the sequel in its uncut form."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, S. (2013). No pain, no gain: strategic repulsion and The Human Centipede. ''Cine-Excess Special Issue: Cult Controversies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as [[card magic]], as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.

==Elements==
Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. [[handkerchief]]s, [[glasses]]) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of [[sleight of hand]] and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.

==Sleights and tricks==
{{Confusing|date=June 2010}}
&lt;!-- This section may need a more detailed description for each act. Comment from User:Davtra --&gt;

Some classic coin magic effects:
*Coin vanish - making a coin seemingly vanish.
*Coin production - making a coin seemingly appear.
*Transposition - making two coins switch places

Some classic coin magic plots:
*[[Miser's Dream]] - Grabbing multiple coins from thin air. Popularized by T. Nelson Downs, who would drop coin after coin into a borrowed top hat.
*Coins Across - The magical transfer of multiple coins from one hand to another.
*Three fly - A coins across type effect involving three coins ''visually'' transferring from one hand to another.
*Matrix - Impossibly moving four coins under the cover of playing cards.
*Chink-a-chink - A bare-handed Matrix.
*[[Coins Through Table]] - Coins penetrate through the surface of the table.
*Coin Bite - Taking a bite out of a coin then visually restoring it right in front of the spectator.
*Spellbound - Visually changing one coin into another, while only showing one coin at all times.
*Coins to Glass - Similar to coins across - coins transfer from one hand to a glass.
*Tenkai Pennies - A two coin routine where one coin travels from one hand to the other.
*Coin to bottle - A coin is slammed into a sealed bottle.

A sampling of coin sleights and moves:
*[[Palming]] - A form of concealment.
*[[Sleeving]] - A form of concealment.
*Lapping - A form of ditching a coin.
*[[The French Drop]] - a retention of vision coin vanish involving the Passing of a coin from one hand to the other than making it disappear.
*The Muscle Pass - Shooting a coin from one hand to the other, this can be done in such a way that can make the coin look as if it’s defying gravity

==Coin magicians==
Some magicians widely known for coin magic include:
* [[Thomas Nelson Downs]] (considered, along with J.B. Bobo, one of the magicians key to the development and teaching of modern coin magic)
* [[J.B. Bobo]] (author of Modern Coin Magic, a core reference and starting point for coin magicians)
* [[Tony Slydini]] (a well-known magician whose style of magic transformed close-up magic including his impressive coin routines)
* [[Dai Vernon]]
* [[Ed Marlo]]
* [[David Roth]] (most important developer of coin magic in the twentieth century and inventor of the standard plots common in current coin magic)
* [[Larry Jennings]]
* [[Michael Ammar]] (one of the most prolific publishers and teachers, an experienced all around magician, including coin work)
* [[Dean Dill]] (coin magician and inventor who has appeared on television and also works as a barber)
* [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]]
* [[Shoot Ogawa]] (Last Vegas restaurant performer known for highly stylized, high-difficulty, impressive coin magic)
* [[Apollo Robbins]] (contemporary of Shoot Ogawa and co-contributor to a number coin teaching materials)
* [[David Stone (magician)|David Stone]] (talented performer and teacher of fast-paced, flashy coin magic)
* [[Rocco Silano]]
* [[Jay Sankey]]
* [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]] (author of Chip Tricks, a magician and mentalist who has authored various magic instructional videos)
* [[Luis Piedrahita]]
* [[Michael Rubinstein]]
* [[Mike Gallo]]
* [[Chris Kenner]]
* [[Paul Cummins]]

==Performance==
Although some coin magic use [[gimmick]]s (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.

==In literature==
Canadian novelist [[Robertson Davies]] devotes a good part of his ''[[The Deptford Trilogy|Deptford Trilogy]]'' to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, [[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]], details his life and career.

In the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[American Gods]]'', the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.

In the [[Dean Koontz]] novel ''[[From the Corner of His Eye]]'', a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.

[[Stock character|Thieves, wizards, and jesters]], in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. [[Coin walk|Rolling a coin across the knuckles]] (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[Belgariad]]'', and [[Mat Cauthon]] and [[Thom Merrilin]] in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[Wheel of Time]]'' do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of [[Pirates of the Caribbean]]. Also, [[Vila Restal]] in the [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Blake's 7]]'' mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

The '''Concert Companion''' was a hand-held device intended to enhance concert experiences by presenting information that complements the music while the music is being performed. Using wireless technology, the Concert Companion delivered explanatory text, program notes and video images in real time with the music. The Concert Companion was developed under the auspices of the [[Kansas City Symphony]] by former executive director Roland Valliere.

==Testing==

Testing of the Concert Companion took place with the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Pittsburgh Symphony]], [[Aspen Music Festival]], Kansas City Symphony and [[Oakland East Bay Symphony]]. It was featured at the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'''s "D: All Things Digital" executive conference in [[Carlsbad, California]] in June 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos.allthingsd.com/D2/Concert-Companion/542601_btX8fC#!i=22522630&amp;k=gBN2d|title=D2 Gallery|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Association of British Orchestras Conference in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in February 2005.

'''Concert production''' is the act of putting on a [[concert]] or a live music performance.  As an individual's role, this refers to the person coordinating all the staff and equipment necessary to make a concert happen; they monitor the schedule, pay the staff, act as a hub for communication between team members, and generally make sure the event runs smoothly.  The role of a '''concert producer''' or '''concert promoter''' is best filled by a person with good organizational skills, a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] demeanor, and plenty of charisma.  As a company's role, concert production may also include the responsibility of [[Talent agency|booking]] the musicians, [[marketing]] the concert, and the financial loss or gain of the event. Over the last 10 years, the number of independent concert producers in the United States has diminished greatly due to acquisition of smaller firms by large national companies.

'''Linda Davison Stafford''', also known as '''Crying Wind''', '''April Knight''', and '''Gwendlelynn Lovequist'''&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Kievit, Joyce Ann.  "Crying Wind" in  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9eaSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary]'', p. 79 (Bataille and Lisa, eds., [[Routledge]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the author of several novels including ''Crying Wind'' and ''My Searching Heart'' which describe the experiences of a young [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] girl named "Crying Wind", and tell a story of [[Christian conversion]].&lt;ref name=Today&gt;"'Crying Wind' is Back, but Not as a Biography This Time". ''[[Christianity Today]]'', v. 25, p. 44 (January 23, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the pseudonym Gwendlelynn Lovequist, she has written many love stories and romances, for publications such as ''[[Writer's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==Education and businesses==
Stafford attended the [[University of Colorado]] (1961), the [[University of Texas]] (1966), the [[University of New Mexico]] (1967), and the [[University of Alaska]] (1969).&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;  She has run art galleries in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Anchorage]], and [[Oklahoma City]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

== Publication and exposure ==
Stafford was described as a [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] author and a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to [[Christianity]] when her book ''Crying Wind'' was published in 1977.&lt;ref name=NC&gt;Veach, Tucker. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CRwaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=syQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2495,5824919&amp;dq=crying-wind&amp;hl=en "A Remarkable Life"] ''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]'', p. 1 (April 20, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, she was touring, promoting her book and giving her conversion [[Testimony#Religion|testimony]] in churches and at conferences across the United States, dressed in Indian garb.&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;

Later editions of her books, which were published by [[Moody Press]], included a disclaimer that said names, dates, and places had been changed.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;  In 1979, Moody Press took the books out of print due to concerns that the books were not presented as fiction.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;  Stafford said the problem arose due to "an unfortunate misunderstanding" between herself and Moody Press, connected to changes in staff and policies at Moody.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;  She maintained that ''Crying Wind'' "is still based on my life", and that her mother was indeed raised on a Kickapoo reservation.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;  Her next publisher, [[Harvest House]], stated that it is honest to call ''Crying Wind'' a "[[biographical novel]]."&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;

Her book ''Crying Wind'' sold over 80,000 copies, and has been translated into over a dozen foreign languages.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;''Indian Life'' has published two of her other books, ''When the Stars Danced'' and ''Thunder in Our Hearts Lightning in Our Veins'' under their imprint,  Sequoyah Editions.&lt;ref&gt;Uttley, Jim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21312">'''Dirty blues''' encompasses forms of [[blues]] music that deal with socially [[taboo]] subjects and [[obscenity]], including sexual acts and/or references to drug use of some kind. Due to the sometimes graphic subject matter, such music was often banned from radio and only available on a [[jukebox]]. The style was most popular in the years before [[World War II]], although it had a revival in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

Many songs used innuendo, slang terms, or [[double entendre]]s, such as [[Lil Johnson (blues singer)|Lil Johnson]]'s&lt;ref name="allmusic1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/dirty-blues-ma0000012302/albums |title=Dirty Blues &amp;#124; Music Highlights |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Press My Button (Ring My Bell)" (''"Come on baby, let's have some fun / Just put your hot dog in my bun"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsofsong.com/lyrics/lil-johnson-press-my-button-ring-my-bell-lyrics-_lijjmm.html |title=Press my button (ring my bell) - Lil Johnson lyrics |website=LyricsOfSong.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some were very explicit. The most extreme examples were rarely recorded at all.

Fidelity to his woman is expected of the easy rider. 1927 Jrnl. Abnormal &amp; Social Psychol. XXII. 16 ‘Easy rider’. This apt expression is used to describe a man whose movements in coitus are easy and satisfying. It is frequently met both in Negro folk songs and in formal songs. ‘I wonder where my easy rider's gone’, is a sort of by-word with Southern negroes. '''1949''' R. BLESH Shining Trumpets vi. 128 In rural Negro parlance...easy rider meant the guitar...carried suspended by its cord. In the double meaning of Negro imagery, the femininely formed guitar...typifies also a woman companion. In Negro ‘city talk’, the term easy rider has come to mean either a sexually satisfying woman or a male lover who lives off a woman's earnings. '''1958''' P. OLIVER in P. Gammond Decca Bk.

'''''Dungeons''''' is a [[strategy video game|strategy]]/[[simulation video game|simulation]] video game developed by [[Realmforge Studios]] and published by [[Kalypso Media]]. It was announced August 12, 2010 and was released on January 27, 2011 in Germany&lt;ref name="gamestar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/dungeons/46373.html|title=Dungeons - PC|publisher=[[Gamestar]]|language=German|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and February 10, 2011 in North America.

==Gameplay==
''Dungeons'' differs from ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; in that the purpose is to care for heroes and not monsters. In order to gain the Soul Energy needed to purchase high-end equipment for the dungeon, heroes need to be killed only after they are fully satisfied. Heroes are pleased if they, for example, find treasure or fight challenging, but not overpowering opponents. Unlike ''Dungeon Keeper'', the player also has an on screen avatar, the Dungeon Lord, who can teleport bodies to the prison room to have their Soul Energy harvested or roam the dungeon defeating heroes. He will re-spawn at the dungeon heart if he is slain, at the cost of the dungeon heart's health points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=October 5, 2010 2:39PM PDT |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/dungeons/preview_6280797.html |title=Gamespot |publisher=Gamespot |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Dungeons'' received "mixed or average" reviews according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dungeons&lt;/ref&gt; Critics noted that the game was more about taking care of the heroes rather than your own creatures, in contrast to the ''Dungeon Keeper'' series.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, [[GameSpot]] panned the game as having "mind-numbing, repetitive gameplay."&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/dungeons/reviews/dungeons-review-6297349|title=Dungeons Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2011-02-07|accessdate=2012-01-02 |quote=''Dungeons' mind-numbing, repetitive gameplay never reaches the greatness of Dungeon Keeper, its classic inspiration.'' |first=Mark |last=Wallton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Addon ==
A standalone addon called "Dungeons - The Dark Lord" was released in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamona.de/games/dungeons-the-dark-lord,test-pc:article,1990506.html |title=Gamona |publisher=Gamona.de |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequels ==
A sequel ''[[Dungeons 2]]'' was announced as an easter egg in [[Dark (video game)|DARK]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157717576 |title=Вот так парни анонсировали Dungeons 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on April 24, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[SteamOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ign.com/dungeons-2/86849/news/dungeons-2-gets-a-release-date|title=Dungeons 2 Gets A Release Date|author=Matt Porter|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 21, 2015|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dungeons 3]]'' is the sequel to ''Dungeons 2''. It was released on October 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dungeons 3|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/493900/Dungeons_3/|website=Steam|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eve Graham''' (born '''Evelyn May Beatson'''; 19 April 1943) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[singer]] who found fame in the early 1970s with the [[pop music|pop]] [[musical ensemble|group]], [[The New Seekers]].

==Biography==
Graham began her career during the 1960s as a [[musical ensemble|band]] singer with the Cyclones in Scotland and later with the [[Cyril Stapleton]] Band, based in London [[England]]. She joined The Track in the mid-sixties and was a founding member of The Nocturnes, originally alongside [[Sandra Stevens]] (later of [[Brotherhood of Man]]) and then [[Lyn Paul]] (her future colleague in The New Seekers), recording for UK Columbia Records between 1967-69.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewseekers.com/new_seekers_web_site_285.htm Eve Graham and colleagues in The Track/The Nocturnes], thenewseekers.com; accessed 25 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 she joined songwriter [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cooke]] for a single release, again on Columbia, called "Smiling Through My Tears" shortly before becoming a founder member of The New Seekers in 1969 and was lead singer on the majority of their early [[hit record|hits]], including the world wide Number One hit - "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]". Other songs that featured Graham as lead vocalist included the US and Canadian smash "Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma", the British Top 5 hit "[[Circles (The New Seekers album)|Circles]]", the Japanese No.1 "The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard" and the ecologically conscious [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]]-[[Roger Greenaway]] composition "We've Got To Do It Now".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Graham's three-octave range was showcased on several songs, most notably the British and European smash hit "Never Ending Song of Love", in which she reached D6.  Though mainly a vocalist, she played acoustic guitar on stage in the [[Chuck Berry]]-influenced skiffle number "Good Old-Fashioned Music" and kazoo in the comic song "(Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut".

In 1974 the group disbanded and Graham moved onto solo [[cabaret]] work, but rejoined a reconstituted New Seekers in 1976 and sang lead on their hits "It's So Nice To Have You Home" and "I Wanna Go Back". In 1978 she left once more, and again performed as a solo singer, as well as marrying another ex-New Seeker Kevin Finn (known professionally as Danny Finn) on 1 June 1979. They toured as a [[Duet (music)|duo]] for many years and released one single ''Ocean and Blue Sky''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Graham retired in 2000 after a last [[charitable organization|charity]] performance, and originally said that she could not envisage being tempted out of retirement. In 2005 former New Seekers record producer [[David Mackay (producer)|David Mackay]] produced a new album with her - ''The Mountains Welcome Me Home''. It was released as a [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]], and contains Scottish traditionals and new recordings of old New Seekers songs. A Christmas themed album, "Til The Season Comes Round Again", followed in 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2008, she told ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper that after the band broke up she found work fitting [[Brassiere|bras]], in a branch of [[Debenhams]] department store in [[Essex]]. She lived in [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]], [[Perthshire]] with her husband Kevin, who worked for a kitchen and bathroom design company. Kevin died on 22 February 2016 after a short illness. Graham told ''The Independent'' that owing to contractual problems she has not received any [[royalties]] since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20080520235042/http://www.themusic.com.au/imm.php?s=christie Christie's Music News], themusic.com.au; accessed 25 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Going Places''''' is an upcoming American [[Crime film|crime]] [[comedy film]] written by, directed by, and starring [[John Turturro]], acting as both a remake of the 1974 French film [[Going Places (1974 film)|of the same name]] by [[Bertrand Blier]], and a spin-off to the 1998 [[cult film]] ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' by the [[Coen brothers]], from which Turturro reprises his role as Jesus Quintana.

Like the original ''Going Places'', it follows a trio of sexually depraved misfits, played by Turturro, [[Bobby Cannavale]], and [[Audrey Tautou]].

== Production ==
The [[Coen brothers]], who wrote, directed, and produced ''The Big Lebowski'', stated on several occasions that they would never make a ''Lebowski'' sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Setoodeh | first=Ramin | date=February 3, 2016 | title=The Coen Brothers Will Never Make a Sequel to 'The Big Lebowski' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/big-lebowski-sequel-coen-brothers-1201694771/ | access-date=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, John Turturro expressed keen interest in reprising his role as Jesus since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2011 | title=John Turturro Says He'd Love To Do A Big Lebowski Spin-Off With Jesus Quintana| website=Cinema Blend| url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/John-Turturro-Says-He-Love-Do-Big-Lebowski-Spin-Off-With-Jesus-Quintana-25463.html| access-date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=O'Neal | first=Sean | date=June 28, 2011 | title=Random Roles: John Turturro | website=''[[The A.V.

In August 2016, it was announced that Turturro, after being granted the right to use the character of Jesus by the Coens, had already started filming the spin-off, which he would also write and direct. It was also announced the film would be a remake of the 1974 French film ''[[Going Places (1974 film)|Going Places]]'' directed by [[Bertrand Blier]], which was itself based on his own novel ''Les valseuses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McNary | first=Dave | date=August 18, 2016 | title=John Turturro in Production on ‘Big Lebowski’ Spinoff ‘Going Places’ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/big-lebowski-spinoff-john-turturro-going-places-1201840371/ | access-date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rotten tomatoes"/&gt; The film was originally supposed to be titled ''100 Minutes with Jesus''.&lt;ref name="first photo"/&gt; The Coen brothers are not involved in the production.

'''Gray rape''' or '''grey rape''' is sex for which consent is unclear.&lt;ref name="Tarrant2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shira Tarrant|title=Men and Feminism: Seal Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsY_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|date=12 May 2009|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-258-0|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} by Laura Sessions Stepp in her 2007 ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' article "A New Kind of Date Rape", which says gray rape is "somewhere between consent and denial and is even more confusing than date rape because often both parties are unsure of who wanted what".&lt;ref name="cosm_Date"&gt;{{Cite web| title = A New Kind of Date Rape| author = Laura Sessions Stepp| work = Cosmopolitan| date = 2007-09-11| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a1912/new-kind-of-date-rape/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been criticized. [[Lisa Jervis]], founder of ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine, argued that gray rape and [[date rape]] "are the same thing", and that the popularization of gray rape constituted a backlash against women's sexual empowerment and risked rolling back the gains women had made in having rape taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape|last = Friedman|first = Jaclyn|publisher = Seal Press|year = 2008|isbn = 1580052576|location = |pages = 163–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former chief of sex crimes for Manhattan district attorney’s office [[Linda Fairstein]] states that while "in the criminal justice system there’s no such thing as gray rape, [it] is not a new term and not a new experience. For journalists, it may be, but for those of us who had worked in advocacy or law enforcement, this description of something being in a gray area has been around all the time.”&lt;ref name="city_‘Gra"/&gt; ConsentEd, a Canadian nonprofit sexual education foundation, dismisses the idea of gray rape, stating that in rape, perpetrators know exactly what they are doing; rape is not an accident.&lt;ref name="cons_Sexu"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sexual Violence Myths: Grey Rape| work = consented.ca| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.consented.ca/myths/grey-rape/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The concept was mentioned in [[Katie Roiphe]]'s 1994 book ''[[The Morning After: Sex, Fear and Feminism on Campus]]''&lt;ref name="city_‘Gra"/&gt; where she writes, "there is a gray area in which one person’s rape may be another’s bad night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Katie |last=Roiphe |title=[[The Morning After (book)|The Morning After: Sex, Fear and Feminism on Campus]] |year=1993 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-0-316-75432-3 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Roiphe "...argued that college campus feminists’ activism against rape infantilized women by redefining ambiguously coercive sexual encounters as rape"; she claims that "...contemporary feminists’ widening of the definition of rape is a puritanical infantilization of women in the guise of progressive politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministing.com/2018/05/11/is-there-a-gray-zone-in-consent/ |title=Is there a gray zone in consent? |last=Gattuso |first=Reina |date=11 April 2018 |website=feministing.com |publisher=Feministing |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''HuffPost'' writer Emma Gray, "gray sex" can be defined as "sex that feels violating even when it's not criminal"; Rachel Thompson states that "while these "experiences might not technically fall under a legal definition of sexual assault", we "...use the term "grey area" because we do not currently have the terminology to describe these experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}
 &lt;/ref&gt; Elsie Whittington stated that this "...grey area is "such a tricky topic" because "we don't really have a language for talking about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Katrina Margolis states that there "...is a space that lies between rape and consensual sex that remains unnamed and undiscussed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetab.com/us/uva/2015/10/16/it-should-be-easier-to-say-i-dont-feel-like-having-sex-664 |title=It should be easier to say ‘I don’t feel like having sex’ |last=Margolis |first=Katrina |date=16 October 2015 |website= thetab.com|publisher=The Tab |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}
 &lt;/ref&gt; Margolis states that when a woman has "...been drinking with a guy, and it gets past 2am, there is a certain expectation of sex if you end up together in a bedroom"; or, "after flirting, and inviting a guy home, I didn’t exactly want to have sex, but it was easier [to say yes] than saying no, ...easier to just let it happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetab.com/us/uva/2015/10/16/it-should-be-easier-to-say-i-dont-feel-like-having-sex-664 |title=It should be easier to say ‘I don’t feel like having sex’ |last=Margolis |first=Katrina |date=16 October 2015 |website= thetab.com|publisher=The Tab |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashley C. Ford]] described a female roommate's experience with her boyfriends, which she describes as "just lay there and let them do it", such as "...when you come home and you're drunk, or you're too tired, or you don't feel like it, but he's there and he wants to, so you just...kinda...let him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ford "identified... the need for "more definitive language" to facilitate nuanced conversations about the "spectrum of harm" inflicted on women physically and psychologically as a result of these experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In a ''New York Times'' article entitled “When saying ‘yes’ is easier than saying ‘no,’” Jessica Bennett describes the "complex situation" of sexual encounters "...you thought you wanted, or maybe you actually never wanted, but somehow here you are and it’s happening and you desperately want out, but you know that at this point exiting the situation would be more difficult than simply lying there and waiting for it to be over. In other words: saying yes when we really mean no", which have been termed “the point of no return,” “gray zone sex,” “begrudgingly consensual sex,” “lukewarm sex,” and “bad sex,” an expression in which "bad" refers “not to the perceived pleasure of it, but to the way you feel in the aftermath.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/109615/yes-no-sex |title=Yes, no and sex|last= Jimenez-David |first=Rina |date= 20 December 2017|website=opinion.inquirer.net |publisher=Inquirer |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term gray rape was used to describe the 1996 Brown University rape allegation involving students Adam Lack and Sara Klein. According to Lack he had consensual sex with Klein. Klein was apparently unaware the two had sex until days later after Lack asked about the experience. She said she did not remember the incident due to her consumption of alcohol, and 5 weeks later, filed charges. Lack said she not only gave consent, but was the one initiating and that he was unaware she was intoxicated. The charges were subsequently dropped, but Lack received academic discipline as a result.&lt;ref name="city_‘Gra"&gt;{{Cite web| title = ‘Gray Rape’: A New Form of Date Rape?| last = Chan | first = Sewell| work = The New York Times City Room| date = 2007-10-10| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/15/gray-rape-a-new-form-of-date-rape/?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brow_Hesa"&gt;{{Cite web| title = He said, she can’t remember: the Adam Lack case| last = Goldstein | first = Daisy| work = Brown Daily Herald| date = 2004-09-22| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.browndailyherald.com/2004/09/22/he-said-she-cant-remember-the-adam-lack-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Laura Sessions Stepp's ''Cosmopolitan'' article, "A New Kind of Date Rape", gray rape definition came to include regrettable sexual experiences and decisions made under the influence of drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name="cosm_Date"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name="salo_Casu"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Casual hookups cause "gray rape"?| last = Clark-Flory | first = Tracy| work = Salon| date = 2007-08-29| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.salon.com/2007/08/29/gray_rape/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} Reina Gattuso states that women have sexual "experiences that feel violating yet ambiguous", which "challenge us to think of violence as a spectrum of power and coercion, rather than a simple dichotomy between “good sex” and “rape.”" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministing.com/2018/05/11/is-there-a-gray-zone-in-consent/ |title=Is there a gray zone in consent? |last=Gattuso |first=Reina |date=11 April 2018 |website=feministing.com |publisher=Feministing |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gattuso states that the “gray zone” "...idea has often functioned as a tactic to minimize or dismiss violence [in couples], and therefore evade accountability, by claiming that sex is inherently a murky, illegible realm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministing.com/2018/05/11/is-there-a-gray-zone-in-consent/ |title=Is there a gray zone in consent? |last=Gattuso |first=Reina |date=11 April 2018 |website=feministing.com |publisher=Feministing |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist magazine ''Bust'' defines the expression “gray zone”  as "sex that isn't completely consensual, but isn't sexual assault" or as an “unwanted sexual experience." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bust.com/feminism/194296-consent-and-the-gray-zone-draft.html |title=On Consent And The "Gray Zone" |last=Sileo |first=Amanda |date= |website=bust.com |publisher=Bust |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Sileo states that the  "gray zone" was "...constructed by a society engulfed in [[rape culture]] and should not exist", because "open communication is missing from so many sexual encounters" and because "women feel too unsafe to speak up". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bust.com/feminism/194296-consent-and-the-gray-zone-draft.html |title=On Consent And The "Gray Zone" |last=Sileo |first=Amanda |date= |website=bust.com |publisher=Bust |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Sileo states that “If you've ever tried to put your finger up a straight guy's ass during sex, you'll know that they actually understand ongoing consent, withdrawal of consent and sexual boundaries very well. They act confused when it's our [women's] bodies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bust.com/feminism/194296-consent-and-the-gray-zone-draft.html |title=On Consent And The "Gray Zone" |last=Sileo |first=Amanda |date= |website=bust.com |publisher=Bust |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;Sileo states that during an encounter, "without the enthusiastic consent of your partner for a new sexual activity [when changing activities], you are no longer participating in consensual sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bust.com/feminism/194296-consent-and-the-gray-zone-draft.html |title=On Consent And The "Gray Zone" |last=Sileo |first=Amanda |date= |website=bust.com |publisher=Bust |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An article about a woman (pseudonymously named Grace) "regarding her sexual encounter with proclaimed feminist actor and comedian [[Aziz Ansari]]" was perceived by the woman as “violating,” telling Ansari the next day via text that “You ignored clear non-verbal cues; you kept going with advances.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/stress-and-sex/201802/dear-young-adult-women-what-you-can-learn-grace-aziz |title=Dear Young Adult Women: What You Can Learn from Grace &amp; Aziz; Here's some advice to empower you sexually in an often toxic sexual culture |last=Mintz |first=Laurie |date=7 February 2018 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this story, there was widespread discussion in the media; ''The New York Times'' stated that “Everyone seems to have an opinion about what she did, what he did and whether talking about gray-zone sex, where the man believes that everything that happened was consensual and the woman feels otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/stress-and-sex/201802/dear-young-adult-women-what-you-can-learn-grace-aziz |title=Dear Young Adult Women: What You Can Learn from Grace &amp; Aziz; Here's some advice to empower you sexually in an often toxic sexual culture |last=Mintz |first=Laurie |date=7 February 2018 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Anna North states that "[s]ituations like the one Grace describes, in which a man keeps pushing and a woman, though uncomfortable, doesn’t immediately leave, happen all the time"; [[Samantha Bee]] commented that “We need to set a higher standard for sex.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/stress-and-sex/201802/dear-young-adult-women-what-you-can-learn-grace-aziz |title=Dear Young Adult Women: What You Can Learn from Grace &amp; Aziz; Here's some advice to empower you sexually in an often toxic sexual culture |last=Mintz |first=Laurie |date=7 February 2018 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and debate==
The University of Florida stated that a "debate has erupted over a particular kind of encounter, one that may not be viewed as sexual assault but which constitutes something murkier than a bad date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://titleix.ufl.edu/in-the-news/title-ix-news-story/ |title=NEW YORK TIMES – NAVIGATING SEX IN THE ‘GRAY ZONE’ |last= |first= |date= |website=titleix.ufl.edu |publisher=University of Florida |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Washington and Lee University]] expelled a student identified only as John Doe for what was described as "gray rape" after he allegedly raped a woman identified as Jane Doe. According to the claim, Jane met John at a party in February 2014 where the two had sex; she did not ask him to stop at the time, but later regretted it, reportedly after seeing him kiss another woman. In the summer of 2014 while working at a women’s clinic that helps sexual assault victims, Jane spoke with staff and later reassessed the encounter as rape. Within 21 days John was expelled from Washington and Lee.&lt;ref name="thec_Male"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mind_The‘"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The ‘Rape’ Disaster at Washington and Lee| author = Johnson, KC| work = Minding The Campus| date = 2015-01-26| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.mindingthecampus.org/2015/01/the-rape-disaster-at-washington-and-lee/}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Doe later sued the school. In 2015, Washington and Lee filed to dismiss the lawsuit, but Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] denied the motion to dismiss allowing John Doe to continue seeking damages from his expulsion believing that John had been the wrongly accused of sexual misconduct. Washington and Lee University ended up settling out of court with the student.&lt;ref name="thec_Male"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Male student – expelled over ‘gray rape’ claim – can sue college, judge rules| author = Stanford, Julianne| work = The College Fix| date = 2015-08-10| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/23709/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wash_Wash"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Washington and Lee settles lawsuit by student expelled for sexual assault| author = Schow, Ashe| work = Washington Examiner| date = 2016-02-08| accessdate = 2016-07-22| url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-and-lee-settles-lawsuit-by-student-expelled-for-sexual-assault/article/2582749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reject the idea of gray rape, saying that it promotes the myth that rape can be an accident. They say that consent is consent, and there is no gray area between consent and lack of consent.&lt;ref name="cons_Sexu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenbergBruess2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerrold S.

Susuana Amoah, who founded the I Heart Consent Campaign, has called for more consent education, including on boundaries: "To avoid grey areas, it's important that people of all ages are educated about what sexual consent means and are able to have informed wider discussions about coercion, body language and abuse of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Thompson has called for more "conversations of grey areas", noting the wide-ranging discussion over the short story "Cat Person" in ''New Yorker'', which examined the "realm of bad sex" and the "reality of terrible sex and its emotional impact". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Conor Friedersdorf stated that "singling out individuals"—like Aziz Ansari—isn't an "effective" way to explore "these thorny, noncriminal, nonworkplace flaws in sexual culture." Friedersdorf stated that it may be better to discuss the fictional portrayals of sex in movies and TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/24/grey-areas-conversation/#wu.iqNcxcmqA |title=We urgently need to talk about the grey areas of bad sexual encounters |last=Thompson |first=Rachel |date=24 January 2018 |website=mashable.com |publisher=Mashable |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Margolis states that "[w]e need to get to the point where saying no is much, much easier. We need to make no-guilt-attached sexual refusal the norm" and it "should be easier to say, “I don’t really feel like having sex” without the addition of an adamant push, or a neighbor-alarming yell"; she says discussing these issues could "help men to distinguish between genuine enthusiasm and silent reluctance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetab.com/us/uva/2015/10/16/it-should-be-easier-to-say-i-dont-feel-like-having-sex-664 |title=It should be easier to say ‘I don’t feel like having sex’ |last=Margolis |first=Katrina |date=16 October 2015 |website= thetab.com|publisher=The Tab |access-date= 2 June 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hammocking''' is a technique used in [[broadcast programming]] whereby an unpopular [[television program]] is scheduled between two popular ones in the hope that viewers will watch it. [[Public broadcasting]] uses this as a way of promoting serious but valuable content. A strong show, followed by a weak show which then is followed by a strong show. This is especially used for new shows. Hammocking may lead to situations where even if programs remain weak, audience rating will be high.

The main theory in play is that audiences are less likely to change channels for a single time slot. However, it is a concept mainly limited to [[prime time]], where "appointment television" is strong. However, there is a risk. If the middle show is weak, the audience could change the channel altogether even if they “would have stayed if the two popular programs had formed a block.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=programming|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television|website=www.museum.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammocking has been fairly reliable over the years. It was largely discovered by accident in the late 1950s: [[Michael Dann]] is credited with developing the concept after ''[[December Bride]]'', thought to be a major hit at the time, underperformed when it lost its lead-in, ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/business/media/michael-dann-tv-programmer-who-scheduled-horowitz-and-hillbillies-dies-at-94.html?_r=0|title=Michael Dann, TV Programmer, Dies at 94; Scheduled Horowitz and Hillbillies|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the middle show becomes a hit. When the new show becomes just as popular, it has caught on. [[NBC]] used this strategy for years with its [[Must See TV]] Thursday night schedule, where the strong series on the night, ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]''/''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', provided two half-hour hammock spots in the night where newer sitcoms were positioned in order to provide strength throughout the night and build the network's bench on other nights if they proved successful, though many of the programs were critically derided for poor writing and acting and "floating by" on the ratings of other shows (''[[The Single Guy]]'' and ''[[Union Square (TV series)|Union Square]]'' being the most prominent and higher-rated examples). So dominant was Must See TV, that a common industry joke of that era was the comparison of the hammocked shows to NBC instead placing a [[Test card|test pattern]] in the half-hour between the end of one top-of-the-hour show and the start of the other, and garnering equivalent ratings for much less effort and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrencemoss.blogspot.com/2016/05/nbcs-must-see-tv-comedy-thursdays.html|title=The Barrel of Forty: NBC's Must-See TV Comedy Thursdays: The "Hammock" Shows|last=Moss|first=Terrence|date=24 May 2015|work=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also related is the concept of [[tent-pole programming]], or using popular, well-established television shows scheduled in pivotal time periods to boost the ratings of the shows around them.

In the 2003-04 season, NBC experimented with a new hammocking format with [[Donald Trump]]'s ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', which aired between ''Friends'' and ''ER''. "Much was made of the ratings for ''The Apprentice'', but in truth, even in its protected spot, it lost almost 4 points compared with the ''Friends'' lead-in and 2 points compared with ''ER''. Moreover, when moved to the unprotected Wednesday night slot, it dropped into the bottom third of the ratings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=William J. |last2=Eastman |first2=Susan Tyler |title=Prime-Time Network Entertainment Programming |publisher=Wadsworth Media |page=213 |url=http://www.wadsworthmedia.com/marketing/sample_chapters/0495500534_ch04.pdf |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, ABC has attempted to hammock programming after ''[[Modern Family]]'' and a drama after (in this case, either ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]'', or ''[[A Million Little Things]]''), to middling or little success. Trying to hammock programs that have little in common with each other can have unusual consequences: [[TNBC]], a block of programming NBC carried during the 1990s that had been aimed at teenagers, had a lead-in from ''[[Weekend Today]]'', a news program targeting those teens' parents. By the end of TNBC's run, after the block's teen viewership had declined, the average age of those recognized by the [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsens]] as watching TNBC was 41 years old, driven mainly by the lead-in from ''Weekend Today''.&lt;ref name=variety-adultsdiscover&gt;{{cite web|title=Adults 'Discover' kiddie programs|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/adults-discover-kiddie-programs-1117880923/|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=2003|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Super Bowl]] has regularly been used as a hammocking opportunity to take advantage of the massive lead-out audience the game produces. See [[list of Super Bowl lead-out programs]] for more information.

(reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; It was printed in a newspaper style format and focused on [[8-bit|8-]] and [[16-bit]] [[home computer]]s of the time, such as the [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX80]], [[Amstrad]], and others. 

Each issue was a collection of both news articles on computer and software testing, treated satirically, and listings of [[source code]] which could be typed in by the reader.

'''Kanamachi''' is a traditional game popular in [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-233288|title=Traditional games get a boost|date=2012-05-09|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2009/11/01/scr01.htm|title=RisingStars|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[India|Indian]] states of [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Odisha]] and [[Tripura]]. It is played mainly by children and is one of the most popular games among [[Bangladeshi]] villagers. Children living in towns and cities also love the game in great amounts.

==Rules==
Kanamachi is not restricted to certain rules, but there are common and widely used rules that most people maintain.
# First the players choose one of them to be the Kanamachi. This is done by a toss or other methods.
# The Kanamachi puts a cloth on his/her eyes and fasten it tightly, so that he/she cannot see things around.
# Then the Kanamachi tries to catch other players.
# Other players have to touch the Kanamachi and get to a safe place where the Kanamchi cannot catch him/her.
# Once the Kanamachi manages to catch a fellow player, that player (who is caught) turns into the new Kanamachi. The former Kanamachi becomes a normal player.
# The game is often restricted to an area, and the players cannot go beyond the range, so that the Kanamachi does not have a great deal of difficulty in catching a player.

'''Mercy Lavinia Warren Stratton''' (née '''Bump''', October 31, 1842 – November 25, 1919) was an American [[Dwarfism|proportionate dwarf]], who was a circus performer and the wife of [[General Tom Thumb]]. She was known for her appearance in one [[silent film]], ''The Lilliputians Courtship'' (1915).

==Early life==
Warren was born at [[Middleborough, Massachusetts]], as Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump, a descendant of a [[French people|French]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] family named Bonpasse, of Governor [[Thomas Mayhew (governor)|Thomas Mayhew]], and five [[Mayflower]] passengers: [[John Billington]], [[Francis Cooke]], [[Edward Doty]], [[Stephen Hopkins (settler)|Stephen Hopkins]], and [[Richard Warren]]&amp;mdash;New England families which intermarried many times over.

Lavinia and her younger sister [[Minnie Warren|Huldah Pierce Warren Bump]] had a form of [[Dwarfism|proportionate dwarfism]] (considered to be desirable by sideshows and "museums" of that era owing to its perfectly miniaturized characteristics, with the same proportions as common larger people) caused by a [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] disorder which seemingly occurs when close relatives (cousins) descended of identically replicating DNA (twins) produce offspring.

Lavinia's parents were 4th cousins, the mother being a 2nd-great-grandchild of married cousins, descended of a twin. The maternal 2nd-great-grandfather of Lavinia's father James Sullivan Bump, Medad Tupper born 1677, was a son of Thomas Tupper and Martha Mayhew. The paternal 2nd-great-grandfather of Lavinia's mother Huldah Pierce Warren, Ichabod Tupper born 1673 who married his cousin Mary Tupper born 1685, was a son of Thomas Tupper and Martha Mayhew. Thomas Tupper was born 16 January 1638 as a twin of Henry Tupper in Sandwich, Barnstable, Massachusetts.

Lavinia's family was a long-established and well-respected New England family. Her childhood was entirely normal for the time.

==Performing career==
After a successful career as a well-respected school teacher, which began at the age of 16, Lavinia went to work as a miniature dancing chanteuse upon a [[Mississippi]] [[showboat]] owned by a cousin. She enjoyed performing, learned of [[General Tom Thumb|Tom Thumb]]'s success, alongside the rest of the nation,  and pursued a performing career as an adult.  Under the management of showman [[P. T. Barnum]], she changed her name from Mercy Lavinia Bumpus to Lavinia Warren, the stage name she had previously used while performing on the Mississippi River.

In February 1872 she visited England with her husband, sister and Commodore Nutt. They were photographed in [[Stonehouse, Plymouth]], and all four signed the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;See images: [[:File:JE Palmer 027.jpg]] and [[:File:JE Palmer 027a.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Charles Sherwood Stratton and Lavinia Warren marriage.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding photo, from left to right: [[Commodore Nutt|George Washington Morrison Nutt]], [[General Tom Thumb|Charles Sherwood Stratton]], Lavinia Warren Stratton, [[Minnie Warren]]]]
Romantically pursued by the tiny entertainer [[Commodore Nutt]], her affections belonged to General Tom Thumb from their first introduction. Lavinia met General Tom Thumb while working in P.T. Barnum's circus. Their wedding was one of the biggest events in nineteenth century New York. She was married in an elaborate ceremony to [[General Tom Thumb|Tom Thumb]] on February 10, 1863 at Grace Episcopal Church and the wedding reception was held at the Metropolitan Hotel which included the couple greeting guests from atop the grand piano.  Her sister [[Minnie Warren]] was her bridesmaid.  While admission to the actual wedding was free, Barnum sold tickets to the reception for $75 each to the first five thousand to apply. After Lavinia and Tom were married they both got even more famous.

Lavinia and General Tom Thumb were living a life of luxury due to their fame, but this also came with some down sides. Lavinia and Tom were presented as childlike to the public by P.T. Barnum. This was an advertising strategy to make the audience feel sympathetic for them in order to sell more tickets. Though they were some of the most famous people in America at the time, due to the way they were presented, people treated them like children. Many people Lavinia met wanted to pet her and hold her. She wrote in her autobiography "It seemed impossible, to make people understand at first that I was not a child; that, being a woman, I had the womanly instinct of shrinking from a form of familiarity which in the case of a child of my size would have been as natural as it was permissible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Disability History of the United States|last=Nielsen|first=Kim|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Lavinia was not extremely fond of how she was viewed by the public, she still continued to perform. Since Lavinia’s life revolved around her presence in the media, she once said "I belong to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Disability History of the United States|last=Nielsen|first=Kim|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, Tom Thumb and Lavinia Warren became famous, perhaps the most famous public personages of the 1860s. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his wife provided a reception for the new couple at the [[White House]]. [[Tiffany and Co.]] gave a silver coach to the couple. They amassed and spent a fortune over the course of their life together which would have made them millionaires by today's standards. They had no actual children, though they did pretend to in the public eye (pictured).
Minnie, who grew to be {{convert|27|in|cm}} high, also married a little person in P.T. Barnum's employ: Major Edward Newell. She became pregnant with a normal-sized child, but excitement was cut short by tragedy on July 23, 1878 when Minnie and her {{convert|6|lb|kg}}-baby died during the birthing. Several years later, Lavinia and her husband stayed at Newhall House in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and were narrowly rescued by their friend and manager, Sylvester Bleeker, from what had been referred to as "one of the worst hotel fires in American history." Within 6 months, on July 15, 1883, her husband suddenly died at age 45 of a stroke.

Two years after her husband's death, Lavinia married an Italian dwarf, [[Count Primo Magri]], and they operated a famous roadside stand in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts]].  At age 73, she appeared alongside Count Magri in a 1915 silent film, ''The Lilliputian's Courtship''.

==Death==
Warren died on November 25, 1919 at the age of 77 and is buried next to her first husband with a simple gravestone that reads: "His Wife."

'''''Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters''''' ('''''リーサルエンフォーサーズ２''''') ('''''Lethal Enforcers II: The Western''''' in [[Japan]]) is a 1994 [[arcade game]] and [[prequel]] to the original ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]''. In contrast with the first game's modern law enforcement theme, ''Lethal Enforcers II'' takes place in the [[American Old West]].

Ports of the game were released for the [[Sega Genesis]]/Mega Drive and the [[Sega CD]]. The game was bundled along with the first ''Lethal Enforcers'' game as part of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] compilation ''Lethal Enforcers I &amp; II''.

Years later, Konami released ''[[Lethal Enforcers 3]]''.

==Gameplay==
The object in the game is to shoot outlaws in order to eradicate crime from a stereotypical Old West town. At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent townsperson or lawmen is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continue play is available.

''Lethal Enforcers 2'' has five stages: "The Bank Robbery", "The Stage-Holdup", "Saloon Showdown", "The Train Robbery", and "The Hide-Out". During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any innocent townsfolk or fellow lawmen. One shot is enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] must be killed in order to complete the stage (though a unique case happened in the third stage where the boss battle is in the form of a dueling mini-game). Just like the original game, a [[dip switch]] setting in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion ("arcade mode") or select individual stages ("street mode"), including the between level target practice stages.

===Weapons===
The player's gun (a [[six-shooter]]) can carry up to six bullets. To reload, the player must aim the lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will give the player better firepower: [[.50-90 Sharps|.50 caliber]] [[Sharps rifle|Sharps]], rifles, [[dual wield|double rigs]], shotguns, [[Gatling gun]]s, and cannons. The Gatling guns and cannons can each be used only once but the other four weapons can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If a player is shot while in possession of one of those weapons, the weapon is lost and the player will return to the regular gun.

===Ranks===
There are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal and U.S. Marshal. When the game begins, the player's rank is Posse, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted. On the Sega Genesis, the accuracy for each stage corresponds to the given rank:

*59% or below is Posse rank.
*60%&amp;ndash;69% will earn the Deputy rank. 
*From 70%&amp;ndash;79% is Sheriff. 
*80%&amp;ndash;89% is Deputy Marshal.
*90% or above is U.S. Marshal.

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the Genesis version a 6.2 out of 10 average, commenting positively on the two-player mode and variety of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Lethal Enforcers 2: Gunfighters|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=63|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1994|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Genesis version a perfect score,{{what|date=December 2017}}&lt;!-- What sort of perfect score did GamePro gave? The scores they gave range from 1-5. --&gt; citing the variety of weapons and their individually distinct firing patterns, sharp digitized sprites, realistic backgrounds, and the quality build and accuracy of the Justifier peripheral, which they felt worked better with ''Lethal Enforcers II'' than with the original game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave the Sega CD version a positive review as well, saying that it is generally identical to the Genesis version but has more voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Lethal Enforcers II: GunFighters|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=65|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' gave the Sega CD version a 6.6 out of 10, commenting that it has better music and sound effects than the Genesis version, but that the game is far more difficult than the first ''Lethal Enforcers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Lethal Enforcers II|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1994|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "The graphics aren't good [...] but it's more challenging, since many more of the targets move this time.  If you liked it once, you'll like it again."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a great number of '''anamorphic format trade names''', for reasons of prestige, technology, or vanity. The basic [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[anamorphic format]] originally popularized as [[CinemaScope]] has been known by a number of other monikers. In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re-branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a cliché throwback, and thus the generic name of ''anamorphic format'' has become predominant.

All of the following trade names refer to the modern [[SMPTE]]-standard anamorphic 35&amp;nbsp;mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time. Generically speaking, this means a 2× anamorphosis lens with 4-perf [[negative pulldown]] for both image origination and projection, and an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1 until 1970 (requiring special, narrow "negative assembly" [[film splice|splices]]) and 2.39:1 after 1970 (using conventional "negative assembly" splices). The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate "negative assembly", and also to better hide "negative assembly" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight "flash" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice. The term ''anamorphic'' should not be considered synonymous with [[widescreen]]; [[VistaVision]] was non-anamorphic, and at the time of shooting, so was [[Techniscope]]
.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15816">Films in the [[Philippines]] derive income mainly from [[Movie theater|theatrical exhibitions]] as revenues from [[home video]], [[television broadcast]] rights and [[merchandising]] share a small portion of the studio earnings. Even more, unlike in the [[United States]] and other territories, gross receipts of movies in the country were not officially disclosed in detail through the years. Third-party organizations that focus on box-office statistics were not present in the industry until the website [[Box Office Mojo]] started providing comprehensive weekly performance of releases in 2007. Although the website is a reliable source, it does not summarize the highest grosses of all time for the reason that its scope is limited to the [[Metro Manila Film Festival]], an annual event during December to January.

==Local and foreign films==
The table below shows the top 20 highest-grossing local and foreign films in the Philippines-based from data gathered by [[Box Office Mojo]]:

'''''Living Lohan''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[reality television]] series that debuted on [[E!]] on May 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Series focuses on life of Ali Lohan|url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Series-focuses-on-life-of-Ali-Lohan-1754395.php|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series aired for a total of nine episodes, ending its run on July 27, 2008.

==Synopsis==
The program documents the daily lives of actress/singer [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s family, with most of the focus on manager/mother [[Dina Lohan|Dina]] and younger sister [[Ali Lohan|Ali]]'s attempt to break into show business. Also appearing are brother Dakota "Cody" Lohan, grandmother Ann "Nana" Sullivan, who is Dina's mother and a former radio actress, and Jeremy Greene, a music producer helping Ali with her debut album. Lindsay Lohan did not participate in the series.

According to Dina Lohan, the series did not air a second season because producers "wanted us to do these crazy things, like my son cheating on his girlfriend, me faking a pregnancy. I was like, 'No, no, no! They had ideas that weren't conducive to our ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/2009/07/dina-lohan-reality-show-produc.html|title=Dina Lohan: reality show producers wanted me to fake a pregnancy!|date=2009-07-01|publisher=lifeandstylemag.com|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Gillian Flynn]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the show F and commented, "The irritation turned to repulsion around the first minute ... Dina snipes about the [[paparazzi]]'s invasion of privacy, but thanks to her, there's not much left to invade." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20202409,00.html ''Entertainment Weekly'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Troy Patterson of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine said, "The show is crisply edited and tangily ironic without pushing its points too hard .... ''Living Lohan'' is not just a symptom of cultural decay but an active agent of it, commodifying the very youth and soul of Ali Lohan—younger sister of poor little Lindsay ... ''Living Lohan''' is one big exploitative mess." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2192000/ Slate Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark A. Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' graded the show D and said, "''Living Lohan'' scrapes the bottom of the stupidity barrel." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/reviews/view.bg?&amp;articleid=1095762&amp;format=&amp;page=2&amp;listingType=tvrev#articleFull ''Boston Herald'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "It's a tedious exercise, joining E!'s ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'' in the realm of mother-daughter bonding experiences, with limited appeal beyond, perhaps appropriately, those pesky tabloids for which the featured "talent" profess disdain ... The show at times provides unintended comedy, representing E!'s best hope of transforming ''Living Lohan'' into a guilty pleasure, if not for the reasons Dina (who doubles as a producer) would doubtless like ... the most salient aspect of the series is that it's profoundly boring, wringing out sprinkles of drama as best it can." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117937255.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2609 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

While on ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', [[Anderson Cooper]] bashed the show during the opening segment of the chat show. [[Kelly Ripa]] proceeds to show Cooper what the show is about.  Video of Cooper's comments was placed in the "Top 20 Best Clips of the Year" by ''[[The Soup]] ''when he stated "I cannot believe I'm wasting a minute of my life watching these horrific people."

The '''Master of Animals''' or '''Lord of Animals''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in ancient art showing a human between and grasping two [[confronted animals]]. It is very widespread in the art of the Ancient Near East and Egypt.  The figure is normally male, but not always, the animals may be realistic or fantastical, and the figure may have animal elements such as horns, or an animal upper body.  Unless he is shown with specific divine attributes, he is typically described as a hero, although what the motif represented to the cultures which created the works probably varies greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Micah (ed), ''From the Banks of the Euphrates: Studies in Honor of Alice Louise Slotsky'', pp. 174-177, 2008, Eisenbrauns, {{ISBN|1575061449}}, 9781575061443, [https://books.google.com/books?id=edVOGJKa7XUC&amp;pg=PA176 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The motif is so widespread and visually effective that many depictions were probably conceived as decoration with only a vague meaning attached to them.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Animals is the "favorite motif of [[Achaemenian]] official [[cylinder seal|seal]]s", but the figures in these cases should be understood as the king.&lt;ref&gt;Teissier, Beatrice, ''Ancient Near Eastern Cylinder Seals from the Marcopolic Collection'', p. 46, 1984, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0520049276}}, 9780520049277, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qu7WeaZA3VUC&amp;pg=PA46 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure may be standing, found from the 4th millennium BC, or kneeling on one knee, these latter found from the 3rd millennium BC.  They are usually shown looking frontally, but in Assyrian pieces typically shown from the side.  Sometimes the animals are clearly alive, whether fairly passive and tamed, or still struggling or attacking. In other pieces they may represent dead hunter's prey.&lt;ref&gt;"Horse Cheekpiece" by "OWM", in ''Notable Acquisitions, 1980-1981'', pp. 7-8, 1981, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870992848}}, 9780870992841, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qG1_i36TbwC&amp;pg=PA7 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other associated representations show a figure controlling or "taming" a single animal, usually to the right of the figure. But the many representations of heroes or kings killing an animal are distinguished from these.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The motif takes pride of place at the top of the famous [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] in the Louvre, an ivory and flint knife dating from the [[Gerzeh culture|Naqada II d]] period of [[prehistoric Egypt|Egyptian prehistory]], which began c.3450 BC. Here a figure in Mesopotamian dress, often taken to be a god, grapples with two lions. It has been connected to the famous [[Pashupati seal]] from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500-1500 BC), showing a figure seated in a [[yoga]]-like posture, with a horned headress (or horns), and surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is related to a figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], who sits with legs part-crossed, has antlers, is surrounded by animals and grasps a snake in one hand and a [[torc]] in the other.  This famous and puzzling object probably dates to 200 BC, or possibly as late as 300 AD, and though found in [[Denmark]] was perhaps made in [[Thrace]].

A form of the master of animals motif appears on an Early Medieval belt buckle from Kanton Wallis, Switzerland, which depicts the biblical figure of Daniel between two lions&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial]] of about 620 AD has two plaques with a man between two wolves, and the motif is common in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and related Early Medieval styles, where the animals generally remain aggressive. Other notable examples of the motif in Germanic art include one of the [[Torslunda plates]], and helmets from [[Vendel]] and [[Valsgärde]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[art of Mesopotamia]] the motif appears very early, usually with a "naked hero", for example at [[Uruk]] in the [[Uruk period]] (c. 4000 to 3100 BC), but was "outmoded in Mesopotamia by the seventh century BC".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 30-31 (Uruk), 75, 78-79, 347 (2nd quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Luristan bronze]]s the motif is extremely common, and often highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-347&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of its composition the Master of Animals motif compares with another very common motif in the art of the [[ancient Near East]] and Mediterranean, that of two [[confronted animals]] flanking and grazing on a [[Tree of Life]].

Although such figures are not all, or even usually, deities, the term can also be a generic name for a number of deities from a variety of cultures with close relationships to the animal kingdom or in part animal form (in cultures where that is not the norm). These figures control animals, usually wild ones, and are responsible for their continued reproduction and availability for hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel&lt;/ref&gt;  They sometimes also have female equivalents, the so-called [[Mistress of the Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mesopotamian examples may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  They may all have a [[Stone Age]] precursor who was probably a hunter's deity.  Many relate to the [[horned deity]] of the [[Hunting|hunt]], another common type, typified by [[Cernunnos]], and a variety of stag, bull, ram and goat gods. Horned gods are not universal however, and in some cultures bear gods, like [[Arktos]] might take the role, or even the more [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] deities who lead the [[Wild Hunt]]. Such figures are also often referred to as 'Lord of the forest'* or 'Lord of the mountain'.

''[[Potnia Theron]]'', a phrase used by [[Homer]] meaning "Mistress of the Animals" is used for early Greek depictions of goddesses, usually [[Artemis]], holding animals. The Greek god shown as "Master of Animals" is usually [[Apollo]], the god of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304, 308&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] has the epithet [[Pashupati]] meaning the "Lord of cattle", and these figures may derive from a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European deity]] or [[archetype]].&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 39 of the [[Book of Job]] has been interpreted as an assertion of the God of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as Master of Animals.&lt;ref&gt;Doak, Brian R., ''Consider Leviathan: Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job'', 2014, Fortress Press, {{ISBN|145148951X}}, 9781451489514, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QB7qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235 google books]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2039&amp;version=NIV Job:39, NIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metallica: This Monster Lives''''' is a book written by [[Joe Berlinger]] and Greg Milner about how Berlinger filmed the feature-length movie ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' with the legendary [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]].
The book follows the emotional roller-coaster both he and his film partner [[Bruce Sinofsky]] and the band Metallica went through during the creation film. The book takes in the time from Berlinger and Sinofsky's first meeting with Metallica in 1999 to the 2003 Summer Sanitarium Tour. Berlinger and Sinofsky's relationship was at an all time low, exacerbated by Berlinger's decision to direct the disastrous sequel to the [[Blair Witch]]. At the start of filming the relationship between the band members, especially between vocalist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], is in a similarly perilous position after bassist [[Jason Newsted]] quit the band and long standing grudges between the remaining members threaten to escalate past the point of no return.

It also follows the creative side of the film, after amassing over 1,600 hours of footage for what was originally supposed to be a short promo for the band's new album the film's editing team had to rapidly change plans as the footage changed from the promo to a TV series and eventually to a feature film.

The book's title is reference to a line in the band's song "Some Kind of Monster" which the film was named after.

The '''Museum of Fournier de Naipes''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Museo Fournier de Naipes'') is a [[playing card]] museum located in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[Spain]]. It originated as a private collection in 1916 by Félix Alfaro Fournier, the grandson of the founder of [[Naipes Heraclio Fournier]]. It was bought by the government of [[Álava]] and was declared ''[[Bien de Interés Cultural]]'' in 1984.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1994, it moved to its current location in the Bendaña palace which it shares with the Álava Museum of Archaeology.

== Building ==
[[File:010 patio.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard]]

The Fournier Museum of Playing Cards is located at the Bendaña Palace, whose courtyard is the beginning of this tour. This Renaissance building was built in the first half of the 16th century. In 1525, Juan López de Arrieta ordered its construction on a piece of land belonging to his family, on the place that once was the defensive medieval tower of the old House of Maestu. Although it was built in the middle of the Renaissance, the building shows some elements of the late Gothic period, such as the pointed-arch gate of the main façade at Cuchilleria Street or the starred octagonal vault on the inner stairs. The organisation and the Renaissance decorative shapes are found mainly in this courtyard, which is a typical example of residential palaces of that time, with three floors of open arched corridors.

The collection of the Fournier Museum of Playing Cards was started by Félix Alfaro Fournier in 1916, when he succeeded his grandfather [[:es:Heraclio Fournier González|Heraclio Fournier]] in the factory after his death.

In 1984, the Alava Provincial Council purchased the collection, that at that time included approximately 3,400 decks of cards, which they exhibited at the Fine Arts Museum of Alava, located at the Augustin Palace. From that moment, the funds of the collection continued increasing and so did the necessity for a bigger space. So, in 1994, the collection was moved to the Bendaña Palace.

The originality of this museum lies with its interesting collection and on the few number of museums devoted to playing cards in the world.

The museum’s permanent exhibition is a small showing selected from among more than 20,000 decks of cards that are part of the funds, coming from different countries, from the five continents.

The Fournier Museum of Playing Cards offers the visitor not only a historic journey, but also a thematic journey showing the development of playing cards, from the 15th century to the present. Besides decks of cards, the centre also exhibits different machines and other objects used for manufacturing playing cards throughout history.

We will visit the Palace on a historic, technical and thematic journey through the development of playing cards, from the 15th century to our time.

The '''National Circus''' ({{lang-sq|Cirku Kombëtar}}) is a [[circus]] in [[Albania]] founded in 1952 and still fully active. The circus had its most successful years during the [[Communist Albania]] era and had difficulties in the 1990-2010 period when its personnel was reduced. The circus has been known to list famous Albanian athletes among its workers.

==History==
The circus was founded in 1952 in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], by Telat Agolli, Bajram Kurti, Xhuzepina Prendi (Shkurti), Bardhyl Jareci, and Abdyl Karakashi.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta-albania.net/news.php?id=4248|title=Cirku i Tiranës pa “Status Kombëtar”|last=Shtëpani|first=Luan|date=2 May 2008|work=Gazeta Albania|language=Albanian|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The circus' first performance, ''Shkopi Magjik'', ({{lang-en|Magic Wand}}) was staged in 1959.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt; In 1964 the circus started to maintain much higher standards of performance with the premiere of ''Fluturime akrobatike'' ({{lang-en|Acrobatic Flights}}).&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt; From 1952 to 1973 the circus operated as part of the [[Estrada of Tirana]]; in 1973, the circus split off to become its own company.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt;
In 1975 the circus started using a canvas tent for the first time and began to perform in other parts of Albania besides Tirana.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt; In 1977 the ''Drejt lartësive'' ({{lang-en|Toward the Heights}}) show premiered in Tirana; in that same year a studio started to work full-time on the preparation of new artists by the circus masters.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt; This brought the number of the people working for the circus to more than a hundred.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt;

In the 1990s, after the fall of communism and with Albania's transitional problems, the circus' staff shrank to almost half of what it had been in the prior decade.&lt;ref name="Shtëpani"/&gt; The canvas tent started to have problems and it was not repaired until 2000. A [[United Nations Development Programme]] project financed some of the circus' activities and by 2010, the Tirana Circus was doing much better than in the 1990s, still being the major circus in the country.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unv.org/fileadmin/docdb/pdf/2004/Final_Report_Circus_Project.pdf|title=Promoting MDGs and Volunteerism among children through the|last=UNDP|year=2004|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the serious financial problems of 1990-2010, the Tirana Circus has been placed under the administration of Albania's Ministry of Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports.&lt;ref name="TV Klan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvklan.al/lajmi.php?id=10057|title=Cirku i Tiranës, menaxhim nga Ministria e Kulturës|last=TV Klan|year=2010|work=TV Klan|language=Albanian|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletes' nest==
Many Albanian athletes have emerged from the Tirana Circus, the best known of which are former World Champion weightlifter [[Ymer Pampuri]]&lt;ref name="Bakillari"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albasoul.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1936|title=Pampuri i rikthehet peshëngritjes pas 25 vjetësh|last=Bakillari|first=Florenc|work=Panorama|language=Albanian|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Olympic weightlifter [[Romela Begaj]].&lt;ref name="Frasheri"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albania-sport.com/mat.php?idm=12215|title=Ymer Pampuri, kampioni i parë botëror|last=Frasheri|first=Dash|date=19 October 2009|work=Albania sport|language=Albanian|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weightlifter Ymer Pampuri (born in 1944) started his circus career when he was only 7, the same year the circus was founded, and grew up as an acrobat.&lt;ref name="Bakillari"/&gt; Later on he started to practice weightlifting.&lt;ref name="Bakillari"/&gt; He stopped competing in 1981 when he was 37, and he returned to circus where he was again an acrobat until 1994, when he retired at the age of 50.&lt;ref name="Bakillari"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9947">{{nihongo|'''''November Steps'''''|ノヴェンバー・ステップス|''Novenbā Suteppusu''}} is a musical composition by the [[Japan]]ese [[composer]] [[Tōru Takemitsu]], for the [[traditional Japanese musical instruments]], ''[[shakuhachi]]'' and ''[[biwa]]'', and [[Orchestra|western orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Ohtake-21"&gt;Ohtake, Noriko (1993). ''Creative sources for the Music of Toru Takemitsu''. Scolar Press. {{ISBN|0-85967-954-3}}. P. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, and premiered in November 1967 by the orchestra under the direction of [[Seiji Ozawa]].&lt;ref name="Ohtake-56"&gt;Ohtake (1993), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Narazaki, Yoko and Kanazawa, Masakata. "Takemitsu, Tōru." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 3 Jul. 2008 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27403&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In his early career, Takemitsu had been reluctant to make use of traditional Japanese music in his compositions, as he said this music "always recalled the bitter memories of war".&lt;ref name="Perspectives"&gt;Takemitsu, Tōru, "Contemporary Music in Japan", ''Perspectives of New Music'', vol. 27, no. 2, (Summer 1989), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He began experimenting with traditional Japanese instruments in the early 1960s, using them in the [[soundtrack]] to [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s 1962 film, ''[[Harakiri (1962 film)|Harakiri]]''.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; Other film soundtracks in which Takemitsu used traditional instruments include [[Masahiro Shinoda|Shinoda]]'s ''[[Assassination (1964 film)|Assassination]]'' and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (both 1964). Takemitsu's first concert composition for [[traditional Japanese musical instruments]] was ''[[Eclipse (Takemitsu)|Eclipse]]'' (1966) for the ''[[biwa]]'' performer, [[Kinshi Tsuruta]], and the ''[[shakuhachi]]'' player, [[Katsuya Yokoyama]].&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; When Seiji Ozawa played Leonard Bernstein a tape of ''Eclipse'', Bernstein suggested combining the instruments in a composition with the western orchestra.&lt;ref name="Takemitsu-1989-62"&gt;Takemitsu, Tōru (1989). "Sound of East, Sound of West" in ''Confronting Silence''. Fallen Leaf Press. {{ISBN|0-914913-36-0}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the title to ''November Steps'', Takemitsu offered two explanations. Taking a literal view of the title, he wrote, "It was performed in November, and to me that project represented a new step: thus, I titled the work ''November Steps''." He further explained, "In Japanese music, ''danmono'' are the equivalent of western [[Variation (music)|variations]], and the word ''dan'' means step. My 'November Steps' are a set of eleven variations."&lt;ref&gt;Takemitsu (1989), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
During the composition of ''November Steps'', Takemitsu secluded himself to a mountain villa, taking with him the scores to [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun]]'' (1894) and ''[[Jeux]]'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;Ohtake (1993), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; At first intending to unite the Japanese and the western musical instruments in the composition, he came to the decision early on that the differences between the two musical traditions were too vast to overcome.&lt;ref name="Takemitsu-1989-62"/&gt; On the brink of abandoning the project, he instead decided to make the difference between the two traditions a theme of the work. Takemitsu later wrote, "It might well be that as a composition it would fail, but I completed the work in order to show as great a difference between the two traditions without blending them."&lt;ref&gt;Takemitsu (1989), pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this line of thought, Takemitsu stated that he did not attempt to integrate the Japanese and western sounds but to display them in juxtaposition to one another, thereby emphasizing their differences.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; Nevertheless, the work does present correspondences between the two sounds. The plucking of the ''biwa'' with the [[plectrum]] is echoed in the orchestra by percussive effects on the strings.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; The ''shakuhachi'''s breath effects are echoed by [[Tone cluster|clusters]] and [[Glissando|glissandi]] in the strings.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; In this way, Takemitsu creates a harmony between the two instrumental bodies while maintaining their unique sound characteristics.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Takemitsu reported that the natural sounds, such as birds and wind, at first disturbed his concentration. When he began listening to them more carefully, he came to view these sounds as not different from his own music.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-20"&gt;Ohtake (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when listening to ''November Steps'' while working in Africa, the cultural anthropologist Junzo Kawada commented that the sounds of nature did not interfere with the enjoyment of Takemitsu's composition.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-20"/&gt;

==Reception==
The performers of the New York Philharmonic were openly skeptical of playing with the two Japanese instruments, however, after hearing the first extended passage for the ''biwa'' and ''shakuhachi'', concerns began to wane. Shouts of "Bravo!" came from the orchestra after the end of the first rehearsal.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-56"/&gt; The first performance received compliments from [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Aaron Copland]] and other prominent musicians.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-56"/&gt; Takemitsu expressed the view the positive reception of the work was proof that if a sound has value it will appeal to all people, not just to particular nationalities.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-56"/&gt;

Shortly after the premier, the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], under its conductor [[Seiji Ozawa]], gave ''November Steps'' its second performance in [[Toronto]]'s [[Massey Hall]].&lt;ref name="Repeat Special"&gt;{{cite news |title=Repeat Special Blends Music|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|location=[[Winnipeg]]|page=2|date=1970-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was distributed widely in the West when Ozawa and the Toronto Symphony included it on the fourth side of an LP of [[Messiaen|Messiaen's]] ''[[Turangalîla Symphony]]'' recorded in December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Peter (2001). ''The Music of Toru Takemitsu''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-78220-1}}., p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/Jan05/Turangalila.htm|title=RECORDING OF THE MONTH; Turangalîla Symphony|accessdate= 19 November 2008 |last=Quinn|first=John|publisher=[http://www.musicweb-international.com/index.htm Music Web International]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ozawa, this orchestra also gave the work its first televised performance, in a 1970 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] program, "East-West Concerto".&lt;ref name="Repeat Special"/&gt; In 1970, ''November Steps'' also had the distinction of being the only Japanese-composed music performed at [[Expo '70]] when Ozawa conducted it in [[Suita, Osaka]], [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Burton | first=Humphrey | title=Leonard Bernstein | location=New York | publisher=Doubleday | year=1994 | isbn=0-385-42345-4 |page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The process of writing ''November Steps'', and its success, resulted in a new direction for Takemitsu's music. Takemitsu wrote that the effort in writing the piece, "somehow liberated music from a certain stagnation and brought to music something distinctly new and different".&lt;ref name="Perspectives"/&gt; One of the ways in which the work changed Takemitsu's music was in a less traditional approach to [[musical form]], which was replaced with a "stream of sound".&lt;ref name="Ohtake-21"/&gt; ''Green'' (1967), composed for orchestra at the same time as ''November Steps'', is more conventional, shows the influence of the two Debussy scores in a more direct way than does ''November Steps''.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-21"/&gt; In contrast, ''November Steps'' does not adhere to traditional western concepts of [[musical form]], but takes the view that each sound is the focus of attention.&lt;ref name="Ohtake-21"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11382">'''Prostitution in Switzerland''' is legal and regulated; it has been legal since 1942. Trafficking, forcing people into prostitution and most forms of pimping are illegal.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite newspaper|title= Drive-in sex plan to curb prostitutes in Europe's playground  |newspaper= The Independent|date=1 August 2011|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/drivein-sex-plan-to-curb-prostitutes-in-europes-playground-2330219.html|location=London|first=Charlotte|last=McDonald-Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensed [[brothel]]s, typically with a reception and leading to several [[studio apartment]]s, are available. One estimate puts the number of street sex workers in Zurich at 5000.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

[[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 20000 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority are foreigners from the Americas, [[Central Europe]] or the [[Far East]]. In recent years the number of full service sex workers has increased. Many workers operate using newspaper advertisements, [[mobile phone]]s and secondary rented apartments, some accept [[credit card]]s. 

==History==
In [[Switzerland]], [[prostitution]] has been legal since 1942.&lt;ref name="swissc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution|url=https://www.ksmm.admin.ch/ksmm/en/home/menschenhandel/besondere-aspekte/prostitution.html|publisher=The Swiss Coordination Unit against the Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants KSMM|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the sexual criminal law was revised, since then [[pimping]] and passive [[soliciting]] are no longer punishable.&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt;

The Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons between Switzerland and the EU of 21 June 1999, which was extended to [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] in 2009, resulted in an increase in the number of prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verdienen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jorio|first1=Luigi|title=Das Recht, mit Sex Geld zu verdienen|trans-title=The right to earn money with sex|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/das-recht--mit-sex-geld-zu-verdienen/33966656|website=SWI Swissinfo|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=German|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, "[[Sex drive-in|sex boxes]]" were erected in the [[Altstetten (Zürich)|Altstetten]] district of [[Zurich]] (such as Strichplatz Depotweg) and one street where [[street prostitution]] was allowed was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Strichplatz von Zürich Altstetten|trans-title=Sexboxes are ready|url=https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/zuerich/sexboxen-sind-fertig-der-strichplatz-von-zuerich-altstetten-id2408068.html|website=Blick|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, street prostitutes in Zurich had to buy nightly permits from a vending machine installed in the area at a cost of 5 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permit tickets for street prostitutes in Zurich|url=https://www.epa.eu/human-interest-photos/curiosities-photos/permit-tickets-for-street-prostitutes-in-zurich-photos-50646610|website=EPA|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, it was publicly announced that inmates of La Pâquerette, a social therapy department for prisoners, were allowed to visit prostitutes in the Champ-Dollon [[Prison|detention center]] near Geneva, accompanied by social therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Büchi|first1=Christophe|title=egleitete Freigänge für Prostituiertenbesuch|trans-title=Accompanied free passages to prostitutes|url=https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/begleitete-freigaenge-fuer-prostituiertenbesuch-1.18233453|website=Neue Zurcher Zeitung|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=German|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Häftlinge gingen auf Freigang zu Prostituierten|trans-title=Prisoners went for free sex with prostitutes|url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/panorama/vermischtes/Haeftlinge-gingen-auf-Freigang-zu-Prostituierten/story/18694822|website=Tages Anzeiger|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=German|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
As well as Federal law, individual [[Cantons]] may also make additional provisions in the form of legislation or regulations.&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt;

Street prostitution is illegal, except in specially designated areas in the major cities.

Article 182 of the Swiss Criminal Code is designed to combat [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt; Article 195 limits the power pimps can have over prostitutes.&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt; Swiss prostitutes are self-employed: regular employment requirements such when and where to work would make the employer likely to be in breach of article 195.&lt;ref name="swissc" /&gt;

It is legal to advertise for "massages" in [[Switzerland|Swiss]] tabloid newspapers.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Switzerland}}
Switzerland is primarily a destination and, to a lesser extent, a transit country for women, children, and transgender people subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Foreign trafficking victims originate primarily from Central and [[Eastern Europe]]—particularly [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], and [[Bulgaria]], with increasing numbers from [[Nigeria]] and [[Thailand]]. Victims also come from [[China]], [[Brazil]], [[Cameroon]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]. The number of victims among asylum-seekers continues to grow. Female victims among asylum-seekers came from Nigeria, [[Eritrea]], and [[Ethiopia]], and were often [[Forced prostitution|forced into prostitution]]. Male victims among asylum-seekers came primarily from Eritrea and [[Afghanistan]] and were exploited in prostitution.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Switzerland 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282759.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=1 August 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Switzerland as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

In the [[music industry]], a '''road manager''' is a person who works with small to mid-sized [[Concert#Concert tour|tours]] (in terms of personnel involved, based on size of the production). Job responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*advancing show dates
*making travel and hotel arrangements (for all group members)
*hiring [[Road crew|backline techs]] or recommending techs to be hired (depending on authority given by [[Talent manager|artist management]])
*coordinating artist media obligations (normally while on tour, but could be anytime)
*ensuring [[Rider (theater)|artist rider]] requirements are met
*collecting payments due to the artist at show time (or signing off on amount due to be sent via wire, depending on arrangements made by artist management)
*making vendor payments (or submission of amounts due to vendors to artist management)
*handling personnel issues
*distributing [[per diem]] (depending on per diem schedule approved by artist management)

Road managers can be confused with [[tour manager]]s. Generally speaking, though, tour managers work with upper-mid to large scale tours and are often granted a much greater degree of authority in tour operations.

}} GE filed the '''SHOW 'N TELL''' trademark with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1967 with its first use in commerce listed as Oct. 3, 1964. The name of the toy appears as Show'N Tell in some texts.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[toy]] combination [[phonograph|record player]] and [[Transparency (photography)|filmstrip viewer]] manufactured by [[General Electric]] from October 1964&lt;ref name="billboard64"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1970s at GE's Utica, NY facility.

It resembled a [[Television|television set]], but had a record player on the top. [[Gramophone record|Records]] and slides were sold for it in combination (known as Picturesound&lt;ref name="billboard64"/&gt;
programs). The slide strips, a flat plastic key 11&amp;nbsp;inches long&lt;ref name="billboard64"/&gt;
containing a strip of 16mm color film, was inserted into the top of the device. As the record played (typically telling a story), the slide strip, through which the images were projected on the screen, would automatically advance to illustrate it. The mechanism by which the slide advanced was purely mechanical, and was based on the rotation of the turntable, so proper operation required manually spinning it a few revolutions before beginning the presentation. The original selling price of the unit was $29.95&lt;ref name="billboard64"/&gt;
and Picturesound programs sold for 99 cents with "a library of five programs" selling for $4.95.&lt;ref name="billboard64"/&gt;

Thirty-five programs were grouped in seven "libraries" initially:&lt;ref name="billboard64"/&gt;

*Fairy Tales and Cartoons
*Children's Favorite Classics I
*Children's Favorite Classics II
*History
*Science and Space
*The World We Live In
*Steps to Knowledge

Licensed film strip and record packages were produced for many different children's properties, including [[Disney]] and [[Sesame Street]]. An advertisement in LIFE Magazine&lt;ref name="life1965"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also specifically mentions [[Pinocchio]], [[Peter Pan]], and the [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]] "as well as educational programs created by [[World Book Encyclopedia]]." By 1965, there were 140 programs available.&lt;ref name="life1965"/&gt; Each program moved through 15 color slides and ran approximately 4 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Show 'N Tell|url=https://toytales.ca/show-n-tell/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also functioned as a standard record player, able to play 16, 33⅓, 45, and 78 RPM records through its built-in speaker.

General Electric released a "compact" version (Model A605) of the '''Show 'N Tell''' in 1966 for $19.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Show 'n Tell''' was also sold as the '''Show 'n Tell''' Phono-Viewer by CBS Toys, in the early 1980s, under the brand name "Child Guidance."  These devices, which were drastically redesigned from their earlier version, only had two speeds (33⅓ and 45), and could not play full 12" LPs. However, the Phono-Viewer could optionally move the projected image off the built-in screen and onto an outside surface (such as a wall or screen).

In [[theatre]] and [[performing art]]s, the '''stage''' (sometimes referred to as the '''deck''' in [[stagecraft]]) is a designated space for the [[performance]] of [[theatrical production|productions]].  The stage serves as a space for [[actor]]s or performers and a focal point (the [[Projection screen|screen]] in [[movie theatre|cinema]] theaters) for the members of the [[audience]]. As an architectural feature, the stage may consist of a [[platform (theatre)|platform]] (often raised) or series of platforms. In some cases, these may be temporary or adjustable but in [[theater (structure)|theaters]] and other buildings devoted to such productions, the stage is often a permanent feature.

There are several types of stages that vary as to the usage and the relation of the audience to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ia470.com/primer/theatres.htm|title=Theatre Types|work=ia470.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710050547/http://www.ia470.com/primer/theatres.htm|archivedate=2010-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form found in the West is the [[proscenium]] stage. In this type, the audience is located on one side of the stage with the remaining sides hidden and used by the performers and technicians. [[Thrust stage]]s may be similar to proscenium stages but with a platform or performance area that extends into the audience space so that the audience is located on three sides. In [[theatre in the round]], the audience is located on all four sides of the stage. The fourth type of stage incorporates created and found stages which may be constructed specifically for a performance or may involve a space that is adapted as a stage.

==Types of staging==

===Proscenium stage===

{{main|Proscenium}}
Since the [[Italian Renaissance]], the most common stage used in the West has been the proscenium stage which may also be referred to as a ''picture frame stage''. The primary feature is a large opening known as the [[proscenium|proscenium arch]] through which the audience views the performance. The audience directly faces the stage—which is typically raised several feet above front row audience level—and views only one side of the scene. This one side is commonly known as the invisible ''[[fourth wall]]'' of the scene. The proscenium arch evolved from the ''proskenium'' in Ancient Greek theaters. This was the space in front of the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'' or backdrop where the actors actually played.

The first indoor theatres were created in French tennis courts and Italian Renaissance palaces where the newly embraced principles of perspective allowed designers to create stunning vistas with buildings and trees decreasing in size toward a "vanishing point" on the horizon. Stage floors were raked upward slightly from front to back in order to contribute to the perspective illusion and also to make actors more visible to audiences, who were seated on level floors. Subsequently, audience seating was raked, and balconies were added to give audiences a fuller view. By the end of the 19th century most stages had level floors, and much of the audience looked down on, rather than up to, the stage.

The competition among royals to produce elegant and elaborate entertainments fueled and financed the expansion of European court theatres. The proscenium—which often was extremely decorative in the manner of a triumphal arch—"framed" the prospective picture. The desire of court painters to show more than one of their perspective backgrounds led court architects to adapt the pin-rails and pulleys of sailing ships to the unrolling, and later to the lowering and raising, of canvas backdrops. A wood (and later steel) ''grid'' above the stage supported pulleys from which wooden battens, and later steel pipes, rolled down, or descended, with attached scenery pieces. The weight of heavy pieces was counterbalanced by sandbags. This system required the creation of a storage ''stage house'' or ''loft'' that was usually as high or higher than the proscenium itself. A "full-fly" stage could store the entire height of scenery above the visible stage using the pin-rails before or during performance, whereas a "half-fly" stage (common in smaller locations) could only store props of limited size and thus required more careful backdrop and scenery design. Theatres using these rope systems, which are manually operated by stage hands, are known as ''hemp houses''. They have been largely supplanted by counterweight [[fly system]]s.

The proscenium, in conjunction with [[stage curtain]]s called ''legs'', conceals the sides of the stage, which are known as the ''wings''. The wings may be used by theatre personnel during performances and as storage spaces for scenery and [[theatrical properties]]. Several rows of short curtains across the top of the stage, called ''teasers,'' hide the backdrops, which in turn are hidden above the stage in the fly system loft until ready for use.

[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|A [[mentalist]] on a stage apron in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
Often, a stage may extend in front of the proscenium arch which offers additional playing area to the actors. This area is a referred to as the [[apron stage|apron]]. Underneath and in front of the apron is sometimes an [[orchestra pit]] which is used by musicians during [[musical theatre|musicals]] and [[opera]]s. The orchestra pit may sometimes be covered and used as an additional playing space in order to bring the actors closer to the audience. The stage is often raised higher than the audience. Space above some proscenium stages may include a flyloft where [[curtain]]s, scenery, and battens supporting a variety of lighting instruments may hang.

The numerous advantages of the proscenium stage have led to its popularity in the West. Many theatrical properties and scenery may be utilized. Backdrops, curtains and lighting can be used to greater effect without risk of rigging being visible to the audience. Entrances and exits can be made more graceful; surprise becomes possible. The actors only have to concentrate on playing to the audience in one direction.

''Boxes'' are a feature of more modern stage designs in which temporary walls are built inside any proscenium stage, at a slight angle to the original walls, in order to allow audience members located to the left or right of the proscenium (the further out, the larger the angle) to see the entirety of the stage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} They enable the creation of [[rat runs]]{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} around the back of the stage, which are when cast members have to walk between entrances and exits without being seen by the audience.

===Theatre in the round===
{{main|Theatre in the round}}
[[File:Circle In The Square.jpeg|thumb|The [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in [[New York City]]]]
This type of stage is located in the centre of the audience, with the audience facing it from all sides. The audience is placed close to the action, which provides a feeling of intimacy and involvement.

In-the-round stages require special considerations in production, such as:

* [[Scenery (theatrical)|Scenery]] that does not obscure actors and the rest of the stage from parts of the audience.
* [[Backdrop (theater)|Backdrop]]s and [[Theater curtain|curtains]] cannot be used, thus the director must find other ways to set the scene.
* [[Lighting design]] is more difficult than for a [[proscenium stage]], since the actor must be lit from all sides without blinding nearby audience members.
* Entrances and exits must be made either through the audience, making surprise entrances very difficult, or via closed-off walkways, which must be inconspicuous. As a result, stage entrances are normally in the corners of the theatre.
* The [[actor]]s need to ensure that they do not have their backs turned to any part of the audience for long periods of time, in order to be seen and heard clearly.

===Thrust stage===
{{main|Thrust stage}}
{{See also|Traverse stage}}
[[File:Pasant Theatre from seats.JPG|300px|thumb|A thrust stage at the Pasant Theatre]]

A thrust stage is one that extends into the audience on three sides and is connected to the backstage area by its [[Stage (theatre)#Stage terminology|upstage]] end. A thrust has the benefit of greater intimacy between the audience and performers than a [[proscenium]], while retaining the utility of a backstage area. Entrances onto a thrust are most readily made from backstage, although some theatres provide for performers to enter through the audience using [[Vomitorium|vomitory]] entrances. An [[theatre in the round|arena]], exposed on all sides to the audience, is without a backstage and relies entirely on entrances in the [[Theater#Parts of a theater|house]] or from under the stage.

As with an arena, the audience in a thrust stage theatre may view the stage from three or more sides. If a performance employs the [[fourth wall]], that imaginary wall must be maintained on multiple sides. Similar to theatre in the round, the audience can view the performance from a variety of perspectives, and as such it is usual for the [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]], [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and scenery to receive thorough consideration to ensure that no perspective is blocked from view. A high backed chair, for instance, when placed [[Stage (theatre)#Stage terminology|stage right]], could create a blind spot in the [[Stage (theatre)#Stage terminology|stage left]] action.

===Black Box===
{{main|Black box theater}}

A black box theater consists of a simple, somewhat unadorned performance space, ideally a large square room with black walls and a flat floor, which can be used flexibly to create a stage and audience area.

===Created and found spaces===
A stage can also be improvised where ever a suitable space can be found. Examples may include staging a performance in a non traditional space such as a basement of a building, a side of a hill or, in the case of a busking troupe, the street. In a similar manner, a makeshift stage can be created by modifying an environment. For example, demarcating the boundaries of a stage in an open space by laying a carpet and arranging seating before it. The theater company [[Shakespeare in the Park festivals|Shakespeare In The Park]], in fact, is based around performing Shakespeare plays in a space that one wouldn't likely find it, namely, [[Central Park]] in New York City. 

==Stage terminology==
[[File:Stage directions 2.svg|right|thumb|House right/left are from the audience's perspective]]
[[File:Theatre Stage Albert Hall looking stage left showing theatre curtains (2016).jpg|thumb|View from stage right across stage to stage left.  Typical small stage ([[Albert Hall, Canberra]]) (2016)]]
The stage itself has been given named areas to facilitate the precise movement and positioning of actors on a stage (see [[Blocking (stage)]]).

To an actor facing the audience, "left" and "right" are the reverse of what they are for the audience. To prevent confusion, actors and directors never use the unmarked terms ''left'' or ''right'' for the sides of the stage. Rather, they use a phrase specifying the viewpoint. The terms "stage left" and "stage right", respectively, denote the sides of the stage that are on the actor's left and right when the actor is facing the audience, while "house left" and "house right" are the reverse, denoting the sides of the stage as viewed by the audience. In Germany, stage right and left are reversed, being the director's view rather than the actor's.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Less ambiguous terms used in theatres that follow a British tradition are "Prompt Side" or "P Side" (Stage left) and "Off-Prompt" or "O.P. Side" (Stage Right), relating to the traditional location of the Stage Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theatreprojects.com/files/pdf/Resources_IdeasInfo_stagedirections.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705034544/http://theatreprojects.com/files/pdf/Resources_IdeasInfo_stagedirections.pdf |archivedate=2016-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the meaning of "front" and "back" would be unclear because they depend on perspective. Instead, the term "upstage" is used to denote the part of the stage furthest from the audience or to motion away from the audience, while "downstage" denotes the portion of the stage closest to the audience or to motion in that direction. These terms were common in older theatres, which gave the audience a better view of the action by inclining the floor (known as a [[Rake (theatre)|raked stage]]), so upstage actually was at a higher elevation than downstage.

A raked stage can vary in its incline; ten degrees is considered ideal{{By whom|date=July 2011}} for the audience and actor comfort.  A dancing surface incline is often different from an acting incline and can vary from three degrees to twenty degrees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

'''''The Grimoire''''' was a comic book series published by [[Speakeasy Comics]] in 2005. A contemporary fantasy story, ''The Grimoire'' was created by writer [[Sebastien Caisse]] and art studio [[Grafiksismik]].

== Publication history ==
The series, went through a creative team change right after the completion of its first story-arc, which ended with issue #6. A creative difference between the creators and publisher, along with alleged problems over payments,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} put the collaboration to a halt during the summer of 2005.

Editor Chris Stone took over the writing chores for the series. Of the new team and storyline, only issue #7 was published before the publisher Speakeasy Comics closed on February 27, 2006.

== Plot ==
The Grimoire is passed to Amandine from a mysterious masked stranger. The object's curse it that whoever holds it will find her fate bound to it. So what begins as a walk to a friend's house becomes the first steps of an incredible adventure...

== Characters ==
* Amandine — the main character, she is a lonely girl surrounded by material wealth
* Medea — a powerful witch, she is Amandine's mother
* Eric Faucon — Amandine's father
* Chai — a magical, intelligent raccoon who speaks Faeric; he is Eric's former familiar
* Louis Bigsky — chieftain of the Western [[minotaur]] tribes

A '''theatre in the round''', '''arena theatre''' or '''central staging''' is a space for [[theatre]] in which the audience surrounds the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].

The Glenn Hughes Penthouse Theatre in Seattle, Washington was the first theatre-in-the-round venue built in the United States.  It first opened on May 19, 1940 with a production of ''Spring Dance'', a comedy by playwright [[Philip Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Cassandra. 200255. [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=3710 "Curtain rises on Seattle's new Penthouse Theatre on May 16, 1947."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808235439/http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=3710 |date=August 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 160-seat theatre is located on the campus of the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, Washington, and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1947, [[Margo Jones]] established America's first professional theatre-in-the-round company when she opened her Theater '47 in Dallas.

The stage design as developed by Margo Jones was used by directors in later years for such well-known shows as the Tony award winning musical [[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]], the original stage production of ''[[Man of La Mancha]],'' and all plays staged at the [[ANTA Washington Square Theatre]] (demolished in the late 1960s), including [[Arthur Miller]]'s autobiographical ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]''. Such theatres had previously existed in colleges, but not in professional spaces for almost two millennia. It is also a popular setup used in contemporary pop concerts in an arena or stadium setting.

==Configuration of the stage==
The stage is always in the centre with the audience arranged on all sides, and is most commonly rectangular, circular, diamond, or triangular. Actors may enter and exit through the audience from different directions or from below the stage. The stage is usually on an even level with or below the audience in a "pit" or "arena" formation.

This configuration lends itself to high-energy productions and anything that requires audience participation. It is favoured by producers of classical theatre and it has continued as a creative alternative to the more common [[proscenium]] format.

In effect, theatre-in-the-round removes [[Fourth wall|the fourth wall]] and brings the actor into the same space as the audience.  This is often problematic for proscenium or end stage trained actors who are taught that they must never turn their backs to the audience, something that is unavoidable in this format. However, it allows for strong and direct engagement with the audience.

It is also employed when theatrical performances are presented in non-traditional spaces such as restaurants, public areas such as fairs or festivals, or [[street theater]]. [[Set construction|Set design]] is often minimal in order not to obscure the audience's view of the performance.

==History of theatre-in-the-round==
Theatre-in-the-round was common in ancient theatre, particularly that of [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] but was not widely explored again until the latter half of the 20th century.

In Margo Jones' survey of theatre-in-the-round,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Margo.  1951. ''Theatre-in-the-Round''.  Rinehard &amp; Company, Inc.; Sec. Pr. edition&lt;/ref&gt; the first two sources of central staging in the United States she identified were the productions by Azubah Latham and Milton Smith at [[Columbia University]] dating from 1914, and T. Earl Pardoe's productions at [[Brigham Young University]] in 1922.

In 1924, [[Gilmore Brown]] founded the Fair Oaks Playbox in Pasadena, California, an important early practitioner of central staging in addition to other stage configurations that it pioneered in its advent of '''flexible staging'''.&lt;ref&gt;Altenberg, Roger.  1964.  [http://dynamics.org/ROGER/THESIS/ ''A Historical Study of Gilmore Brown's Fair-oaks Play box: 1924-1927''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327125016/http://dynamics.org/ROGER/THESIS/ |date=March 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Indicated by Jones,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Margo.  1951. ''Theatre-in-the-Round'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; the centrally staged productions of the Fair-oaks Play box were followed approximately eight years later by the work of Glenn Hughes in his Seattle Penthouse.

[[Stephen Joseph]] was the first to populise the form in the United Kingdom from the US in the 1950s and set up theatres-in-the-round in [[New Vic Theatre|Newcastle-under-Lyme]] and the Studio Theatre in Scarborough. The current theatre, opened in 1996, is known as the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]]. Joseph was reputed to have once rhetorically asked, "Why must authorities stand with their back to a wall?" His answer was: "So nobody can knife them from behind."

Sam Walters set up an impromptu performance space in the upstairs of the Orange Tree pub in [[Richmond, London]] in the early 1970s and subsequently moved across the road to a permanent Orange Tree Theatre.

In 1972, RG Gregory set up the Word and Action theatre company in Dorset in England to work exclusively in theatre-in-the-round. Gregory sought to create a grammar that would enable actors to maximise the form's potential for connecting with the audience both as individuals and as a collective. All Word and Action productions were performed in normal lighting conditions, without costumes or makeup.

==Uses in television and concert halls==
The innovations of Margo Jones were an obvious influence on [[Albert McCleery]] when he created his ''Cameo Theatre'' for television in 1950. Continuing until 1955, McCleery offered dramas seen against pure black backgrounds instead of walls of a set. This enabled cameras in the darkness to pick up shots from any position.

Richard Nixon's 1968 U.S. Presidential campaign staged nine live televised question and answer sessions using a ground-breaking theatre-in-the-round format, adapted for a live televised audience. The first time use of the staging device was memorialized in the book, "The Selling of the President 1968" &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selling_of_the_President_1968&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Joe McGinniss]] &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McGinniss&lt;/ref&gt;. The producer of these Nixon "Man in the Arena" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFeWFjbeEQ8&lt;/ref&gt; programs was Roger Ailes &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2017/05/roger-ailes-nixons-television-man/&lt;/ref&gt;, who later went to on start FOX News &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes&lt;/ref&gt;. Ailes' innovation of the theatre-in-the-round format for candidate forums became the blueprint for modern "town hall" candidate formats and even multiple-candidate debates.

Elvis Presley's ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]'' TV programme was performed with the musicians seated using a raised staging in-the-round format.

When an arena staging was conceived for the progressive-rock group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] by their tour manager Jim Halley in the mid-1970s, it prompted a redesign of rock concerts and venue seating arrangements.

==The politics of the round==
The politics of theater-in-the-round were explored most deliberately by RG Gregory. In his view the lit space of a proscenium arch is analogous to the seat of power; the audience adopts the role of passive receivers. In traditional theatre design, maximum care is taken with [[sight line]]s in order to ensure that the actor can engage every member of the audience at the same time.

However, once removed from the picture frame of the arch, the actors are compelled to turn their back on some members of the audience and so necessarily lose exclusive command of the acting space. All members of the audience can see the actor, but the actor can no longer see all of them. At this point, in order for the play to function, the audience themselves must be allowed to become key conductors of the meaning of the performance.

Some, like the writer [[Mick Fealty]], have stressed a close analogy between Gregory's description of the rudimentary dynamics of theater-in-the-round with the [[network effect]] of Internet-based communication in comparison to traditional broadcast and marketing channels.

==Arena stage archive==
[[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] is home to the largest arena stage archive and contains material from the theatre's 50-year history. Included in the collection are photographs, production notebooks, scrapbooks, playbills, oral histories and handwritten correspondence. According to their website, the total volume is {{convert|260|cuft|m3}} or {{convert|440|ft|m}} linear and is housed in the Fenwick Library.

'''''Twice Through the Heart''''' is a musical work by the English composer [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], variously described as a dramatic ''[[Concert aria|scena]]'',&lt;ref name=Schott&gt;[http://www.schott-music.com/shop/9/show,159225.html Twice Through the Heart], [[Schott Music|Schott &amp; Co]].

Accessed 9 April 2010. "Kammeroper" is the term used which is the German equivalent for "chamber opera".&lt;/ref&gt; or even as a "dramatic song-cycle-cum-scena".&lt;ref name=Gramophone /&gt; It is scored for [[mezzo-soprano]] and 16 instrumentalists and sets an English-language [[libretto]] by the Scottish poet [[Jackie Kay]] based on her script for a television programme about a woman jailed for killing her violent husband.

Originally intended to be a full-length [[opera]], ''Twice'' was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.

==Background and composition==
''Twice Through the Heart'' is based on a 1992 poetry documentary of the same name that Kay had written for the [[BBC]] television series ''Words on Film''. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the [[battered woman defence]] which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse.&lt;ref name=Kay&gt;Jackie Kay, "Twice Through the Heart" in Philip Reed (ed.) (1997), Programme for ''From the House of the Dead'' and ''Twice Through the Heart'', London, English National Opera. Two pages in publication without page numbering.&lt;/ref&gt; She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of [[Amelia Rossiter]], a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife.&lt;ref name=Kay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Severin&gt;Laura Severin (2004), ''Poetry off the Page: Twentieth Century British Women Poets in Performance'', Aldershot, Ashgate, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to [[manslaughter]] after her plea of provocation was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Bindel, Kate Cook &amp; Liz Kelly, "Trials &amp; Tribulations — ''Justice for Women'': A Campaign for the 1990s" pp.&amp;nbsp;65–76 in Gabriele Griffin (ed.)

Turnage, who had previously composed one full-length opera, ''[[Greek (opera)|Greek]]'', worked on the musical version of ''Twice'' between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref name=Schott /&gt; It was commissioned by the John S. Cohen Foundation.&lt;ref name=ENO /&gt; He had learnt of Kay's original work after he was shown a copy of the BBC video by poet and artistic director [[Maura Dooley]].&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt; It was a difficult development with Turnage at one point abandoning the work in favour of other pieces.&lt;ref name=Kimberley /&gt; Composer and librettist had started out with the intention of developing a full-length [[opera]] including both [[soprano]] and [[baritone]] narrators.&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimberley&gt;Nick Kimberley, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/two-from-the-heart-1256379.html Two from the Heart"], ''The Independent'', Tuesday, 17 June 1997. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (The original television script had included poems for the judge as well as for the woman.)&lt;ref name=Severin/&gt; However, the creators felt that their attempts at redeveloping and expanding the original work "water[ed] down its impact" and they eventually cut everything apart from the woman's words.&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt; Both text and setting also underwent repeated changes in detail. Kay changed some of the wording to make it easier to sing. Similarly, Turnage revised the music after trying it out with [[Sally Burgess]] who was to give the first performance.&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt; He had become Composer in Association with [[English National Opera]] (ENO) in 1995 and was able to thoroughly workshop ''Twice'' and its companion piece with ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio before arriving at their respective final versions.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Knussen, "Mark-Anthony Turnage: Defying the Stereotype" in Philip Reed (ed.)

==Description==
''Twice Through the Heart'' lasts for approximately 30 minutes. It consists of nine [[number (music)|musical numbers]] arranged in three sections.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt; It is narrated by a woman in the prison cell where she has been sent for the murder of her husband. To express the woman's feelings, Kay deliberately chose a voice that was unpoetic: "I wanted the voice to be so everyday, it would be banal."&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt; Turnage's music too includes similarly basic material, what critic Tom Service describes as "simple hummable tunes", but these are transformed and distorted, a metaphor for how initial loving intimacy is destroyed and distorted by years of violence and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Service, "[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jan/21/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures1 Turnage Weekend"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 February 2003. Accessed 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Turnage's musical language is [[modernism (music)|modernist]] but influenced by [[jazz]],&lt;ref&gt;Valorie Dick, "[http://www.scena.org/lsm/sm3-6/sm3-6nmf.htm The Winnipeg New Music Fest"], ''[[La Scena musicale]]'', Volume 3, No. 6, 1 April 1998. Accessed 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; an area of musical interest he shared with Kay.&lt;ref name=Kay /&gt;

The instrumental scoring is for [[flute]] (doubling alto flute), [[oboe]] (doubling [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s (one doubling bass clarinet), [[French horn|horn]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], one [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]], [[harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[Celesta|celeste]]), [[violin]], 2 [[viola]]s, 2 [[cello]]s and [[double bass]]. The percussion consists of 8 [[crotales]], [[vibraphone]], [[marimba]], [[suspended cymbal]], 3 [[gong]]s, [[tam-tam]], [[bass drum]], pedal bass drum, [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[claves]] and [[Whip (instrument)|whip]].&lt;ref name=Schott /&gt;

==Performance and recording history==
[[Image:Snape maltings concert hall.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Snape Maltings]] concert hall where ''Twice Through the Heart'' was first performed]]
''Twice Through the Heart'' was first performed on 13 June 1997 at the [[Snape Maltings]] Concert Hall during the 50th [[Aldeburgh Festival]].&lt;ref name=ENO/&gt; Sally Burgess was accompanied by the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by [[Nicholas Kok]].&lt;ref name=Schott /&gt; The companion piece was the [[chamber opera]] ''[[The Country of the Blind (opera)|The Country of the Blind]]'' which Turnage had composed relatively quickly in order to make up a full programme after ''Twice'' had turned out much shorter than originally intended.&lt;ref name=Kimberley /&gt; To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], with a staging at its main home in the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Hadfield, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/classical--opera-short-but-not-sweet-1236638.html Classical &amp; opera:Short but not sweet"], ''The Independent'', Saturday, 18 October 1997. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with [[Susan Bickley]] as the soloist and with Kok again conducting.&lt;ref name=ENOcast&gt;Philip Reed (ed.) (1997), Programme for ''From the House of the Dead'' and ''Twice Through the Heart'', London, English National Opera, unnumbered page with cast list.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context it was a companion piece for ''[[From the House of the Dead]]'', an opera set in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp.

''Twice'' had received its mainland European premiere a day earlier than the first Coliseum performance, when it was given by the State Opera in [[Gießen]], Germany. In 1998, ''Twice'' received its North American premiere in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada and was also given in the United States, (by the [[New York Philharmonic]],) Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. In these last two countries composer [[Oliver Knussen]] conducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schott-music.com/shop/9/show,159225.html?showOldPerformances=true#top List of past performances] Schott Music Gmbh. Accessed 9 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The work has continued to receive international performances, for example by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=vonRhein&gt;John von Rhein, "[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/nov/26/entertainment/chi-1126-classical-jvrnov26 Mark-Anthony Turnage's poignant ''Twice Through the Heart'' suggests why Chicago Symphony Orchestra's composer in residence will be missed"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 26 November 2009. Accessed 9 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial recording was made in 2007 with [[Sarah Connolly]] singing and [[Marin Alsop]] conducting the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Some live performances have been recorded for broadcast, including one at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with the original performers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/t/tu/turnage_double_bill.html Database listing of BBC radio broadcast], RadioListings. Accessed 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Winnipeg performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s631264.htm Music details for Monday 6 December 1999], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. Accessed 13 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In reviewing the first performance for ''[[The Independent]]'', Nick Kimberley felt that the ''Twice Through the Heart'' "w[ore] the scars of a difficult birth" with Sally Burgess "strain[ing] to find specific expression in the sharp angles and steep slides Turnage provided" in a work that Kimberley considered less natural than its relatively quickly written companion piece. For this critic, the instrumental writing came over far more successfully than the vocal part with Kimberley praising the use of colour and finding the "draining" final climax particularly effective. [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]], in contrast to Kimberley, found the ''scena'' "the more dramatic and musically more inventive" of the two works performed that night.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4709426/Paler-but-still-burning.html Paler but still burning]", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 June 1997. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Holland]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'' heard both the Aldeburgh and New York premieres. He noted the influence both of [[Alban Berg]] and, in the strings and percussion, of rock music and appreciated a musical language that makes modernism easier on the ears.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Holland, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/21/arts/in-the-shadow-of-britten-a-showcase-for-the-new.html In the Shadow of Britten: A Showcase for the New"], ''New York Times'', 21 June 1997. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he felt a degree of ambivalence about a composer he described as "theatrical... in both the good and bad senses of the word."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Holland, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/arts/music-review-a-day-of-british-sounds-spirit-and-pep.html Music Review: A Day of British Sounds, Spirit and Pep"], ''New York Times'', 28 April 1998. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoff Brown, reviewing Marin Alsop and Sarah Connolly's recording in ''[[The Times]]'', praised the directness of both Kay's and Turnage's writing and described ''Twice Through the Heart'' and its "awful clarity" as "among the best in Turnage's recent output".&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Brown, "[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article3327948.ece Marin Alsop: Mark-Anthony Turnage"], ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 February 2008. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; David Gutman suggested in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' that "if listeners feel uncomfortable with the mix of artful delivery and documentary realism, that may be part of the intended effect."&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;David Gutman [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/April%202008/91/792502/Turnage "Turnage"], ''Gramophone'', April 2008, p.91. Accessed 27 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' were later to list this disc among the hundred best classical recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Toronyi-Lalic, John Allison, Michael Kennedy, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/6137471/100-Best-Classical-Recordings.html 100 best classical recordings"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 September 2009. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

John von Rhein of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' noted the trickiness of the solo part and criticised the "banality" of Kay's verse but reported that he "was held by the sensitive lyrical, rather Bergian vocal writing and often translucent scoring". "The woman's suppressed anger and fear rise to the surface through Turnage's music — poignant gritty yet always compassionate."&lt;ref name=vonRhein /&gt; Considering the same Chicago performance, freelance music critic Lawrence A. Johnson, was taken by the use of instrumental colour and also by Turnage's "whipcrack rhythmic vitality", but "If ''Twice through the Heart'' [sic] just misses being one of Turnage's top-drawer works, it's because of the somewhat unvaried air of doleful melancholy as well as the text's more pedestrian moments and repetition."&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Lawrence A. Johnson, "[http://chicagoclassicalreview.com/2009/11/domestic-violence-and-dynamic-jazz-make-worthy-bedfellows-for-musicnow/ MusicNOW's British program offers spirited jazz and a tragic song cycle"], ''Chicago Classical Review'', Monday, 23 November 2009. Accessed 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all critics have been hostile to Kay's poetry: reviewing a concert by the [[London Sinfonietta]], Nicholas Williams refers to her "arresting text".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Williams, [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/classical-review-london-sinfonietta-qeh--farewells-with-violence-1157265.html Classical review: London Sinfonietta, QEH: Farewells with violence"], ''The Independent'', 25 May 1998. Accessed 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether positive or negative, the music critics only assessed part of Kay's original work. In considering the original television version of ''Twice'', the literary critic Laura Severin, praised the contrasted voices and the use of repetition as an adaptation to a medium where listeners would be less attentive to the words than if they were attending a conventional poetry reading. She also saw Kay's portrayal of Rossiter as one that avoided both a conventional masculine representation of her as a ruthless murderer and an overly simplistic [[feminism|feminist]] one of her as a passive victim.&lt;ref name=Severin /&gt;

Three years after the start of the [[poker boom]] in 2003, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed UIGEA to extend existing gambling laws into cyberspace. The law made processing payments for illegal online gambling a crime; however, the defendant companies remained in the U.S. market in the belief that the law did not cover [[poker]]. A former payment processor for the companies turned state's evidence after initially being charged with violating UIGEA himself. On September 20, the civil suit was amended claiming individual fraud by Messrs. [[Howard Lederer]], [[Chris Ferguson]] and [[Rafe Furst|Rafael Furst]].&lt;ref name=USAPSSD&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576582741398633386|title=U.S. Alleges Poker Site Stacked Deck|accessdate=2011-09-22|date=2011-09-21|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Berzon, Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PWSCUUSS&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/business/poker-site-misused-players-money-us-says.html|title=Poker Web Site Cheated Users, U.S. Suit Says|accessdate=2011-09-22|date=2011-09-21|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Richtel, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] seized the [[.com]] internet addresses of the three [[online gambling]] sites, replacing them with a [[takedown notice]], but let Full Tilt and PokerStars use them again once they pledged to no longer serve the U.S. About 76 bank accounts in 14 countries were frozen, including an unknown amount of player funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/16/technology/16poker.html?_r=0 | title=U.S. Cracks Down on Online Gambling | publisher=The New York Times | date=15 April 2011 | accessdate=28 April 2014 | author=Richtel, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors are seeking jail sentences for the 11 criminal defendants including site founders and executives, U.S. payment processors, and an executive of a small Utah bank, who prosecutors maintain were engaged in an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, using the bank in Utah to mis-code transactions with other banks to bypass UIGEA restrictions.

[[Antigua and Barbuda]] officials considered action in the [[World Trade Organization]]. The companies ceased their U.S.-facing ad campaigns, resulting in cancellations of [[Poker on television|poker-themed television]] shows. In June, Full Tilt's eGambling license was suspended, which halted all of its remaining online play. The Alderney Gambling Control Commission on the British Channel Islands later revoked its license on September 29.

==Background==

===Growth of poker===
{{main|Poker boom}}
In 2003, [[ESPN]] expanded its coverage of the [[World Series of Poker]]. Between [[2003 World Series of Poker|2003]] and [[2006 World Series of Poker|2006]] the number of contestants in the $10,000 [[Betting (poker)#No limit|No Limit]] [[Texas hold'em]] Main Event grew from 839 to 8773.&lt;ref name=ABFAPFCF/&gt; After the UIGEA was passed the World Series of Poker main event decreased in size, to 6358 players in 2007. In 2015 6420 players participated.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Changes in gambling laws===
On October 13, 2006, the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]], which makes it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison, for a gambling business to "knowingly accept" payments "in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling."&lt;ref name=ABFAPFCF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullum&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=2011-07-23
|date=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to syndicated columnist [[Jacob Sullum]], the [[Void for vagueness|law did not define]] or alter the definition of unlawful gambling, which under Federal law only applies to [[sports betting]] via the [[Wire Act]].&lt;ref name=Sullum/&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Party Poker]], at the time the largest provider for U.S. demand, decided to withdraw from servicing the United States poker market. The [[United States Department of Justice]] later indicted them for services provided prior to 2006 in violation of the [[Wire Act]], a case they [[settled out of court]] in the hopes of being allowed to serve the U.S. market at a later date.&lt;ref name=PSWUDoJf$M/&gt;  Also in 2006, several other online poker service providers withdrew from the market, including [[Sportingbet]]'s Paradise Poker, [[888 Holdings]]' Pacific Poker, and the [[iPoker Network]]'s CD Poker.&lt;ref name=iSWTfOPS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/imega-signs-were-there-for-online-poker-seizures-18918/|title=iMEGA: Signs Were There for Online Poker Seizures|accessdate=2014-03-02|date=2011-04-25|work=[[Poker News Daily]]|author=Cypra, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other sites continued to facilitate the demand for online poker in the U.S., which had been growing about 20% per year.&lt;ref name=ABFAPFCF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aipilf/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBOPBF/&gt;

A 2006 law passed in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] that made it a felony to play online poker was upheld as constitutional by the [[Washington Supreme Court]] in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This case was preceded by a 2009 seizure of $34 million worth of winnings in transit U.S. poker players (q.v. [[Southern District of New York action against online poker players]]).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As charged, these defendants concocted an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, alternately tricking some U.S. banks and effectively bribing others to assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits. Moreover, as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud. Foreign firms that choose to operate in the United States are not free to flout the laws they don't like simply because they can't bear to be parted from their profits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge [[Janice K. Fedarcyk]] added: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;These defendants, knowing full well that their business with U.S. customers and U.S. banks was illegal, tried to stack the deck. They lied to banks about the true nature of their business. Then, some of the defendants found banks willing to flout the law for a fee. The defendants bet the house that they could continue their scheme, and they lost.&lt;ref name=SDNY/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{For|the family name|Zito}}

'''Žito''' ({{IPA-all|Zhee-toe}},&lt;ref name="Jirásek1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alois Jirásek|title=Old Czech Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaHYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%C5%BDito+magician|year=1992|publisher=Forest Books|isbn=978-1-85610-020-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called Ziito, fl. fourteenth century) was a court-magician of [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]].

==History==
Žito was well known as a conjurer and illusionist. Reportedly, he was [[Court dwarf|deformed]] and had a mouth that stretched from ear to ear.&lt;ref name=bells&gt;{{cite book|title=Bow Bells: A Magazine of General Literature and Art, for Family Reading, Illustrated with Numerous Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_M1RAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA403|year=1874|publisher=J. Dicks|page=403|chapter=The Science of Legerdemain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the tales told of his prowess with sleight of hand is one in which, during an argument with a visiting juggler, he swallowed him whole, except for his shoes. He returned a time later, leading his opponent by the hand.&lt;ref name=bells/&gt; Supposedly this occurred during the wedding of Wenceslaus and [[Sophia of Bavaria|Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albion: A Weekly Chronicle of Literature, Science and the Fine Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-tFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;dq=%C5%BDito%20magician|issue= 46|date=November 15, 1835|location=Stuttgart|page=361-|chapter=ZIITO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a banquet, he caused a commotion outside, and when the guests went to look, he affixed deer antlers to their heads, which prevented them from drawing their heads back inside. While they struggled to remove them, he helped himself to sweets from their tables.

In another, he sold a butcher a dozen pigs, under the condition they not drink from running water. When they did so, the pigs changed into kernels of corn. He was angry at Žito and accosted him roughly, tearing one of his arms out by the roots.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin has that his leg was torn out. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-b05AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=leg 276]&lt;/ref&gt; The argument soon attracted a crowd and Žito called out that the butcher was actually selling human flesh in his stall. The crowd rushed to look and found the proof. When the butcher was about to be torn apart, Žito called out for the crowd to look again. They found only animal meat.&lt;ref name=bells/&gt;

He traveled in a cart drawn by poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Thomsonian Botanic Watchman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycIhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Ziito%20magician|volume=1|year=1834|page=139|chapter=ZIITO}} citing ''[[Lives of the Necromancers]]'' by Godwin&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''{{lang|la|Historia regni Boiemiae}}''; published in 1552 by [[Jan Dubravius|Dubravius]], he was at the end taken to Hell, in "both body and soul".&lt;ref name="Classen2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Classen|title=Magic and Magicians in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Time: The Occult in Pre-Modern Sciences, Medicine, Literature, Religion, and Astrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVFKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT613&amp;dq=%C5%BDito%20magician|date=23 October 2017|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=978-3-11-055652-0|page=613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factualness==

[[P. T. Barnum]] considered the story of the butcher to be fictional, pointing out that it closely resembles a story about [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]] selling a horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. T. Barnum|title=The Humbugs of the World: An Account of Humbugs, Delusions, Impositions, Quackeries, Deceits and Deceivers Generally, In All Ages|location= New York|publisher=Carleton|date= 1866|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8L4zwmIaeMC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Ziito%20Faust|chapter=Ziito and His Large Swallow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of his exploits can be seen as the product of skilled [[Illusion (magic)|illusions]] such as [[Misdirection (magic)|Misdirection]] and [[Quick-change (stage)|Quick-change]], in the past this was seen as the product of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paranormality.com/occult_ziito.shtml|title=Ziito - Glossary of Occultism|work=www.paranormality.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
