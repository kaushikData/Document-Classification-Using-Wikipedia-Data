==Synopsis==
In the [[Bukharim quarter]], [[Jerusalem]], during the 1920s, merchant Naftali Siman-Tov ({{ill|Yossi Pollak|he|יוסי פולק}}) is a wealthy middle-aged widower, all of whose previous wives have died under mysterious circumstances. He fears getting married again due to believing that he is cursed. A local matchmaker, Arotchas ({{ill|Salim Daw|he|סלים דאו|fr}}), with the help of some old ladies, pressures him to get married again nonetheless, and, eventually, he marries Flora ([[Rita (Israeli singer)|Rita Jahanforuz]]), a naïve 24-year-old virgin. However, in order not to bestow his alleged curse upon her, he avoids all physical touch. Flora gets pregnant as a result of sleeping with a local textile salesman, Hamedian ({{ill|Jonathan Cherchi|he|יונתן צ'רצ'י}}), and, Naftali, unable to bear the shame, becomes violent toward his young wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Israel|first=Yael|date=5 May 1989|script-title=he:הולכת אחרי חושיה|trans-title=Going After Her Senses|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600576.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Al HaMishmar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuv|first=Yael|date=5 May 1989|script-title=he:אומרים לי לשחק קטן|trans-title=I Was Told to Play Small Roles|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600585.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Davar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in ''[[Haaretz]]'', critic {{ill|Uri Klein|he|אורי קליין}} opined that [[Rita (Israeli singer)|Rita Jahanforuz]] "adds to this film a significant amount of humanity and humor, and, she has a natural filmic presence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Uri|date=11 May 1989|script-title=he:הפוטנציאל של ריטה|trans-title=Rita's Potential|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600603.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Haaretz]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' critic {{ill|Nachman Ingber|he|נחמן אינגבר}} wrote that the film presents "a cornucopia of beautiful colors, [showing] a [[Jerusalem]] of towels, handsome tools, and, scarfs, really a wonderful parade of lots of tradition, customs, and, folklore, representing all [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]], as if it were a beautiful exhibition by [[Maskit]], with a well-spoken text,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingber|first=Nachman|date=12 May 1989|script-title=he:אלף בעיותיה של בת־אדם|trans-title=Bat-Adam's Thousand Problems|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600601.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Davar]]'' critic {{ill|Oshra Schwartz|he|אושרה שוורץ}} noted that the film's main achievement is its treatment of color and light, namely, that the cinematography "creates an almost perfect match between the view that can be seen through the vast Jerusalemite windows (in which the characters walk) and the large rooms within the old tastefully and colorfully decorated stone-made houses,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Oshra|date=14 May 1989|script-title=he:על החלטות נכונות ושגויות|trans-title=On Correct and Incorrect Decisions|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600607.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Davar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Al HaMishmar]]'' critic {{ill|Yael Israel|he|יעל ישראל}} underscored that the film is [[Michal Bat-Adam]]'s "best and most wholesome film" to date, due to its "reliable and reserved cinematic language creating a correct historical environment and utilizing glowing and careful acting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Israel|first=Yael|date=19 June 1989|script-title=he:סיפור פשוט|trans-title=A Simple Story|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0160/01600598.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Al HaMishmar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">Wageningen UR (University &amp; Research centre) has constructed '''AlgaePARC''' (Algae Production And Research Centre) at the Wageningen Campus{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. The goal of AlgaePARC is to fill the gap between fundamental research on [[algae]] and full-scale algae production facilities. This will be done by setting up flexible pilot scale facilities to perform applied research and obtain direct practical experience. It is a joined initiative of [http://www.bpe.wur.nl BioProcess Engineering] and [http://www.fbr.wur.nl Food &amp; Biobased Research] of the [http://www.wur.nl Wageningen University].

'''AlgaePARC facility'''
AlgaePARC uses four different [[photobioreactors]] comprising 24 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ground surface: an open pond, two types of tubular reactors and a plastic film bioreactor, and a number of smaller systems for the testing of new technologies. This facility is unique, because it is the first facility in which the productivity of four different production systems can be compared during the year under identical conditions. At the same time, knowledge is gained for the development of new photobioreactors and the design of systems on a production scale.
For the construction of the facility 2.25 M€  has been made available by the [http://www.minlnv.nl/ Ministry of Agriculture], Nature and Food Quality (1.5 M€) and the [http://www.gelderland.nl/ Provincie Gelderland] (0.75 M€).

'''Microalgae'''
[[Microalgae]] are currently seen by some persons as a promising source of [[biodiesel]] and chemical building blocks, which can be used in paint and plastics.&lt;ref&gt;René H. Wijffels, Maria J. Barbosa. An Outlook on Microalgal Biofuels. ''Science'', 2010; 329 (5993): 796 {{doi|10.1126/science.1189003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] from algae offers a sustainable alternative to products and fuels from the [[petrochemical industry]]. When fully developed this contributes to a biobased economy as algae help to reduce the emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and make the economy less dependent on [[fossil fuels]].

'''AlgaePARC research'''
The costs of biomass produced from algae for biofuels are still ten times too high to be able to compete with today’s other fuels. Within the business community, the question being asked is how it could be produced more cheaply, making it economically viable. Companies within the energy, food, oil and chemical sectors, the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature &amp; Food Quality, the Provincial Government of Gelderland, Oost NV and Wageningen UR are all working together in or contributing to the algae research centre AlgaePARC in order to answer that question.

'''Arland Dean Williams Jr.''' (September 23, 1935 – January 13, 1982) was a passenger aboard [[Air Florida Flight 90]], which crashed on take-off in [[Washington, D.C.]], on January 13, 1982, killing 74 people. One of six people to initially survive the crash, he helped the other five escape the sinking plane before he himself drowned.&lt;ref name=mysheroid/&gt;

The [[14th Street Bridge (I-395)|14th Street Bridge]] over the Potomac River at the crash site was renamed in his honor.

==Personal background==

==Air Florida Flight 90==
{{Main|Air Florida Flight 90}}
On January 13, 1982, during an extraordinary period of freezing weather, [[Air Florida Flight 90]] took off from nearby [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington National Airport]], failed to gain altitude, and crashed into the [[14th Street Bridge (Potomac River)|14th Street Bridge]], where it hit six cars and a truck on the bridge, killing four motorists.

After the crash on the bridge, the plane then continued forward and plunged into the freezing [[Potomac River]].  Soon only the tail section which had broken off remained afloat. Only six of the airliner's 79 occupants (74 passengers and 5 crew members) survived the initial crash and were able to escape the sinking plane in the middle of the ice-choked river.

==After the crash==
News cameramen watched from the bridge, recording the unfolding disaster. There appeared to be no way to reach the survivors in the water. Bystanders helped as fellow passerby Roger Olian, with a makeshift rope, began an attempt to rescue them. At about 4:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST, ''Eagle 1'', a [[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]] helicopter based at [[Anacostia Park]] in Washington and manned by [[aviator|pilot]] Donald W. Usher and [[paramedic]] Melvin E. (Gene) Windsor, arrived and assisted with the rescue operation.  At one point in the operation the helicopter's skids dipped beneath the surface of the icy water.

According to the other five survivors, one passenger continued to help the others reach the rescue ropes being dropped by the hovering helicopter, repeatedly passing the line to others instead of using it himself. While the other five were being taken to shore by the helicopter, the tail section of the wrecked Boeing 737 shifted and sank further into the water, dragging Williams under the water with it.

The next day, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described his heroism:  
{{quote|He was about 50 years old, one of half a dozen survivors clinging to twisted wreckage bobbing in the icy Potomac when the first helicopter arrived. To the copter's two-man Park Police crew he seemed the most alert. Life vests were dropped, then a flotation ball. The man passed them to the others. On two occasions, the crew recalled last night, he handed away a life line from the hovering machine that could have dragged him to safety. The helicopter crew – who rescued five people, the only persons who survived from the jetliner – lifted a woman to the riverbank, then dragged three more persons across the ice to safety. Then the life line saved a woman who was trying to swim away from the sinking wreckage, and the helicopter pilot, Donald W. Usher, returned to the scene, but the man was gone.|4="A Hero – Passenger Aids Others, Then Dies"|5=''The Washington Post'', January 14, 1982.}}

An essay in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' dated January 25, 1982, was written before the identity of Williams was known.  [[Roger Rosenblatt]], the essay's author, wrote: 
{{quote|So the man in the water had his own natural powers. He could not make ice storms, or freeze the water until it froze the blood. But he could hand life over to a stranger, and that is a power of nature too. The man in the water pitted himself against an implacable, impersonal enemy; he fought it with charity; and he held it to a standoff. He was the best we can do.|4=Rosenblatt, R.|5="The Man in the Water," ''Time Magazine'', January 25, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925257-1,00.html |title=The Man in the Water |author=Roger Rosenblatt |date=January 25, 1982 |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Honors, memorials==
The four other members of the Air Florida rescue who also risked their lives but survived were honored shortly after the disaster.

It took over a year to investigate and establish without any doubt Williams's identity and actions. On June 6, 1983, Williams was posthumously awarded the [[United States Coast Guard]]'s [[Gold Lifesaving Medal]] in a [[White House]] Oval Office presentation to his family by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] [[Elizabeth H. Dole]]. Mrs. Virginia Williams accepted the medal on her son's behalf.&lt;ref name=mysheroid/&gt; Other participants in the ceremony included the recipient's father, Arland; his children, Arland III and Leslie Ann; and his sister, Jean Fullmer. Also present were Cmdr. Donald C. Addison; Vice Admiral [[Benedict L. Stabile]], Vice Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard; Senator [[Charles H. Percy]] and Representative [[Dan Crane|Daniel B. Crane]] of [[Illinois]].

The docudrama ''[[Flight 90: Disaster on the Potomac]]'' was aired on [[NBC]] television on April 1, 1984. It displayed the heroism of Williams, portrayed by [[Donnelly Rhodes]].

The repaired [[14th Street Bridge (I-395)|14th Street Bridge]] over the Potomac River at the crash site, which had been officially named the "Rochambeau Bridge," was renamed the "[[Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge]]" in his honor by the city government of the [[District of Columbia]] in March 1985.&lt;ref name=bbrenmed&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RUQsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=os4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2756%2C4219405 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |location=South Carolina |agency=Associated Press |title=Bridge being renamed to honor hero |date=March 14, 1985 |page=C14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dcspnfm&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DAwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TXMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2533%2C2911930 |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |location=New York |last=Coppola |first=Michele |agency=Associated Press |title=D.C. span in crash named for man who helped others |date=March 14, 1985 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ernest Hollings]] of [[South Carolina]], a fellow alumnus of the Citadel, initiated the action in late 1983.&lt;ref name=hwbnmed&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ClcsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w84EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4267%2C6778904 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |location=South Carolina |agency=Associated Press |title=Hollings wants bridge named after dead hero |date=December 23, 1983 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Reagan retold the story of Williams and paid tribute to him during a commencement address at The Citadel on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.free-enterprise-foundation.org/regeantranscript.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, The Citadel &amp;mdash; and Williams's alma mater (class of 1957) &amp;mdash; created the Arland D. Williams Society to recognize graduates who distinguished themselves through community service. The Citadel also established the Arland D. Williams Endowed Professorship of Heroism in his honor.

In August 2003, the new [[Arland D. Williams Jr. Elementary School]] in his hometown of Mattoon was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://herald-review.com/special-section/news/limited/mattoon-school-honors-hero-arland-d-williams-sacrificed-himself-to/article_5920a39f-b8f7-5670-8a69-fb70082fb6fe.html|newspaper=Herald &amp; Review|location=Decatur, IL|title=Mattoon school honors hero: Arland D.

However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">'''Artificial imagination''', also called synthetic imagination or machine imagination, is defined as the artificial simulation of [[human]] [[imagination]] by general or special purpose [[computers]] or [[artificial neural networks]].

The term artificial imagination is also used to describe a property of [[machines]] or [[Computer program|programs]]. Some of the traits that researchers hope to simulate include [[creativity]], vision, [[digital art]], [[humor]], and [[satire]].

Artificial imagination research uses tools and insights from many fields, including [[computer science]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[creative arts]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[affective computing]], [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[operations research]], [[creative writing]], [[probability]] and [[logic]].

Practitioners in the field are researching various aspects of Artificial imagination, such as Artificial ([[visual]]) imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''Visual Information Retrieval Using Synthesized Imagery'' http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1282303&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial ([[aural]]) Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''AUDIO CONTENT TRANSMISSION'' by Xavier Amatriain &amp; Perfecto Herrera, {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; modeling/filtering content based on human emotions  and  Interactive Search. Some articles on the topic speculate on how artificial imagination may evolve to create an [[artificial world]] "people may be comfortable enough to escape from the real world".&lt;ref&gt;''Hypertext and “the Hyperreal”'' by Stuart Moulthrop, [[Yale University]] http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=74224.74246&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[researchers]] such as G. Schleis and M. Rizki have focused on using artificial [[neural networks]] to simulate artificial imagination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning from a random player using the reference neuron model'' in the ''Proceedings of the 2002 Congress on 
Evolutionary Computation, 2002.'' http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1007019&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important project is being led by Hiroharu Kato and Tatsuya Harada at the University of Tokyo in Japan. They have developed a computer capable of translating a description of an object into an image, which could be the easiest way to define what imagination is. Their idea is based on the concept of an image as a series of pixels divided into short sequences that correspond to a specific part of an image. The scientists call this sequences “visual words” and those can be interpreted by the machine using statistical distribution to read an create an image of an object the machine has not encountered.

The topic of artificial imagination has gotten interest from scholars outside the computer science domain, such as noted communications scholar [[Ernest Bormann]], who came up with the [[Symbolic Convergence Theory]] and worked on a project to develop artificial imagination in computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Roots of Rhetorical 
Studies'', by Jim A. Kuypers and Andrew King, 2001. published by Praeger/Greenwood, page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary research seminar on artificial imagination and [[postdigital]] art has been taking place since 2017 at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Postdigital Artificial Imagination''http://postdigital.ens.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

''How to Build a Mind: Toward Machines with Imagination'' by [[Igor Aleksander]] is an academic book on the topic; ''Artificial Imagination'',&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial Imagination'' https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Imagination-Special-Photostory-Washington/dp/098147621X&lt;/ref&gt; a roman à clef, is a non-academic book supposedly written by an Artificial imagination system.

== Typical artificial imagination ==

The typical application of artificial imagination is for an interactive search. Interactive searching has been developed since the mid-1990s, accompanied by the World Wide Web's development and the optimization of search engines. Based on the first query and feedback from a user, the databases to be searched are reorganized to improve the searching results.

''How artificial imagination can contribute to interactive search''

Artificial imagination allows us to synthesize images and to develop a new image, whether it is in the database, regardless its existence in the real world. For example, the computer shows results that are based on the answer from the initial query. The user selects several relevant images, and then the technology analyzes these selections and reorganizes the images'  ranks to fit the query. In this process, artificial imagination is used to synthesize the selected images and to improve the searching result with additional relevant synthesized images. This technique is based on several algorithms, including the [[Rocchio algorithm]] and the [[evolutionary algorithm]]. The ''Rocchio algorithm'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalton, Gerard,|first=Buckley, Chris|date=June 1, 1990|title=Improving retrieval performance by relevance feedback|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H/abstract|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=288–297|via=|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; locating a query point near relevant examples and far away from irrelevant examples, is simple and works well in a small system where the databases are arranged in certain ranks. The ''evolutionary synthesis'' is composed of two steps: a standard algorithm and an enhancement of the standard algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=December 2008|title=Using an artificial imagination for texture retrieval|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.330.1562&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Artificial Imagination for Interactive Search|last=|first=|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=19–28|quote=|via=|url=http://press.liacs.nl/publications/An%20artificial%20imagination%20for%20interactive%20search.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through feedback from the user, there would be additional images synthesized so as to be suited to what the user is looking for.

== General artificial imagination ==
Artificial imagination has a more general definition and wide applications. The traditional fields of artificial imagination include visual imagination and aural imagination. More generally, all the actions to form ideas, images and concepts can be linked to imagination. Thus, artificial imagination means more than only generating graphs. For example, moral imagination is an important research subfield of artificial imagination, although classification of artificial imagination is difficult.&amp;nbsp;

Morals are an important part to human beings' logic, while artificial morals are important in artificial imagination and artificial intelligence. A common criticism of artificial intelligence is whether human beings should take responsibility for machines‘ mistakes or decisions and how to develop well-behaved machines. As nobody can give a clear description of the best moral rules, it is impossible to create machines with commonly accepted moral rules. However, recent research about artificial morals circumvent the definition of moral. Instead, machine learning methods are applied to train machines to imitate human morals. As the data about moral decisions from thousands of different people are considered, the trained moral model can reflect widely accepted rules.&amp;nbsp;

Memory is another big field of artificial imagination. Researchers like [[Aude Oliva]] have performed extensive work on artificial memory, especially visual memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14325.short|title=Visual long-term memory has a massive storage capacity for object details|last=Oliva|first=Aude|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803390105|volume=105|issue=38|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=14325–14329|year=2008|bibcode=2008PNAS..10514325B|pmc=2533687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to visual imagination, the visual memory focuses more on how machine understand, analyse and store pictures in a human way. In addition, characters like spatial features are also considered. As this field is based on the brains' biological structures, extensive research on neuroscience has also been performed, which makes it a large intersection between biology and computer science.

It was originally proposed by Anders Lansner and Örjan Ekeberg at [[KTH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lansner |first1=A. |first2=Ö. |last2=Ekeberg |title=A one-layer feedback artificial neural network with a Bayesian learning rule |journal=Int.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">'''Bernard II''' (died February 844) was the [[count of Poitou]] from 840 until his death. His ancestry is uncertain. He was most likely the son of [[Adalhelm of Autun]], on the basis of onomastics. He was probably a member of the [[Guilhemid]] family. His brothers were [[Turpio]] (died 863) and [[Emenon]] (died 866), counts of [[County of Angoulême|Angoulême]] and Périgord, respectively.

According to [[Ademar of Chabannes]], writing 150 years after the events, Emenon was count of Poitou in 838, when King [[Pippin I of Aquitaine]] died. He supported the succession of Pippin's son, [[Pippin II of Aquitaine|Pippin II]], but the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] instead bestowed the kingdom of Aquitaine on his own youngest son, [[Charles the Bald|Charles]].{{sfn|Dillange|1995|p=33–34}} Bernard was resident in [[Poitiers]] in 839, when the emperor led an army against it, forcing Emenon to flee to their brother Turpio at Angoulême and Bernard to flee to [[Renaud d'Herbauges|Renaud]], [[Herbauges|count of Herbauges]]. Ademar of Chabannes refers to Bernard as a "Poitevin count", ''comes pictavinus'', but it is not clear if he means to imply that Bernard was count of Poitou at this time or just that he held the rank of count and was from the Poitou.{{sfn|Saint-Phalle|2000|p=160}} Louis named [[Ranulf I of Aquitaine|Ranulf I]] as count of Poitou in Emenon's place.{{sfn|Dillange|1995|p=45–47}}

Although Bernard fled to Renaud of Herbauges, this does not indicate that Bernard was in revolt, since Renaud was a loyal supporter of Emperor Louis and King Charles.{{sfn|Saint-Phalle|2000|p=160}} In 840, Emenon submitted to the emperor and it is possible that Bernard did the same. Louis died on 20 June 840, and during the ensuing civil war between his sons, Pippin II seized control of Aquitaine. He besieged Poitiers, which resisted under its bishop, [[Ebroin (bishop of Poitiers)|Ebroin]], until he was forced to retreat by Charles's army.{{sfn|Dillange|1995|p=37–38}} It is not clear if Bernard was appointed count by Pippin II in opposition to Ranulf, or if he was appointed by Charles to oppose Pippin. In any case, there is no evidence that during this time the city of Poitiers was administered by anyone other than the bishop, who was present on the scene, unlike Bernard or Ranulf.{{sfn|Dillange|1995|p=45–47}}

During the civil war, Bernard joined Renaud of Herbauges in putting down the rebellion of [[Lambert II of Nantes|Lambert]], son of Count [[Lambert I of Nantes]]. Renaud died in 843 and his son [[Hervé d'Herbauges|Hervé]] continued the fight against Lambert. Bernard was killed in combat in February 844.{{sfn|Saint-Phalle|2000|p=160}}{{sfn|Dillange|1995|p=45–47}}

Bernard's wife was Belihildis, known only from a [[Papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope John VIII]] excommunicating her son, Marquis [[Bernard of Gothia]]. The ''Historia inventionis et translationis reliquiarium Sancti Baudelli martyris''{{efn|A record of the discovery and transfer of the relics of Saint [[Baudilus]].}} records that her son had an uncle named Gauzlin who was an abbot before he was a bishop. This most likely refers to [[Joscelin (bishop of Paris)|Gauzlin]], abbot of [[Abbey of Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and then [[bishop of Paris]]. He was a son of Count [[Rorgon I of Maine]] and Bilichildis (a variant of Belihildis), who were thus most likely the parents of Bernard's wife as well. Besides Bernard of Gothia, Bernard and Belihildis had another son named Emenon.

The '''Byl's loop''' is an [[artificial life]]form similar in concept to [[Langton's loops|Langton's loop]]. It is a two-dimensional, 5-neighbor [[cellular automaton]] with 6 states per cell, and was developed in 1989 by John Byl, from the Department of Mathematical Sciences of [[Trinity Western University]].

== Details ==
The Byl's loop was developed just a few years after Langton's simplification of [[Codd's automaton]], which produced a simpler automaton that would reproduce itself in 151 time-steps. John Byl simplified Langton's automaton further, with an even smaller automaton that reproduced in just 25 time-steps. Byl's automaton consisted of an array of 12 chips — of which 4 or 5 could be counted as the instruction tape — and 43 transition rules, while Langton's device consisted of some 10×15 chips, including an instruction tape of 33 chips, plus some 190 transition rules.

Essentially, the simplification consisted in using fewer cellular states (6 as compared with Langton's 8) and a smaller replicating loop (12 cells as compared with Langton's 86).

'''Cognitive robotics ''' is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to [[Robot learning|learn]] and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world. Cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[embodied embedded cognition]].

==Core issues==

While traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world, translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable. [[philosophy of perception|Perception]] and [[motor cognition|action]] and the notion of [[Mental representation|symbolic representation]] are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics.

==Starting point==

Cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing, as opposed to more traditional [[Artificial Intelligence]] techniques. Target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing, attention allocation, [[anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipation]], planning, complex motor coordination, reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states. Robotic cognition embodies the behavior of [[intelligent agent]]s in the physical world (or a virtual world, in the case of simulated cognitive robotics). Ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world.

==Learning techniques==

===Motor Babble===
{{main|Motor babbling}}

A preliminary robot learning technique called [[motor babbling]] involves correlating pseudo-random complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual and/or auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to ''expect'' a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output. Desired sensory feedback may then be used to inform a motor control signal. This is thought to be analogous to how a baby learns to reach for objects or learns to produce speech sounds. For simpler robot systems, where for instance inverse kinematics may feasibly be used to transform anticipated feedback (desired motor result) into motor output, this step may be skipped.

===Imitation===

Once a robot can coordinate its motors to produce a desired result, the technique of ''learning by imitation'' may be used. The robot monitors the performance of another agent and then the robot tries to imitate that agent. It is often a challenge to transform imitation information from a complex scene into a desired motor result for the robot. Note that imitation is a high-level form of cognitive behavior and imitation is not necessarily required in a basic model of embodied animal cognition.

===Knowledge acquisition===

A more complex learning approach is "autonomous knowledge acquisition": the robot is left to explore the environment on its own. A system of goals and beliefs is typically assumed.

A somewhat more directed mode of exploration can be achieved by "curiosity" algorithms, such as Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/ims.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-neurorobotics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or Category-Based Intrinsic Motivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.slc.edu/~jmarshall/papers/cbim-epirob09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms generally involve breaking sensory input into a finite number of categories and assigning some sort of prediction system (such as an [[Artificial Neural Network]]) to each. The prediction system keeps track of the error in its predictions over time. Reduction in prediction error is considered learning. The robot then preferentially explores categories in which it is learning (or reducing prediction error) the fastest.

==Other architectures==

Some researchers in cognitive robotics have tried using architectures such as ([[ACT-R]] and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]]) as a basis of their cognitive robotics programs. These highly modular symbol-processing architectures have been used to simulate operator performance and human performance when modeling simplistic and symbolized laboratory data. The idea is to extend these architectures to handle real-world sensory input as that input continuously unfolds through time. What is needed is a way to somehow translate the world into a set of symbols and their relationships.

==icb metric systematic manifold== 

drones or subatomic ai are some of the most controversial and greatest representation of sentient robotics and their processing or what the common people refer and believe in as  quantum computing or plutonic A.I. (not to be confused with platonic A.I.) use string theory or mass sentient (sentient, mass) relativity to conduct a universal occlusion called schripp  or string theory using schripp for the general process and purpose of creating A.I. or icb metric drones uses quantum relativity between two units to synchronize and assimilate a wavelength to cause universal fractal hyper conclusion and create an icb3 geometric manifold and conclude computing singularity units 
hypothetically for units to quantum compute icb3 metric numbers and code computers use a conjunction of high pitched AM frequency to randomize photogenic relay combined with a high axis accelerometer with the implementation and use of quantum source code and with inductive relay for reasoning skills that are very close to the geometric decision based system that the human race used for evolution 
inclusively space time to manifold and icb metric singularity are generally heard in a frequency that is beyond the range of human hearing

==Questions==

Some of the fundamental questions to still be answered in cognitive robotics are:
* How much human programming should or can be involved to support the learning processes?
* How can one quantify progress? Some of the adopted ways is the reward and punishment. But what kind of reward and what kind of punishment? In humans, when teaching a child for example, the reward would be candy or some encouragement, and the punishment can take many forms. But what is an effective way with robots?

==Incident at Burj al Arab hotel==
In April 2011, Lee Brown took a last minute vacation to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where he stayed at the world-renowned [[Burj Al Arab]] luxury hotel, part of the [[Jumeirah Group]]. According to the hotel staff, a Nepalese housekeeper entered his room unannounced and with no form of uniform or identification. In her statement to police she said she thought the room was empty and needed cleaning.&lt;ref name="Gulf News"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Detained Briton died due to natural causes - Dubai attorney general| url= http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/detained-briton-died-due-to-natural-causes-dubai-attorney-general-1.792618| publisher= [[Gulf News]]| date= 14 April 2011| accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff explained that after verbally abusing the maid, an agitated Brown attempted to throw the housekeeper from the internal balcony.&lt;ref name="Gulf News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news|title=British inquiry launched after tourist 'beaten to death in Dubai prison'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/8451050/British-inquiry-launched-after-tourist-beaten-to-death-in-Dubai-prison.html=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another guest at the hotel reported that Brown shouted for staff to call the police as he had 'caught her stealing'. Hotel security and staff intervened, and they subsequently called an ambulance and then later the police, noting that the Nepalese maid required minor medical attention for her injuries.&lt;ref name="Gulf News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; CCTV footage of the incident at the Burj al Arab had been requested but none has been forthcoming to date.

According to Essam Al Humaidan, the Dubai Public Prosecutor, the group of hotel employees that intervened to prevent Brown from throwing the Nepalese maid off the balcony met "violent resistance" as they attempted to contain him.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; According to Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim, then the Dubai Chief of Police, Brown&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Open verdict recorded at inquest into the death of Briton who died in Bur Dubai jail|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/open-verdict-recorded-at-inquest-into-the-death-of-briton-who-died-in-bur-dubai-jail=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; resisted arrest, banging his head against a wall and trying to throw himself from the hotel's balcony.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dubai Police chief blasts ‘speculation’ over jail death Brit|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-police-chief-blasts-speculation-over-jail-death-brit-410172.html=[[Arabian Business]]|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exclusive: 'I shared a cell with Lee Brown'| url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/exclusive-i-shared-a-cell-with-lee-brown-1.796936| publisher= [[Gulf News]]| date= 21 April 2011| accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Police officers also testified that Brown continued to beat on the metal mesh barrier in the patrol car while he was being driven to the police station.&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; Despite repeated claims of Brown's 'violence' nobody received or reported any injuries or other damage. The statement of the booking officer at Bur Dubai Police Station described Brown as 'calm and in good health'.

==Criminal charges and bail denial==
Brown was charged with using abusive language and intimidating behaviour&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; and was denied bail.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Assault by fellow inmates==
Shortly after his arrest, Brown was placed in a cell with other European prisoners. He got along well with his cellmates and four were British. He was moved to solitary confinement after returning from the prosecutor's office with injuries so severe an ambulance was called.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt; Lieutenant General Tamim initially alleged that Brown's injuries were the result of an altercation with other inmates and said in a statement to the press that he would make surveillance camera tapes of the incident available as proof that Brown's behaviour warranted such action. This CCTV footage was requested on numerous occasions by both the Foreign Office in Britain and by the UK coroner but was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dubai Police chief blasts ‘speculation’ over jail death Brit |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-police-chief-blasts-speculation-over-jail-death-brit-410172.html=[[Arabian Business]]|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later statement Tamim retracted what he had previously stated and reported that Brown had caused all his injuries to himself by 'throwing himself to the ground'.

==Health issues in prison==
A European prisoner who shared a cell with Brown described Brown's condition as "terrible" but clarified he did not see him being beaten.&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; The prisoner explained, "I saw him bleeding. He had bruises on his face, shoulder and arms when he asked me for help....he kept saying: ‘Please help me, please help me'."&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; The European prisoner noted that "Brown was half naked with both his hands and legs in cuffs. He wore nothing on top … and no shoes… his pants were hanging well below the waist."&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; The prisoner noted that Brown was not eating, and asked the police to help him.&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; Dubai police noted that Brown had been vomiting the day before his death but added that Brown neither complained about nor sought medical help.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Death==
The [[Foreign Office]] confirmed that Brown died in custody six days after his arrest, on 12 April 2011.&lt;ref name="Alun Palmer" /&gt;

== Allegations of police abuse==
The allegations that Brown was beaten by police originated from four British citizens, who were being held at the same police station on charges unrelated to those of Brown.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; One of the British inmates used his cellular phone to contact the sister-in-law of Brown, Su Brown, after he found her phone number as the next of kin contact in Brown's passport, which had been left in his cell.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Media==
{{POV-check|section|date=December 2014}}
The arrest and subsequent death of the 39-year-old Brown in 2011 caused an international uproar as many publications reported the events surrounding the incident. 

Many British publications even downplayed the fact that the maid had entered his room unannounced, not in uniform and, as Lee's police statement said he found her going through his bags, in what could only be an attempt to steal, and that he was found to have no alcohol in his system. Both these facts were conveniently mis-reported in the heavily controlled UAE press. On 14 April 2011, only two days after Brown's death, and before any forensic examinations had been concluded, the British tabloid [[The Daily Mail]], ran a headline that read, "Briton 'beaten to death' in a Dubai police cell after being arrested for swearing,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Briton 'beaten to death' in a Dubai police cell after being arrested for swearing,
|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1376649/British-tourist-Lee-Bradley-Brown-beaten-death-Dubai-police-cell.html=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reclassified Brown's charge of "using abusive language" as simple "swearing," and altogether neglected to note the additional charges of intimidating behaviour against the Nepalese maid. Likewise, the United Kingdom's newspaper of record, [[The Daily Telegraph]], ran a headline that read, "British inquiry launched after tourist beaten to death".

Following a story that ran two days earlier in the Gulf News about a witness who actually met with Lee Brown's family,&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; the Daily Mail ran a story on 23 April 2011 about a witness, an alleged cellmate of Lee Brown,&lt;ref name="The Daily Mail"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cellmate of Dubai cell-death Briton says he was attacked by SIX guards then left for four days| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1379990/Cellmate-Dubai-cell-death-Briton-Lee-Brown--attacked-SIX-guards.html| publisher= [[The Daily Mail]]| date= 23 April 2011| accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf News reported that Brown only kept repeating, "Please help me, please help me."&lt;ref name="gulfnews.com"/&gt; The Daily Mail reported that the witness stated that Brown begged him, "Please, please help me. Call my embassy, call my family . . . They beat me badly. Please help me otherwise I will die."&lt;ref name="The Daily Mail"/&gt;  

Yet another British newspaper, [[The Independent]], ran a story in 2013, noting that a consultant pathologist, Dr Benjamin Swift, privately hired by Brown's family, had concluded that the irrefutable finding that Brown was under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident was irrelevant and would not have contributed to a death by asphyxiation on his own vomit.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fresh doubts over Briton Lee Bradley Brown’s death in Dubai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/fresh-doubts-over-briton-lee-bradley-browns-death-in-dubai-8595547.htmll=[[The Independent]]|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article asserted that the finding "lends credibility to mounting claims about brutality towards prisoners in the emirate."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; However, the article notably failed to mention that Dr. Swift did not rule out the possibility that Brown nonetheless sustained life-threatening injuries due to being under the influence of the drugs, and even more pointedly, that Dr. Swift explicitly ruled out violent trauma as a possible cause of death.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

==Forensic conclusions==
A preliminary post mortem report, based on an examination performed one week after Brown's death,&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;  stated "the death... was caused by suffocation as result of outflow of vomiting liquids into his respiratory tract,"&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; and noted that hashish was found in Brown's system through analysis of his blood and urine.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The report of the Dubai authorities noted that Brown suffered irregular bruising on the left side of the forehead, as well as bruising on the nose and on the inner arm.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt;

An examination of Brown's body by British officials one week later found no evidence that Brown had vomit in his airways.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt; Another post-mortem examination was carried out ahead of the British inquest into his death by consultant pathologist, Dr Benjamin Swift in 2012, at the behest of Brown's family.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Dr. Swift concluded that the finding about cannabis was "not relevant" – adding that the drug had not "caused or contributed to his death".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; However, Dr. Swift also discounted violent trauma as a possible cause of death, describing the bruising as "light".&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

An official inquest was conducted at Walthamstow Coroner’s Court in East London, and this proceeding was attended by Brown’s mother, Doris Shafi, his brother, Steven, and his sister-in-law Su Brown.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt; Unusually, no witnesses were called and no other evidence other than the post mortem reports was permitted. No CCTV footage was released by the Dubai authorities, despite references to this footage in UAE press by the Chief of Police and others.

The coroner, Chinyere Inyama, rejected the efforts of barrister John Lofthouse, to draw attention away from the evidence by citing the conflicts between the forensic findings of Emirati and British officials, reminding him that his submissions bore no relevance to the inquest’s role, which was limited to a determination of the cause of death.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt; As such, the British coroner returned an open verdict, indicating that there was insufficient evidence to prove either an unlawful nor a natural cause of death,&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt; which effectively served to leave doubts about the circumstances of Lee Brown's death.&lt;ref name="thenational.ae"/&gt;

The animal belongs to the genus Eriovixia. It was discovered in 2015 in the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]] by Javed Ahmed, Rajashree Khalap and Sumukha Javagal. The discoverers of this new spider thought it resembled the [[Sorting Hat]] of the [[Harry Potter books]]. So they named it after [[Godric Gryffindor]], the original owner of the sorting hat. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/New-spider-named-after-Harry-Potter-character/articleshow/55918535.cms New spider named after Harry Potter character, Times of India, 11 december 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

E. gryffindori is the most recent and possibly the most well-known of the 21 species of the genus [[Eriovixia]]. These spiders reside mostly in the tropical regions of Asia. Many species in this genus group are also known for their unconventional appearance. For example, the [[Orb-weaver spider|Orb-Web Spider]] from Thailand boasts a bright yellow abdomen, while the species [[c:Eriovixia_pseudocentrodes|E. pseudocentrodes]] brandishes a hat-like shape, similar to it's cousin E. gryffindori.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eriovixiagryffindori.org/|title=Meet the spider that looks like a Hogwarts sorting-hat – Eriovixia gryffindori|last=Blyth|first=Alison|date=2018-05-24|website=EriovixiaGryffindori.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discovered in the mountainous Western Ghats region of south-western India.

there are several [[algorithm]]s for locating [[landmark]]s in images such as [[satellite map]]s, [[medical image]]s etc.&lt;br /&gt;
nowadays [[evolutionary algorithm]]s such as [[particle swarm optimization]] are so useful to perform this task. evolutionary algorithms generally have two phase, training and test.

in the training phase, we try to learn the algorithm to locate landmark correctly. this phase performs in some [[iteration]]s and finally in the last iteration we hope to obtain a system that can locate the landmark, correctly. in the particle swarm optimization there are some [[particle]]s that search for the landmark. each particle uses a specific [[formula]] in each iteration to optimizes the [[landmark detecting]].

The fundamental particle swarm optimization algorithm used in training phase generally as follows:

Randomly initialise 100 individuals in the [[Mathematical optimization#Optimization problems|search space]] in the range [-1,1]&lt;br /&gt;
LOOP UNTIL 100 iterations performed OR [[detection error]] of gbest is 0%&lt;br /&gt;
FOR each particle p&lt;br /&gt;
Detection errors at x = 0&lt;br /&gt;
FOR each image i in training set&lt;br /&gt;
FOR each pixel coordinate c in i&lt;br /&gt;
Evaluate x of p on visual features at c&lt;br /&gt;
IF evaluation is highest so far for i THEN&lt;br /&gt;
Detected position in i = c&lt;br /&gt;
IF distance between detected position and marked-up position &gt; 2mm THEN&lt;br /&gt;
Detection errors at x = Detection errors at x + 1&lt;br /&gt;
Fitness of p at x = 1- ( Detection errors at x /Total no. of images in training set)&lt;br /&gt;
IF new _tness of p at x &gt; previous _tness of p at pbest THEN&lt;br /&gt;
pbest _tness of p = new _tness of p at x&lt;br /&gt;
pbest position of p = x of p

IF new _tness of p at x &gt; previous gbest _tness THEN&lt;br /&gt;
gbest _tness = new _tness of p at x&lt;br /&gt;
gbest position of p = x of p&lt;br /&gt;
FOR each particle p&lt;br /&gt;
Calculate v of p&lt;br /&gt;
IF magnitude of v &gt; v max THEN&lt;br /&gt;
Magnitude of v = v max&lt;br /&gt;
Move x of p to next position using v&lt;br /&gt;
IF x of p outside [-1,1] range THEN&lt;br /&gt;
x of p = -1 or 1 as appropriate&lt;br /&gt;
REPEAT&lt;br /&gt;
Output gbest of last iteration as trained detector d

'''Francesco "Franco" Scoglio''' ({{IPA-it|ˈfraŋko ˈskɔʎʎo}}; 2 May 1941 &amp;ndash; 3 October 2005&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Johnston-takes-over-as-manager.2666933.jp |title=Johnston takes over as manager of MetroStars |publisher=The Scotsman |author=Brian Trusdell |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[association football|football]] manager who coached at both national and international level.

==Biography==
Francesco Scoglio was born in [[Lipari]], in the [[province of Messina]], [[Italy]].
 
Nicknamed ''il Professore'' (the Professor) because of his past teaching activity (he was a [[pedagogy]] graduate), Scoglio never actually had a playing career. He started a managing career in 1972 in one of the [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] youth teams. He then went on coaching at amateur and Serie C levels in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]] (Gioiese, [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina]], [[A.S. Acireale|Acireale]], Akragas). It was Scoglio who discovered the great potential of [[Salvatore Schillaci]], one of his players during Scoglio's second stint in Messina.

However, Scoglio is most remembered for his time in [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa CFC]], which was also the team for which he first coached. He achieved great success with his next clubs, being often fired before the end of the season. He is also known for having coached the national teams of [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and [[Libya national football team|Libya]]. Under his management, [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] reached the semi-finals of the [[2000 African Cup of Nations]]. His last coaching (and unsuccessful) experience was on 2002–2003 for [[S.S.C. Napoli|SSC Napoli]].

Scoglio then became a very popular TV commentator on football shows in Italy, and even worked for [[Al Jazeera]] as the technical expert reporting on the Italian league.

==Death==
On 3 October 2005, Scoglio was appearing on a regional television station in [[Genoa]],&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt; having a rather heated and passionate, yet civil, discussion with current Genoa president [[Enrico Preziosi]]. While Preziosi was answering one of Scoglio's charges, Scoglio lost consciousness and slumped in his chair. He died of an apparent heart attack shortly thereafter. This dramatic event fulfilled his own prophecy "Morirò parlando del Genoa" ('I'll die talking about Genoa CFC').&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|kLkCLZ9Kh08|Franco Scoglio dies live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Following his death, in 2016 the city of [[Messina]], the provincial capital of his birthplace as well as the home of [[A.C.R. Messina|ACR Messina]], a club he coached for many years, honoured his memory by renaming [[Stadio San Filippo|the local stadium]] after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stampalibera.it/2016/01/21/messina-il-san-filippo-intitolato-a-scoglio-patti-pronti-a-ricordare-anche-ciccio-curro/ |publisher=Stampa Libera.it |language=Italian |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=21 January 2016 |title=MESSINA, E' UFFICIALE: Il San Filippo intitolato a FRANCO SCOGLIO.

'''Francis Albert Sinatra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|r|ə}}; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], having sold more than 150{{nbsp}}million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2015/jun/08/steve-wynn-celebrate-100th-birthday-late-frank-sin/|title=Steve Wynn to celebrate 100th birthday of the late Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas|last=Leach|first=Robin|date=June 8, 2015|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], to [[Italian Americans]], Sinatra began his musical career in the [[swing era]] with bandleaders [[Harry James]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]]. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the "[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).

Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. &amp; Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and reached success in 1980 with "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.

Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. In crime, the FBI investigated Sinatra and his alleged relationship with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].

While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people.]] After his death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century",&lt;ref name="Christgau" /&gt; and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}

In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a [[Roadhouse (facility)#United States|roadhouse]] called "The Rustic Cabin" in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], for which he was paid $15 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Hodge|1y=1992|1p=11|2a1=Rojek|2y=2004|2p=41}} The roadhouse was connected to the [[WBBR|WNEW]] radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group live during the ''Dance Parade'' show.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=27}} Despite the low salary, Sinatra felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to "become so big that no one could ever touch him".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=46}} In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station WAAT where both performed on live broadcasts, arranged for him to audition and record "[[Our Love (song)|Our Love]]", his first solo studio recording.&lt;ref name=CoyneK /&gt;{{efn| Only one copy of this recording was made, a 78&amp;nbsp;rpm disc.

[[File:Tommy dorsey playing trombone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tommy Dorsey]] in ''[[The Fabulous Dorseys]]'' (1947)]]
Sinatra became increasingly frustrated with the status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend [[Hank Sanicola]] persuaded him to stay with the group,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=54}} but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard{{efn|the vocalist, not to be confused with the comedian [[Jack E.

Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in [[Chicago]],{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=135}} and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract.&lt;ref name=pc1a&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|A}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sinatra acknowledged his debt to James throughout his life, and upon hearing of James' death in 1983, stated: "he is the one that made it all possible."{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=24}}}} On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the [[Coronado Theatre]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]],{{sfn|Silva|2000|p=12}} opening the show with "[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]".{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=94}} Dorsey recalled: "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no [[matinée idol]]. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59–60}} Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a [[father figure]]. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter [[Nancy Sinatra|Nancy]] in June 1940.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1pp=59–60|2a1=Lahr|2y=2000|2p=59}} Sinatra later said that "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey".{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=1}} Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer [[Buddy Rich]] were bitter rivals,{{efn|Kelley claims that arguments and fights regularly broke out between Sinatra and Rich, who were both arrogant with volatile tempers. In one incident witnessed by Stafford backstage at the [[Astor Hotel]] in New York, Rich called Sinatra a name and Sinatra threw a heavy glass pitcher filled with water and ice at Rich's head. In another incident at the [[Golden Gate Theater]] in San Francisco, Rich reportedly attempted to ram Sinatra against the wall with his high F cymbal.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=58–59}}}} other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band.

In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song "[[Polka Dots and Moonbeams]]" in late April 1940.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} Two more chart appearances followed with "[[Say It (Frank Sinatra song)|Say It]]" and "[[Imagination (1940 song)|Imagination]]", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} His fourth chart appearance was "[[I'll Never Smile Again]]", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.{{sfnm|1a1=Whitburn|1y=1986|1p=136|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=91}} Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by [[RCA Victor]] include "[[Our Love Affair]]" and "Stardust" in 1940; "[[Oh!

Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]", "[[The Night We Called It a Day (song)|The Night We Called It a Day]]", "[[The Song is You]]", and "[[Lamplighter's Serenade]]" at a Bluebird recording session, with [[Axel Stordahl]] as arranger and conductor.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Lees|2y=1998|2p=97}} Sinatra first heard the recordings at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] and [[Hollywood Plaza Hotel|Hollywood Plaza]] and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=67}}

After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=67–68}} with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby,{{efn|Sinatra said: "The reason I wanted to leave Tommy's band was that Crosby was Number One, way up on top of the pile. In the open field, you might say, were some awfully good singers with the orchestras. Bob Eberly (with [[Jimmy Dorsey]]) was a fabulous vocalist. [[Perry Como|Mr. Como]] (with [[Ted Weems]]) is such a wonderful singer. I thought, if I don't make a move out of this and try to do it on my own soon, one of those guys will do it, and I'll have to fight all three of them to get a position".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}}} but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}  A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1942.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}}{{efn|Sinatra's lawyer, Henry Jaffe, met with Dorsey's lawyer N. Joseph Ross in Los Angeles in August 1943. In the words of Kelley: "In the end, MCA, an agency representing Dorsey and courting Sinatra, made Dorsey a $60,000 offer that he accepted. To obtain Frank as a client, the agency paid Dorsey $35,000 while Sinatra paid $25,000, which he borrowed from Manie Sacks as an advance against his royalties from Columbia Records. MCA agreed that until 1948 it would split its commissions on Sinatra with GAC, the agency that Frank had signed with when he left the Dorsey band."{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}} However, during a 1979 concert at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles, Sinatra claimed that it took him years to escape the contract, and that Dorsey had cost him seven million dollars.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=72}}}} On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, "I hope you fall on your ass".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}} He replaced Sinatra with singer [[Dick Haymes]].&lt;ref name=pc1a /&gt; Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, [[Willie Moretti]], coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding a gun to his head.{{sfn|Anastasia|Macnow|Pistone|2011|p=301}}{{efn|The incident started rumors of Sinatra's involvement with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], and was fictionalized in the book and film ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Levinson|2009|p=161}}}} Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey.{{Sfn|Goldstein|1982|p=9}} Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=71}}

All this for a fellow I never heard of."{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=44}} Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the [[Benny Goodman]] orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as "Swoonatra" or "The Voice", and his fans "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, and within a few weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=76}} Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=78, 99}} When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in.{{sfn|Roby|2010|p=111}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/frank-sinatra-pop-star|title=The Columbus Day riot: Frank Sinatra is pop's first star |work=The Guardian|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Booker|2004|p=79}}  Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his [[bow-tie]].{{sfn|Booker|2004|pp=79–80}}

Sinatra did not serve in the military during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified [[Class 1-A|4-F]] ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum. However, U.S. Army files reported that Sinatra was "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional instability was hidden to avoid "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=45}} Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist [[Walter Winchell]] that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, but the FBI found this to be without merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Sinatra FBI Files Opened|first=Bill|last=Holland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=walter+winchell#v=snippet&amp;q=walter%20winchell|date=December 19, 1998|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=314}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Frank%20Sinatra|title=Vault {{ndash}} Frank Sinatra|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]|location=USA|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas [[USO]] tours with comedian [[Phil Silvers]].{{sfn|Andrews|Gilbert|1993|p=293}} During one trip to Rome he met the [[Pope Pius XII|Pope]], who asked him if he was an operatic tenor.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=115–116}}  Sinatra worked frequently with the popular [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]] in radio in the 1940s,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=228}} and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] (AFRS).{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=80}} In 1944 Sinatra released "[[I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night]]" as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", and the following year he released "[[I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)]]", "[[Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)]]", "[[Dream (1944 song)|Dream]]", and "[[Nancy (with the Laughing Face)]]" as singles.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=568}}

=== Columbia years and career slump (1946–1952) ===
[[File:Frank Sinatra Metronome magazine November 1950.JPG|thumb|Sinatra in November 1950]]
Despite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946 he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=150}}

In 1946 Sinatra released "[[Oh!

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Sinatra "took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", and that his "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-voice-of-frank-sinatra-mw0000659223|title=The Voice of Frank Sinatra|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon selling ten million records a year.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=129}} Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged with the release of the set ''[[Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder]]'', an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at the time, which consisted of teenage girls.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=21}} The following year he released his second album, ''[[Songs by Sinatra]]'', featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[How Deep is the Ocean?]]" and [[Harold Arlen]]'s and [[Jerome Kern]]'s "[[All The Things You Are]]".{{sfn|Osborne|2014|p=98}} "[[Mam'selle]]", composed by [[Edmund Goulding]] with lyrics by [[Mack Gordon]] for the film ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1946),{{Sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=236}} was released as a single.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra had competition; versions by [[Art Lund]], [[Dick Haymes]], [[Dennis Day]], and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6h8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=Mam'selle%20billboard|work=Billboard|title=Most Played Juke Box Records|p=23|date=May 31, 1947|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December he recorded "[[Sweet Lorraine]]" with the [[Metronome All-Stars]], featuring talented jazz musicians such as [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Harry Carney]] and [[Charlie Shavers]], with [[Nat King Cole]] on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as "one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}}

Sinatra's third album, ''[[Christmas Songs by Sinatra]]'', was originally released in 1948 as a 78&amp;nbsp;rpm album set,{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=47–48}} and a 10" LP record was released two years later.{{sfn|Larkin|2002|p=397}} When Sinatra was featured as a priest in ''[[The Miracle of the Bells]]'', due to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time,{{efn|Sinatra was spotted in Havana in 1946 with mobster [[Lucky Luciano]], which started a series of negative press articles, implicating Sinatra with the Mafia.{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} In 1947 he was involved in a violent incident with journalist [[Lee Mortimer]], who had written some of the most scathing articles on his alleged connections. Kelley claims that his articles grew so offensive that Sinatra pounced on him outside Ciro's and punched him behind the left ear in response to an insult in which he was called a "dago". Sinatra was taken to court, and according to Kelley, Mortimer received Mafia threats to drop the case or lose his life.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=139–141}}}} it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in wages from the film to the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} By the end of 1948, Sinatra had slipped to fourth on Down Beat's annual poll of most popular singers (behind [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Frankie Laine]], and Bing Crosby).{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=149}} and in the following year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 1943.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=158}} ''[[Frankly Sentimental]]'' (1949) was panned by ''Down Beat'', who commented that "for all his talent, it seldom comes to life".{{Sfn|Shaw|1968|p=131}}

Though "[[The Hucklebuck]]" reached the top ten,{{Sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=301}} it was his last single release under the Columbia label.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra's last two albums with Columbia, ''[[Dedicated to You (Frank Sinatra album)|Dedicated to You]]'' and ''[[Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra]]'', were released in 1950.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=218}} Sinatra would later feature a number of the ''Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra'' album's songs, including "[[Lover (song)|Lover]]", "[[It's Only a Paper Moon (song)|It's Only a Paper Moon]]", "[[It All Depends on You]]", on his 1961 Capitol release, ''[[Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!]]''.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=67}}

Cementing the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans from a heart attack in January 1950 at 48. According to [[Jimmy Van Heusen]], Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was "an enormous shock which defies words", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the bobbysoxers.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=161}} Sinatra's reputation continued to decline as reports broke out in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy,{{sfn|Small|2009|p=59}} though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he had met Gardner.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=162}} In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copa]] club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to suffering a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=168–169}} Evans once said that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to emotional tension which "absolutely destroyed him".{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}}

In financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=172}} Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to [[Las Vegas]] and made his debut at the [[Desert Inn]] in September 1951,{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=48}} and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in [[Reno, Nevada]].

Rojek notes that the [[Rat Pack]] "provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks", but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an "unassailable command over the other performers".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=136}} Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's single-engine plane.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=97}} On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]], after an invitation by the manager [[Jack Entratter]],{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=189}} who had previously worked at the Copa in New York.{{sfn|Ainlay|Gabaldon|2003|p=108}} Sinatra typically performed there three times a year, and later acquired a share in the hotel.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=243|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2011|2p=656}}{{efn|Sinatra bought a two percent share in the hotel for $54,000.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=656}} At one point the share reached nine percent.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=245}} He was reportedly ordered to sell his interest in the Sands in 1963, due to his association with mobster [[Sam Giancana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2881720/sinatra_drives_golf_cart_through_sands/|title=Sinatra Hit in Mouth in Vegas Melee|work=The Times ([[San Mateo, California]])|date=September 12, 1967|page=8|accessdate=July 29, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sinatra's decline in popularity was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief run at the Paramount in New York he drew small audiences.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}} At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=529}} At a concert at [[Chez Paree]] in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=529}} By April 1952 he was performing at the [[Kauai County Fair]] in Hawaii.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=93}} Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] executive [[Mitch Miller]] claiming he "couldn't give away" the singer's records.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Miller tried to offset Sinatra's declining record sales by introducing "gimmicky novel tunes" into the singer's repertoire such as "Mama Will Bark" to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;ref name="columbia-yrs-hemming-36"&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Best of the Columbia Years: 1943–1952 |title-link=The Best of the Columbia Years: 1943–1952 |year=1995 |chapter=Sinatra Standards |first=Hemming |last=Roy |page=36 |type=booklet |publisher=SONY Music Entertainment |id=C4K 64681 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=476–477}} "Mama Will Bark" is often cited as the worst of Sinatra's career.

=== Career revival and the Capitol years (1953–1962) ===

[[File:Nelson Riddle 1958.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Nelson Riddle]], Sinatra's album arranger for Capitol Records]]
The release of the film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival.{{sfn|Kidder|Oppenheim|2008|p=157}} Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an "unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts",{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=187}} in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as "a new and brilliant phase".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=188}} On March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with Capitol Records vice president [[Alan Livingston]] and signed a seven-year recording contract.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=601}} His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl conducting.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=604, 615}} The session produced four recordings, including "[[I'm Walking Behind You]]",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=604}} Sinatra's first Capitol single.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=101}} After spending two weeks on location in Hawaii filming ''From Here to Eternity'', Sinatra returned to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with [[Nelson Riddle]], an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole's musical director.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=614–615, 618}} After recording the first song, "[[I've Got the World on a String]]", Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, "Beautiful!",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=616}} and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, exclaiming, "I'm back, baby, I'm back!"{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}}

In subsequent sessions in May and November 1953,{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=33}} Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} Sinatra's first album for Capitol, ''[[Songs for Young Lovers]]'', was released on January 4, 1954, and included "[[A Foggy Day]]", "[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]", "[[My Funny Valentine]]", "[[Violets for Your Furs]]" and "[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]",{{sfnm|1a1=Kline|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Granata|2y=2003|2p=91}} songs which became staples of his later concerts.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC57" /&gt; That same month, Sinatra released the single "[[Young at Heart (Frank Sinatra song)|Young at Heart]]", which reached #2 and was awarded Song of the Year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=O'Brien|2y=2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinatrafamily.com/single/young-at-heart-125/|title=Young at Heart|publisher=Sinatra Discography|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/young-at-heart-mw0000867619/awards|title=Young at Heart album awards|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sinatra was not very enthusiastic about the song initially. His friend, Jimmy Van Heusen, convinced him that the song would be a success.{{sfn|O'Brien|2014}} ''Young at Heart'' was produced by Day's husband at the time, [[Marty Melcher]], whom Sinatra detested. Their feud grew worse when Melcher suggested that Day sing "Young at Heart" as the film's title song when Sinatra's recording of the song was already a hit. Day conceded that she did not care whose voice was heard singing the film's title song. Because of the rift, the ''Young at Heart'' soundtrack album contains all the songs heard in the film but the title ''Young at Heart''. Sinatra's hit recording is heard at the beginning and end of the film.{{sfn|Bret|2014|p=63}}}} In March, he recorded and released the single "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]", a "powerful ballad"&lt;ref name="Inc.1954"&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=The Billboard Music Popularity Charts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YB8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=May 8, 1954|page=22|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reached #4.{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}} Sinatra's second album with Riddle, ''[[Swing Easy!]]'', which reflected his "love for the jazz idiom" according to Granata,{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} was released on August 2 of that year and included "[[Just One of Those Things (song)|Just One of Those Things]]", "[[Taking a Chance on Love]]", "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]", and "[[All of Me (Ruth Etting song)|All of Me]]".{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}}&lt;ref name="Inc.1965"&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=The Sinatra Discography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT117|date=November 20, 1965|page=117|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Swing Easy!'' was named Album of the Year by ''Billboard'', and he was also named "Favorite Male Vocalist" by ''Billboard'', ''Down Beat'', and ''[[Metronome]]'' that year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=Evanier|2y=2011|2p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Artists Favorites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|date=November 13, 1954|page=42|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra came to consider Riddle "the greatest arranger in the world",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}} and Riddle, who considered Sinatra "a perfectionist",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} offered equal praise of the singer, observing, "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable&amp;nbsp;... there is still no one who can approach him."{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}}

In 1955 Sinatra released ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'', his first 12" LP,{{Sfn|Smith|2009|p=18}}  featuring songs such as "[[In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning]]", "[[Mood Indigo]]", "[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]" and "[[When Your Lover Has Gone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-wee-small-hours-mw0000650776|title=In the Wee Small Hours|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 9, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204131932/http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-wee-small-hours-mw0000650776|archivedate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Granata it was the first [[concept album]] of his to make a "single persuasive statement", with an extended program and "melancholy mood".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=302}} Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in the development of ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'', sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956.{{Sfn|Weatherford|2001|p=14}} It features a recording of "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]" by [[Cole Porter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_i5f3jhD9UC|title=The New York Times Guide to the Arts of the 20th Century: 1900–1929 – A New Family and A New Fame|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|page=3072|isbn=978-1-57958-290-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}}

His February 1956 recording sessions inaugurated the studios at the [[Capitol Records Building]],{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=22}} complete with a 56-piece symphonic orchestra.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=117}} According to Granata his recordings of "Night and Day", "Oh! Look At Me Now" and "[[From This Moment On (Cole Porter song)|From This Moment On]]" revealed "powerful sexual overtones, stunningly achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra's best-teasing vocal lines", while his recording of "River, Stay 'Way from My Door" in April demonstrated his "brilliance as a syncopational improviser".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=98}} Riddle said that Sinatra took "particular delight" in singing "The Lady is a Tramp", commenting that he "always sang that song with a certain amount of salaciousness", making "cue tricks" with the lyrics.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=236}} His penchant for conducting was displayed again in 1956's ''[[Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color]]'', an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|pp=21–22}} Also that year, Sinatra sang at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], and performed with [[The Dorsey Brothers]] for a week soon afterwards at the Paramount Theatre.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=95}}
[[File:Frank Sinatra in 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sinatra in 1957]]
In 1957, Sinatra released ''[[Close to You (Frank Sinatra album)|Close to You]]'', ''[[A Swingin' Affair!]]'' and ''[[Where Are You? (Frank Sinatra album)|Where Are You?]]''—his first album in stereo, with [[Gordon Jenkins]].{{sfn|Morrell|2013|p=40}} Granata considers "Close to You" to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the "golden" era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was "extremely progressive" by the standards of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs "[[With Every Breath I Take]]", "[[Blame It On My Youth]]" and  "[[It Could Happen to You (song)|It Could Happen to You]]".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=121}} For Granata, Sinatra's ''A Swingin' Affair!'' and swing music predecessor ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers!'' solidified "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". [[Buddy Collette]] considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], and stated that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}} On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the [[McCaw Hall|Seattle Civic Auditorium]],{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=138}} his first appearance in [[Seattle]] since 1945.&lt;ref name="SC57"&gt;''Sinatra '57 in Concert'' (1999), [[Artanis Entertainment Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 [[Artanis Entertainment Group]] officially released it as the ''[[Sinatra '57 in Concert]]'' live album, after Sinatra's death.&lt;ref name="LAT99"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilburn, Robert|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/11/entertainment/ca-45246|title=Getting a Kick Out of Sinatra, Live in Concert in 1957|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1999|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Sinatra released the concept album ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' with [[Billy May]], designed as a musical world tour.{{Sfnm|1a1=Mirtle|1y=1998|1pp=154–155|2a1=Turner|2y=2004|2p=107}} It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks,{{sfn|Whitburn|2001|p=797}} and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] at the [[1st Grammy Awards|inaugural Grammy Awards]].{{Sfn|Mirtle|1998|p=155}} The title song, "[[Come Fly with Me (1957 song)|Come Fly With Me]]", written especially for him, would become one of his best known standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Theatre Record, Volume 7, Issues 14–26 – Sammy Cahn Words And Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uClaAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=I.

In the words of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was "not simply the leader of the Rat Pack" but had "assumed the position of ''il padrone'' in Hollywood". He was asked by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended by President [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on September 19, 1959.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=287–288}} ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'', a collection of ballads, topped the  ''Billboard'' chart in October 1960 and remained in the charts for 86 weeks, {{Sfn|Fuchs|Prigozy|2007|p=101}} winning critical plaudits.{{Sfn|Campbell|2008|p=220}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Cap Captures Honors at Disc Jockey Poll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|date=December 19, 1960|page=2|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granata noted the "lifelike ambient sound" quality of ''Nice and Easy'', the perfection in the stereo balance, and the "bold, bright and snappy" sound of the band.

=== Reprise years (1961–1981) ===
[[File:Dean Martin, Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra in 1962.jpg|thumb|Sinatra with [[Dean Martin]] and [[Judy Garland]] in 1962]]
Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol, and fell into a feud with [[Alan Livingston]], which lasted over six months.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=146}} His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label, [[Verve Records]], which ended once an initial agreement with Verve founder, [[Norman Granz]], "failed to materialize."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/reprise-records-history/|title=To Play and Play Again: How Frank Sinatra's Thirst for Creative Freedom Led to Some of Classic Rock's Greatest Records|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to form his own label, [[Reprise Records]]{{Sfnm|1a1=Friedwald|1y=1995|1p=367|2a1=Rojek|2y=2004|2p=142}} and, in an effort to assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, working with other arrangers such as [[Neil Hefti]], [[Don Costa]], and [[Quincy Jones]].{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=153}}  Sinatra built the appeal of Reprise Records as one in which artists were promised creative control over their music, as well as a guarantee that they would eventually gain "complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/article/label-retrospective-sinatra-forms-reprise-records-on-this-day-in-1960|title=Label Retrospective: Sinatra forms Reprise Records on this day in 1960 {{!}} Rhino|website=www.rhino.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Sinatra the company developed into a music industry "powerhouse", and he later sold it for an estimated $80{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=340}} His first album on the label, ''[[Ring-a-Ding-Ding!]]'' (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on ''Billboard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Cliff Richard a Four-Time Winner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jiAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|date=December 11, 1961|first=Espen|last=Eriksen|page=26|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released in February 1961, the same month that Reprise Records released [[Ben Webster]]'s ''[[The Warm Moods]]'', Sammy Davis, Jr.'s ''The Wham of Sam'', [[Mavis Chloe Rivers|Mavis River]]'s ''Mavis'' and [[Joe E.

In 1962, Sinatra released ''[[Sinatra and Strings]]'', a set of standard ballads arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra's entire Reprise period.

In 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for ''[[The Concert Sinatra]]'', an ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35&amp;nbsp;mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been "impeachable" [sic], "one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an impressive vocal range, particularly in "[[Ol' Man River]]", in which he darkened the hue.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=171–173}}  In 1964 the song "[[My Kind of Town]]" was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1965 | title=The 37th Academy Awards | publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra released ''[[Softly, as I Leave You (album)|Softly, as I Leave You]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/softly-as-i-leave-you-mw0000653242|title=Softly, as I Leave You|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated with Bing Crosby and [[Fred Waring]] on ''[[America, I Hear You Singing]]'', a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F.

=== Later career (1982–1998) ===

[[File:Fremont street 1983.jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra signed a $16 million three-year deal with the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas]] in 1982]]

Santopietro stated that by the early 1980s, Sinatra's voice had "coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, but audiences didn't care".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=431}} In 1982, he signed a $16{{nbsp}}million three-year deal with the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]] of Las Vegas. Kelley notes that by this period Sinatra's voice had grown "darker, tougher and loamier", but he "continued to captivate audiences with his immutable magic". She added that his baritone voice "sometimes cracked, but the gliding intonations still aroused the same raptures of delight as they had at the Paramount Theater".{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=540}} That year he made a reported further $1.3{{nbsp}}million from the Showtime television rights to his "Concert of the Americas" in the Dominican Republic, $1.6{{nbsp}}million for a concert series at [[Carnegie Hall]], and $250,000 in just one evening at the Chicago Fest. He donated a lot of his earnings to charity.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=542}} He put on a performance at the White House for the Italian Prime Minister, and performed at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] with [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[George Shearing]].{{Sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=311}}

Sinatra was selected as one of the five recipients of the 1983 [[Kennedy Center Honors]], alongside [[Katherine Dunham]], [[James Stewart]], [[Elia Kazan]], and [[Virgil Thomson]]. Quoting [[Henry James]], President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that "art was the shadow of humanity" and that Sinatra had "spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=544}} On September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2{{nbsp}}million court case against [[Kitty Kelley]], suing her in punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, ''His Way'', was even published. The book became a best-seller for "all the wrong reasons" and "the most eye-opening [[celebrity biographer|celebrity biography]] of our time", according to [[William Safire]] of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=ESSAY&gt;{{cite news|author=Safire, William|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/opinion/essay-the-truth-about-frank.html|title=Essay: The Truth About Frank|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 1986|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra was always adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself would "set the record straight" in details of his life.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Author's note xvii}} According to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on Sinatra's health. Kelley claims that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father's colon surgery in 1986.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Introduction xv}} He was forced to drop the case on September 19, 1984, with several leading newspapers expressing concerns about his views on censorship.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Author's note xviii}}

In 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for the first time in nearly two decades on the album, ''[[L.A. Is My Lady]]'', which was well received critically.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=188}} The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with [[Lena Horne]], which had to be abandoned.{{efn|Horne developed vocal problems and Sinatra, committed to other engagements, could not wait to record.{{sfn|Gavin|2009|p=444}}}} In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in [[Atlantic City]] and was hospitalized for [[diverticulitis]],{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=55}} which left him looking frail.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=442}} Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=444}}

On June 6, 1988, Sinatra made his last recordings with Reprise for an album which was not released. He recorded "[[My Foolish Heart (song)|My Foolish Heart]]", "[[Cry Me A River (1953 song)|Cry Me A River]]", and other songs. Sinatra never completed the project, but take number 18 of "My Foolish Heart" may be heard in ''[[The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzbreaker.com/2016/08/30/foolish-heart-the-lost-albums-of-frank-sinatra/ ''Foolish Heart: The Lost Albums of Frank Sinatra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brendan Grace with Frank Sinatra.JPG|thumb|left|Sinatra with [[Brendan Grace]] in 1991]]
In 1990, Sinatra was awarded the second "Ella Award" by the Los Angeles-based [[Society of Singers]], and performed for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony.{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=159}} Sinatra maintained an active touring schedule in the early 1990s, performing 65 concerts in 1990, 73 in 1991 and 84 in 1992 in seventeen different countries.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=448}}

In 1993, Sinatra returned to Capitol Records and the recording studio for ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]'', which became his best-selling album.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=451}} The album and its sequel, ''[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]'', released the following year,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=452}} would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.{{sfn|Cole|Browning|Schroeder|2003|p=28}}
During his tours in the early 1990s, his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he fainted onstage in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in March 1994.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=445}} His final public concerts were held in [[Fukuoka Dome]] in Japan on December 19–20, 1994.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=196}} The following year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament.{{sfnm|1a1=Santopietro|1y=2008|1p=452|2a1=Sinatra|2y=2011|2p=274}} ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' reported of the show that Sinatra was "clear, tough, on the money" and "in absolute control".{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=104}} Sinatra was awarded the [[Grammy Legend Award|Legend Award]] at the [[1994 Grammy Awards]], where he was introduced by [[Bono]], who said of him, "Frank's the chairman of the bad attitude&amp;nbsp;...

== Artistry ==
{{Anchor|Sinatra, the musician}}
While Sinatra never learned how to read music well, he had a fine, natural understanding of it,{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=31}} He did, however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semitonal differences.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=38}} Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a "sixth sense", which "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=30}} Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music,{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=21}} and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as [[Puccini]] and [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] masters. His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a "certain feeling" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}} 

By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions:  "Air for Oboe", "Air for English Horn", "Air for Flute", "Air for Bassoon", "Slow Dance" and "Theme and Variations".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard "a couple of little strangers" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra &amp; Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102–103}}

Voice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was "the best singer in the business".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had "perfected the art of intimacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a "fairly rangy voice",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C. Sinatra could "surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of "[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming "precise" and articulation "meticulous".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would "take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95–96}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59–60}}

Arrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a "perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14–16}} 

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a "rhythm" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28–29}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as "Isn't that a pretty ballad" or "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with "childlike delight".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers. Years ago, his voice was more even, and now it is divided into at least three interesting ranges: low, middle, and high. [He's] probing more deeply into his songs than he used to. That may be due to the ten years he's put on, and the things he's been through."|source=—Nelson Riddle noting the development of Sinatra's voice in 1955.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=137}}}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="He'd always been critical of his voice, and that only intensified as he got older. He never liked to discuss a performance afterward because he knew his voice wasn't as good as it used to be. If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible."|source=—Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}
Sinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a "brooding melancholy", such as "[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]", "[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]", "[[My One and Only Love]]" and "[[There Will Never Be Another You]]",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii–xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an "ultra-sensitive" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111–112}}

In the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, "Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length". In the words of author John Lahr, "As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69–70}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, "Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}

Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him,{{Sfn|Young|Young|2010|p=635}} being exceptionally self-confident,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=6}} he was rarely enthusiastic about his own acting, once remarking that "pictures stink".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=57}} Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in ''[[Las Vegas Nights]]'', singing "I'll Never Smile Again" with Tommy Dorsey's Pied Pipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Jazzmen Have Always Favored FS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=November 24, 1973|page=44|first=Leonard|last=Feather|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]]'s ''[[Reveille with Beverly]]'', making a brief appearance singing "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]".{{sfn|Knight|2010|p=80}} The following year he was given leading roles in ''[[Higher and Higher (film)|Higher and Higher]]'' and ''[[Step Lively (1944 film)|Step Lively]]'' for [[RKO Pictures]].{{sfn|Knight|2010|p=16, 20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E6DC1030E53BBC4A51DFB766838F659EDE|title=Lower and Lower |work=The New York Times|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=January 22, 1944|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Montgomery Clift]], and Sinatra, stationed on [[Hawaii]] in the months leading up to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Knight|2010|p=86}} Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss [[Harry Cohn]] had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as "Maggio" in the film.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=210, 214}}{{efn|Sinatra successfully later sued a BBC interviewer who claimed that he'd used his Mafia connections to get the part.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=215}}}} During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend,{{sfn|Wayne|2004|p=164}} and Sinatra later professed that he "learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Out, Issues 82–85 – Sinatra on From Here to Eternity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOXZAAAAMAAJ|date=September 2000|publisher=Out Pub., Incorporated|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of critical and commercial decline, his [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidt |first=M.A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/eternity-ar.html|title=Back on the High Road With a Busy Minstrel|work=The New York Times|date=May 9, 1954|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance also won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]].&lt;ref name=GoldenGlobes&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/frank-sinatra | title=Frank Sinatra at the Golden Globe Awards | publisher=[[Golden Globe Award]]s | accessdate=October 7, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115021651/http://www.goldenglobes.com/frank-sinatra | archivedate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Examiner'' wrote that Sinatra is "simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant", commenting that his death scene is "one of the best ever photographed".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=224}}

[[File:Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sinatra as Tony Rome]]

Due to an obligation he owed to [[20th Century Fox]] for walking off the set of [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' (1956),{{efn|Sinatra had stormed off the set when he learned that the film was to be shot in both Cinemascope and a new 55-millimeter process. Refusing to make "two pictures for the price of one", he left the production and did not return. Fox initially sued Sinatra for a million dollars for breach of contract and replaced him with [[Gordon MacRae]]. Fox agreed to drop the charges on condition that he appear in another picture of theirs.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|p=76}}}} in 1960 Sinatra starred opposite [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Louis Jourdan]] in ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''. He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=273}} Later that year he starred in the Las Vegas-set ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'', the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a "new era of screen cool" for Santopietro.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=285}} Sinatra personally financed the film, and paid Martin and Davis Jr. fees of $150,000 and $125,000 respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=144}} In 1962, Sinatra had a leading role opposite [[Laurence Harvey]] in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=336|2a1=Santopietro|2y=2008|2p=295}} [[Vincent Canby]], writing for the magazine ''Variety'', found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be "a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/the-manchurian-candidate-1200420234/ | title=Review: 'The Manchurian Candidate' | work=Variety | date=October 17, 1962 | accessdate=October 30, 2015 | author=Canby, Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', following it with ''[[4 for Texas]]'' in 1963.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=144}} For his performance in ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]'', he was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.&lt;ref name=GoldenGlobes /&gt;

''[[Von Ryan's Express]]'' in 1965 was a major success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24787/Marriage-on-the-Rocks/articles.html|title=Marriage on the Rocks (1965)|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=October 3, 2015|author=LoBianco, Lorraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/von-ryans-express-1965|title=Von Ryan's Express|work=Time Out|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sinatra directed ''[[None but the Brave]]'' that year.{{sfn|Knight|2010|p=262}} However, in the mid 1960s, [[Brad Dexter]] wanted to "breathe new life" into Sinatra's film career by helping him display the same professional pride in his films as he did his recordings. On one occasion, he gave Sinatra [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962) to read, with the idea of making a film, but Sinatra thought it had no potential and did not understand a word.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=392}}{{efn|The [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] was later made by [[Stanley Kubrick]] in 1971 and is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/movies100.pdf|title=American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest Movies|format=PDF|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics |title=Sight &amp; Sound&amp;nbsp;– Critics' Top 250 Films |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026034922/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics |archivedate=October 26, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1960s, Sinatra became known for playing detectives,{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=388}} including Tony Rome in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967) and its sequel ''[[Lady In Cement]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tony-rome-1967|title=Tony Rome|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=November 22, 1967|accessdate=October 4, 2015|author=Ebert, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01E4DA1230EF34BC4951DFB7678383679EDE|title=Lady in Cement' Here|work=The New York Times|date=November 21, 1968|accessdate=October 4, 2015|last=Canby |first=Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a similar role in 1968's ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-detective-1968|title=The Detective|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=July 12, 1968|accessdate=October 4, 2015|author=Ebert, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Sinatra starred opposite [[George Kennedy]] in the western ''[[Dirty Dingus Magee]]'', an "abysmal" affair according to Santopietro,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=409}} which was panned by the critics.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=414}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ebert, Roger|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dirty-dingus-magee-1970|title=Dirty Dingus Magee|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=November 23, 1970|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Sinatra received a [[Golden Globe Cecil B.

Hutton]]'s ''[[The First Deadly Sin]]'' (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an "extraordinarily rich", heavily layered characterization, one which "made for one terrific farewell" to his film career.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=648}}

== Television and radio career ==
[[File:Dean Martin Show 1958 Dean Martin Frank Sinatra.JPG|thumb|Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra on ''The Dean Martin Show'' in 1958]]
After beginning on the ''[[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]]'' radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT in Jersey City,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=27}} Sinatra became the star of various radio shows of his own on [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] from the early 1940s to the mid 1950s. In 1942 Sinatra hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his radio work.{{sfn|Dunning|1998|pp=260–261}} By the end of 1942 he was named the "Most Popular Male Vocalist on Radio" in a ''Down Beat'' poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3406256/sinatra_most_popular_vocalist_on_radio/|title=Sinatra Most Popular Vocalist on Radio |work=Harrisburg Telegraph ([[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]])|date=January 16, 1943|page=45|accessdate=October 12, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on he frequently worked with the popular [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]] on radio, and they would appear as guests on each other's shows,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=228}} as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] (AFRS).{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=80}} He appeared as a special guest in the sisters' ABC ''Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch'' series,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=444}} while the trio in turn guested on his ''[[Songs by Sinatra]]'' series on CBS.{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=99}} Sinatra had two stints as a regular member of cast of ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'';{{efn| ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'' was a popular weekly radio and television program from 1935 to 1958.

In October 1951, the second season of ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (CBS TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[CBS Television]]. Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped.{{efn|Producer [[Irving Mansfield]] described Sinatra as being obsessed with the thought that his wife, Ava Gardner, was having an affair with her former husband, Artie Shaw. He often started shouting about this on the set of the television show when he phoned his home and could not reach Gardner. Mansfield had to communicate with Sinatra through the entourage that always accompanied him to CBS. Sinatra was always late to work and did not care to spend any time at rehearsal; he blamed all those connected with the program for the poor ratings it received. Mansfield was at his wits' end with Sinatra and his television show and quit the program. Mansfield informed him that he was man of great talent but a failure as a person, which led to Sinatra attempting to angrily fire him. Mansfield replied that he was too late, as he had resigned that morning.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|pp=284–285}}}} Santopietro writes that Sinatra "simply never appeared fully at ease on his own television series, his edgy, impatient personality conveying a pent up energy on the verge of exploding".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=113}} In 1953 Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program ''[[Rocky Fortune]]'', portraying Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune), a "footloose and fancy free" temporary worker for the Gridley Employment Agency who stumbles into crime-solving. The series aired on NBC radio Tuesday nights from October 1953 to March 1954.{{Sfn|Terrace|1998|p=287}}

In 1957, Sinatra formed a three-year $3{{nbsp}}million contract with ABC to launch ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'', featuring himself and guests in 36 half hour shows. ABC agreed to allow Sinatra's Hobart Productions to keep 60% of the residuals, and bought stock in Sinatra's film production unit, Kent Productions, guaranteeing him $7{{nbsp}}million.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=278}} Though an initial critical success upon its debut on October 18, 1957, it soon attracted negative reviews from ''Variety'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' thought that Sinatra and frequent guest Dean Martin "performed like a pair of adult delinquents", "sharing the same cigarette and leering at girls".{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=280}} In return, Sinatra later made numerous appearances on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and Martin's TV specials.{{Sfn|Terrace|2013|p=123}}

Sinatra's fourth and final [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] TV special, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|Welcome Home Elvis]]'', was broadcast in March 1960, earning massive viewing figures. During the show, he performed a duet with Elvis, who sang Sinatra's 1957 hit "[[Witchcraft (1957 song)|Witchcraft]]" with Frank performing the 1956 Elvis classic "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]". Sinatra had previously been highly critical of [[Elvis Presley]] and rock and roll in the 1950s, describing it as a "deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac" which "fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people."{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=283}}{{efn|Presley had responded to the criticism: "...&amp;nbsp;[Sinatra] is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it&amp;nbsp;...

According his musical collaboration with Jobim and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] in 1967, Sinatra appeared in the TV special, ''[[A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim]]'', which was broadcast on CBS on November 13.{{sfn|Terrace|2013|p=157}} When Sinatra came out of retirement in 1973, he released both an album and appeared in a TV special named "Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back". The TV special was highlighted by a dramatic reading of "[[Send in the Clowns]]" and a song-and-dance sequence with former co-star Gene Kelly.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=167}} In the late 1970s, John Denver appeared as a guest in the ''Sinatra and Friends'' ABC-TV Special, singing "September Song" as a duet.{{Sfn|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=286}}

In 1977, Sinatra starred as a detective in ''[[Contract on Cherry Street]]'', cited as his "one starring role in a dramatic television film".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=430}} Ten years later, he made a guest appearance opposite [[Tom Selleck]] in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', playing a retired policeman who teams up with Selleck to find his granddaughter's murderer.

=== Style and personality ===

[[File:Frank Sinatra in 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sinatra in 1955]]

Sinatra was known for his immaculate sense of style.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=131}} He spent lavishly on expensive custom-tailored tuxedos and stylish pin-striped suits, which made him feel wealthy and important, and that he was giving his very best to the audience.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=51}} He was also obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname "Lady Macbeth", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits.{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=116}} His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes".{{sfn|Sirvaitis|2010|p=23}}

For Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification of America in the 1950s: "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full of the sense of possibility".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=231}} Barbara Sinatra wrote, "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=3}}  [[Cary Grant]], a friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=224}}  Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive were "enormous".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}} A workaholic, he reportedly only slept four hours a night on average.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=16}} Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]],{{sfn|Sinatra|Coplon|2000|p=47}} stating to an interviewer in the 1950s that "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=218}} Barbara Sinatra stated that he would "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor",{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=148}} while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was "best to disappear".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=155}}

Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists, and photographers.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249–250}} According to Rojek he was "capable of deeply offensive behavior that smacked of a persecution complex".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}  He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in [[Houston]] in 1950, Judy Garland's publicist [[Jim Byron]] on the [[Sunset Strip]] in 1954,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249–250}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3405214/sinatra_vs_jim_byron/|title=Sinatra, Press Agent Trade Blows, Few of Which Connect|work=Oneonta Star ([[Oneonta, New York]])|date=December 10, 1954|page=1|accessdate=October 12, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a confrontation with ''Washington Post'' journalist [[Maxine Cheshire]] in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}{{efn|Rojek states that Sinatra verbally assaulted Cheshire at a party in 1973, remarking, "Get away from me, you scum. Go home and take a bath&amp;nbsp;... You're nothing but a two-dollar cunt. You know what that means, don't you? You've been laying down for two dollars all your life". According to Rojek, Sinatra then proceeded to place two dollar bills in her wine glass and remarked, "Here's two dollars, baby, that's what you're used to".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}}} In contrast, Sinatra was known for his generosity,{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=146}} particularly after his comeback. Kelley notes that when [[Lee J. Cobb]] nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with "books, flowers, delicacies", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his "finest acting" was yet to come.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=251–252}} In another instance, after an argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new [[Cadillac]].{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=53}}

=== Alleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge ===

[[File:LuckyLucianoSmaller.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Mugshot of mobster [[Lucky Luciano]] in 1936]]

Sinatra became the stereotype of the "tough working-class Italian American", something which he embraced. Sinatra commented that if it had not been for his interest in music he would "probably have ended in a life of crime".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=50}} In his early days, [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss [[Willie Moretti]], Sinatra's [[Capo dei capi|godfather]] and notorious underboss of the [[Genovese crime family]], helped him for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy Dorsey.{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=420}} Sinatra was present at the Mafia [[Havana Conference]] in 1946,{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=419}} and when the press learned of Sinatra's being in Havana with [[Lucky Luciano]], one newspaper published the headline, "Shame, Sinatra".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=63}} He was reported to be a good friend of [[Sam Giancana]],{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=343}} and the two were seen playing golf together.{{sfn|Heymann|2014|p=287}} Kelley quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that Sinatra "adored" [[Bugsy Siegel]], and boasted to friends about him and how many people he had killed.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=124–125}} Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster [[Joseph Fischetti]] had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like "Sicilian brothers".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=135}} She also states that Sinatra and [[Hank Sanicola]] were financial partners with [[Mickey Cohen]] in the gossip magazine ''Hollywood Night Life''.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=176}}

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, who was a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent [[New Deal]] politics and his friendship with [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1075739|title=Sinatra: The FBI Files|publisher=NPR|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI kept Sinatra under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and [[extortion]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march99/sinatra7.htm|title=AKA Frank Sinatra|publisher=The Washington Post Magazine|accessdate=June 14, 2008|date=March 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose younger brother Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] was leading a crackdown on organized crime.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=327–329}} Sinatra denied Mafia involvement, declaring, "Any report that I fraternized with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=49}}

In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the [[Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino]], a casino hotel which straddles the California-Nevada state line on the north shores of [[Lake Tahoe]]. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted Sinatra's show business friends [[Red Skelton]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Victor Borge]], [[Joe E. Lewis]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Juliet Prowse]], the [[McGuire Sisters]], and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=347–348, 355}} Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Martin|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-03-31-lake-tahoe-rat-pack-casino_N.htm|title=Frank Sinatra's Lake Tahoe casino shuts down |work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=July 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204182309/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-03-31-lake-tahoe-rat-pack-casino_N.htm|archivedate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal and was fuming at the abuse he had given to the commission's chairman, Ed Olsen.

== Politics and activism ==
{{Main|Political life of Frank Sinatra}}
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt Frank Sinatra.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sinatra, pictured here with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] in 1960, was an ardent supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] until the early 1970s.]]
Sinatra held differing political views throughout his life. His mother, Dolly Sinatra (1896–1977), was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ward leader,{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=16}} and after meeting President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1944, he subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 presidential election]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2005|1p=40|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=125}} According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years Sinatra had "ardent liberal" sympathies, and was "so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=118, 123}} He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward blacks and Italians, from early on. In November 1945 Sinatra was invited by the mayor of [[Gary, Indiana]], to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the "Pro-Negro" policies of the new principal.{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=26}} His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a [[Communism|Communist]], which he strongly denied.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=122–123}} In the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], Sinatra actively campaigned for President [[Harry S.

Of all the U.S. Presidents he associated with during his career, he was closest to [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=ws; /&gt; Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the two would womanize and enjoy parties together.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=298–300}} In January 1961 Sinatra and [[Peter Lawford]] organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office.&lt;ref name=ws; /&gt; In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy during his visit to [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime.{{efn|At the time, President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General [[Robert F.

Kennedy was strongly advised by [[Henry Petersen]], a senior official of the Justice Department, to avoid staying with Sinatra.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=334}} }} Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected.{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=169}} Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.&lt;ref name=ws; /&gt;{{efn|When Sinatra learned that Kennedy's killer [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] had watched ''Suddenly'' just days before the assassination, he withdrew it from circulation, and it only became distributed again in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|pp=151–152}}}}
[[File:Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Sinatra is awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].]]

From his youth, Sinatra displayed sympathy for African Americans and worked both publicly and privately all his life to help them win equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice on the parents of children.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=138}} Sinatra played a major role in the [[desegregation]] of [[Nevada]] hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Casino Journal: National ed, Volume 18&amp;nbsp;– Desegregation of Nevada hotels and casinos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWUsAQAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Casino Journal of Nevada, Incorporated|pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Sands in 1955, Sinatra went against policy by inviting [[Nat King Cole]] into the dining room,{{Sfn|Roman|2011|p=111}} and in 1961, after an incident where an African-American couple entered the lobby of the hotel and were blocked by the security guard, Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. forced the hotel management to begin hiring black waiters and busboys.{{Sfn|Land|Land|2004|p=148}} On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers.

American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] referred to Sinatra as "the greatest singer of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="Christgau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1998|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/sinatra-det.php|title=Frank Sinatra 1915–1998|journal=Details|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His popularity was later matched only by [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Beatles]], and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="holden" /&gt; For Santopietro, Sinatra was the "greatest male pop singer in the history of America",{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=456}} who amassed "unprecedented power onscreen and off", and "seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the 'top of the heap', yet never forgot his roots". Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his own world, which he was able to dominate—his career was centred around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|pp=76–78}}

Composer [[Gus Levene]] commented that Sinatra's strength was that when it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a "genius" ability and feeling, which with the "rare combination of voice and showmanship" made him the "original singer" which others who followed most tried to emulate.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=68}} [[George Roberts (trombonist)|George Roberts]], a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a "charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one else had".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=32}} Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter [[James Bacon (author)|James Bacon]] in saying that Sinatra was the "swinging image on which the town is built", adding that no other entertainer quite "embodied the glamour" associated with Las Vegas as him.{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=48}} Sinatra continues to be seen as one of the icons of the 20th century,{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}

It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university.{{sfn|Moehring|2007|p=265}} During his speech, Sinatra stated that his education had come from "the school of hard knocks" and was suitably touched by the award.

'''George Bogdan''' (1859-1930) was a [[Romania]]n physician and university professor.

Bogdan attended the [[National College (Iași)|National College]] in [[Iași]], graduating in 1876. He studied medicine in France, and earned a doctorate in psychiatry there. After returning home, he began work as a doctor at [[Sfântul Spiridon Hospital]] and as a teacher at the National College, where he offered a course on hygiene. In 1891, he became a part-time professor at the forensic medicine department of [[Iași University]]. The same year, he was named dean of the medical faculty and a member of the university senate. As such, he argued for an increase in the number of departments at the faculty, for an improvement in its laboratories, for the establishment of a library, for scholarships for needy students, and for the creation of a student cafeteria. He became a full professor in 1895, and taught both advanced medical students and law students. He introduced the notion of medical ethics into the courses at his faculty. He taught that doctors should follow principles of honesty, modesty and deference; that they are morally responsible for their actions; and that irresponsibility is "a sad privilege of the sick and the insane".&lt;ref name="s93"&gt;Scripcaru, Târcoveanu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a five-volume course on forensic medicine; this was considered the field's most up-to-date Romanian text at the time. He spent his entire career working as a coroner for the Iași tribunal. In 1915, for the benefit of other coroners, he edited a collection of 56 coroners' reports he had filed.&lt;ref name="s93"/&gt; He published widely across three decades, writing numerous works in the field of clinical practice based on his lifelong experience as a doctor in a dermatology and syphilis clinic. An active participant in international hygiene congresses, he focused on health education and preventive medicine. He performed experiments on animals as well as [[anthropometric]] measurements. He collected a wide array of exhibits for the museum of pathological forensic medicine, and was involved in forensic microbiology.&lt;ref name="s94"&gt;Scripcaru, Târcoveanu, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rector of Iași University from 1907 to 1913; as such, he proposed the establishment of a students' union, the establishment of new departments and the building of dormitories. He led the 50th anniversary celebrations in 1910 and strove to raise the university's prestige. A lover of literature, he was president of the local Franco-Romanian society, and published three short stories. He worked as a [[combat medic]] during the [[Second Balkan War]] (1913) and [[World War I]] (1916-1919), and was made a commander of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name="s94"/&gt;

'''George James Felos''' (born March 1952) is an American lawyer specializing in [[right-to-die]] cases.  He is best known for representing [[Terri Schiavo]]'s husband Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubbs|first=Sharon|title=The spirit and the law|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/052501/Floridian/The_spirit_and_the_la.shtml|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=St Petersburg Times (Florida)|date=May 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Raised Greek-Orthodox, Felos graduated from [[Boston University]] School of Law with a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1976. He was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1977.

{{Terri Schiavo}}

==Career==
In 1990 he represented the family of Estelle Browning in an earlier right-to-die case at the Florida Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colby|first=William H|title=Unplugged: Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America|year=2007|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGpJIXhxZhUC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=george%20felos%20Estelle%20Browning&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20felos%20Estelle%20Browning&amp;f=false|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browning while still healthy had written a [[living will]] asking not to be artificially kept alive, before suffering a serious [[stroke]] which had left her in a nursing home reliant on a feeding tube for nearly 3 years; a judge had prevented the will being enacted, but Felos litigated the case even after Browning's death in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida Woman Dies Attached to a Tube; Legal Fight Goes On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/us/florida-woman-dies-attached-to-a-tube-legal-fight-goes-on.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 19, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 in a "landmark ruling" the Florida Supreme Court decided in Browning's favor, ruling that the permanently incapacitated need not be force-fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Right-to-die law defined by local case|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/13/Tampabay/Right_to_die_law_defi.shtml|newspaper=St Petersburg Times (Florida)|date=October 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His conduct in the Schiavo case caused controversy, because he had Terry Schiavo moved to the Woodside Hospice, Florida, where until recently he had been chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Didion|first=Joan|title=The Case of Theresa Schiavo|journal=New York Review of Books|date=Jun 9, 2005|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2005/jun/09/the-case-of-theresa-schiavo/?pagination=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the author of ''Litigation as Spiritual Practice'' (Blue Dolphin Publishing), which combined discussion of legal practice with spiritual reflections on meditation and new-age religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pfeiffer |first=Eric |title=Odd Felos |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/pfeiffer200503301030.asp |newspaper=National Review |date=March 30, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1973, Church began research work at [[Duke University]] with assistant professor of biochemistry [[Sung-Hou Kim]], work that continued a year later with Church in a graduate biochemistry program at Duke on an NSF fellowship.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MillerNG15/&gt; As Peter Miller reported for the ''National Geographic'' series, "The Innovators":&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a graduate student at Duke…  he used x-ray crystallography to study the three-dimensional structure of "transfer" RNA, which decodes DNA and carries instructions to other parts of the cell. It was groundbreaking research, but Church spent so much time in the lab—up to a hundred hours a week—that he neglected his other classes [in the fall of 1975]".&lt;ref name="MillerNG15"&gt;Peter Miller, 2015, "News, The Innovators Project: George Church, The Future Without Limits," ''National Geographic'' (online), see [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/innovators/2014/06/140602-george-church-innovation-biology-science-genetics-de-extinction/], accessed 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As a result, Church was not compliant with Duke graduate academic policies, and was withdrawn from the degree program in January 1976. He was told that "[We] hope that whatever problems… contributed to your lack of success… at Duke will not keep you from a successful pursuit of a productive career."&lt;ref name=MillerNG15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duke University Graduate School, Office of the Dean, 1976, "Dear Mr. Church…", January 16, 1976, private letter from W.G. Katzenmeyer, Associate Dean, to George McDonald Church, in the archives of G.M. Church, see [http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/F.jpg]. accessed 4 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The work gave rise to publications that include a ''Proceedings'' report with Church as lead author on an early model for molecular interactions between the [[minor groove]] of double-stranded [[DNA]] and β-ribbons of proteins&lt;ref&gt;G.

Church returned to graduate work at [[Harvard University]] in 1977 under [[Walter Gilbert]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Perkel, 2013, "BioTechniques: Celebrating 30 Years of Methods Development," ''BioTechniques'' '''55'''(5), November 2013, 227–230, see [http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2013/November/BioTechniques-Celebrating-30-Years-of-Methods-Development/biotechniques-348091.html?service=print], accessed 21 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and completed a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]] working on [[mobile genetic elements]] within [[intron]]s of [[Mitochondrion|yeast mitochondrial]] and mouse [[Immunoglobulin]] genes (1984).&lt;ref name="churchphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=George|last=Church |title=Genetic Elements within Yeast Mitochondrial and Mouse Immunoglobulin Introns (Sequence, Enhancer, Technique) |publisher=Harvard University|date=1984 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303300427|oclc=13285113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George, along with a group of visionaries and scientists, including leaders from Harvard Medical School's Personal Genome Project, co-founded [http://www.veritasgenetics.com Veritas Genetics] and its European and Latinoamerican subsidiary, [http://www.veritasint.com Veritas Intercontinental], with the idea of bringing the benefits of genomic data to millions of people globally.

==Research==
Church is known for his professional contributions in [[genome sequencing|the sequencing of genomes]] and interpreting such data, in [[synthetic biology]] and [[genome engineering]], and in an emerging area of neuroscience that proposes to map brain activity and establish a "functional [[connectome]]." Among these, Church is known for pioneering the specialized fields of [[personal genomics]] and [[synthetic biology]]. He has co-founded commercial concerns spanning these areas, and others from green and natural products chemistry to infectious agent testing and fuel production, including [[Knome]], [[LS9, Inc|LS9]], and [[Joule Unlimited]] (respectively, human genomics, [[green chemistry]], and solar fuel companies). {{As of|2015}}, according to [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref name=googlescholar/&gt; his most cited research has been published in [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal]]s including ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'',&lt;ref name=genomicseq&gt;{{Cite journal

=== The BRAIN initiative===
He was part of a team of six&lt;ref name=Neuron2012/&gt; who, in a 2012 scientific commentary, proposed a Brain Activity Map, later named [[BRAIN Initiative]] (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Obama Seeking to Boost Study of Human Brain | publisher= NY Times | author = John Markoff | date = 17 February 2013 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They outlined specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a "functional [[connectome]]", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project,&lt;ref name=Neuron2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alivisatos AP, Chun M, Church GM, Greenspan RJ, Roukes ML, Yuste R |title=The Brain Activity Map Project and the Challenge of Functional Connectomics |journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=970&amp;ndash;974 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22726828 |pmc=3597383 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.006 |url=http://download.cell.com/neuron/pdf/PIIS0896627312005181.pdf?intermediate=true |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228014207/http://download.cell.com/neuron/pdf/PIIS0896627312005181.pdf?intermediate=true |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including wireless, minimally invasive methods to detect and manipulate neuronal activity, either utilizing [[microelectronics]] or [[synthetic biology]]. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced [[DNA]] would serve as a "ticker tape record" of neuronal activity.&lt;ref name=Neuron2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlosONE&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zamft BM, Marblestone AH, Kording K, Schmidt D, Martin-Alarcon D, Tyo K, Boyden ES, Church G | title = Measuring Cation Dependent DNA Polymerase Fidelity Landscapes by Deep Sequencing | journal = [[PLoS ONE]] | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22928047 | pmc = 3425509 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0043876 | pages=e43876|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...743876Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Woolly mammoth cloning ===
In March 2015, Church and his genetics research team at Harvard successfully copied [[woolly mammoth]] genes into the genome of an Asian elephant. Using the [[CRISPR]] DNA editing technique, his group spliced genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens, including genes from the ears, subcutaneous fat, and hair attributes, into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant. This marked the first time that woolly mammoth genes had been functionally active since the species became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.popsci.com/woolly-mammoth-dna-brought-life-elephant-cells |title=Woolly Mammoth DNA Successfully Spliced Into Elephant Cells |author=Sarah Fecht |date=24 March 2014 |publisher=''[[Popular Science]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work has not been subject to peer review, however. Church stated that "Just making a DNA change isn't that meaningful. We want to read out the phenotypes." To do that, the team plans to perform further tests to get the hybrid cells into becoming specialized tissues, and from there attempting to turn the hybrid elephant/mammoth skin cells into hybrid embryos that can be grown in artificial [[womb]]s.

===Controversies===
In response to a question from [[Der Spiegel]], Church speculated that it could be technically possible to make a [[Neanderthal]] by reconstructing the DNA of a Neanderthal and modifying living human cells accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Der Spiegel | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/george-church-explains-how-dna-will-be-construction-material-of-the-future-a-877634.html | title= How DNA will be construction material of the future | date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other media such as The [[Daily Mail]] fabricated a "Want-Ad" and quote for Church as having said: "Now I need an adventurous female human." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= Daily Mail |date=20 January 2013 | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265402/Adventurous-human-woman-wanted-birth-Neanderthal-man-Harvard-professor.html | title=Wanted: 'Adventurous woman' to give birth to Neanderthal man |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church pointed out that he was not working on such a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |journal=Boston Herald  |author=Gary J.

==Popular science==
In his science and popular efforts, Church has also promoted open access genome sequencing and shareable human medical data, as well as online, [[open education]] and [[citizen science]]. Controversy found Church in early 2013, in response to his spoken speculations as to what was required to engineer the birth of a [[Neanderthal]].

Church authored the 2012 ''NewScientist'' "top science book," ''Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves'' with [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Church George |title= Regenesis |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2012 |pages= | isbn=978-0-465-02175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=New Scientist | url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/12/the-top-10-science-books-of-2012.html | title=The top 10 science books of 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has participated in news interviews and videos including at TED, TEDx,&lt;ref&gt;TEDx, 2012, "TEDxCambridge: George Church on genomics and human diversity," March 21, 2012, see [http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxCambridge-George-Church-on;search%3AGeorge%20Church], accessed 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TEDx, 2013, "Hybridizing with extinct species: George Church at TEDxDeExtinction," May 8, 2013, see [http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Hybridizing-with-extinct-specie;search%3AGeorge%20Church], accessed 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TEDx, 2013, "DNA [as detectors], George-Church-at-TEDxCERN," May 24, 2013, see [http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/DNA-George-Church-at-TEDxCERN], accessed 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and TEDMED venues, at [[PBS]]'s [[Charlie Rose]],&lt;ref&gt;charlierose.com, 2009, "Personalized Medicine, …GUESTS/AFFILIATIONS: ...Steven Pinker, Harvard University,  George Church, Harvard Medical School, Personal Genome Project," air date 19 June 2009, see {{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/history.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020637/http://www.charlierose.com/history.html|archivedate=19 December 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-12-24|df=dmy-all}} and [http://www.tv.com/shows/charlie-rose/george-church-linda-avey-anne-wojcicki-steven-pinker-robert-kagan-1971275/], accessed 4 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faces of America]], and [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]], as well as at PopSci, EG, and [[The Colbert Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Church Lab News | accessdate=8 September 2010 | url=http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/news.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Liz|title=When George Church met Stephen Colbert|url=http://www.frontlinegenomics.com/rich-media/5096/5096-2/|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a regular contributor to [[Edge.org]] publications and videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/church.html | title= Church Writings, Master Class and Videos on Edge.org | accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the Xconomists, an ad hoc team of editorial advisors for the tech news and media company, [[Xconomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.xconomy.com/about/#The%20Xconomists|title=About Our Mission, Team, and Editorial Ethics|work=Xconomy|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Church is married to fellow Harvard Medical School faculty member in genetics [[Ting Wu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Do inventors get enough respect in science? | url=http://www.boston.com/news/science/blogs/science-in-mind/2013/07/02/inventors-get-enough-respect-science/i7wCB2NWW5Ii98XLoO69nL/blog.html | work=The Boston Globe | date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church has been outspoken in his support of following a [[veganism|vegan]] lifestyle, for reasons concerned with health, and with environmental and moral issues. When asked about his dietary choice, Church replied, "I've been vegan off-and-on since 1974 when I was inspired by participating in an MIT nutritional study, and quite strictly since 2004."  He goes on to elaborate 4 reasons:&lt;blockquote&gt;"medical ([[cholesterol]] in fish &amp; dairy), energy conservation (up to 20-fold impact), cruelty ("[[organic food|organic]]" animals are deprived of medicines that humans use), and risks of spreading pathogens (not just the flu)… [noting that] veganism is an issue for which personal and global love of life, health and wealth align. It's a pity to lose parts of our humanity and planet just due to a lack of recipes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Church |url=http://www.veganpeace.com/famousvegans/profiles/george_church.htm |accessdate=20 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118055438/http://www.veganpeace.com/famousvegans/profiles/george_church.htm |archivedate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the context of the Personal Genome Project, journalists at ''Forbes'' and ''Wired'' have noted Church's openness about his health issues, including [[dyslexia]], [[narcolepsy]], and high cholesterol (one of the motivations for his vegan diet).&lt;ref name="herper"&gt;{{cite news | author=Herper, Matthew | title= Going To Church | publisher=Forbes Magazine |date= 27 April 2009 |url= https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0427/020-biofuels-biotech-genetics-ideas-opinions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://archive.wired.com/medtech/stemcells/magazine/16-08/ff_church?currentPage=all |title = How the Personal Genome Project Could Unlock the Mysteries of Life |author= Thomas Goetz |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Edward Holt''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|CH}} (5 August 1908{{spaced ndash}}17 December 1967), was an Australian politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|17th Prime Minister of Australia]], in office from 1966 until [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|his presumed drowning death]] in 1967. He was the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] during that time.

Holt was born in [[Sydney]], but lived in [[Melbourne]] from a young age. He was the first prime minister born in the 20th century. He studied law at the [[University of Melbourne]] and eventually opened his own legal practice. Holt entered parliament at [[Fawkner by-election, 1935|a 1935 by-election]], standing for the [[United Australia Party]] (UAP). He was a protégé of [[Robert Menzies]], and was added to cabinet when Menzies became prime minister in 1939. Aged only 30 at the time of his appointment, he held a series of minor portfolios until the government's defeat in 1941, under both Menzies and [[Arthur Fadden]]. Holt's tenure was interrupted by a brief stint in the [[Australian Army]], which ended when he was recalled to cabinet following the deaths of three ministers in the [[1940 Canberra air disaster]]. He joined the new Liberal Party upon its creation in 1945.

When Menzies regained the prime ministership in 1949, Holt became a senior figure in [[Menzies Government (1949–66)|the new government]]. As [[Minister for Immigration (Australia)|Minister for Immigration]] (1949–56), he  expanded the [[Post-war immigration to Australia|post-war immigration scheme]] and relaxed the [[White Australia policy]] for the first time. He was also influential as [[Minister for Labour and National Service]] (1949–58), where he handled several industrial relations disputes. Holt was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1956, and after the [[Australian federal election, 1958|1958 election]] replaced [[Arthur Fadden]] as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]]. He oversaw the creation of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] and the decimal [[Australian dollar]], but was blamed for a [[credit crunch]] that almost cost the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] the [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 election]]. However, the economy soon rebounded and Holt retained his place as Menzies' heir apparent.

Holt became prime minister in January 1966, [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 1966|elected unopposed]] as Liberal leader following Menzies' retirement. He fought [[Australian federal election, 1966|a general election]] later that year, winning a landslide victory. The [[Holt Government]] continued the dismantling of the White Australia policy, [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|amended the constitution]] to give the federal government responsibility for [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous affairs]], and took Australia out of the [[sterling area]]. Holt promoted greater engagement with Asia and the Pacific, and made visits to a number of East Asian countries. His government expanded [[Australia in the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement]] in the [[Viet Nam War]], and maintained close ties with the United States under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. While visiting the [[White House]], Holt proclaimed that he was "all the way with L.B.J.", a remark which was poorly received at home.

After just under two years in office, [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|Holt disappeared while swimming]] at [[Cheviot Beach]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in rough conditions. His body was never recovered, and he was declared dead ''[[Declared death in absentia|in absentia]]''; his disappearance spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Holt was the third Australian prime minister to die in office, and was succeeded by [[John McEwen]] on an interim basis and then by [[John Gorton]]. His death was commemorated in a number of ways, among them by the establishment of the [[Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre]].

== Early life ==
===Birth and family background===
Holt was born on 5 August 1908 at his parents' home in [[Stanmore, New South Wales|Stanmore, Sydney, New South Wales]]. He was the first of two sons born to Olive May (née Williams; formerly Pearce){{Efn|Holt's mother was born Olive May Williams. His maternal grandmother had remarried after the death of her first husband, James Henry Williams, and her children took the name of their stepfather, Arthur Pearce.&lt;ref name=frame4/&gt;}} and Thomas James Holt; his younger brother Clifford was born in 1910.&lt;ref name=frame4&gt;{{cite book|author=Frame, Tom| authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop)|title=The Life and Death of Harold Holt|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin / National Archives of Australia|year=2005|isbn=1-74114-672-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his father's side, Holt was descended from James Holt, a cobbler from [[Birmingham]], England, who arrived in [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather, Thomas Holt Sr., owned a large farming property in [[Nubba, New South Wales|Nubba]], and was twice elected mayor of nearby [[Wallendbeen]]. Holt's father trained as a schoolteacher in Sydney and eventually found work as a physical education teacher at the [[Cleveland Street Intensive English High School|Cleveland Street School]] in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]]. Holt's mother was born in [[Eudunda, South Australia]], and had Cornish, English, German, and Irish ancestry; her sister was the actress [[Vera Pearce]]. She was pregnant at the time of their marriage, which occurred in January 1908.&lt;ref name=frame4/&gt;

===Education===
In 1914, Holt's parents moved to [[Adelaide]], where his father became the licensee of a hotel in [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]]. He and his brother stayed behind in Sydney, living with an uncle and attending [[Randwick Public School]]. In late 1916, Holt was sent to live with grandparents in the country, where he briefly attended the Nubba State School. He returned to Sydney the following year, and for three years was enrolled at [[Abbotsholme College]], a private school in [[Killara]]; his parents separated around that time.&lt;ref name=frame4/&gt; In 1920, Holt began boarding at [[Wesley College, Melbourne]]. He was a popular and talented student, winning a scholarship in his final year and graduating second in his class. Holt generally spent school holidays with his relatives in Nubba or with schoolmates, rather than with his parents – his father had begun working as a talent agent, touring the country on the [[Tivoli circuit]], while his mother died in 1925. He was 16 at the time, and was unable to attend the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young Harold Holt.jpg|thumb|right|Holt as a young man]]
In 1927, Holt began studying law at the [[University of Melbourne]], living at [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]] on a scholarship. He represented the university in [[cricket]] and [[Australian rules football|football]], and was also active in various student organisations, serving as president of the Law Students' Society and of the Queen's College social club. Holt won prizes for oratory and essay-writing, and was a member of the inter-university debating team. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1930. Holt's father – living in London – invited to him to continue his studies in England, but he declined the offer.&lt;ref name=frame6&gt;Frame (2005), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal career===
Holt served his [[articled clerk|articles of clerkship]] with the firm of [[Theodore Fink|Fink]], [[Robert Best (Australian politician)|Best]], &amp; Miller. He was admitted to the [[Victorian Bar]] in late 1932, and opened his own legal practice the following year. However, clients during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] were scarce and frequently underpaid, so Holt lived in a boardinghouse and often relied upon the hospitality of friends.&lt;ref name=frame6/&gt; Drawing on his family connections in show business, he eventually accepted an offer to become secretary of the Victorian Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association, a film industry lobby group. In this capacity he appeared several times before the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].&lt;ref name = ADB&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/holt-harold-edward-10530 Australian Dictionary of Biography]. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frame9"&gt;Frame (2005), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This had a positive affect on his own practice, and he eventually took on two partners, first Jack Graham and later James Newman.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm of Holt, Graham, &amp; Newman was dissolved in 1963, following a financial dispute and subsequently reconstituted as Holt, Newman, &amp; Holt, with Holt's son Sam as the new addition. Holt's involvement in the practice declined once he entered politics and ceased altogether in 1949, although he did not formally retire until assuming the prime ministership.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
In 1933, Holt joined the [[Young Nationalists]], the youth wing of the [[United Australia Party]].&lt;ref name="frame9" /&gt; He cultivated a friendship with [[Mabel Brookes]], and through Brookes became acquainted with senior members of the influential [[Australian Women's National League]] (AWNL). He also secured the patronage of [[Robert Menzies]], with whom he shared a similar background and political views.&lt;ref name=p11&gt;Frame (2005), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Australian federal election, 1934|1934 federal election]], Holt stood for the UAP in the [[Division of Yarra]]. It was a [[safe seat]] for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], held by the party's leader (and former prime minister) [[James Scullin]]. Holt lost heavily, as was expected, but was praised for his campaigning.&lt;ref name="frame9"/&gt; Early the following year, he contested [[Electoral district of Clifton Hill|Clifton Hill]] – another safe Labor seat – at the [[Victorian state election, 1935|Victorian state election]], losing to [[Bert Cremean]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was eventually elected to parliament on his third attempt, winning [[Fawkner by-election, 1935|a federal by-election]] for the seat of [[Division of Fawkner|Fawkner]] in August 1935; his predecessor, [[George Maxwell (Australian politician)|George Maxwell]], had died in office. He won UAP [[preselection]] against five other candidates, a victory which ''[[Smith's Weekly]]'' attributed to his "political godmothers" in the AWNL.&lt;ref name=p11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/234615406 Political Godmothers Rule U.A.P. With Haughty Mien], ''[[Smith's Weekly]]'', 10 August 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; His new seat was centred on Melbourne's wealthy inner-eastern suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt was twenty-seven years old when he entered parliament, making him its youngest member. He kept a relatively low profile in his first few years, but spoke on a wide range of topics.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; When Robert Menzies became prime minister in April 1939, he made Holt one of four [[minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. His inclusion was made possible by the collapse of [[Coalition (Australia)|the coalition]] with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] – previously a certain number of positions had been reserved for Country MPs, but [[First Menzies Ministry|the new ministry]] was composed solely of UAP members.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Holt officially had no portfolio, he effectively served as an assistant minister to [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]], who headed the [[Department of Supply and Development (1939–42)|Department of Supply and Development]]. He was given responsibility for the [[CSIRO|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR),&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and also acted for periods as [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]] and [[Minister for Air (Australia)|Minister for Civil Aviation and Air]] while the incumbents were overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt's first stint as a government minister came to an end in March 1940, when the coalition with the Country Party was reinstituted. His replacement was [[Arthur Fadden]], another future prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Harold Holt 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Holt in 1940]]
Holt enlisted in the [[Militia (Australia)|Militia]] in February 1939, joining a part-time artillery unit for businessmen and professionals. He was given indefinite leave during his ministerial service.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1940, without resigning his seat, Holt enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] with the intent of becoming a full-time soldier. Several of his parliamentary colleagues did likewise at various points in the war.{{Efn|[[William Hutchinson (Australian politician)|William Hutchinson]] and [[Keith Wilson (politician)|Keith Wilson]], enlisted around the same time as Holt, while [[Thomas White (Australian politician)|Thomas White]] had already done so.&lt;ref name=p20/&gt; In total, nine sitting MPs served in the military at some point in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/MembersWWII Commonwealth Members of Parliament who have served in war: the Second World War], Parliament of Australia. Retrieved 10 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Holt was posted to the [[2/4th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Field Regiment]], holding the rank of [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]. He had been offered a commission as an officer in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], but declined due to his lack of experience. In a press statement, Holt said "as the youngest member of the House, I could not feel happy in my position if I were not prepared to make some sacrifice and take an active part".&lt;ref name=p20&gt;Frame (2005), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to [[Puckapunyal]] for training, and expected to be posted to North Africa or Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt's brief military career came to an end as a result of the [[1940 Canberra air disaster|Canberra air disaster]] on 13 August, which killed three senior government ministers. Menzies called [[Australian federal election, 1940|an early general election]] for 21 September, which resulted in a [[hung parliament]] and a UAP–Country minority government. Holt was given leave from the army to campaign, and won re-election with a large majority. Menzies subsequently asked him to return to cabinet, to which he agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was sworn in as [[Minister for Labour and National Service]] on 28 October, and formally resigned from the army the same day. He was placed in charge of the new [[Department of Labour and National Service]], which took over most of the responsibilities of the previous [[Department of Industry (1928–40)|Department of Industry]].&lt;ref name=p23&gt;Frame (2005), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a member of the bipartisan [[Advisory War Council (Australia)|Advisory War Council]], although he personally favoured the establishment of a [[national unity government]] with the Labor Party.&lt;ref name=p24&gt;Frame (2005), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

As labour minister, Holt's foremost task was to prevent industrial disputes from disrupting the war effort.&lt;ref name=p25&gt;Frame (2005), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He met with union leaders and employer groups, and secured their agreement to a streamlining of the arbitration process while the war was underway.&lt;ref name=p23/&gt; He had also been made [[Minister for Industry (Australia)|Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial Research]], which gave him responsibility for the [[CSIRO|CSIR]] and its wartime efforts.&lt;ref name=p23/&gt; In April 1941, Holt sponsored and oversaw the passage of the ''Child Endowment Act'', which introduced a universal [[child endowment]] scheme;{{Efn|Five shillings per week for every child under the age of 16, excluding first-born children.&lt;ref name=p25/&gt;}} newspapers labelled him "the godfather to a million Australian children".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; When leadership troubles hit the Coalition later in the year, Holt initially supported Menzies. However, he and five cabinet colleagues eventually transferred their allegiance to [[Arthur Fadden]], the leader of the Country Party, believing this way the only to ensure stable government. Menzies felt he had been betrayed, but forgave Holt and accepted his assurances that he had been acting in the best interests of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt retained his portfolios in the [[Fadden Government]], which lasted only 40 days before being defeated on a [[confidence motion]] in October 1941. After going into [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]], he kept a reasonably low profile for the remainder of the war, except for his membership of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure.&lt;ref name=p31&gt;Frame (2005), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was criticised by some for not re-joining the army,&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]] was opposed by Brigadier [[William Cremor]], whose campaign was funded by Sydney businessmen (including [[Keith Murdoch]]). He lost a significant portion of his [[First-preference votes|primary vote]], but suffered only a small swing on the [[two-party-preferred]] count.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Menzies returned as leader of the UAP [[United Australia Party leadership election, 1943|in September 1943]], and Holt was initially a candidate for the deputy leadership; he withdrew once former prime minister [[Billy Hughes]] entered the race.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was in favour of the creation of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], but played little role in the practical aspects of its establishment. He became an official member of the new party in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar ministerial career==
[[File:HaroldHoltPortrait1953.JPG|thumb|right|Holt in 1953]]

After eight years in opposition, the Coalition won the [[Australian federal election, 1949|federal election of December 1949]] and Menzies began his record-setting second term as Prime Minister. In a redistribution held ahead of that election, Holt's majority in Fawkner nearly disappeared. He transferred to [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]], one of several new seats created in the 1949 redistribution. The seat was created as a safe Liberal seat; it had been carved out of the wealthier portions of Fawkner. Holt won it easily. He was appointed to the prestigious portfolios of [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Labour and National Service]] (1949–1958; he had previously served in this portfolio 1940–41) and [[Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Minister for Immigration]] (1949–1956), by which time he was being touted in the press as a "certain successor to Menzies and a potential Prime Minister". In Immigration, Holt continued and expanded the massive immigration programme initiated by his ALP predecessor, [[Arthur Calwell]]. However, he displayed a more flexible and caring attitude than Calwell, who was a strong advocate of the [[White Australia policy]].&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt; One of his first acts was to intervene in the so-called "Gamboa case", which involved a Filipino immigrant with an Australian wife and children. Calwell had had Gamboa deported under the ''[[War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949]]'', but Holt reversed the decision and allowed Gamboa to return to Australia to live.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/annie-white-australia-policy How one refugee signalled the end of the White Australia policy], ''The Guardian Australia'', 18 March 2014. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt excelled in the Labour portfolio and has been described as one of the best Labour ministers since Federation. Although the conditions were ripe for industrial unrest—Communist influence in the union movement was then at its peak, and the right-wing faction in Cabinet was openly agitating for a showdown with the unions—the combination of strong economic growth and Holt's enlightened approach to industrial relations saw the number of working hours lost to strikes fall dramatically, from over two million in 1949 to just 439,000 in 1958.  He also had ministerial responsibility for the [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne Olympics]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Harold Holt: urbane treasurer |first = John |last = Hawkins |work = Economic Roundup Issue 1, 2012 |publisher = The Treasury |url = http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |page = 62 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140212121321/http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |archivedate = 12 February 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt fostered greater collaboration between the government, the courts, employers and trade unions. He enjoyed good relationships with union leaders like [[Albert Monk]], President of the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]; and [[Jim Healy (trade unionist)|Jim Healy]], leader of the radical [[Maritime Union of Australia|Waterside Workers Federation]];and he gained a reputation for tolerance, restraint and a willingness to compromise, although his controversial decision to use troops to take control of cargo facilities during a waterside dispute in [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]], [[Queensland]] in September 1953 provoked bitter criticism.

Holt's personal profile and political standing grew throughout the 1950s. He served on numerous committees and overseas delegations, he was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]] in 1953,&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt; and in 1954 he was named one of Australia's six best-dressed men. In 1956, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and became [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]],&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt; and from this point on, he was generally acknowledged as Menzies' heir apparent.

===Treasurer (1958–1966)===

In December 1958, following the retirement of [[Arthur Fadden]], Holt succeeded him as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]].&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt; Holt had little knowledge or interest in economics, but the job cemented his position as Menzies' likely successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Harold Holt: urbane treasurer |first = John |last = Hawkins |work = Economic Roundup Issue 1, 2012 |publisher = The Treasury |url = http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |page = 63 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140212121321/http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |archivedate = 12 February 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Treasurer, Holt relied strongly on the advice of Treasury secretary [[Roland Wilson (economist)|Roland Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Harold Holt: urbane treasurer |first = John |last = Hawkins |work = Economic Roundup Issue 1, 2012 |publisher = The Treasury |url = http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |pages = 63–64 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140212121321/http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |archivedate = 12 February 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements included major reforms to the banking system (originated by Fadden){{spaced ndash}}including the establishment of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]{{spaced ndash}}and the planning and preparation for the introduction of [[decimal currency]].

Holt was reluctant to act, but in November 1960 introduced a deflationary package of tax changes. He also reluctantly agreed to an interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank. The [[credit squeeze]] was nicknamed the "Holt jolt". The economy went into recession, and unemployment rose to three percent, which was considered high for the time and contrary to the government's policy of [[White Paper on Full Employment in Australia|full employment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Harold Holt: urbane treasurer |first = John |last = Hawkins |work = Economic Roundup Issue 1, 2012 |publisher = The Treasury |url = http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |pages = 65–66 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140212121321/http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/Treasury/Publications%20and%20Media/Publications/2012/Economic%20Roundup%20Issue%201/Downloads/05%20Hawkins%20Harold%20Holt.ashx |archivedate = 12 February 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/its-half-a-century-since-australia-received-the-holt-jolt-20100222-orwn.html It's half a century since Australia received the Holt Jolt], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 23 February 2010.

The credit squeeze brought the Coalition dangerously close to losing the [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 election]], with the Coalition being returned with a precarious one-seat majority.

He was almost fourteen years younger than his predecessor, but, at the age of 57, was still the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by age|fourth-oldest]] man to assume the office. He had been an MP for over 30 years before becoming prime minister, a record surpassed only by his successor [[John McEwen]]'s 33 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/fast-facts.aspx Fast facts: Harold Holt], National Archives of Australia.

[[First Holt Ministry|Holt's initial cabinet]] was virtually unchanged from that of his predecessor. [[John Gorton]] and [[Les Bury]] were promoted to replace Menzies and Paltridge, but there were no other changes in composition. There were also no major changes in portfolio, outside of McMahon's promotion to Treasurer in place of Holt.

===Elections===

{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqIMzc2e4RA Newsreel footage of the 1966 election] from [[Pathé News]]}}
[[Australian federal election, 1966|On 26 November 1966]], Holt fought his first and only general election as prime minister, winning a somewhat unexpected landslide victory. The Coalition secured 56.9 percent of the [[two-party-preferred vote]], gaining 10 seats and bringing its total number of seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to 82 out of 124; the Liberal Party was only two seats away from forming majority government in its own right. It was a higher margin victory of victory than Menzies had achieved in eight elections as Liberal leader, and was the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]'s worst electoral defeat [[Australian federal election, 1934|in 31 years]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt received little credit for the Coalition's election victory, even from within his own party.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally held that the Labor Party's poor campaign had been the major factor in its defeat. [[Arthur Calwell]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]], was 70 years old and had limited personal popularity – a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll before the election placed his personal approval rating at 24 percent, compared with Holt's 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Calwell had suffered a damaging rift with his deputy [[Gough Whitlam]] earlier in the year, and the general public still perceived the party as divided.&lt;ref name="Frame 2005, p. 166"&gt;Frame (2005), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In an election where the Viet Nam War was a major campaign issue, he and Whitlam publicly contradicted each other on major policy decisions.{{Efn|Calwell had pledged to withdraw ''all'' Australian troops from Viet Nam, whereas Whitlam suggested that Labor was contemplating withdrawing only conscripts and allowing the regular army to remain.&lt;ref name=p168&gt;Frame (2005), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Labor ran on an anti-war platform, but struggled to appeal to voters concerned about national security; combined with Calwell's dedication to the [[White Australia policy]], this allowed the party to be portrayed as isolationist and naive about external affairs.{{Efn|''[[The Bulletin]]'' – normally supportive of the Labor Party – accused Calwell of wanting Australia to be "a cosy little isolated British community, without people from continental Europe, let alone any other fearful regions".&lt;ref name=p168/&gt;}} Calwell was far less telegenic than his opponent, and was seen as gruff and antagonistic where Holt was suave and easy-going. At a rally in [[Adelaide]] a week before the election, Calwell accused Holt of having "chickened out of World War II – just as his three stepsons are chickening out of the war in Vietnam today". His attack on Holt's family – which he refused to withdraw – was viewed as desperate and undignified, and it was pointed out that, unlike Holt, Calwell had performed no military service in World War II.&lt;ref name=p168/&gt;

In early 1967, Arthur Calwell retired as ALP leader and [[Gough Whitlam]] succeeded him. Whitlam proved a far more effective opponent, both in the media and in parliament, and Labor soon began to recover from its losses and gain ground, with Whitlam repeatedly besting Holt in Parliament.&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt; By this time, the long-suppressed tensions between the Coalition partners over economic and trade policies were also beginning to emerge. Throughout his reign as Liberal leader, Menzies had enforced strict party discipline but, once he was gone, dissension began to surface. Some Liberals soon became dissatisfied by what they saw as Holt's weak leadership. [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] asserts that Holt was being increasingly criticised within the party in the months before his death, that he was perceived as being "vague, imprecise and evasive" and "nice to the point that his essential decency was viewed as weakness".

===Domestic policy===
According to his biographer [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]], "Holt's inclinations and sympathies were those of the political centre [...] he was a pragmatist rather than a philosopher, but he nonetheless claimed a philosophical lineage connecting him with [[Alfred Deakin]] and approvingly quoted his statement that 'we are liberal always, radical often, and reactionary never'.".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
[[File:ABC Decimal Currency.ogv|thumb|right|An [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) video showing Holt (as Treasurer) introducing the coins of the new Australian dollar in 1964.]]
Holt as prime minister was sometimes criticised for a failure to be assertive on economic matters. A major [[Drought in Australia|drought]] in 1965 had led to slowdown in growth, but he was unwilling to increase public spending in case it increased inflation.&lt;ref name="Frame 2005, p. 161"&gt;Frame (2005), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian dollar]] – a legacy of Holt's period as Treasurer – came into circulation on 14 February 1966, less than a month after his prime ministership began. In November 1967, the British government unexpectedly announced that it would be devaluing the [[pound sterling]] by 14 percent. Holt announced that the Australian government would not follow suit, effectively withdrawing Australia from the [[sterling area]]. The decision was strongly opposed by the Country Party, who feared it would disadvantage primary industry. [[John McEwen]], the Country Party leader, issued a public statement criticising the government, which caused a breakdown in his relations with Holt and nearly led to the collapse of the Coalition. ''[[The Bulletin]]'' said that the withdrawal was "quite certain to mean the end of any remaining special relationship between Australia and Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 239–241.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no other important economic policy reforms made by the Holt Government, although Australia did become a founding member of the [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
As prime minister, Holt continued the liberalisation of immigration law that he had begun as Minister for Immigration. When he came to office, what remained of the [[White Australia policy]] was upheld by [[ministerial decree]] rather than by explicit legislation. In March 1966, the residency requirement for [[naturalisation]] was changed to a uniform five years; it had previously been 15 years for non-whites. Discriminatory provisions relating to [[family reunification]] were also removed.&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/105891028 "New migration policy will aid Japanese"], ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 11 March 1966.

Retrieved 3 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Immigration Minister [[Hubert Opperman]] announced that potential immigrants to Australia would be assessed solely "on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily, and their possession of qualifications which are in fact positively useful to Australia";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/white-australia-policy-the-beginning-of-the-end-50-years-ago/ White Australia policy – the beginning of the end 50 years ago], Museum of Australian Democracy, 9 March 2016.

[[Keith Wilson (politician)|Keith Wilson]] believed that the Holt Government's reforms ensured that "from now on there will not be in any of our laws or in any of our regulations anything that discriminates against migrants on the grounds of colour or race". However, there would not be a practical change in the composition of Australia's immigration intake for many more years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/end_of_the_white_australia_policy White Australia policy ends], National Museum of Australia.

====Constitutional reform====
{{Further|Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|Australian referendum, 1967 (Parliament)}}

In 1967, the Holt Government amended the constitution to alter [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution|section 51 (xxvi)]] and remove [[Section 127 of the Australian Constitution|section 127]]. This gave the federal government the power to legislate specifically for [[Indigenous Australians]], and also allowed indigenous people to be enumerated in the [[Australian census|census]]. The constitutional amendments required [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|a referendum]] before they could be enacted, which passed with over 90 percent of the vote; it remains the largest referendum majority [[Referendums in Australia|in Australian history]]. Holt personally considered the amendments unnecessary and mostly symbolic, but thought they would be well received by the international community (particularly Asia).&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barrie Dexter]], he was privately shocked by the referendum result, having been uncertain whether it would even pass.&lt;ref name=p214&gt;Frame (2005), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt came to regard the referendum as indicative of a shift in the national mood. In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]] and [[Kath Walker]]. Despite opposition from state governments,{{Efn|At a meeting in [[Perth]] in July 1967, the Aboriginal Welfare Conference of State and Commonwealth Ministers voted to preserve the ''status quo''.&lt;ref name=p214/&gt;}} he created a new [[Office of Aboriginal Affairs]] within the [[Prime Minister's Department (Australia)|Prime Minister's Department]], as well as a new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by [[H. C. Coombs]]).&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coombs and [[Paul Hasluck]], Holt had little interest in indigenous affairs before becoming prime minister.{{Efn|Coombs said: "When we talked it became clear that Holt had little knowledge of Aborigines and was puzzled to know how the Government should go about creating an appropriate administrative agency to deal with the problems associated with them".&lt;ref name="p214"/&gt; Hasluck said: "I am puzzled about Holt's role as innovator in Aboriginal affairs. In sixteen years with him in cabinet I had never known him to show any interest in Aborigines".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Despite this, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way policy was handled, paving the way for the federal government to assume many of the powers and responsibilities that had previously been the preserve of the states. Indigenous academic [[Gary Foley]] has said that Holt's death was a setback for Aboriginal people, as his successors did not show the same commitment to the framework that he established.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Foley|Foley, Gary]], [https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/27/harold-holts-death-and-why-the-1967-referendum-failed-indigenous-people Harold Holt's death and why the 1967 referendum failed Indigenous people], ''[[The Guardian Australia]]'', 27 May 2017. Retrieved 14 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holt Government also unsuccessfully attempted to remove [[Section 24 of the Constitution of Australia|section 24]] of the constitution (the so-called "nexus clause"), which requires the number of members in the House of Representatives to be "as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators". [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Parliament)|The resulting referendum]] did not come close to passing, with only 40 percent voting in favour nationwide and only one state ([[New South Wales]]) recording a majority. All three major-party leaders campaigned for the "Yes" vote, while opposition came mainly from Coalition backbenchers and [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] senators. Supporters of the "No" vote successfully argued that section 24 protected the influence of the Senate, and thus the interests of less populous states and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidestory.org.au/the-forgotten-1967-referendum/ "The forgotten 1967 referendum"], ''Inside Story'', 26 May 2017. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt did make one other significant legal reform, albeit one that did not require a constitutional amendment. In September 1967, he announced that his government would use [[Section 74 of the Constitution of Australia|section 74 of the constitution]] to remove the potential for [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] cases to be appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The necessary legislation was not passed until after his death.{{Efn|The ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act'' came into effect in August 1968. It closed off appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation, but it remained possible to appeal from [[Judiciary of Australia|state supreme courts]] until the passage of the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The arts====
In November 1967, in one of his last major policy statements, Holt announced the establishment of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. The National Gallery, which did not open until 1982, was the first arts-related major infrastructure project to be funded by the federal government; previous projects had been funded by state governments or by private subscription. Holt said it would "add significantly to the cultural life of Australia and the national capital".&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/106980131 "Work to begin on National Gallery"], ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 2 November 1967.

====Viet Nam War====
[[File:Holt-1-7-1966.JPEG|thumb|Holt with U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] at [[the Pentagon]] in July 1966.]]
{{Further|Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War}}
The [[Viet Nam War]] was the dominant foreign policy issue during Holt's term in office. He was a strong supporter of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian involvement in the war]], which had begun in 1962,&lt;ref name=personal/&gt; and accused its critics of adopting a "[[Lotus Land]]" attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as citing Australia's [[SEATO]] obligations to [[South Viet Nam]], Holt justified the war on the grounds that Australia was morally obligated to "resist communist subversion and aggression" and "defend the right of every people to choose their own social and economic order". He held that "unless there is security for all small nations, there cannot be security for any small nation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches/1966-harold-holt Australian Federal Election Speeches: Harold Holt], Museum of Australian Democracy. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1966, Holt announced that the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], would be withdrawn and replaced by the [[1st Australian Task Force]], a self-contained [[brigade]]-sized unit based at [[Nui Dat]]. This effectively tripled the number of Australian troops in Viet Nam to around 4,500, and also included 1,500 [[Conscription in Australia#Vietnam War|national servicemen]] – the first conscripts to serve in the conflict.&lt;ref name="Frame 2005, p. 178"&gt;Frame (2005), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; By the final months of Holt's prime ministership, Australia had over 8,000 personnel stationed in South Viet Nam, drawn from all three branches of the [[Australian Defence Force]]; the final troop increase was announced in October 1967.&lt;ref name=personal/&gt; Holt "never deviated from his whole-hearted support for American bombing of [[North Viet Nam]] and the hope that steadily increasing the number of foreign troops deployed to South Viet Nam would lead to military victory and a solution to the crisis".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gorton]] later that it was "ironical that, being a man of peace, he should have presided over one of the greatest build-ups of military power that Australia has found itself engaged in".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's handling of the war initially enjoyed broad public support, and was considered a key contributor to the landslide election victory in 1966 – referred to by some as a "[[khaki election]]".&lt;ref name=p188&gt;Frame (2005), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the following year, however, opinion polls were showing that public sentiment had turned against the war, and previously supportive media outlets had begun to criticised Holt's decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not live long enough to see the mass demonstrations experienced by his successors. Political opposition to the war was initially led by Opposition Leader [[Arthur Calwell]], who promised a total withdrawal from the conflict and labelled it a "cruel, unwinnable civil war".&lt;ref name=p188/&gt; His replacement, [[Gough Whitlam]], adopted a more pragmatic approach, focusing on policy specifics (particularly the government's apparent lack of an [[exit strategy]]) rather than the validity of the war itself.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="All the way with LBJ"====
[[File:Harold Holt and Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|Holt with U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in October 1966.]]
{{See also|Australia–United States relations}}
Holt cultivated a close relationship with the United States under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He believed that "without the American shield most of us who live in Asia and the South Pacific would have a continuing sense of insecurity". Cooperation between the two countries extended beyond the Viet Nam War. Holt approved the construction of several [[Earth stations in Australia|Earth stations]] for use by [[NASA]] and American intelligence agencies, including [[Pine Gap]], [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]], and [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex|Tidbinbilla]]. This made Australia "the most substantial centre for American missile and space operations outside the continental United States".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt and Johnson developed a personal friendship. They were the same age, and had first met in 1942, when Johnson visited Melbourne as a naval officer; afterwards they shared a similar career trajectory. Holt visited the U.S. twice while in office, in June and July 1966, and on the latter visit was invited to stay at [[Camp David]]. He and Johnson reportedly played tennis, lounged by the pool, and watched movies together.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/all-the-way-and-beyond/news-story/5027b3daabfa592207fc491f21adfaa1 All the way, and beyond], ''[[The Australian]]'', 4 November 2013. Retrieved 15 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://providencemag.com/2017/02/lbjs-australian-bromance/ LBJ’s Australian Bromance], 8 February 2017. Retrieved 15 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1966, Johnson made the first visit to Australia by an incumbent American president; Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] had visited in February of that year.&lt;ref name="Frame 2005, p. 178"/&gt; He toured five cities, and was greeted by large crowds as well as a number of anti-war demonstrators, who disrupted the presidential motorcade. The opposition criticised the visit as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson later returned to Australia for Holt's memorial service, and invited his widow [[Zara Holt|Zara]] to stay with him when she visited the United States in 1969.&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

On his first visit to the U.S., Holt made what was widely viewed as a ''faux pas'' while delivering a ceremonial address at the [[White House]]. Departing from his prepared remarks, he said: "And so, sir, in the lonelier and perhaps even more disheartening moments which come to any national leader, I hope there will be a corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the fact that you have an admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be ''all the way with LBJ''."&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt had meant it to be a "light-hearted gesture of goodwill towards a generous host", referencing the slogan used in [[United States presidential election, 1964|Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; It was interpreted as such by his immediate audience, but once it was reported back in Australia it came to be viewed as a "foolish, sycophantic and dangerous statement" that was indicative of Australian subservience.&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt; [[Bill Hayden]] said Holt's remarks "shocked and insulted many Australians [...] its seeming servility was an embarrassment and a worry".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper editorials generally agreed with Holt's assertion that he had been misinterpreted, but still criticised him for making an error in judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; His comments intensified anti-war sentiments among those who were already opposed to the war, but had little electoral impact. Nonetheless, "all the way with LBJ" is still remembered as Holt's "best-known utterance".&lt;ref name=personal/&gt;

====Britain and the Commonwealth====
[[File:NAAImageM4297 Holt Wilson.jpg|thumb|right|Harold and Zara Holt meeting with [[Harold Wilson|Harold]] and [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Wilson]] in 1967.]]
Holt was a strong supporter of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and believed its member states had moral obligations to one another – particularly Britain, as the former colonial power.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his relationship with [[Harold Wilson]], the British prime minister, was somewhat frosty. He repeatedly lobbied Wilson to maintain a strong British presence "[[East of Suez]]", in order to complement American efforts, and in early 1967 received assurances that no reduction was being contemplated.&lt;ref name="Frame 2005, p. 191"/&gt; However, by the middle of the year Wilson had announced that Britain intended to close all of its bases in Asia by the early 1970s (except for [[Hong Kong]]).&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Australia's concerns, it was suggested that a British naval base could be established in [[Cockburn Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt rejected this outright, and felt that Wilson had deliberately misled him as to the UK's intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 193, 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Holt's popularity and political standing was damaged by his perceived poor handling of a series of controversies that emerged during 1967. In April, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s new nightly current affairs program ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' ran a story which criticised the government's decision not to reappoint the Chair of the ABC Board, [[James Ralph Darling|Sir James Darling]]. Holt responded rashly, questioning the impartiality of the ABC and implying political bias on the part of journalist [[Mike Willesee]] (whose father [[Don Willesee]] was an ALP Senator and future Whitlam government minister), and his statement drew strong protests from both Willesee and the [[Australian Journalists' Association]].

In May, increasing pressure from the media and within the Liberal Party forced Holt to announce a parliamentary debate on the question of a [[Melbourne-Voyager collision|second inquiry into the 1964 sinking]] of ''[[HMAS Voyager (D04)|HMAS Voyager]]'' to be held on 16 May. The debate included the [[maiden speech]] by newly elected NSW Liberal MP [[Edward St John]] QC, who used the opportunity to criticize the government's attitude to new evidence about the disaster. An enraged Holt interrupted St John's speech, in defiance of the parliamentary convention that maiden speeches are heard in silence; his blunder embarrassed the government and further undermined Holt's support in the Liberal Party. A few days later, Holt announced a new [[Royal Commission]] into the disaster.

In October the government became embroiled in another embarrassing controversy over the alleged misuse of V.I.P. aircraft, which came to a head when [[John Gorton]] (Government Leader in the Senate) tabled documents that showed that Holt had unintentionally misled Parliament in his earlier answers on the matter. Support for his leadership was eroded even further by his refusal to sack the Minister for Air, [[Peter Howson (politician)|Peter Howson]], in order to defuse the scandal, fuelling criticism from within the party that Holt was "weak" and lacked Menzies' ruthlessness. Much of the blame for the episode within the Public Service was visited upon Sir [[John Bunting (diplomat)|John Bunting]], Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department, although other figures such as the Deputy Secretary [[Peter Lawler (public servant)|Peter Lawler]] were able to protect themselves. One of John Gorton's first acts upon becoming Prime Minister in January 1968 was to sideline Bunting by creating a separate Department of the Cabinet Office with Bunting as its head, and replaced him with [[Lenox Hewitt]].

In November 1967, the government suffered a serious setback in the [[Australian Senate election, 1967|Senate election]], winning just 42.8 per cent of the vote against Labor's 45 per cent. The coalition also lost the seats of [[Division of Corio|Corio]] and [[Division of Dawson|Dawson]] to Labor in by-elections. [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] says that, within the party, the reversal was blamed on Holt's mishandling of the V.I.P. planes scandal. Disquiet was growing about his leadership style and possible health problems.&lt;ref name = ADB /&gt;

==Disappearance==
{{Main|Disappearance of Harold Holt}}
[[File:Cheviot Beach.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Cheviot Beach]], the site of Holt's disappearance]]
Holt loved the ocean, particularly [[spearfishing]], and had holiday homes at [[Portsea, Victoria]], and [[Bingil Bay, Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 1967, while Holt was spending the week-end at Portsea, he and four companions decided to drive to [[Point Nepean]] to watch sailor [[Alec Rose]] pass through [[The Rip]] on his solo circumnavigation attempt. On their way back to Portsea, Holt convinced the group to stop at remote [[Cheviot Beach]] for a swim before lunch – he had spearfished there on many previous occasions, and claimed to "know this beach like the back of my hand". Because of the rough conditions, only one other person, Alan Stewart, joined Holt in the water. Stewart kept close to shore, but Holt swam out into deeper water and was seemingly caught up in a [[rip current|rip]], eventually disappearing from view. One of the witnesses, Marjorie Gillespie, described it as "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 248–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt's disappearance sparked "one of the largest search operations in Australian history", but no trace of his body was ever found.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; A police report released in early 1968 made no definitive findings about Holt's death, while a [[Coroners Court of Victoria|coronial inquest]] in 2005 returned a verdict of accidental drowning. It is generally accepted that Holt overestimated his swimming ability.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have alleged that Holt committed suicide, but those close to him rejected this as uncharacteristic of his personality.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theories have included suggestions that Holt faked his own death, was assassinated by the CIA, or [[The Prime Minister Was a Spy|was collected by a submarine so that he could defect to China]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 278–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service for Holt was held at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]], on 22 December, and attended by numerous world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 59 at the time of his death, Holt became the third Australian prime minister to die in office, after [[Joseph Lyons]] (1939) and [[John Curtin]] (1945). [[John McEwen]], the leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], was sworn in as caretaker prime minister on 19 December.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Party held [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 1968|a leadership election]] on 9 January 1968, in which [[John Gorton]] defeated [[Paul Hasluck]], [[Billy Snedden]], and [[Les Bury]]. Gorton was a member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], and in line with [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] transferred to the House of Representatives at [[Higgins by-election, 1968|the by-election]] caused by Holt's death.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
[[File:Harold Zara Holt-1950.jpg|thumb|right|Harold and Zara Holt in 1950]]
While at university, Holt met [[Zara Bate|Zara Dickins]], the daughter of a Melbourne businessman; there was an "instant mutual attraction". They made plans to marry once Holt had graduated, but after a financial dispute chose to separate.&lt;ref name="frame6"/&gt; Zara went on a trip to Britain, where she was introduced to James Fell, a [[British Indian Army]] officer. She accompanied Fell to India, and then in early 1935 returned to Australia where Holt again proposed marriage. She declined his offer, and married Fell a short time later, going to live with him in [[Jabalpur]]. Holt had entered parliament by that time, and was soon being profiled as "the most eligible bachelor in parliament". He briefly dated Lola Thring, the daughter of his father's business partner, [[F. W. Thring]], but his widowed father Tom was also interested in her (to his son's "disgust"). Tom Holt married Lola in 1936, and their daughter Frances (Harold's half-sister) was born in 1940; Tom Holt died in 1945.&lt;ref name=p7&gt;Frame (2005), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Zara returned to Australia to give birth to her first child, Nicholas. She had two more children, twins Sam and Andrew, in 1939. Her marriage with Fell broke down a short time later, and in late 1940 she returned to Australia permanently and resumed a relationship with Holt. Their relationship did not become public for some time, in order to avoid Holt being implicated in Zara's divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=p8&gt;Frame (2005), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually married on 8 October 1946, at Zara's parents' home on [[St Georges Road]], [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; They initially lived on nearby Washington Street, but in 1954 bought the St Georges Road house.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt legally adopted Zara's three children, and as young men they changed their surname to his.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]], it was an "open secret" that Holt was the biological father of the twins, as they shared his physical appearance and had been conceived at a time when Zara was known to have been in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=p8/&gt;

Zara Holt was a successful businesswoman, owning a chain of dress shops, and out-earned her husband even as prime minister. It was her success that allowed the couple to purchase two holiday homes, one at [[Portsea, Victoria]], and the other at [[Bingil Bay, Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; She nonetheless made sacrifices for her husband's political career, accompanying him on all but one of his overseas trips, which could last for weeks.{{Efn|The only time Holt travelled overseas without his wife was in August 1948, when he attended a meeting of the [[Empire Parliamentary Association]] in London. It was the first time he had been outside Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After her husband's death, Zara remarried in 1969 to one of his Liberal Party colleagues, [[Jeff Bate]].&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; She was widowed a second time in 1984, and died in 1989. In a 1988 interview with ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Zara stated that her husband Harold had carried on "dozens" of extramarital affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of Holt, Tom Frame wrote: "I have not included the names of women with whom Holt allegedly had a sexual relationship because I was unable to confirm or deny that most of these relationships took place […] by their very nature they were always illicit and Holt was very discreet."&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2005), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Holt was the first Prime Minister born in the twentieth century. Holt was an enthusiastic sportsman and avid swimmer, which was a stark differentiation to that of Menzies and the majority of his predecessors and colleagues. Like later successor [[Bob Hawke]], this resonated with positive effect within the electorate. His oratory skills were vastly superior to that of [[Arthur Calwell]] whom Holt resoundingly beat in 1966. Holt's rhetorician was, however, considered a match to that of new Labor leader [[Gough Whitlam]]. Whitlam himself later said of Holt:

{{quote|(his) ability to establish relationships with men of different backgrounds, attitudes and interests was his essential decency. He was tolerant, humane and broadminded. His suavity of manner was no pose. It was the outward reflection of a truly civilised human being. He was in a very real sense a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbs.com.au/news/harold-holt-the-australian-prime-minister-who-disappeared | SBS News, 'The Australian Prime Minister who disappeared' - Retrieved 20180314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moadoph.gov.au/blog/on-this-day-prime-minister-harold-holt-commences-his-692-days-as-leader-of-australia/ | Museum of Australian Democracy, 'On this day' - Retrieved 20180319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/news/books/holt-legacy-rescued-from-the-deep/2005/09/01/1125302674781.html | Sydney Morning Herald, 'Holt legacy rescued from the deep' - Retrieved 20180319&lt;/ref&gt;|Gough Whitlam, Leader of the Opposition, March 1968}}

===Religious beliefs===
Holt has been described as an "apathetic agnostic". He was baptised [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], attended [[Methodism|Methodist]] schools, and married with [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] forms, but neither he nor his wife had any interest in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Roy|date=2013|title=In God They Trust?: The Religious Beliefs of Australia's Prime Ministers, 1901–2013|publisher=[[Bible Society Australia]]| page=140|isbn=9780647518557}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lack of religiosity apparently had little impact on his political prospects, and was not generally remarked upon.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alick Downer]] believed that Holt's thoughts "lay in this world not the next".&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friend [[Simon Warrender]], he "was an agnostic whose ''raison d'être'' was dedication to his career".&lt;ref name=p266&gt;Frame (2005), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Holt had a reputation as something of a [[fatalism|fatalist]], and frequently quoted from [[Andrew Marvell]]'s ''[[carpe diem]]'' poem "[[To His Coy Mistress]]".&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2013), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also fond of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "[[If—]]", which Warrender said he used as a "guiding light in his political and private life".&lt;ref name=p266/&gt;

Harold Holt is commemorated by the [[Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonnington.vic.gov.au/explore-stonnington/sport-and-recreation/swim/|title=Harold Holt Swim Centre|publisher=Stonnington.vic.gov.au|date=|accessdate=12 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130081144/http://www.stonnington.vic.gov.au/explore-stonnington/sport-and-recreation/swim/|archivedate=30 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris. The complex was under construction at the time of Holt's disappearance, and since he was the local member, it was named in his memory. The irony of commemorating a man who is presumed to have drowned with a swimming pool has been a source of wry amusement to many Australians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryson, Bill]]. ''[[In a Sunburned Country]]'' (Broadway Books, New York, 2000) {{ISBN|0-7679-0385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the newly commissioned [[United States Navy]] [[Knox class frigate|Knox class destroyer escort]] [[USS Harold E. Holt (FF-1074)|USS ''Harold E. Holt'' (FF-1074)]] was named in his honour. She was launched by Holt's widow Dame Zara at the [[Vigor Shipyards|Todd Shipyards]] in Los Angeles on 3 May 1969, and was the first American warship to bear the name of a foreign leader.

In 1969, a plaque commemorating Holt was bolted to the seafloor off Cheviot Beach after a memorial ceremony. It bears the inscription:

{{quote|In memory of Harold Holt, Prime Minister of Australia, who loved the sea and disappeared hereabouts on 17 December 1967.}}

Other memorials include:

* the suburb of [[Holt, Australian Capital Territory]];
* the [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt]];
* the [[Division of Holt]], an electoral district in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in Victoria;
* a sundial and garden in the [[Fitzroy Gardens]], [[Melbourne]];
* a wing for boarders at [[Wesley College (Victoria)|Wesley College, Melbourne]];
* the Harold Holt Fisheries Reserves – five protected areas in southern [[Port Phillip]], located at [[Swan Bay]], [[Point Lonsdale]], [[Mud Islands]], [[Point Nepean]] and [[Pope's Eye]] (The Annulus). 
* a memorial stone within the 'Prime Ministers Garden' of [[Melbourne General Cemetery]]

By way of a folk memorial, he is recalled in the [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian vernacular]] expression "do a Harold Holt" (or "do the Harry"), [[rhyming slang]] for "do a bolt" meaning "to disappear suddenly and without explanation", although this is usually employed in the context of disappearance from a social gathering rather than a case of presumed death.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, James (2004) ''The Macquarie Australian Slang Dictionary,'' p. 69 (Macquarie Library: Sydney) {{ISBN|1-876429-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1968, Holt's widow [[Zara Bate|Zara Holt]] was made a Dame Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]], becoming Dame Zara Holt DBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1067227&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true |title=It's an Honour |publisher=Itsanhonour.gov.au |date=8 June 1968 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later married for a third time, to a Liberal party colleague of Holt's, [[Jeff Bate]], and was then known as Dame Zara Bate.

'''Joseph Bruce Ismay''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|z|ˈ|m|eɪ}}; 12 December 1862 – 17 October 1937) was an English businessman who served as chairman and managing director of the [[White Star Line]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; In 1912, he came to international attention as the highest-ranking White Star official to survive the sinking of the company's brand new [[flagship]] [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], for which he was subject to severe criticism.

==Early life==
Ismay was born in [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;'Merseyside' did not exist before 1st April 1974.'Lancashire' is correct&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of [[Thomas Henry Ismay]] (7 January 1837 – 23 November 1899) and Margaret Bruce (13 April 1837 – 9 April 1907), daughter of [[ship-owner]] Luke Bruce.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/j-bruce-ismay.html ''Mr Joseph Bruce Ismay''], ''Encyclopedia Titanica''.

He was apprenticed at his father's office for four years, after which he toured the world. He then went to [[New York City]] as the company representative, eventually rising to the rank of agent.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=144}} Bruce was one of the founding team of [[Liverpool Ramblers|Liverpool Ramblers football club]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolramblersafc.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 1888, Ismay married [[Julia Florence Schieffelin]] (5 March 1867 – 31 December 1963), daughter of George Richard Schieffelin and Julia Matilda Delaplaine of [[New York City|New York]], with whom he had five children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/married-early-december.html ''Married in early December''], ''The New York Times'', ''Encyclopedia Titanica''.

In 1891, Ismay returned with his family to the United Kingdom and became a partner in his father's firm, Ismay, Imrie and Company. In 1899, Thomas Ismay died, and Bruce Ismay became head of the family business. Ismay had a head for business, and the White Star Line flourished under his leadership. In addition to running his ship business, Ismay also served as a director of several other companies. In 1901, he was approached by Americans who wished to build an international shipping conglomerate, which agreed to merge his firm into the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|International Mercantile Marine Company]].&lt;ref name="WSL" /&gt;

Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Ismay succeeded him as the chairman of White Star Line. He decided to build four ocean liners to surpass the {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} built by his father: the ships were dubbed the [[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]: {{RMS|Celtic}}, {{RMS|Cedric}}, {{RMS|Baltic|1903|6}}, and {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|6}}. These vessels were designed more for size and luxury than for speed.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=11}}

In 1902, Ismay negotiated the sale of the White Star Line to [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], which was organising the formation of [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|International Mercantile Marine Company]], an Atlantic shipping combine which absorbed several major American and British lines. IMM was a holding company that controlled subsidiary operating corporations. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Clark, and Margaret T. Clark, "The International Mercantile Marine Company: A Financial Analysis," ''[[American Neptune]]'' 1997 57(2): 137–154.&lt;/ref&gt; White Star Lines became one of the IMM operating companies and, in February 1904, Ismay became president of the IMM, with the support of Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/griscom-is-no-longer-head-ship-combine.html ''Griscom is no longer head of the Ship Combine''], ''The New York Times'', ''Encyclopedia Titanica''.

== RMS ''Titanic'' ==
{{main article|RMS Titanic|Sinking of the RMS Titanic}}
[[File:Titanic the sinking.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the sinking of the ''Titanic'']] 
In 1907, Ismay met [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]] of the [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] shipyard to discuss White Star's answer to the {{RMS|Lusitania}} and the {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}},{{efn|The duo themselves were designed to compete with the {{SS|Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse}} and {{SS|Deutschland|1900}} owned respectively by the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] and the [[Hamburg America Line]], the two German top shipping companies.}} the recently unveiled marvels of their chief competitor, [[Cunard Line]]. Ismay's new type of ship would not be as fast as their competitors, but it would have huge [[steerage]] capacity and luxury unparalleled in the history of ocean-going steamships. The latter feature was largely meant to attract the wealthy and the prosperous middle class. Three ships of the [[Olympic-class ocean liner|Olympic Class]] were planned and built. They were in order {{RMS|Olympic}}, {{RMS|Titanic|link=no}} and RMS (later HMHS) [[HMHS Britannic|''Britannic'']]. In a highly controversial move, during construction of the first two Olympic class liners, Ismay authorized the projected number of lifeboats reduced from 48 to 16, the latter being the minimum allowed by the [[Board of Trade]], based on the [[RMS Olympic]]'s tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;3 November 2008 [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Unsinkable Titanic''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/titanic/page65.htm ''Les canots de sauvetage''], le Site du Titanic. Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ismay occasionally accompanied his ships on their maiden voyages, and this was the case with the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref name="WSL" /&gt; During the voyage, Ismay talked with either (or possibly both) chief engineer Joseph Bell or Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]] about a possible test of speed if time permitted.{{sfn|Piouffre|2009|pp=111–112}} After the ship collided with an [[iceberg]] 400 miles south of the [[Grand Banks|Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] on the night of 14 April 1912, Ismay bore the full brunt of his errors in the ship's lifeboat capacity when it was made clear the ship would founder before any rescue ships would reach the area. Ismay stepped aboard Collapsible C, which was launched less than 20 minutes before the ship went down.&lt;ref name="canotc"&gt;{{fr}} [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/titanic/page129.htm ''Composition du radeau pliable C''], le Site du Titanic. Retrieved 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He later testified that as the ship was in her final moments, he turned away, unable to watch his creation sink beneath the waters of the [[North Atlantic]]. Collapsible C was picked up by the ''Carpathia'' about 3–4 hours later.

After being picked up by the ''Carpathia'', Ismay was led to the cabin belonging to the ship's doctor, Frank Mcgee.  He gave [[Arthur Rostron|Captain Rostron]] a message to send to White Star's New York office: "Deeply regret advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision iceberg, resulting serious loss life further particulars later. Bruce Ismay". Ismay did not leave Dr. Mcgee's cabin for the entire journey, ate nothing solid, and was kept under the influence of opiates.{{sfn|Piouffre|2009|p=207}}{{sfn|Piouffre|2009|p=209}}  Another survivor, 17-year-old [[Jack Thayer]], visited Ismay to try to console him, despite having just lost his father in the sinking.

{{quote|[Ismay] was staring straight ahead, shaking like a leaf.  Even when I spoke to him, he paid absolutely no attention.  I have never seen a man so completely wrecked.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m-xoPImeijsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=I+have+never+seen+a+man+so+completely+wrecked&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tfKUYVrhba&amp;sig=GP5SOOd7yBLeFvfdGP6Tg27jmhI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhxdqAtsXcAhWpgVwKHebBBvAQ6AEIFzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20never%20seen%20a%20man%20so%20completely%20wrecked&amp;f=true&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When he arrived in New York, Ismay was hosted by Philip Franklin, vice president of the company. He also received a summons to appear before a Senate committee headed by Republican Senator [[William Alden Smith]]. Ismay later testified at the ''Titanic'' disaster inquiry hearings held by both the [[U.S. Senate]] (chaired by Senator [[William Alden Smith]]) the following day, and the British [[Board of Trade]] (chaired by [[John Charles Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey|Lord Mersey]]) a few weeks later.

===Criticism===

After the disaster, Ismay was savaged by both the American and the British press for deserting the ship while women and children were still on board. Some papers called him the "Coward of the ''Titanic''" or "J. Brute Ismay" and suggested that the White Star flag be changed to a yellow liver. Some ran negative cartoons depicting him deserting the ship. The writer [[Ben Hecht]], then a young newspaperman in [[Chicago]], wrote a scathing poem contrasting the actions of Capt. Smith and Ismay. The final verse reads: "To hold your place in the ghastly face / of death on the sea at night / is a seaman's job, but to flee with the mob / is an owner's noble right."&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-688-04939-3}} Walter Lord, "The Night Lives On". New York: William Morrow and Company. 1986. pp. 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some maintain Ismay followed the "[[women and children first]]" principle, having assisted many women and children himself. Ismay's actions were defended in the official British inquiry, which found "Mr. Ismay, after rendering assistance to many passengers, found "C" collapsible, the last boat on the starboard side, actually being lowered. No other people were there at the time. There was room for him and he jumped in. Had he not jumped in he would merely have added one more life, namely, his own, to the number of those lost."&lt;ref&gt;"Shipping casualties (loss of the steamship ''Titanic''). Report of a formal investigation into the circumstances attending the foundering on 15th April, 1912, of the British steamship ''Titanic,'' of Liverpool, after striking ice in or near latitude 410 46' N., Longitude 500 14' W., North Atlantic Ocean, whereby loss of life ensued." [[Command paper|Cd.]] 6532, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ismay had boarded Collapsible C with first-class passenger William Carter; both said they did so after there were no more women and children near that particular lifeboat. Carter's own behaviour and reliability, however, were criticised by [[Lucile Carter|Mrs. Lucile Carter]], who sued him for divorce in 1914; she testified Carter had left her and their children to fend for themselves after the crash and accused him of "cruel and barbarous treatment and indignities to the person".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lord, ''The Night Lives On''. New York: William Morrow and Company. 1986. pp. 216–217. {{ISBN|978-0-688-04939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; London society ostracised Ismay and labelled him a coward. On 30 June 1913, Ismay resigned as president of International Mercantile Marine and chairman of the White Star Line, to be succeeded by Harold Sanderson.

Ismay announced during the United States Inquiry that all the vessels of the International Mercantile Marine Company would be equipped with lifeboats in sufficient numbers for all passengers.{{sfn|Piouffre|2009|p=257}} Following the inquiry, Ismay and the surviving officers of the ship returned to England aboard {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|6}}.

== ''Titanic'' controversy ==
During the congressional investigations, some passengers testified that during the voyage they heard Ismay pressuring [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward J. Smith]] to go faster, in order to arrive in New York ahead of schedule and generate some free press about the new liner. The book ''The White Star Line: An Illustrated History'' (2000) by Paul Louden-Brown states that this was unlikely, and that Ismay's record does not support the notion that he had any motive to do so.&lt;ref name="THS"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.titanichistoricalsociety.org/articles/ismay.html| title = Ismay and the Titanic| author = Louden-Brown, Paul| date = 10 January 2001| accessdate = 22 March 2017| publisher = Titanic Historical Society| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170515141920/http://www.titanichistoricalsociety.org/articles/ismay.html| archive-date = 15 May 2017| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing on the [[BBC News]] magazine website, Rosie Waites reports that Ismay was widely vilified in America after the sinking of the ''Titanic'', due to the hostility shown in the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] controlled by [[William Randolph Hearst]], who had fallen out with Ismay. Waites writes "Ismay was almost universally condemned in America, where the Hearst syndicated press ran a vitriolic campaign against him, labelling him 'J. Brute Ismay'. It published lists of all those who died but in the column of those saved it had just one name – Ismay's."&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17515305| title = Five Titanic myths spread by films| author = Waites, Rosie| date = 5 April 2012| accessdate = 8 May 2014| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from the Hearst press depiction of Ismay, Waites writes that every subsequent film about the ''Titanic'' has depicted Ismay as a villain, starting with the 1943 Nazi propaganda film ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]''; the 1996 miniseries ''[[Titanic (1996 miniseries)|Titanic]]''; [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''; and [[Julian Fellowes|Julian Fellowes']] TV miniseries ''[[Titanic (2012 miniseries)|Titanic]]'', where he is shown to be a racist who orders a group of non-British crew members locked below to drown.&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt; Louden-Brown, consultant to the Cameron film, has stated that he thought the antagonistic characterisation of Ismay was unfair and he tried to challenge this. Louden-Brown said "Apart from being told, under no circumstances are we prepared to adjust the script, one thing they also said is 'this is what the public expect to see'."&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt; The 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'' did not blame Ismay for the disaster, but also presented him in an unfavourable and cowardly light, while a ''Titanic''-themed episode of the science fiction television series ''[[Voyagers!]]'' portrayed Ismay dressing as a woman in order to sneak into a lifeboat.

[[John Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey|Lord Mersey]], who led the 1912 [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British inquiry into the sinking of the ''Titanic'']], concluded that Ismay had helped many other passengers before finding a place for himself on the last lifeboat to leave the starboard side.&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt;

== Later life ==
[[File:Bruce Ismay grave Putney Vale 2014.jpg|thumb|alt=A fenced patch of grass in a cemetery with four headstones of different shapes|Bruce Ismay's family grave at [[Putney Vale Cemetery]], London in 2014]]
Ismay's reputation never recovered from the damage done to it by the ''Titanic'' disaster, and he kept a low profile afterwards. He lived part of the year in a large cottage, Costelloe Lodge, near [[Casla]] in [[Connemara]], [[Ireland]]. Paul Louden-Brown, in his history of the White Star Line, writes that Ismay continued to be active in business, and that much of his work was for The Liverpool &amp; London Steamship Protection &amp; Indemnity Association Limited, a company founded by his father. According to Louden-Brown: "Hundreds of thousands of pounds were paid out in insurance claims to the relatives of the ''Titanic''{{'s}} victims; the misery created by the disaster and its aftermath dealt with by Ismay and his directors with great fortitude, this, despite the fact that he could easily have shirked his responsibilities and resigned from the board. He stuck with the difficult task and during his twenty-five year chairmanship hardly a page of the company's minutes does not contain some mention of the ''Titanic'' disaster."&lt;ref name="THS"/&gt;

Ismay maintained an interest in maritime affairs. He inaugurated a cadet ship called ''Mersey'' used to train officers for [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Britain's Merchant Navy]], donated £11,000 to start a fund for lost seamen, and in 1919 gave £25,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|25000|1919|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} to set up a fund to recognise the contribution of merchant mariners in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanictown.plus.com/titanictown/titanic.htm Titanic 15 April 1912], www.titanictown.plus.com. Retrieved 8 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
His health declined in the 1930s, following a diagnosis of [[diabetes]], which worsened in early 1936, when the illness resulted in amputation of part of his right leg. He returned to [[UK|Britain]] a few months later, settling in a small house on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. J. Bruce Ismay died in [[Mayfair]], London on 17 October 1937, of a [[cerebral thrombosis|stroke]] at the age of 74.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B00EFDC133EE03ABC4152DFB667838C629EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=J.

After his death, she renounced her [[British subject]] status in order to restore her American citizenship on 14 November 1949. Julia Florence Ismay, ''née'' Schieffelin, died 31 December 1963, aged 96, in [[Kensington]], London.

[[File:Julia caesaris.jpg|thumb|200px|Julia from ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]].'' The inscription reads: "Julia; Gaius Caesar's daughter; Pompey' wife."]]
'''Julia Caesaris Filia''' ([[Classical Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•CAESARIS•FILIA&lt;/small&gt;), c. 76 BC–54 BC, was the daughter of [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] by his first wife [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]], and his only child from his three marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', iii. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Julia became the fourth wife of [[Pompey]] the Great and was renowned for her beauty and virtue.

==Life==
Julia was probably born around 76 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Edward Farquhar Chilver , Robin J. Seager " Iulia (2)" ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Ed. Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth. Oxford University Press 2009. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t111.e3368.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died in 69 BC &lt;ref&gt;Matthias Gelzer, ''Caesar, Politician and Statesman'', (translated by Peter Needham), Oxford, 1968; [[Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton]], ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', vol. 2, 132, New York, (1951–1986). Gelzer quotes Broughton to assert that Caesar was quaestor in 69.
Gelzer then explains that Caesar, after taking on his place of duty, delivered an oration in praise of his aunt Julia. Shortly after this, his wife died too.&lt;/ref&gt; when Julia was only seven years old, after which she was raised by her paternal grandmother [[Aurelia Cotta]]. Her father engaged her to Quintus Servilius Caepio, who could have been [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sempronius [I 15]''. In: ''Der Neue Pauly''. Vol. 11, col. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; (Caesar's most famous assassin) who, after being adopted by his uncle Quintus Servilius Caepio, was known as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus for an unknown period of time. Caesar broke off this engagement and married her to [[Pompey]] in April 59 BC, with whom Caesar sought a strong political alliance in forming the [[First Triumvirate]]. This family-alliance of its two great chiefs was regarded as the firmest bond between Caesar and Pompey, and was accordingly viewed with much alarm by the ''[[optimates]]'' (the [[Oligarchy|oligarchal]] party in Rome), especially by [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and [[Cato the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum|Letters to Atticus]]'', ii. 17, viii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Caesar]]'', 14; ''[[Parallel Lives|Pompey]]'', 48; ''[[Parallel Lives|Cato the Younger]]'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars#Life of Julius Caesar|Life of Julius Caesar]]'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey was supposedly infatuated with his bride. The personal charms of Julia were remarkable: she was a kind woman of beauty and virtue; and although policy prompted her union, and she was thirty years younger than her husband, she possessed in Pompey a devoted husband, to whom she was, in return, devotedly attached.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A rumor suggested that the middle aged conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey had been given the governorship of [[Hispania Ulterior]], but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the [[Rome's grain supply|Roman grain supply]] as ''curator annonae'', exercising his command through subordinates.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 53"&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia died before a breach between her husband and father had become inevitable.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 53"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius Paterculus]], ii. 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; At the election of aediles in 55 BC, Pompey was surrounded by a tumultuous mob, and his gown was sprinkled with blood of the rioters. A slave carried the stained toga to his house on the [[Carinae]] and was seen by Julia. Imagining that her husband was slain, she fell into premature labor,&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 53"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings'', iv. 6. § 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and her constitution received an irreparable shock. In August of the next year, 54 BC, she died in child birth,&lt;ref&gt;William Smith (ed.), ''A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography'', 1851.&lt;/ref&gt; and her infant—a son, according to some writers,&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ii. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Julius Caesar'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucanus, v. 474, ix. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; a daughter, according to others,&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 53"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, xxxix. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;—did not survive and died along with Julia.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, xl. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was in Britain, according to Seneca,&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''[[Ad Marciam, De consolatione|To Marcia, On consolation]]'', xiv. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; when he received the tidings of Julia's death.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Oration for Publius Quinctius'', iii. 1; ''Letters to Atticus'', iv. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey wished her ashes to repose in his favourite [[Alban hills|Alban]] villa, but the Roman people, who loved Julia, determined they should rest in the [[Campus Martius|field of Mars]] (''Campus Martius''). For permission a special decree of the senate was necessary, and [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus]], one of the consuls of 54 BC, impelled by his hatred for Pompey and Caesar, procured an interdict from the tribunes. But the popular will prevailed, and, after listening to a funeral oration&lt;ref&gt;In Latin: ''laudatio funebris''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the forum, the people placed her urn in the field of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, xxxix. 64; xlviii. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later the official pyre for Caesar's cremation would be erected near the tomb of his daughter,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Julius Caesar'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe condita|Ad urbe condita]]'' preserved by a 4th century summary entitled ''Periochae'', cxvi. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but the people intervened after the funeral oration by [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] and cremated Caesar's body in the [[Forum Romanum|Forum]].

After Julia’s death, Pompey and Caesar’s alliance began to fade, which resulted in [[Caesar's civil war]]. It was allegedly remarked, as a singular [[omen]], that on the day [[Augustus]] entered Rome as Caesar's adoptive son (in May 44 BC), the monument of Julia was struck by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars#Life of Augustus|Life of Augustus]]'', 95; compare ''Life of Julius Caesar '', 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar himself vowed a ceremony to her [[manes]], which he exhibited in 46 BC as extensive funeral games including gladiatorial combats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, xliii. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the ceremony was chosen to coincide with the ''ludi Veneris Genetricis'' on September 26,&lt;ref&gt;John T. Ramsey, A. Lewis Licht, ''[https://books.google.com/books?q=The+Comet+of+44+B.C.+and+Caesar%27s+Funeral+Games|The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games]'', appendix III, Oxford University Press US, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; the festival in honor of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Genetrix]], the divine ancestress of the [[Iulii|Julians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus|Octavian]] followed this precedent in 44 BC by staging the ''ludi funebres'' for Caesar while simultaneously moving the ''Ludi Veneris Genetricis'' from September to July, after which time they were known as ''[[Ludi Victoriae Caesaris]]''; see John T. Ramsey and A.

==Cultural depictions of Julia==

===Literature===
* In the novel ''Caesar's Women'' by [[Colleen McCullough]], Julia is one of the three main female characters, along with her grandmother Aurelia Cotta and her father's mistress Servilia. 
* In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s epic poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' (14th century), Julia was encountered by Dante in the first circle of Hell, the ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Limbo]]'' (where rest souls who are not in torture, the pagans that lived righteous existences):&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', Inferno Canto IV, 24, 45 and 128, translated by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], Boston: Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

::[...] The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss. [...]
::[...] I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended. [...]
::[...] [[Lucretia]], Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia, [...]

The Italian [[Renaissance]] poet [[Carlo Marsuppini]] wrote a eulogy about [[Piccarda Bueri]], in which he compared her to Julia. He names her as an example of great marital devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pernis and Adams | page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* In ''[[Julius Caesar (TV miniseries)|Julius Caesar]]'' (2002 television movie), the role of the child Julia is played by Alexandra Morris,&lt;ref&gt;[https://tv.yahoo.com/caesar/show/501/castcrew Caesar Cast &amp; Crew – Yahoo! TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peplums.info/pep19.htm PEPLUM – Jules Cesar (DVD)]&lt;/ref&gt; while the role of the adult Julia is played by Italian actress [[Nicole Grimaudo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0284741|title=Julius Caesar (2002)(TV)}} Retrieved July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Julia's death is portrayed in the premiere episode of HBO's 2005 television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.  However, Julia actually died in childbirth in 54 BC, at least 5 years before the events of this episode.

'''Lars Gunnar "Lasse" Eriksson''' (1 April 1949 – 3 March 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Komikern Lasse Eriksson död |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/komikern-lasse-eriksson-dod_5983689.svd |newspaper=[[SvD]] |language=Swedish |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Swedish comedian, actor and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forelasare.skillspartner.se/talare/lasse-eriksson-190.html |title=Skillspartner.se: ''Lasse Eriksson'' |publisher=skillspartner.se |language=Swedish |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812165848/http://www.forelasare.skillspartner.se/talare/lasse-eriksson-190.html |archivedate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriksson was born in [[Piteå]], Sweden. He took a bachelor of arts in [[economic history]] before he initiated a theatrical career in the 1970s, when he played at the [[Panic Theatre]] in Uppsala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unt.se/uppsala/underhallaren-lasse-eriksson-dod-1272375.aspx |title=''Underhållaren Lasse Eriksson död'' |publisher=unt.se |language=Swedish |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[brass band]] in 1983, he did the show ''Vad varje kvinna bör veta om män'' (''What every woman should know about men''). In 1984, he became known to TV audiences with his personal contemplations in ''Dagsedlar'' (''Daily pages''), which were brief five-minute episodes accompanied by the dog Hillman. In 1985–86, he was the presenter of ''Café Luleå'' and in 2002, he was the team commander in ''Snacka om nyheter'' (''News talk''). Eriksson was also part of the original 1999 panel of ''[[Parlamentet]]'', where he teamed with Annika Lantz in the red party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/tv/article5401405.ab |title=Lantz till hårt angrepp mot "Parlamentet" |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |author=Ylva Niklasson |quote=Originalpanelen bestod av Helge Skoog och Johan Wahlström i det blå partiet samt Lasse Eriksson och Annika Lantz i det röda partiet. |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriksson rose to fame mainly as a [[stand-up comedian]]. He also composed and wrote several songs, among the best known is ''Stället'', a stylish reflection on rural people's everyday thoughts. In 1992, Eriksson participated in the stand-up revue ''Spik'' at the [[Vasateatern|Vasa Theatre]], and worked with [[Iwa Boman]] on the shows ''Jägare och jungfrur, typ'' (''Hunters and maidens, sort of'') (1995) and ''Är du för eller emot EMU'' (''Are you for or against EMU'') (2000). For many years, one could hear Eriksson at the radio program ''Telespånarna'' at [[Sveriges Radio P4]] on Sunday mornings.

Eriksson died 3 March 2011 on stage during the show ''Fyra lyckliga män 2'' (''Four happy men 2'') at the [[Regina Theatre, Uppsala|Regina Theatre]] in [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unt.se/uppsala/underhallaren-lasse-eriksson-dod-1272375.aspx |title=''Underhållaren Lasse Eriksson död'' |publisher=unt.se |language=Swedish |quote=Lasse Eriksson föll ihop på scenen under föreställningen av Fyra lyckliga män på Regina teatern.

'''Lembitu''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] also: '''Lembit''', died 21 September 1217) was an [[ancient Estonia]]n king of [[Sakala County]] and military leader in the struggle against [[Livonian crusade|conquest of the Estonian lands]] by the [[Germans|German]] [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] at the beginning of the 13th century. He is the only Estonian pre-Crusade ruler, about whom some biographical information is known (he is mentioned only in the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-4904-4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC&amp;pg=PA310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lembitu, also referred to in [[Latin]] as ''Lambite'', ''Lembito'' or ''Lembitus'', was first mentioned in chronicles in 1211. Troops led by Lembitu destroyed a troop of missionaries in the historical Estonian county of [[Sakala County|Sakala]] (''Sackalia'') and made a raid as far as [[Pskov]], then a town of the [[Novgorod Republic]].  In 1215, Lembitu's Lehola (''Leal'') stronghold (situated near the present town of [[Suure-Jaani]]) was taken by Germans and Lembitu was taken prisoner. He was released in 1217.

Lembitu attempted to unite the [[Estonians]] in order to withstand the German conquest. He managed to assemble an army of 6,000 Estonian men from different counties, but was killed in the following [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] in September 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1970 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc |page= 734 |isbn= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=cyXwSPGlPIquywSt1qWrBw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22in+1217%2C+the+knights+defeated+the+Estonians+and+killed+their+commander+Lembitu%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MERCI Retriever''' is a medical device designed to treat [[Stroke#Ischemic|Ischemic Strokes]]. The name is an [[acronym]] for '''M'''echanical '''E'''mbolus '''R'''emoval in '''C'''erebral '''I'''schemia. Designed by [[UCLA|University of California, Los Angeles]] in 2001, MERCI was the first device approved in the U.S. to remove blood clots in patients suffering from acute [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name=Story&gt;

==Mechanism==

In an ischemic stroke, there is an obstruction within blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. The goal in treatment of such a stroke is to restore blood flow through these blood vessels. The MERCI retriever does so by allowing the removal of the blood clots causing the obstruction.

The retriever consists of a long thin wire with a helical coil formed at the distal end.  A [[balloon catheter]] is snaked into the affected vessel from the [[femoral artery]], and the balloon is inflated to prevent blood flow that could hinder the retrieval process.  The retriever is then fed through the catheter, during which the distal coil is straightened to fit through the catheter tube.  When the retriever emerges at the clot site, the coil reforms, wrapping around the clot and allowing the clot to be removed with the catheter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems|year=2009–2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780323036887|pages=1469–1470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The MERCI Retriever obtained U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] clearance in August 2004 for [[Blood clot#Prognosis|re-canalization]] of cerebral arteries in acute stroke.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

A '''mock execution''' is a stratagem in which a victim is deliberately but falsely made to feel that their execution or that of another person is imminent or is taking place. It may be staged for an audience or a subject who is made to believe that they are being led to their own execution. This might involve [[blindfold]]ing the subjects, making them recount last wishes, making them dig their own [[Grave (burial)|grave]], holding an unloaded gun to their head and pulling the trigger, shooting near (but not at) the victim, or firing [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]]. Mock execution is categorized as [[psychological torture]]. There is a sense of fear induced when a person is made to feel that they are about to be executed or witness someone being executed. Mock execution is considered psychological torture because there is no physical harm caused, but there is mental harm.

The [[psychological trauma]] can also lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and other mental disorders after experiencing a traumatic event such as a mock execution. An example of anxiety during a mock execution would be the victim showing signs of fear, crying, uncontrollable movements, and pleading for their life. The psychological trauma may lead to a breakdown where someone may do or say something to stop the execution; it might act as a threat that future conduct may result in a real execution; or suggest that the apparent victim's death has changed the circumstances. Using mock execution may not result in death, but leaves the victim with the memory of the torture they experienced. Treatment after experiencing torture should take effect as soon as possible. Interventions and specialists have been proven to be beneficial. In Lilla Hardi, Gábor Király, Esther Kovács, and Kathryn Heffernan's 2010 publication ''Torture and Survivors: Manual for Experts in Refugee Care'', treatments for trauma are discussed. According to the authors, trauma specialists are able to help victims overcome the experience, emotions, and explains that it will be a long healing process. Trauma specialists are able to assist the victim in identifying the issue and brainstorming ways to overcome the trauma. Interventions are beneficial as it allows the victim to be more comfortable with discussing the event, relating to individuals with similar experiences, and practicing coping skills.

== Historical instances ==
* In 1849, members of Russian political discussion group the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], including writer [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], were convicted for high treason and sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentences were commuted to hard labour secretly and the prisoners were told only after all the preparations for execution had been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frank |first1=Joseph |title=Dostoevsky A Writer in His Time |date=2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dostoevsky described the experience in his novel ''[[The Idiot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dostoevsky |first1=Fyodor |title=The Idiot |date=2004 |publisher=Penguin Classics |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
* In 1968, [[Commander Lloyd M. Bucher]], Commander of the ''USS Pueblo'', was tortured and put through a mock firing squad by [[North Korea|North Korean]] interrogators in an effort to make him confess; see ''[[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS Pueblo]]''. Eventually, the Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented. None of the Koreans knew English well enough to write the confession, so they had Bucher write it himself. They verified the meaning of his words, but failed to catch the pun when he said "We paean the North Korean state. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22978 Bush lauded for handling of EP-3 incident] WorldNetDaily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepalmbeachtimes.com/Pages/Korea.html End of North Korea?] ''[[The Palm Beach Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ("We [[paean]]" sounds almost identical to "we [[Urination|pee]] on"). Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that ''Pueblo'' had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members.
* The [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages held by Iran]] of 1979 were subject to a mock execution by their detainers.
* Reports of mock executions carried out by the [[US Marines]] on detainees in Iraq surfaced in December 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17206&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union: U.S. Marines Engaged in Mock Executions of Iraqi Juveniles and Other Forms of Abuse, Documents Obtained by ACLU Reveal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published internal documents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS) obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] scandal.
*In 2000, British military hostages in Sierra Leone were subject to mock executions by the [[West Side Boys]] to get information from them.
* In April 2003, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] (who later served a single term as a [[United States Congress|Congressman]] for [[Florida's 22nd congressional district]]) had an Iraqi police officer named Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi seized and brought in for questioning based on allegations he was planning an imminent attack on West's unit. After Hamoodi was allegedly beaten by an interpreter and several U.S. troops, West took Hamoodi out of the interrogation room and showed him six U.S. troops with weapons in hand. West told Hamoodi, "If you don't talk, they will kill you."  West then placed Hamoodi's head in a bucket used for clearing weapons, placed his gun into the bucket and discharged the weapon near Hamoodi's head.  Hamoodi then provided West with names, location and methods of the alleged ambush. However, the alleged ambush—supposedly scheduled for the following day—never occurred, and a search of Hamoodi's residence uncovered no evidence of any plans of attack. Hamoodi was subsequently released without charges. For his involvement in this incident, West was charged with violations of two statutes of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]; however, charges were subsequently dropped after West was fined $5,000 for the incident and allowed to resign his position with the U.S. Army without court martial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/27/politics/27WEST.html?ex=1400990400&amp;en=71d7b26fe2922d57&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND  Deborah Sontag, "How Colonel Risked His Career by Menacing Detainee and Lost", New York Times (May 27 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] was subjected to mock executions by [[Islamic State of Iraq and Levant|ISIL]] [[Jihadi John|militants]] before he was beheaded. Mock executions are reported to be a common torture tactic used by ISIL.

==History==
In 1997, the [[Council of Europe]] established the "Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation
of Anti-[[Money Laundering]] Measures", carrying the official [[abbreviation]] of '''PC-R-EV''', as a sub-committee of the European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC, for ''Comité Européen pour les Problèmes Criminels'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/1998%201999%20ENG.pdf  Annual Report 1998-99], Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of PC-R-EV were to be regulated by the general provisions of Resolution Res(2005)47 on committees and subordinate bodies.

In 2002, the name of the committee was changed to "Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism", with the [[abbreviation]] '''Moneyval''', on the grounds that "the abbreviation 'PC-R-EV' does not express the aim of the committee’s activities sufficiently clearly."&lt;ref name=monaco&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=281665&amp;Site=COE Request by the Principality of Monaco to be evaluated by the Select Committee of Experts on the evaluation of anti-money laundering measures], Rapporteur Group on Legal Co-operation, Council of Europe, 13 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

At their meeting of 13 October 2010, the Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution elevating Moneyval, from 1 January 2011, to an "independent monitoring mechanism within the Council of Europe, answerable directly to the [[Committee of Ministers]]".&lt;ref name=council&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/moneyval/About/MONEYVAL_in_brief_en.asp Moneyval in brief], Council of Europe website&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''month's mind''' is a [[requiem mass]] celebrated about one month after a person's death, in memory of the deceased. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/month%27s%20mind month's mind], Merriam-Webster dictionary. Retrieved: 2010-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval and later [[England]], it was a service and feast held one month after the death of anyone in his or her memory. [[Bede]] speaks of the day as ''commemorationis dies''. These "minding days" were of great antiquity, and were survivals of the Norse ''minne'', or ceremonial drinking to the dead.

"Minnying Days," says Blount, "from the Saxon Lemynde, days which our ancestors called their monthes mind, their Year's mind and the like, being the days whereon their souls (after their deaths) were had in special remembrance, and some [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] or obsequies said for them, as Obits, Dirges." The phrase is still used in [[Lancashire]]. 

It is still an almost universal practice in Ireland (for Roman Catholics) for the family of the deceased and close friends to attend mass and take a meal together on the occasion of the month's mind.

Elaborate instructions for the conduct of the commemorative service were often left in wills. Thus, one Thomas Windsor (who died in 1479) orders that "on my moneth's minde there be a hundred children within the age of sixteen years, to say for my soul," and candles were to be burned before the rood (cross) in the parish church and twenty priests were to be paid by his executors to sing Placebo, Dirige, and other songs. In the correspondence of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas, Lord Cromwell]], one in 1536 is mentioned at which a hundred priests took part in the [[requiem]] [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]. Commemorative sermons were usually preached, the earliest printed example being one delivered by [[John Fisher]], bishop of Rochester, on [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret, countess of Richmond and Derby]], in 1509.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''Mu'awiya ibn Hisham''' ({{floruit|725–737}}) was an [[Arabs|Arab]] general, the son of the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 723–743), who distinguished himself in the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]]. His son, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya]], was the founder of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]] and the Umayyad line of [[al-Andalus]].

==Biography==
Mu'awiya he was son of the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd Al-Malik and Um Al-Hakam bint Yahia ibn Al-Hakam, one of his cousins, is known chiefly for his role in the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]], where he led many invasions against [[Byzantine]] [[Asia Minor]]. The first campaign he led was in summer 725, which was carried out in conjunction with a naval attack by Maymun ibn Mihran against [[Cyprus]]. According to Arab accounts, Mua'wiya's army reached as far as [[Dorylaion]], capturing many prisoners and sacking several forts.&lt;ref name="B120"&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"&gt;Winkelmann &amp; Lilie (2000), p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Mu'awiya is also recorded to have launched an expedition in 726, possibly in winter, but nothing specific is known of it. In 727, he led another expedition, alongside [[Abdallah al-Battal]]. Battal captured and razed [[Gangra]] first, and then their combined forces took the fortress of Ateous, and advanced on [[Nicaea]]. Despite [[Siege of Nicaea (727)|a 40-day siege]], however, they failed to capture it.&lt;ref name="B120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt; In 728 he led the southern expedition into Asia Minor, while his brother [[Sa'id ibn Hisham]] led the northern; neither appears to have been particularly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim sources attribute to him the capture of the fortress of [[Charsianon]] in September/October 730, but Byzantine sources state that this was done by Mu'awiya's uncle, [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]]. In the next year, his forces were reportedly unable to penetrate the frontier, while a secondary expedition by al-Battal was heavily defeated. In 732, Mu'awiya's expedition penetrated as far as [[Akroinon]].&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In 733, he led an expedition into [[Paphlagonia]]. He continued to lead expeditions over the next few years, bit although they ranged deep into Asia Minor in search of plunder—one of his raiding parties reportedly reached [[Sardeis]] near the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast—no major town or fortress appears to have been captured.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 737 he again led the southern expedition, but died, according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], by falling from his horse during a hunt.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blankinship (1994), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

His son by a [[Berber people|Berber]] concubine, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya|Abd al-Rahman]] (731–788), escaped the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the [[Abbasid Revolution]] to [[al-Andalus]], where he founded the Umayyad [[Emirate of Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;Ṭāhā (1998), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Funeral Customs''' was located at 1440 Monument Ave. in [[Springfield, Illinois]], USA. It featured exhibits dealing with American [[funeral|funerary]] and [[mourning]] customs. The [[museum]] was near [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]], the site of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Lincoln's Tomb|tomb]].  Collections at the museum included a re-created 1920s [[embalming]] room, [[coffin]]s and funeral paraphernalia from various cultures and times, examples of [[post-mortem photography]], and a scale model of Lincoln's [[funeral train]].  The museum hosted tours and special events and provided resources to scholars who are researching funeral customs. A gift shop provided books and funeral-related gifts, including coffin-shaped keychains and chocolates.  The museum was closed in March 2009 due to poor attendance and handling of the museum's trust fund.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/us/09funeral.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1254586499-/QycUK/kcjvwM/iqRsqGfA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelastromance.com.my/ The Last Romance] - {{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12175 |title=Museum of Funeral Customs - Closed, Springfield, Illinois |publisher=Roadsideamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the collection were transferred to the Kibbe Hancock Heritage Museum in [[Carthage, Illinois]] in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swearingen|first=Joy|title=Priceless museum pieces come to Kibbe; Artifacts include Lincoln funeral history, replicas|url=http://www.journalpilot.com/articles/2011/02/01/news/news1.txt|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629141842/http://www.journalpilot.com/articles/2011/02/01/news/news1.txt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 June 2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2011|newspaper=Hancock County Journal-Pilot|date=1 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Фёдорович Фёдоров}}; surname also Anglicized as "Fedorov") (June 9, 1829 – December 28, 1903) was a [[Russia]]n [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the [[Russian cosmism]] movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fyodorov advocated radical [[life extension]], physical [[immortality]] and even [[resurrection of the dead]], using scientific methods.

== Biography ==
Fyodorov's parents were the [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurikid]] [[knyaz]] (noble) Pavel Ivanovich Gagarin and Elisaveta Ivanova, a woman of lower-class nobility.

He studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum (Odessa)|Richelieu Lyceum]] in [[Odessa]]. From 1854 to 1868, he served as a teacher in various small Russian towns. In 1878, he joined the [[Russian State Library|Rumyantsev Museum]] staff as a librarian. Fyodorov opposed the idea of [[intellectual property|property]] of books and ideas and never published anything during his lifetime. His selected articles were printed posthumously with the title ''Philosophy of the Common Task'' (also known as ''Philosophy of Physical Resurrection'').

== Philosophy ==
Fyodorov was a [[Futures studies|futurist]], who theorized about the eventual [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfection]] of the human race and society (i.e., [[utopia]]), including radical ideas like [[immortality]], [[Resurrection|revival of the dead]], [[space colonization|space]] and [[ocean colonization]].
His writings greatly influenced mystic [[Peter Uspensky]]. He also had direct contact with early rocket theorist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], who visited the library where he worked over a 3-year period. He was also known to [[Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

===Fyodorov and Tolstoy===
Leo Tolstoy was of the highest opinion of Fyodorov. They were quite friendly, and shared many ideas in the 1880s and early 90s. But Fyodorov refused to see Tolstoy again after 1892, because of their ideological differences. That was the time of some food shortages in Russia because of poor harvest. Tolstoy published in the London ''Daily Telegraph'' an article accusing the Russian government of not doing enough for the peasants, which displeased many Russian conservatives.

While Fyodorov shared with Tolstoy many religious ideas, he was also a church-going Christian who cared very much for the Orthodox ritual observance. This was also a big stumbling block between them.

=== Humankind’s Common Cause ===
Fedorov argued that [[human evolution|evolutionary]] process was directed towards increased [[intelligence]] and its role in the development of life. Humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov also argued that [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] is the most obvious indicator of the still imperfect, contradictory nature of humanity and the underlying reason for most evil and [[nihilism]] of humankind. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people of Earth, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth (he called this the Common Cause).

Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science, and that this knowledge must leave the laboratories and become the common property of all: "Everyone must be learning and everything be the subject of knowledge and action".

=== Two reasons for death ===

Human life, emphasized Fedorov, dies for two reasons. First is internal: due to the material organization of a human, his or her functionality is incapable of infinite self-renewal. To overcome this, psychophysiological regulation of human organisms is needed. The second reason is the unpredictable nature of the external environment; its destructive character must be overcome with the regulation of Nature. Regulation of nature, "introducing will and reason into nature" includes, according to Fedorov, prevention of natural disasters, control of Earth's climate, fight against viruses and epidemics, mastery of solar power, space exploration and unlimited creative work there.

=== Immortality for all ===
Achieving immortality and resurrection of all people who ever lived are two inseparable goals, according to Fedorov. Immortality is impossible, both ethically and physically, without resurrection. We cannot allow our ancestors, who gave us life and culture, to remain buried, or our relatives and friends to die. Achieving immortality for individuals alive today and future generations is only a partial victory over death – only the first stage. The complete victory will be achieved only when everyone is resurrected and transformed to enjoy immortal life.

=== Restoring life and making it infinite ===

Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite.
His first project involved collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on "knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world". This idea of Fedorov is related to the modern practice of [[cloning]].
The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary.
The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person (the problem of identity in cloning). It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fedorov speculates about the idea of "radial images" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, humanity will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.

=== Transformation of past physical forms ===
The revival of people who lived during the past is not a recreation of their past physical form – it was imperfect, parasitic, centered on mortal existence. Fedorov's idea was to transform it into self-creating, mind-controlled form, capable of infinite renewal, which is immortal. Those who haven’t died will go through the same transformation. Humans will have to become creators and organizers of their organisms ("our body will be our business"). In the past the development of civilization happened by increasing human power using external tools and machines – the human body remained imperfect.

=== Transhumanism ===
{{main|Transhumanism}}
Fedorov stated that people needed to reconcile the difference between the power of technology and weakness of the human physical form. The transition is overdue from purely technical development, a "[[Prosthesis|prosthetic]]" civilization, to organic progress, when not just external tools, artificial implements, but the organisms themselves are improved, so that, for example, a person can fly, see far and deep, travel through space, live in any environment. People must become capable of "organodevelopment" that so far only nature was capable of. Fedorov discussed supremacy of mind, "giving, developing organs for itself" and anticipated [[Vladimir Vernadsky|V. Vernadsky]]’s idea of autotrophic humans. He argues that a person must become an [[autotroph]]ic, self-feeding creature, acquire a new mode of energy exchange with the environment that will not end.

Fedorov repeatedly said that only general scientific studies of aging, death and postmortem studies can deliver the means to overcome death and promote indefinite healthy lifespan.

== Fedorov's quotes ==
Fedorov's criticism of philosophers:

''How unnatural it is to ask, ‘Why does that which exists, exist?' and yet how completely natural it is to ask, ‘Why do the living die?‘''

Fedorov's vision of regulation of nature and the "common task" that could unite humankind:
"Natural phenomena will remain visions until they become the product of the general will and activity of all humans, acting as God's tools. And notions will remain ghostly and dream-like until they become projects, blueprints for the works to be achieved by the general human will and that of God manifested in it."

"The value of a thought is determined by the larger or smaller number of people it concerns; the most general evil affecting all – a crime, in fact – is death, and therefore the supreme good, the supreme task, is resuscitation."

"For man as the consciousness of nature, the natural problem, the problem of nature as a force which procreates and kills, constitutes his natural task because it solves the problem of hunger, epidemics and sickness in general – that is, of old age and death. Both believers and unbelievers can unite in this natural task, and by uniting and carrying out the task they will attain oneness of mind."

== Popular culture ==
[[File:Nikolai Fedorov monument at Borovsk, Kaluga.jpg|thumb|left|Nikolai Fedorov monument at Borovsk, Kaluga Oblast]]

The 2011 BBC documentary ''Knocking on Heaven's Door'', about the [[Space Race]] in the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], suggests that, in many people's eyes, Nikolai Fyodorov was the true father of the Soviet space project that put the first man in space.

Fedorov's thought is extensively though indirectly referenced in the well-regarded 2010 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Quantum Thief]]''; it is implied that the founders of the post-human collective of uploaded minds called the Sobornost were inspired by Fedorov and other thinkers associated with [[Russian Cosmism|cosmism]].

The 2013 novel ''Strange Bodies'' by [[Marcel Theroux]] imagines Fedorov's ideas of the Common Task being developed by Soviet and post-Soviet research to implant a mind into another body using an encoded lexicon from the original mind and an unspecified, but painful, Procedure.

'''Opo''' was a [[bottlenose dolphin]] who became famous throughout New Zealand during the summer of 1955/56 for playing with the children of the small town of [[Opononi]] on the [[Hokianga]] harbour.&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/death-of-opo-the-friendly-dolphin|title=Death of Opo the friendly dolphin - NZHistory, New Zealand history online|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opo was a wild dolphin that started following fishing boats around Opononi in early 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Opo | work = An Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966 | date = 1966 | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/opo/1 | accessdate = 8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after her mother had been killed, and would swim daily in the bay close to town. She was originally named "Opononi Jack", based on [[Pelorus Jack]], since she was presumed to be male. Unlike the majority of dolphins, she had no qualms about human company, and would perform stunts for locals, play with objects like beach balls and beer bottles, and allow children to swim alongside her and make contact.&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/&gt;

[[Māori people|Māori]] children were more reluctant to play with Opo, as cultural beliefs said the dolphin was a messenger from [[Kupe]].&lt;ref name="folksong.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksong.org.nz/opo/|title=NZ Folk Song  *  Opo the Dolphin|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dolphin became a local celebrity but news of her soon spread, and visitors from throughout the country would come to watch her. On 8 March 1956 official protection for Opo, requested by locals, was made law, but on 9 March she was found dead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hutching | first = Gerard | title = Opo at play | work = Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand    | date = 6 November 2009 | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/dolphins/5/5/1 | accessdate = 8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a rock crevice&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/&gt; at Koutu Point. There were suggestions that she had become stranded while fishing, or that she had been killed by fishermen [[Blast fishing|fishing with]] [[gelignite]].&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="folksong.org.nz"/&gt; Her death was reported nationwide, and she was buried with full Māori honours in a special plot next to the War Memorial Hall.&lt;ref name="folksong.org.nz"/&gt;

The song "Opo the Friendly Dolphin" was written by [[Crombie Murdoch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hutching | first = Gerard | title = Opo at play | work = Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand    | date = 6 November 2009 | url = http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/dolphins/5/4 | accessdate = 8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded by Pat McMinn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/pat-mcminn Audioculture - Pat McMinn]&lt;/ref&gt; (coincidentally on the same day Opo died) and was highly popular.&lt;ref name="folksong.org.nz"/&gt; A second song was written by [[Julie Collier]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="folksong.org.nz"/&gt;

Several documentary films have been made about Opo. [[Rudall Hayward]] made a film called ''The Amazing Dolphin of Opononi'', released in 1956 and shown in 26 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4h22/hayward-rudall-charles-victor |title=Rudall Hayward |publisher=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5792">In [[biology]], '''outbreeding depression''' is when progeny resulting from crosses between genetically distant individuals ([[outcrossing]]) exhibit lower [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the parental environment than either of their parents or than progeny from crosses between individuals that are more closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leimu | first1 = R. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = M. | editor1-last = Bruun | editor1-first = Hans Henrik | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012614 | title = Between-Population Outbreeding Affects Plant Defence | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12614 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20838662| pmc =2935481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is opposed to [[inbreeding depression]], although the two effects can occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics|last=Frankham, Ballou, &amp; Briscoe|first=R., J.D. &amp; D.A.|publisher=Cambridge|year=2002|isbn=0521702712|location=|pages=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outbreeding]] depression manifests most significantly in two ways:

* Intermediate genotypes are not adapted to either parental habitat. For example, selection in one population might favor a large body size, whereas in another population small body size might be more advantageous, while individuals with intermediate body sizes are comparatively disadvantaged in both populations. As another example, in the [[Tatra Mountains]], the introduction of [[ibex]] from the Middle East resulted in hybrids which produced calves at the coldest time of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turcek|first=FJ|date=1951|title=Effect of introductions on two game populations in Czechoslovakia.|url=|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=15 |pages=113–114|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breakdown of biochemical or physiological compatibility. Within isolated breeding populations, [[allele]]s are selected in the context of the local [[epistasis|genetic background]]. Because the same alleles may have rather different effects in different genetic backgrounds, there is the potential evolution of different locally [[coadaptation|adapted]] [[gene complex]]es. Outcrossing between individuals with differently adapted gene complexes can result in disruption of this selective advantage, resulting in a loss of fitness.

==Mechanism and impact==
The different mechanisms of outbreeding depression can operate at the same time. However, determining which mechanism is more important in a particular population is very difficult. Generally the first mechanism will be more prevalent in the first generation (F1) after the initial outcrossing when most individuals are made up of the intermediate [[phenotype]]. An extreme case of this type of outbreeding depression is the [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]] and other fitness-reducing effects often seen in [[interspecific]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s (such as [[mule]]s), which involves not only different [[allele]]s of the same gene but even different [[ortholog]]ous genes.

The second mechanism may not appear until two or more generations later (F2 or greater),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenster|first=Charles|date=2000|title=Inbreeding and Outbreeding Depression in Natural Populations of ''Chamaecrista fasciculata'' (Fabaceae)|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99234.x|pmid=|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1406–1412}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] has undermined vitality positive [[epistasis]]. [[Heterosis|Hybrid vigor]] in the first generation can, in some circumstances, be strong enough to mask the effects of outbreeding depression.  An example of this is that plant breeders will make [[F1 hybrid]]s from purebred strains, which will improve the uniformity and vigor of the offspring, however the F1 generation are not used for further breeding because of unpredictable phenotypes in their offspring. Unless there is strong selective pressure, outbreeding depression can increase in further generations as co-adapted gene complexes are broken apart without the forging of new co-adapted gene complexes to take their place.

If the outcrossing is limited and populations are large enough, selective pressure acting on each generation can restore fitness. Unless the F1 hybrid generation is sterile or very low fitness, selection will act in each generation using the increased diversity to adapt to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson and Fenster|first=|date=2006|title=Intraspecific hybridization and the recovery of fitness in the native legume ''Chamaecrista fasciculata''|jstor=4095211|journal=Evolution|doi=10.1554/05-020.1|pmid=16610315|volume=60|issue=2|pages=225–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to recovery in fitness to baseline, and sometimes even greater fitness than original parental types in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewontin &amp; Birch|first=R.C. &amp; L.C.|date=February 3, 1966|title=Hybridization as a source of variation for adaptation to new environments|url=|journal=Evolution|volume=20|issue=3|pages=315–336|doi=10.2307/2406633|pmid=28562982|jstor=2406633}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the hybrid population will likely to go through a decline in fitness for a few generations, they will need to persist long enough to allow selection to act before they can rebound &lt;ref&gt;Frankham, Ballou, &amp; Briscoe, R., J.D. &amp; D.A.

'''Pre-shipment inspection''', (also spelled preshipment inspecter) or PSI,its work is a part of [[supply chain management]] and an important [[quality control]] method for checking the quality of goods clients buy from suppliers.

PSI ensures that production complies with specifications of the buyer and/or the terms of a purchase order or letter of credit. A final random inspection (FRI), checks finished products when at least 80% of an order has been produced and export-packed. Samples are selected at random, according to standards and procedures.

Pre-shipment inspection can diminish risks inherent to [[Internet commerce]] like [[phishing]] and [[fraud]].

==Process==
The pre-shipment inspection can be agreed upon between a buyer, a supplier, and a bank, and it can be used to initiate payment for a letter of credit. A PSI can be performed at different stages before shipment, such as checking the total amount of goods and packing, controlling the quality or consistency of goods, checking of all documentation, as for example test reports, packaging list, or verification of compliance with standards of the destination country like ASME, CE mark and import duties.citation needed date January 2015

==Inspection companies==
There are two types of PSI companies:
*Free-market companies which are privately owned, selling their services to the market. Risks involved might be, especially if it is a smaller company, that the company is paid by the manufacturer and working in its interest.
*State owned inspection companies: Only very few companies operating on the market are state-owned or partly state-owned. The shareholding of governmental institutions guarantees independence and objectivity.
 
A higher form of the PSI is called [[expediting]], in which the dates of delivery and the production are included in the control.

==Termination on the Pre-shipment Inspection requirement==
PSI increases burdens and costs in international trade and can be counter-productive for the country of importation and its traders.

Several countries are considering termination on the use of inspection companies' service, following upon WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation
Article 10.5 Pre-shipment Inspection : 
5.1. Members shall not require the use of pre-shipment inspections in relation to tariff classification and customs valuation.

In 1988, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Recommendation No.18 - Recommended Measure 8.2 “Discouragement of Pre-Shipment Inspection”.

In humans, the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a [[gestational age]] of 37 complete weeks.&lt;ref name=Steer2005&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Steer P | title = The epidemiology of preterm labour | journal = [[British Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology]] | volume = 112 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 1–3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15715585 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00575.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on [[ventilator]]s. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Mom and Premature Baby at Kapiolani.jpg|thumb|right|A new mother holds her premature baby at [[Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women &amp; Children|Kapiolani Medical Center]] [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] in Honolulu, Hawaii]]
Preterm birth causes a range of problems.&lt;ref name="SaigalDoyle2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saigal S, Doyle LW | title = An overview of mortality and sequelae of preterm birth from infancy to adulthood | journal = The Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608 | pages = 261–269 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18207020 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60136-1 | issn = 0140-6736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm [[labor induction]] and spontaneous preterm [[Childbirth|labor]]. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labour]], true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.

A review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urquhart|first=Christine|last2=Currell|first2=Rosemary|last3=Harlow|first3=Francoise|last4=Callow|first4=Liz|date=15 Feb 2017|title=Home uterine monitoring for detecting preterm labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD006172|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006172.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28205207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Complications===

====Mortality and morbidity====
In the U.S. where many [[neonatal infection]]s and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathew TJ, MacDorman MF |year=2006 |title=Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2003 Period Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set |journal=[[National Vital Statistics Reports]] |volume=54 |issue=16 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.

The earliest [[gestational age]] at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the [[limit of viability]]. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, the limit of viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="Kaempf2006"&gt;

As risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives, there are [[medical ethics|ethical]] controversies over the aggressiveness of the care rendered to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the [[abortion]] debate.&lt;ref name="Arzuaga2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arzuaga BH, Lee BH | title = Limits of Human Viability in the United States: A Medicolegal Review | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = 1047–1052 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22065266 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific risks for the preterm neonate====
Preterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result, they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems.
*Neurological problems include [[apnea of prematurity]], hypoxic-ischemic [[encephalopathy]] (HIE), [[retinopathy of prematurity]] (ROP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Taylor and Hoyt's pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus|others=Lambert, Scott R.,, Lyons, Christopher J.|isbn=9780702066160|edition=Fifth|location=Edinburgh|oclc=960162637|last1 = Lambert|first1 = Scott R.|last2=Lyons|first2=Christopher J.|date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[developmental disability]], [[transient hyperammonemia of the newborn]], [[cerebral palsy]] and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], the latter affecting 25% of babies born preterm, usually before 32 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes&gt;[http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx March of Dimes --&gt; Neonatal Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024114718/http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx |date=24 October 2014 }} Retrieved on November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Mild brain bleeds usually leave no or few lasting complications, but severe bleeds often result in brain damage or even death.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes/&gt; Neurodevelopmental problems have been linked to lack of maternal [[thyroid hormone]]s, at a time when their own [[thyroid]] is unable to meet postnatal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berbel P, Navarro D, Ausó E, Varea E, Rodríguez AE, Ballesta JJ, Salinas M, Flores E, Faura CC, de Escobar GM | title = Role of late maternal thyroid hormones in cerebral cortex development: an experimental model for human prematurity | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1462–75 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 19812240 | pmc = 2871377 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhp212 | url = http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/6/1462 | journal=Cerebral Cortex}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiovascular complications may arise from the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth: [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA).
*Respiratory problems are common, specifically the [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] (RDS or IRDS) (previously called hyaline membrane disease). Another problem can be [[Bronchopulmonary dysplasia|chronic lung disease]] (previously called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).
*Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues can arise from [[neonatal hypoglycemia]], feeding difficulties, [[rickets]] of prematurity, [[hypocalcemia]], [[inguinal hernia]], and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).
*Hematologic complications include [[anemia of prematurity]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] (jaundice) that can lead to [[kernicterus]].
*Infection, including [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[urinary tract infection]] {{ref|1}}

== Risk factors ==
The exact cause of preterm birth is difficult to determine and it may be multi-factorial. The cause of 50% of preterm births is never determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhabra|first=S|date=September 2017|title=Preterm Births, Whys, Whats and Way Forward|url=https://www.ecronicon.com/ecpe/pdf/ECPE-05-00151.pdf|journal=Ecronicon|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labor is a complex process involving many factors. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension (placental abruption), decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11353/|title=Biological Pathways Leading to Preterm Birth|last=Behrman|first=Richard E.|last2=Butler|first2=Adrienne Stith|last3=Outcomes|first3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy|date=2007|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying women at high risk of giving birth early would enable the health services to provide specialized care for these women to delay the birth or make sure they are in the best place to give birth (for example a hospital with a special care baby unit). Risk scoring systems have been suggested as a possible way of identifying these women. However, there is no research in this area so it is unclear whether the risk scoring systems would prolong pregnancy and reduce the numbers of preterm births or not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davey|first1=MA|last2=Watson|first2=L|last3=Rayner|first3=JA|last4=Rowlands|first4=S|title=Risk-scoring systems for predicting preterm birth with the aim of reducing associated adverse outcomes|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=22 October 2015|volume=10|issue=10|pages=CD004902|pmid=26490698|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004902.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, in the U.S. and the UK, [[Black people|black]] women have preterm birth rates of 15–18%, more than double than that of the white population.

A history of spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) or surgical [[abortion]] has been associated with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth, with an increased risk with increased number of abortions, although it is unclear whether the increase is caused by the abortion or by confounding risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic status).&lt;ref name="rcog-care"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]| title = The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion| work = Evidence-based Clinical Guideline No. 7| pages = 44, 45| date = November 2011| accessdate = May 31, 2013| url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/Abortion%20guideline_web_1.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529004416/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/Abortion%20guideline_web_1.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2012-05-29| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased risk has not been shown in women who terminated their pregnancies [[medical abortion|medically]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Factors during pregnancy===
The use of [[fertility medication]] that stimulates the ovary to release multiple eggs and of IVF with [[embryo transfer]] of multiple embryos has been implicated as an important factor in preterm birth.

Infectious microorganisms can be ascending, hematogeneous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the Fallopian tubes.

It has been reported that asymptomatic [[colonization]] of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a [[DNA probe]] suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response.

As the condition is more prevalent in black women in the US and the UK, it has been suggested to be an explanation for the higher rate of preterm birth in these populations. It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. The condition known as [[aerobic vaginitis]] can be a serious risk factor for preterm labor; several previous studies failed to acknowledge the difference between aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis, which may explain some of the contradiction in the results.&lt;ref&gt;Donders, G; Bellen, G; Rezeberga, D (2011).

A review into prophylactic antibiotics (given to prevent infection) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (13–42 weeks of pregnancy) found a reduction in the number of preterm births in women with bacterial vaginosis. These antibiotics also reduced the number of waters breaking before labor in full-term pregnancies, reduced the risk of infection of the lining of the womb after delivery (endometritis), and rates of gonococcal infection. However, the women without bacterial vaginosis did not have any reduction in preterm births or pre-labor preterm waters breaking. Much of the research included in this review lost participants during follow-up so did not report the long-term effects of the antibiotics on mothers or babies. More research in this area is needed to find the full effects of giving antibiotics throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thinkhamrop|first1=J|last2=Hofmeyr|first2=GJ|last3=Adetoro|first3=O|last4=Lumbiganon|first4=P|last5=Ota|first5=E|title=Antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes and morbidity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=20 June 2015|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD002250|pmid=26092137|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002250.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review into giving antibiotics in pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine infection with no symptoms) found the research was of very low quality but that it did suggest that taking antibiotics reduced the numbers of preterm births and babies with low birth weight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smaill|first1=FM|last2=Vazquez|first2=JC|title=Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 August 2015|volume=8|issue=8|pages=CD000490|pmid=26252501|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000490.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review found that one dose of antibiotics did not seem as effective as a course of antibiotics but fewer women reported side effects from one dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widmer|first1=M|last2=Lopez|first2=I|last3=Gülmezoglu|first3=AM|last4=Mignini|first4=L|last5=Roganti|first5=A|title=Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=11 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD000491|pmid=26560337|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000491.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review recommended that more research is needed to discover the best way of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A different review found that preterm births happened less for pregnant women who had routine testing for low genital tract infections than for women who only had testing when they showed symptoms of low genital tract infections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sangkomkamhang|first1=US|last2=Lumbiganon|first2=P|last3=Prasertcharoensuk|first3=W|last4=Laopaiboon|first4=M|title=Antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for preventing preterm delivery|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=1 February 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD006178|pmid=25922860|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006178.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women being routinely tested also gave birth to fewer babies with a low birth weight. Even though these results look promising, the review was only based on one study so more research is needed into routine screening for low genital tract infections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Also [[periodontal disease]] has been shown repeatedly to be linked to preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Placental alpha microglobulin-1===

Specifically, the PPV, or [[positive predictive value]], of the tests were 76%, 29%, and 30% for PAMG-1, fFN and CL, respectively (P &lt; 0.01).&lt;ref&gt;Nikolova T, Bayev O, Nikolova N, Di Renzo GC.

===Fetal fibronectin===
[[Fetal fibronectin]] (fFN) has become an important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt; It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ultrasound===
{{Further|Cervical incompetence}}
[[Obstetric ultrasound]] has become useful in the assessment of the [[cervix]] in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: A cervical length of less than 25&amp;nbsp;mm at or before 24 weeks of [[gestational age]] is the most common definition of [[cervical incompetence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiopaedia.org/articles/cervical_incompetence Cervical incompetence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307205141/http://radiopaedia.org/articles/cervical_incompetence |date=7 March 2014 }} from [[Radiopaedia]].

==Prevention==
Historically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children.&lt;ref name=Iams2008&gt;

===Before pregnancy===
Adoption of specific professional policies can immediately reduce risk of preterm birth as the experience in assisted reproduction has shown when the number of embryos during embryo transfer was limited.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt;
Many countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous or night-shift work and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave. The EUROPOP study showed that preterm birth is not related to type of employment, but to prolonged work (over 42 hours per week) or prolonged standing (over 6 hours per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saurel-Cubizolles MJ, Zeitlin J, Lelong N, Papiernik E, Di Renzo GC, Bréart G | title = Employment, working conditions, and preterm birth: results from the Europop case-control survey | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 395–401 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15082738 | pmc = 1732750 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2003.008029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, night work has been linked to preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;Other Complications include:
* Jaundice Of Prematurity
* Atrial septal defects commonly seen in babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia because their lungs are so fragile.
* GER Gastroesophageal reflux
* Patent Ductus Arterosis
* Seizures
* Immature GI system so feeding from an (NG) tube or nasogastric tube may help make feeding easier on the babies' tummy. Also theirs{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} TPN feeding or Total Parenteral Nutrition is made up of lipids, calories, good fats calcium, magnesium sulfate and other vitamins including B and C. Neonatalogists work with the family as a whole instead of just the neonate or baby whose systems are to immature to actually swallow food so babies between 23-28 weeks are fed through a neonatal gastric tube from the babies nose to the stomach. In some neonates, there are disabilities from varying conditions of the baby this depends on the gestational age the babies delivered a.uUsually, women with severe enough preeclampsia will deliver earlier than normal and those mothers worry greatly because of all of their rumors about NICUs and babies needing wheelchairs glasses and also needing medicines for seizures and ADD/ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, [[anxiety disorder]]s.

Healthy eating can be instituted at any stage of the pregnancy including nutritional adjustments, use of vitamin supplements, and [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Calcium supplementation in women who have low dietary calcium reduces the number of negative outcomes including preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and maternal death.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr2014&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmeyr|first=G.

====Screening of low risk women====

Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria followed by appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Romero R, Oyarzun E, Mazor M, Sirtori M, Hobbins JC, Bracken M | title = Meta-analysis of the relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and preterm delivery/low birth weight | journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology]] | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 576–582 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2927852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but [[cerclage]] is not proven useful, and the application of a progestogen is under study.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk.

====Self-care====

Self-care methods to reduce the risk of preterm birth include proper nutrition, avoiding stress, seeking appropriate medical care, avoiding infections, and the control of preterm birth risk factors (e.g. working long hours while standing on feet, carbon monoxide exposure, domestic abuse, and other factors). Self-monitoring vaginal pH followed by yogurt treatment or clindamycin treatment if the pH was too high all seem to be effective at reducing the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Reducing existing risks===
Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a [[uterine septum]]), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others.

====Multiple pregnancies====
In [[multiple pregnancy|multiple pregnancies]], which often result from use of [[assisted reproductive technology]], there is a high risk of preterm birth.

====Reducing indicated preterm birth====

[[Progestogen]]s, often given in the form of [[progesterone (medication)|progesterone]] or [[hydroxyprogesterone caproate]], relaxes the uterine musculature, maintains cervical length, and has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus exerts activities expected to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40–55%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|issue=7|pages=CD004947|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004947.pub3|pmid=23903965|vauthors=Dodd JM, Jones L, Flenady V, Cincotta R, Crowther CA|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=====Cervical cerclage=====

In preparation for [[childbirth]], the woman's [[cervix]] shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. [[Cervical cerclage]] is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth.&lt;ref name=Iams2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the [[Fetal fibronectin|fibronectin test]] and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Steroids===
Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs because they are not yet producing their own [[surfactant]]. This can lead directly to [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of [[glucocorticoids]], a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the baby.&lt;ref name=ACOG2016/&gt; Steroid use up to 37 weeks is also recommended by the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2016/&gt; Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]], often when the pregnancy has reached [[Fetal viability|viability]] at 23 weeks.

In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second "rescue" course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There are still some concerns about the efficacy and side effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. A 2015 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowther|first=Caroline A.|last2=McKinlay|first2=Christopher J.

Beside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular bleeding, [[necrotising enterocolitis]], and [[patent ductus arteriosus]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Devender|last2=Brown|first2=Julie|last3=Medley|first3=Nancy|last4=Dalziel|first4=Stuart R.|date=21 Mar 2017|title=Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|pages=CD004454|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004454.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28321847}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery, but there are some concerns about applicability of this recommendation to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownfoot|first=Fiona C.|last2=Gagliardi|first2=Daniela I.|last3=Bain|first3=Emily|last4=Middleton|first4=Philippa|last5=Crowther|first5=Caroline A.|date=2013-08-29|title=Different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD006764|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006764.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23990333|pmc=4164475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants. There is ongoing discussion about when steroids should be given (i.e. only antenatally or postnatally too) and for how long (i.e. single course or repeated administration). Despite these unknowns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single course of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994AntenatalSteroidPerinatal095html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: The Effect of Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturation on Perinatal Outcomes |accessdate=2017-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174327/https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994antenatalsteroidperinatal095html.htm |archivedate=9 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: Antenatal Corticosteroids Revisited: Repeat Courses |accessdate=2017-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118011125/https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |archivedate=18 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McGoldrick|first1=Emma|last2=Brown|first2=Julie|last3=Middleton|first3=Philippa|last4=McKinlay|first4=Christopher JD|last5=Haas|first5=David M|last6=Crowther|first6=Caroline A|title=Antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation: an overview of Cochrane reviews|date=17 April 2016|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd012156|df=dmy-all|hdl=1805/11459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
The routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby to get infected with [[Streptococcus agalactiae|group B streptococcus]] and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schrag S, Gorwitz R, Fultz-Butts K, Schuchat A | title = Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Revised guidelines from CDC | journal = [[MMWR. Recommendations and Reports]] | volume = 51 | issue = RR-11 | pages = 1–22 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12211284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When membranes rupture prematurely, obstetrical management looks for development of labor and signs of infection. Prophylactic antibiotic administration has been shown to prolong pregnancy and reduced neonatal morbidity with rupture of membranes at less than 34 weeks.&lt;ref name="Kenyon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Broad-spectrum antibiotics for preterm, prelabour rupture of fetal membranes: the ORACLE I randomised trial.

===Tocolysis===
A number of medications may be useful to delay delivery including: [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[calcium channel blocker]]s, [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta mimetics]], and [[atosiban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haas DM, Caldwell DM, Kirkpatrick P, McIntosh JJ, Welton NJ | title = Tocolytic therapy for preterm delivery: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 345 | pages = e6226 | date = Oct 9, 2012 | pmid = 23048010 | pmc = 4688428 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e6226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tocolytic|Tocolysis]] rarely delays delivery beyond 24–48 hours.&lt;ref name=Simham2007&gt;

=== Mode of delivery ===
The routine use of [[caesarean section]] for early delivery of infants expected to have very low [[birth weight]] is controversial,&lt;ref name="Iams2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alfirevic|first=Zarko|last2=Milan|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Livio|first3=Stefania|date=2012-06-13|title=Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth in singletons|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD000078|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000078.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164504|pmid=22696314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery probably needs to be made on a case by case basis.

===Neonatal care===
After delivery, plastic wraps or warm mattresses are useful to keep the infant warm on their way to the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCall EM, Alderdice F, Halliday HL, Jenkins JG, Vohra S | title = Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birthweight infants. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD004210 | date = Mar 17, 2010 | pmid = 20238329 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004210.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29431872|date = July 2018}} In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in an NICU. The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as [[neonatology|neonatologists]]. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in [[neonatal incubator|incubator]]s (also called isolettes), which are [[bassinet]]s enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]], and [[Electroencephalography|brain activity]]. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] catheters, [[oxygen]] supplementation, [[mechanical ventilation]] support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as ''[[kangaroo care]]'' (skin to skin warming), encouraging [[breastfeeding]], and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm [[morbidity]] and mortality. [[Bili light]]s may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).

Water can be carefully provided to prevent dehydration but no so much to increase risks of side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell EF, Acarregui MJ | title = Restricted versus liberal water intake for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD000503 | date = 4 December 2014 | pmid = 25473815 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000503.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preterm birth complicates the births of infants worldwide affecting 5% to 18% of births.&lt;ref name= rob2015/&gt; In Europe and many developed countries the preterm birth rate is generally 5–9%, and in the USA it has even risen to 12–13% in the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delnord|first=Marie|last2=Blondel|first2=Béatrice|last3=Zeitlin|first3=Jennifer|date=April 2015|title=What contributes to disparities in the preterm birth rate in European countries?|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=133–142|doi=10.1097/GCO.0000000000000156|issn=1040-872X|pmc=4352070|pmid=25692506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As weight is easier to determine than gestational age, the [[World Health Organization]] tracks rates of low [[birth weight]] (&lt; 2,500&amp;nbsp;grams), which occurred in 16.5 percent of births in less developed regions in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Data and statistics |url=http://www.who.int/research/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216204220/http://www.who.int/research/en/ |archivedate=16 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that one third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to preterm delivery. Weight generally correlates to gestational age, however, infants may be underweight for other reasons than a preterm delivery. Neonates of low birth weight (LBW) have a birth weight of less than 2500 g (5&amp;nbsp;lb 8 oz) and are mostly but not exclusively preterm babies as they also include ''[[small for gestational age]]'' (SGA) babies. Weight-based classification further recognizes ''Very Low Birth Weight'' (VLBW) which is less than 1,500 g, and ''Extremely Low Birth Weight'' (ELBW) which is less than 1,000 g.&lt;ref name="SubramanianKNS"&gt;

Complications from preterm births resulted in 740,000 deaths in 2013, down from 1.57 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
Preterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the US determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500–700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ethics==

The transformation of medical care means that extremely premature and very ill babies have better chances of survival than ever before. But it is difficult to predict which babies will die and which will live, though possibly with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable.

The most difficult decisions are about whether or not to resuscitate a premature baby and admit him or her to neonatal intensive care, or whether to withdraw intensive care and give the child [[palliative care]].

This is discussed at great length in a report "Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine: ethical issues"&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10703">A '''quality circle''' or '''quality control circle''' is a group of [[worker]]s who do the same or similar work, who meet regularly to identify, analyze and solve work-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/quality-circles.html Inc Encyclopedia - "Quality Circles"]. accessed 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally small in size, the group is usually led by a supervisor or manager and presents its solutions to [[management]]; where possible, workers implement the solutions themselves in order to improve the performance of the organization and motivate employees.  Quality circles were at their most popular during the 1980s, but continue to exist in the form of [[Kaizen]] groups and similar worker participation schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/1985/01/quality-circles-after-the-fad/ar/1 Edward E. Lawler III and Susan A. Mohrman, "Quality Circles After the Fad", ''Harvard Business Review'', January 1985]. Accessed 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical topics for the attention of quality circles are improving [[occupational safety and health]], improving [[product design]], and improvement in the workplace and [[Manufacturing process management|manufacturing processes]]. The term ''quality circles'' was most accessibly defined by Professor Kaoru Ishikawa in his 1988 handbook, "What is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way"&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa, K., "What is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way", Prentice Hall, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and circulated throughout Japanese industry by the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] in 1960. The first company in Japan to introduce Quality Circles was the Nippon Wireless and Telegraph Company in 1962. By the end of that year there were 36 companies registered with JUSE by 1978 the movement had grown to an estimated 1 million Circles involving some 10 million Japanese workers. Contrary to some people's opinion this movement had nothing whatever to do with [[W. Edwards Deming|Dr. W. Edwards Deming]] or indeed Dr Juran and both were skeptical as to whether it could be made to work in the USA or the West generally.

Quality circles are typically more formal groups. They meet regularly on company time and are trained by competent persons (usually designated as facilitators) who may be personnel and industrial relations specialists trained in human factors and the basic skills of problem identification, information gathering and analysis, basic statistics, and solution generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management |edition=4th |last=Montana |first=Patrick J. |author2=Bruce H. Charnov  |year=2008 |publisher=Barron's |isbn=978-0-7641-3931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality circles are generally free to select any topic they wish (other than those related to salary and terms and conditions of work, as there are other channels through which these issues are usually considered).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quality Circles Handbook |last=Hutchins |first=David C. |year=1985 |publisher=Pitman Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-89397-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hoshin Kanri : the strategic approach to continuous improvement |last=Hutchins |first=David C. |date=September 2008 |publisher=Gower |location=Burlington, Vermont |isbn=978-0-566-08740-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality circles have the advantage of continuity; the circle remains intact from project to project. (For a comparison to Quality Improvement Teams, see Juran's ''[[Quality by Design]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Juran on quality by design : the new steps for planning quality into goods and services |last=Juran |first=Joseph M. |authorlink=Joseph M. Juran |year=1992 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-916683-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== History ==
Quality circles were originally described by [[W. Edwards Deming]] in the 1950s, Deming praised [[Toyota]] as an example of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nayak |first1=P. Ranganath |author2=John Ketteringham |date=1994 |title=Breakthroughs!

The Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) coordinated the movement in Japan. The first circles started at the Nippon Wireless and Telegraph Company; the idea then spread to more than 35 other companies in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Just In Time |last= Hutchins |first= David C. |year= 1999 |publisher= Gower Publishing |location= Farnham, Surrey |isbn= 978-0-566-07798-2 |page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 it was claimed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} that there were more than one million quality circles involving some 10 million Japanese workers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} {{As of | 2015}} they operate in most East Asian countries; it was recently{{when|date=July 2015}} claimed{{by whom|date=July 2015}} that there were more than 20 million quality circles in China.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Quality circles have been implemented even in educational sectors in India, and QCFI (Quality Circle Forum of India) is promoting such activities. However this was not successful in the United States, as the idea was not properly understood and implementation turned into a fault-finding exercise – although some circles do still exist. Don Dewar together with Wayne Ryker and Jeff Beardsley established quality circles in 1972 at the [[Lockheed Missiles and Space Company|Lockheed Space Missile]] factory in California.

==Empirical studies==

In a structures-fabrication and assembly plant in the south-eastern US, some quality circles (QCs) were established by the management (management-initiated); whereas others were formed based on requests of employees (self-initiated). Based on 47 QCs over a three-year period, research showed that management-initiated QCs have fewer members, solve more work-related QC problems, and solve their problems much faster than self-initiated QCS. However, the effect of QC initiation (management- vs. self-initiated) on problem-solving performance disappears after controlling QC size. A high attendance of QC meetings is related to lower number of projects completed and slow speed of performance in management-initiated QCS&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T. L. P., Tollison, P. S., &amp; Whiteside, H. D. 1987. The effect of quality circle initiation on motivation to attend quality circle meetings and on task performance. '''Personnel Psychology''', 40: 799-814.&lt;/ref&gt; QCs with high upper-management support (high attendance of QC meetings) solve significantly more problems than those without.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T.

A significant drop in QC membership is a precursor of QC failure. The sudden decline in QC membership represents the final and irreversible stage of the QC's demise.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T. L.

There are [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality|seven basic quality improvement tools]] that circles use:

*[[Ishikawa diagram|Cause-and-effect diagram]]s (sometimes called Ishikawa or "fishbone" diagrams)
*[[Pareto chart]]s
*Process mapping, data gathering tools such as [[check sheet]]s
*Graphical tools such as [[histogram]]s, frequency diagrams, spot charts and pie charts
*[[Run chart]]s and [[control chart]]s
*[[Scatter plot]]s and correlation analysis 
*[[Flowchart]]s

== Student quality circles ==
Student quality circles work on the original philosophy of [[total quality management]].&lt;ref&gt;Terra Stern, [http://www.pmhut.com/change-management-adopting-a-continuous-improvement-program Change Management - Adopting A Continuous Improvement Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of SQCs was presented by [[City Montessori School]] (CMS) Lucknow India at a conference in Hong Kong in October 1994. It was developed and mentored by two engineers of Indian Railways PC, Bihari and Swami Das, in association with Principal Dr. Kamran of CMS Lucknow India. They were inspired and facilitated by Jagdish Gandhi, who founded CMS after his visit to Japan, where he learned about [[Kaizen]]. The world's first SQC was made in CMS Lucknow with then-13-year-old student Sucheta Bihari as its leader. CMS has continued to conduct international conventions on student quality circles every two years. After seeing its utility, educators from many countries started such circles. The World Council for Total Quality &amp; Excellence in Education was established in 1999 with its Corporate Office in Lucknow and head office in Singapore. It monitors and facilitates student quality circle activities in its member countries, which number more than a dozen. SQC's are considered to be a co-curricular activity. They have been established in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Mauritius, Iran, UK (Kingston University and started in University of Leicester), and USA. In Nepal, Prof. Dinesh P. Chapagain has been promoting the approach through QUEST-Nepal since 1999. He has written a book entitled ''A Guide Book on Students' Quality Circle: An Approach to prepare Total Quality People'', which is considered a standard guide to promote SQC's in academia for students' personality development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

"On Saturday night last dyed Major-General Elliott, late Governor to Gibraltar".&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of the earliest British [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governors of Gibraltar]]. A member of the [[Eliot family (South England)|Eliot family]], his nephew [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Eliott]] also became a noted Governor and [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|defender of Gibraltar]] while his son [[Granville Elliott]] became the first [[Count Elliott]].

==Early life==

Roger Elliott was born, possibly in [[London]] but more probably in the [[English Tangier|English Colony of Tangier]] in [[Morocco]], to [[George Elliott (surgeon)|George Elliott]] ({{circa}} 1636 - 1668, the [[Physician|Chirurgeon]] to the [[Tangier Garrison]]) and his wife Catherine (née Maxwell, {{circa}} 1638 – 1709). George Elliott was the illegitimate son of [[Richard Eliot]], the wayward second son of [[John Eliot (statesman)|Sir John Eliot]] (1592–1632).

Roger Elliott's father, George Elliott, died at Tangier in 1668, and his widowed mother remarried there on 22 February 1670 to Robert Spotswood (17 September 1637 – 1680), the assistant and replacement Chirurgeon at the Garrison, and thirdly the Rev. Dr George Mercer, the Garrison schoolmaster. Roger Elliott was therefore an older half-brother of [[Alexander Spotswood]] ({{circa}} 1676 – 6 June 1740), who became a noted [[List of Governors of Virginia|Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia]].

==Military career==
By 1680, Roger was an Ensign in the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Tangier Regiment of Foot]], and was wounded on 27 October fighting the local Moors. In 1681, he was suspended by Colonel [[Percy Kirke]] &lt;ref&gt;Percy Kirke was Roger Elliott's first cousin once removed, with common ancestor Robert Killigrew (1580-1633)&lt;/ref&gt; for duelling with Ensign Bartholomew Pitts, later being cashiered for this offence. He was sent back to England in 1682 with a letter begging for his readmission into His Majesty's Service, and he was reinstated as an Ensign in his old Company on 8 March 1683. In 1684 he returned to England and probably fought against the [[Monmouth Rebellion]].

By 1685, he had transferred to the [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Queen Dowager's Regiment of Foot]], and, in 1687, he became a first lieutenant in the [[10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot|Earl of Bath's Regiment]] - created by Sir [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath]] (1628–1701). He was promoted to captain on 1 May 1690. He fought and was wounded at the [[Battle of Steenkerque]] on 3 August 1692. On 21 December of that year, he was promoted to major in the same Regiment, and, on 1 January 1696, promoted to lieutenant-colonel of Sir [[Bevil Granville|Bevil Granville's]] [[Royal Lincolnshire Regiment|Regiment of Foot]]. In 1702, on campaign with the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], he was shot through the body at the defence of [[Tongeren]] in [[Belgium]]. He reputedly took on the entire French Army with only two regiments, before surrendering.

On 5 March 1704, he raised his own regiment – [[61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot|Colonel Elliott's Regiment of Foot]]. Officers were commissioned on 10 April that year at St James'. On 2 July 1704, again on campaign with the Duke of Marlborough, he fought and was wounded at the [[Battle of Schellenberg]]. It is possible that he fought at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] on 13 August 1704. However, he certainly did not lead the cavalry at this battle, as has been maintained by other biographies – this was led by General Sir [[John Cutts, 1st Baron Cutts|John 'Salamander' Cutts]].

==Gibraltar==
In March 1705, Colonel Elliott's Regiment of Foot embarked for Spain and served at [[Gibraltar]], which was declared a free port in 1706. On 1 January 1707, he was promoted to [[Brigadier-General]], and later that year to [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;PRO PC 1/2/51 Admiralty memorial concerning the rival claims to a prize ship of the Lieutenant Governor of Gibraltar (memorial dated 5 February 1707: the captured prize ship, Nostra Seigniora del Rosario, master: Francis Pujal, was disputed by Roger Elliott and the Captain and crew of HMS Carcass. The decision was to split the prize, with 1/8 going to Roger Elliott and 7/8 going to the crew)&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December, he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar. His time in office is remembered in the Gibraltar records as one of mercenary opportunity; whereas, in the London records, it appears that he proceeded with expensive but vital defensive fortification with only minimal prior financial approval. The arguments over the accounts for these defences subsequently caused problems for the probate of his personal estate. On 1 January 1710, he was promoted to [[Major-General]], and on 24 January 1711, he handed over the Governorship to Brigadier-General [[Thomas Stanwix]]. He finally departed Gibraltar on 18 June 1711.

==Return to England==
Having returned to England, he married, settled, leased Byfeld House in Church Road, [[Municipal Borough of Barnes|Barnes]], [[Surrey]] and had a small family. However, he never fully recovered from his wounds and died relatively early.

==Family==

On 4 March 1712 at [[St Peter upon Cornhill|St Peter's Church, Cornhill]], Roger married '''Charlotte Elliot''' ({{circa}}1692 - {{circa}}1753), the daughter of '''William 'the Laceman' Elliot''' of Brugh and Wells, a rich London merchant. They had two children:
#'''[[Granville Elliott]]''' (7 October 1713 – 10 October 1759), 1st [[Count Elliott]], who married firstly [[Jeanne Thérèse du Han]] and secondly to Elizabeth Duckett.
#'''Catherine (Kitty) Elliott''' (18 September 1714 – 15 January 1757), who married firstly {{circa}} 1735 to Charles Boyle (of Araglin Bridge, co Cork, related to the [[Earls of Cork]] and [[Orrery]]), and secondly, in 1742, to the Very Rev Robert Bligh, the [[Dean of Elphin]] and a younger brother of the [[Earls of Darnley|1st Earl of Darnley]].

'''Mary Elliott''', who married '''Garrett Fitzmaurice''' (died May 1738) in Ireland, claimed to be a natural daughter of Roger Elliott.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Irish Family Records&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Elliott never fully recovered from his various wounds and died at Byfeld on 16 May 1714. He was buried 21 May in the cemetery of [[St Mary the Virgin, Barnes]].

His will was probated on 16 November 1714 but his estate took years to resolve because of the difficulties mentioned. The eventual resolution was mostly thanks to the involvement of his father-in-law, William 'the Laceman' Elliot, who sought to expedite his daughter's remarriage to Captain Thomas Burroughs.&lt;ref&gt;PROB 10/1515 CC 2646 - Probate of Will&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PRO C104/251 Chancery: Master Tinney's Exhibits&lt;/ref&gt;

have made contributions to the theory of self-transcendence.

Self-transcendence is distinctive as the first trait concept of a  spiritual nature to be incorporated into a major theory of personality.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; 
Self-transcendence is one of the  "character" dimensions of personality assessed in [[Cloninger]]'s [[Temperament and Character Inventory]].&lt;ref name=Cloninger/&gt; 
It is also assessed by the Self-Transcendence Scale&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Pamela G. (1991). Self-transcendence and mental health in oldest-old adults. ''Nursing Research'', 40(1), 5–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Adult Self-Transcendence Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, Michael R., et al. Self-transcendence: Conceptualization and measurement. The International Journal of Aging and Human Development 60.2 (2005): 127-143. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the trait ==
Several overlapping definitions of self-transcendence have been given. Viktor Frankl wrote, "The essentially self-transcendent quality of human existence renders man ''a being reaching out beyond himself''."&lt;ref&gt;Frankl, Viktor E. ''The will to meaning: Foundations and applications of logotherapy''. Penguin, 2014 (orig. published 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reed, self-transcendence is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the capacity to expand self-boundaries ''intrapersonally'' (toward greater awareness of one’s philosophy, values, and dreams), ''interpersonally'' (to relate to others and one’s environment), ''temporally'' (to integrate one’s past and future in a way that has meaning for the present), and ''transpersonally'' (to connect with dimensions beyond the typically discernible world).&lt;ref&gt;Reed, P. G. (2003). The theory of self-transcendence. In M. J. Smith &amp; P. Liehr (Eds.), ''Middle range theories in nursing'' (pp. 145–165). New York, NY:Springer; p. 147)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taking a developmental perspective concerning aging and transcendence, Tornstam defined the concept of gerotranscendence as "a shift in metaperspective, from a midlife materialistic and rational vision to a more cosmic and transcendent one, accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Tornstam, L. (1996). Gerotranscendence: A theory about maturing into old age. ''Journal of Aging and Identity'', 1, 37–50; p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cloninger's seven-dimensional model of personality, there are four ''temperament'' dimensions that have a strong biological basis, and three learned ''character'' dimensions that are believed to be concept-based. Self-transcendence is a character trait considered to relate to the experience of spiritual aspects of the self.&lt;ref name=Cloninger/&gt; The concept was influenced by theories of personality development in [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Self-transcendence refers to an identification of the self with the universe conceived as a unitive whole. According to Cloninger, this "may be described as acceptance, identification, or spiritual union with nature and its source."&lt;ref name=Cloninger/&gt;

== Components ==

Self-transcendence as assessed in the Temperament and Character Inventory originally had three subscales,&lt;ref name=Cloninger/&gt; but two more were later added:&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=D.A.|author2=Holland, D. |title=Examination of the psychometric properties of the temperament and character inventory self-transcendence dimension|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|volume=32|pages=1013–1027|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00107-6|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Self-forgetful vs. self-conscious experience
# Transpersonal identification vs. self-isolation
# Spiritual acceptance vs. rational materialism
# Enlightened vs. objective
# Idealistic vs. practical

An independent study found that the five subscales proposed by Cloninger were difficult to replicate using [[factor analysis]] and suggested that the self-transcendence scale of the Temperament and Character Inventory is better represented by four sub-dimensions:&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;

# Spiritual and [[religious]] beliefs (e.g., belief in the existence of a higher power)
# Unifying interconnectedness (i.e., an experienced sense of connection with other living beings, the environment, and a higher power)
# Belief in the [[supernatural]] (e.g., belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena, such as [[extrasensory perception]])
# Dissolution of self in experience (e.g., [[absorption (psychology)|absorption]], or a loss of sense of separate self while immersed in experience)

The Adult Self-Transcendence Inventory has five subscales:&lt;ref&gt;Koller I., Levenson, M. R. , &amp; Glueck, J. (2017).

# Self-knowledge and self-integration
# Peace of mind
# Non-attachment
# Self-transcendence
# Presence in the here-and-now and growth

== Relationship to other personality traits ==
Coward (1996) found positive correlations between self-transcendence, hope, purpose in life, and cognitive and emotional well-being in a study of healthy adults ages 19 to 85&lt;ref&gt;Coward, Doris D. (1996). Self-transcendence and correlates in a healthy population. ''Nursing research'' 45.2,116−121.&lt;/ref&gt;. Negative correlation has been found between self-transcendence as measured by Reed's Self-Transcendence Scale and depression in both middle-aged and older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Romeu, Albert. 
[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Albert_Garcia-Romeu/publication/271706485_Self-transcendence_as_a_measurable_transpersonal_construct/links/5501b17d0cf2d60c0e5fdfeb.pdf Self-transcendence as a measurable transpersonal construct]. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' 42.1 (2010): 26− 47; p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has not been a great deal of research into the validity of self-transcendence as a measure of spirituality, one study found that self-transcendence was significantly related to a number of areas of belief and experience that have been traditionally considered "spiritual".&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;

A study relating the Temperament and Character Inventory to the [[Five factor model]] personality traits found that self-transcendence was most strongly related to [[openness to experience]] and to a lesser extent [[extraversion]].&lt;ref name=defruyt/&gt; Self-transcendence is largely unrelated to traits in Zuckerman's "[[Alternative five]]" model and [[Hans J. Eysenck|Eysenck's]] model which do not include an equivalent to openness to experience. Self-transcendence is strongly related to [[absorption (psychology)|absorption]].&lt;ref name="laidlaw" /&gt;

== Relationship to psychopathology ==

Cloninger found that psychiatric patients tend to be lower in self-transcendence compared with adults in the general population.&lt;ref name=Cloninger/&gt;  Low self-transcendence was found to be particularly evident in patients with many symptoms of [[schizoid personality disorder]] but is otherwise not a common feature of people with personality disorders. This is in contrast to the traits of [[cooperativeness]] and [[self-directedness]] which have been found to be low in personality disorder profiles generally. Cloninger suggested that self-transcendence levels may help differentiate between people with schizoid and those with [[schizotypal personality disorder]] as the latter is more strongly associated with psychotic thinking.

=== Psychosis proneness and psychotic symptoms ===
High self-transcendence has been linked to psychotic tendencies, such as schizotypy and mania, particularly in individuals low in both [[self-directedness]] and [[cooperativeness]]. 

Cloninger proposed that self-transcendence leads to "mature creativity and spirituality" when coupled with high self-directedness.&lt;ref name=loftus/&gt; However, self-transcendence may be associated with psychotic tendencies when associated with underdeveloped character traits.&lt;ref name=schizotypy/&gt; Self-transcendence in itself is moderately related to [[schizotypy]], particularly the cognitive-perceptual component associated with magical thinking and unusual perceptions. A research study found that the specific combination of high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness was especially associated with a high risk of overall schizotypy.&lt;ref name=schizotypy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danelluzo|first=E. |author2=Stratta, P. |author3=Rossi, A.|title=The contribution of temperament and character to schizotypy multidimensionality|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|date=Jan–Feb 2005|volume=46|issue=1|pages=50–5|pmid=15714195|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2004.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that people with schizophrenia also had a combination of high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness compared to non-psychotic siblings and a community control group.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Matthew J. |author2=Cloninger, C.R. |author3=Harms, M.P. |author4=Csernansky, J.G.|title=Temperament and character as schizophrenia-related endophenotypes in non-psychotic siblings|journal=Schizophrenia Research|date=September 2008|volume=104|issue=1–3|pages=198–205|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2008.06.025|pmid=18718739|pmc=2565802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloninger has referred to the specific combination of high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness as a "schizotypal personality style".&lt;ref name="laidlaw"/&gt; Low cooperativeness and self-directedness combined with high self-transcendence may result in openness to odd or unusual ideas and behaviours associated with distorted perceptions of reality.&lt;ref name=laidlaw&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.01.025|title=Low self-directedness (TCI), mood, schizotypy and hypnotic susceptibility|year=2005|last1=Laidlaw|first1=Tannis M.|last2=Dwivedi|first2=Prabudha|last3=Naito|first3=Akira|last4=Gruzelier|first4=John H.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=39|issue=2|pages=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, high levels of cooperativeness and self-directedness may protect against the schizotypal tendencies associated with high self-transcendence.&lt;ref name=siblings/&gt;

People with [[bipolar disorder]] have been found to score higher in self-transcendence and harm avoidance, and lower in self-directedness compared to a community control group.&lt;ref name=loftus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=S.T. |author2=Garno, J.L. |author3=Jaeger, L. |author4=Malhotra, A.K.|title=Temperament and character dimensions in bipolar I disorder: a comparison to healthy controls|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|year=2008|volume=42|issue=13|pages=1131–6|pmid=18191148|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of self-transcendence in particular were found to be associated with severity of psychotic symptoms in people with bipolar disorder. This accords with previous research findings linking self-transcendence to [[delusions]] and [[mania]]. Higher  self-transcendence in people with bipolar may reflect residual symptoms of the disorder rather than transpersonal or spiritual consciousness.

MacDonald and Holland argued that two of the four sub-dimensions of self-transcendence identified in their study, belief in the supernatural and dissolution of the self in experience, probably account for the relationship between self-transcendence and psychopathology found by researchers.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; Previous research has found linkages between supernatural beliefs and schizotypy, and they suggested that dissolution of the self is likely to be linked to phenomena such as absorption, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], and suggestibility, which have potentially pathological implications.

== Validity ==

Criticisms have been made of Cloninger's conception of self-transcendence.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; Although Cloninger proposed that character traits, including self-transcendence, are wholly learned, more recent research suggests that biological and genetic factors play an important role in how self-transcendence is expressed. Although humanistic and transpersonal theories of psychology have maintained that spirituality is an essential component of health and well-being, published research using the Temperament and Character Inventory has linked self-transcendence to various aspects of mental illness. Cloninger and colleagues have even proposed more recently that self-transcendence may represent a subclinical manifestation of mood and psychotic disorders.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; Additionally of concern is the paucity of research evaluating the validity of the self-transcendence as a measure of spiritual aspects of personality. Evidence relevant to the validity of the scale is provided by a study by MacDonald and Holland who found that people who were convinced that they had had a spiritual experience scored higher on  self-transcendence compared to those who had not.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;  Additionally they found that  self-transcendence had positive and meaningful associations with four areas of spirituality: beliefs about the existence and relevance of spirituality; spiritual experience; paranormal beliefs; and traditional religiousness. (Although the dissolution of the self sub-dimension of  self-transcendence had little relation with these things.) However, self-transcendence was largely unrelated to existential well-being.{{#tag:ref|Existential well-being refers to having a positive sense of meaning and purpose in life and a sense of inner strength. Although considered by some to be an aspect of spirituality, some researchers have argued that existential well-being taps general psychological well-being and is not clearly related to the "spiritual" as the term has been traditionally understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Fulltext/2008/05000/Concerns_About_Measuring__Spirituality__in.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e31816ff796|title=Concerns About Measuring "Spirituality" In Research|year=2008|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G.|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=196|issue=5|pages=349–55|pmid=18477877}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} The latter was most strongly related to the  Temperament and Character Inventory traits of high self-directedness and low [[harm avoidance]]. Self-directedness is associated with self-control and adaptability, whereas low harm avoidance is associated with emotional well-being. This suggests that self-transcendence may be a valid measure of areas of spirituality relating to spiritual beliefs, spiritual experiences, paranormal beliefs, and traditional religiousness, but is unrelated to having a sense of meaning and purpose in life which is more related to other features of personality. Additionally, the  dissolution of the self in experience aspect of self-transcendence appears to have little relationship with spirituality and may be related to the more pathological aspects of the trait.

==Contribution to quality of life==
People with schizophrenia tend to have poorer self-rated quality of life compared to the general population. A study of individual differences in people with schizophrenia found that higher scores on self-transcendence and self-directedness and lower scores on harm avoidance were associated with better self-ratings of quality of life. The authors suggested that this finding accords with previous studies finding that spirituality in people with schizophrenia is associated with better adjustment to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.08.007|title=Temperament, character, and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives|year=2011|last1=Margetić|first1=Branka Aukst|last2=Jakovljević|first2=Miro|last3=Ivanec|first3=Dragutin|last4=Margetić|first4=Branimir|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=52|issue=4|pages=425–30|pmid=21683179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergio Aleati''' (born c. 1924) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[rugby union]] and professional [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1940s and 1950s. He played club level rugby union (RU) for [[R.S. Ginnastica Torino]], and representative level rugby league (RL) for [[Italy national rugby league team|Italy]], and at club level for [[Torino XIII]], as a {{rlp|sh}}, i.e. number 7.

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707–720.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging 
| journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=199–208

| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey.

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

More recently, biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]] has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M |title=The impracticality of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: translational and pharmacological barriers |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=390–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25072550 |pmc=4142774 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriazis |first1=Marios |title=Translating laboratory anti-aging biotechnology into applied clinical practice: Problems and obstacles |journal=World Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=51–4 |doi=10.5528/wjtm.v4.i2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M, Apostolides A |title=The Fallacy of the Longevity Elixir: Negligible Senescence May be Achieved, but Not by Using Something Physical |journal=Current Aging Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=227–34 |year=2015 |pmid=26135528 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/132663/article |doi=10.2174/1874609808666150702095803}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey responded to one such criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Grey AD |title=The practicality or otherwise of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: a response to Kyriazis |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=397–400 |year=2014 |pmid=25072964 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006).

''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend/&gt;

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

'''''The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea''''' is a play by [[Cherríe Moraga]]. The play, published by [[West End Press]],&lt;ref name=Parelesp43&gt;Pareles, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; was first written in 1995. It includes aspects of [[Coatlicue]], an Aztec goddess; the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' by [[Euripides]]; and [[La Llorona]].&lt;ref name=Eschenp103&gt;Eschen, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

A revolution in what was the United States had created separate territories for different racial groups. One territory is now African-American, one territory is now Native American, and another is now Latino and Hispanic. Patriarchies were established and homosexuals were forced to leave many of the areas because of politically conservative counter-revolutions.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; The setting is a post-apocalyptic future on the border of the current [[United States]] and [[Aztlán]], the separate nation carved out for Latinos and Hispanics as well as Native Americans. Aztlán combined elements of both cultures. Medea was exiled because of the patriarchical, anti-homosexual revolution in Aztlán.&lt;ref name=Eschenp103/&gt;

Medea, her son Chac-Mool, and her girlfriend live in the border area,&lt;ref name=Eschenp103/&gt; around [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Medea's husband Jasón wants to divorce Medea and take her Chac-Mool with him back to Aztlán, where Jasón holds an important place in society.&lt;ref name=Eschenp103/&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Medea''' - The main character, a former revolutionary who was forced into exile. She is bisexual and feminine.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; She is Luna's lover, Jasón's wife, and mother to teenage son, Chac-Mool. Her character is based on Euripides' Medea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eschen|first=Nicole|date=2006-01-01|title=The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea (review)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236805950_The_Hungry_Woman_A_Mexican_Medea_review|journal=[[Theatre Journal]]|volume=58|pages=103–106|doi=10.1353/tj.2006.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Jasón''' - Medea's husband, a biracial man who now lives in Aztlán,&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; where he holds an important position.&lt;ref name=Eschenp103/&gt; He wants to marry an [[Apache]] virgin girl and thus is divorcing Medea.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;
* '''Chac-Mool''' - Medea's son, a teenager.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Chac-Mool is named after a [[Toltec]] messenger, [[Chacmool]].&lt;ref&gt;Eschen, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Melissa Pareles of the ''[[Lambda Book Report]]'' describes him as "rebellious but trusting".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; At one point Medea kills Chac-Mool to prevent him from going into Aztlán. Nicole Eschen of the ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' wrote that at the end, "Chac-Mool reappears, possibly as a ghost or hallucination, to absolve and cradle Medea as she kills herself."&lt;ref name=Eschenp104&gt;Eschen, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Luna''' - Medea's girlfriend, a sculptor.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; She had taught Chac-Mool about history and heritage, including how to plant corn. Eschen states that Luna is not apologetic about her sexuality, and while Media is in despair, Luna gives "the voice of reason".&lt;ref name=Eschenp104/&gt; She is not willing to leave Medea.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Eschen and Pareles both describe her as "butch".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eschenp104/&gt; Pareles states that in the play Luna is "perhaps the most sympathetic character".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;
* '''Mama Sal''' - A grandmother who is a lesbian. Pareles describes Mama Sal as "the kind cynic who, despite her love for Chac-Mool and Medea, helps Luna leave Medea and Medea carry out her insane plan".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;
* '''Chihuateo''' - Four women who had died in childbirth. They provide a chorus.&lt;ref name=Eschenp104/&gt;

==Production==
By 2006 the play had received several full productions.&lt;ref name=Eschenp103/&gt;

''The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea'' has had few productions between the first 1995 production directed by Tony Kelly and the 2006 production at the Leeds Theater at Brown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehungrywoman.weebly.com/production-history.html|title=Production History|website=The hungry woman|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brown University Production of ''The Hungry Woman'' took place at the Leeds Theater in April 2006. According to the Brown Daily Herald Review, "Though a recreation of a Greek tragedy, the play includes both humorous scenes such as a girls’ night on the town in a lesbian dance club where the ladies line-dance to a disco remix of “The Hustle” and intense scenes like Medea mourning her son in the confines of a psychiatric hospital, only to be mocked by her doctors" (Barnes).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/12/07/review-medea-receives-modern-makeover-in-moragas-the-hungry-woman/|title=Review: Medea receives modern makeover in Moraga's 'The Hungry Woman'|last=Barnes|first=Taylor|date=2006-12-07|work=Brown Daily Herald|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelica del Valle plays Medea, highlighting the emotions behind the battle to keep her son. Luna, Medea’s lover, played by Erin Adams gives a sense of romance and evokes the feeling of emotional strain that family conflict can have on a relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Stanford University’s production of ''The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea'' took place in May 2005 at the Pigott Theater. Adelina Anthony directed this production. The production included equity actors VIVIS as Medea, Tessa Koning-Martínez as Mama Sal, as well as actors Ronak Kapadia as Jasón, Misha Chowhury as Chac-Mool, and Adelina Anthony as Luna.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eschen|first=Nicole|date=March 2006|title=Cherríe Moraga's The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea Performance Review|url=|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=58|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Eschen's performance review, "The play, from Medea herself to the set design, carried several simultaneous meanings, resonating with various culture" (Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to a production review by Nicole Eschen in a Theatre Journal, "The Hungry Woman furthers Moraga’s explorations of the intersection between aspects of identity, particularly as a Chicana lesbian, but also in relationship to indigenous cultures and motherhood" (Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adelina Anthony tackles Cherríe Moraga’s work and attempts to display the intersection of cultures. Cultures were intertwined in this production. This was heavily seen in the set design. The set had Greek elements, with white marble and traditional architecture. Its shape "suggested a cave or natural rock setting" according to Eschen. She further mentions that "Lighting and repositioning of a small rectangular platform transformed this abstract background into various locations such as a lesbian bar and a mental hospital"(Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This production takes inspiration from Euripides' Medea, but does not mimic it, balancing "elements of the Greek story with the Mexican La Llorona and the Aztec goddess Coatlicue" (Eschen).  VIVIS highlighted Medea’s characterization of agony and despair. Eschen writes that VIVIS, "spent a great deal of the play wandering around the stage in a black slip with a bottle of tequila or confines in a mental institution" (Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  During the scene where Medea ultimately makes the decision to kill her son, there is a choreographed dance by Alleluia Panis which "combined images of birth and death culminating in a Pietà image in which Medea cradled her dead son" (Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Anthony, playing Luna, Medea’s lover, both acted and co-directed the production. Anthony represented the butch lesbian lover, teaching Medea’s son Chac-Mool about his heritage and history. Both Anthony and VIVIS utilized "fairly realistic, traditional Western acting styles"(Eschen).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The chorus was costumed in brown body suits, "which were painted outlines of their breasts" (Eschen)., mimicking the image of tattoos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The women both danced and took on minimal roles such as a nurse, switching their costumes by adding specific identifying pieces.  Jasón, "a cruel South American dictator" (Eschen), was seen as having dark skin, unshaven face, and vaguely military costume.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Chac-Mool, Medea and Jasón’s son, played by Misha Chowdhury represented a tall and lanky adolescent.

The '''ultimate end''' is a concept in the moral philosophy of [[Max Weber]], in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.

"We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an "ethic of ultimate ends" or to an "ethic of responsibility." This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally, nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends—that, is in religious terms, "the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord"—and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html Politics as a Vocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (From [[Politics as a Vocation]], Max Weber, 1918).

The "ultimate end" is out of the hands of the actor. So long as he/she acts in a [[moral]] manner, any bad results, or negative ends, are not the responsibility of the actor and ultimately a result of God's will or other forces.

Born in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]],&lt;ref name="Urmas Alender Biography"&gt;[http://ruja.ee/?p=bio_alender Urmas Alender Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Alender began his musical career in the rock band Shades in 1969 but left the following year to become the vocalist for Andromeeda.&lt;ref name="Urmas Alender Biography"/&gt;

In 1971, Alender fronted the [[progressive rock]] band Ruja with pianist [[Rein Rannap]]. The band was influenced by Western acts such as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] and [[King Crimson]] and often incorporated the poetry of Estonian writers [[Juhan Viiding]] and [[Ott Arder]] into the lyrics.&lt;ref name="ce-review.org"&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/00/3/huang3_culture.html Central European Review:''Estonia's Purveyors of Prog'']&lt;/ref&gt; The band were nationally commercially successful.&lt;ref name="ce-review.org"/&gt; Alender would remain with the band until its demise in 1988.

From 1979 until 1980, Urmas Alender also fronted the Estonian [[punk rock]] band Propeller. Other bands Alender performed with were Teravik (1973–1976), Data (1988–1989), and in 1983, he briefly played in an outfit called Kaseke.

In 1987, Alender appeared in the Estonian [[rockumentary]] ''Pingul keel'' (''Tightened String'') alongside popular Estonian musicians [[Tõnis Mägi]], [[Ivo Linna]] and [[Anne Veski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tallinnfilm.ee/index.php?page=117&amp;product_id=739&amp;action=show_product_details |title=Tallinn Film |access-date=2009-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620022905/http://www.tallinnfilm.ee/index.php?page=117&amp;product_id=739&amp;action=show_product_details |archive-date=2009-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of being harassed by the [[KGB]] and Soviet authorities, Alender temporarily emigrated to Sweden in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://home.uninet.ee/~mel/estprog/proge/ruja.html |title=Ruja |access-date=2008-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224127/http://home.uninet.ee/~mel/estprog/proge/ruja.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 1994, while en route from Tallinn to [[Stockholm, Sweden]], Urmas Alender died when the [[cruiseferry]] [[MS Estonia|''Estonia'']] sank in the [[Baltic Sea]]. He was survived by a daughter, [[Yoko Alender]].&lt;ref name="ce-review.org"/&gt;

In 2003, Liia Sakkos made a documentary about Alender, titled ''Teisel pool vett'' (English: ''On the Other Side of the Water'', also a title of a song by Ruja).

{{Violence against women}}

A '''women's shelter''', also known as a '''women's refuge''' and '''battered women's shelter''', is a place of temporary protection and support for women escaping [[domestic violence]] and [[intimate partner violence]] of all forms.&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/women-s-refuge|title=women's refuge Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used to describe a location for the same purpose that is open to people of all genders at risk.

Representative data samples done by the [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] show that one in three women will experience physical violence during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Breiding MJ, Chen J, Black MC. Intimate Partner Violence in the United States – 2010. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; One in ten will experience sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women's shelters help individuals escape these instances of domestic violence and intimate partner violence and act as a place for protection as they choose how to move forward. Additionally, many shelters offer a variety of other services to help women and their children including [[counseling]] and legal guidance.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam"&gt;Chanmugam, A. (2011). Perspectives on US Domestic Violence Emergency Shelters: What do Young Adolescent Residents and their Mothers Say?. ''Child Care In Practice'', ''17''(4), 395. doi:10.1080/13575279.2011.596814&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to escape is valuable for women subjected to domestic violence or intimate partner violence.  Additionally, such situations frequently involve an imbalance of power that limits the victim's financial options when they want to leave.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009" /&gt; Shelters help women gain tangible resources to help them and their families create a new life.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;Perez, S., Johnson, D. M., &amp; Wright, C. V. (2012). The Attenuating Effect of Empowerment on IPV-Related PTSD Symptoms in Battered Women Living in Domestic Violence Shelters. ''Violence Against Women'', ''18''(1), 102–117 16p. doi:10.1177/1077801212437348&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, shelters are valuable to [[battered women]] because they can help them find a sense of empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Women's shelters are available in more than forty-five countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gnws.org/docs/GNWS_GlobalDataCount_2012.pdf|title=Global Data Count|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Global Network of Women's Shelters|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are supported with government resources as well as non-profit funds. Additionally, many philanthropists also help and support these institutions.

==History==

=== Canada ===
The very first women's shelter in Canada was started in 1965 by the Harbour Rescue Mission (now Mission Services) in Hamilton, Ontario. It was named Inasmuch House, with the name referencing a Bible verse (Matthew 25:40) quoting Jesus Christ as saying "Inasmuch as you have done it for the least of these, you have done it for me." It was designed to be a practical outworking of Christian values relating to justice and care. Although originally conceived as a shelter for women leaving prison, its clientele later became women escaping abuse by their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mission-services.com/say-hello/history/|title=History - Mission Services of Hamilton|work=Mission Services of Hamilton|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Inasmuch House was shared with other Christian inner-city missions across North America and led to the opening of  other such shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shelterlistings.org/details/19550/|title=The Haven Of Rest Ministries - Inasmuch House (for Women And Children)|website=www.shelterlistings.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first  shelters in Canada developed from a feminist perspective were started by Interval House, Toronto in April 1973, and the Ishtar Transition Housing Society in Langley, B.C.in June 1973.  These homes were grass roots organizations that lived on short term grants at first, with staff often working sacrificially in order to keep the houses running to ensure women's safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ckc.torontofoundation.ca/org/interval-house-0|title=Interval House {{!}} Toronto Community Knowledge Centre|website=ckc.torontofoundation.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ishtarsociety.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

From there,the  movement in Canada grew, with women's shelters opening under a variety of names - often as a Transition House or Interval House - opening up across the country in order to help women flee from abusive situations.

=== United States ===
The first women's shelter in the United States was likely established in St. Paul, Minnesota shortly after the first domestic violence hotline was established in the same location.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; However, other early locations include [[Rosie's Place]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which was opened in 1974 by [[Kip Tiernan]], and the Atlanta Union Mission in Atlanta, opened by Elsie Huck.&lt;ref name="Detweiler2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7WP3g2h3vwC&amp;dq=Elsie+Huck&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Life of Faith: My Journey|last=Detweiler|first=Elsie Moses Huck|date=December 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37582-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's shelters evolved over time. Grassroots community advocates in the 1970s offered shelters as one of the first services for victims of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; At this time, most shelters were for emergencies and involved stays less than six months.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;Montgomery, B. E., Rompalo, A., Hughes, J., Wang, J., Haley, D., Soto-Torres, L., &amp; ... Hodder, S. (2015). Violence Against Women in Selected Areas of the United States. ''American Journal of Public Health'', ''105''(10), 2156–2166. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2014.302430&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers and shelter workers offered legal and welfare referrals to women when they exited but contact afterwards was limited. More recent programs, such as those funded by the [[Violence Against Women Act]], offer longer term stays for women.&lt;ref name="Montgomery" /&gt; These locations, as well as [[transitional housing]], offer more services to women and their children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roberts, A. R., &amp; Lewis, S. J. (2000). Giving them shelter: National organizational survey of shelters for battered women and their children. ''Journal of Community Psychology'', ''28''(6), 669–681.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent change is the increasing amount of shelters publicizing their locations to increase funding and visibility in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to a larger women's movement, the number of shelters quickly increased after their induction and by 1977 the United States had eighty-nine shelters available for victims of violence.&lt;ref name="Clevenger"&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 361. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the United States had over 2,000 domestic violence programs in place, many with domestic violence shelters included.&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
For Asia, offering shelter to abused women is not a new concept. In feudal [[Japan]], [[Buddhist]] temples known as Kakekomi Dera acted as locations where abused women could take shelter before filing for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Cassegård, C. (2013). ''Youth Movements, Trauma and Alternative Space in Contemporary Japan''. Leiden: Brill, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; A formal system took more time, however, so it was not until 1993 that the grassroots women's movement of Japan built the first shelter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Yoshihama, M. (2002). Breaking the web of abuse and silence: voices of battered women in Japan. ''Social Work'', ''47''(4), 389–400 12p. doi:sw/47.4.389&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are thirty shelters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A similar history did not lead to as much progress in [[China]].  Women's shelters did not exist until the nineties and since then the country only opened a small number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Joan|date=2012-07-01|title=The Global Women's Movement and Chinese Women's Rights|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|volume=21|issue=76|pages=585–602|doi=10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|issn=1067-0564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Beijing]] there are no shelters for the twenty million residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/battered-women-in-china-could-finally-get-a-measure-of-legal-protection/2015/03/05/31e542c4-c1a8-11e4-a188-8e4971d37a8d_story.html|title=Battered women in China could finally get a measure of legal protection|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In England, [[Erin Pizzey]] opened the first widely known shelter for battered women, [[Chiswick Women's Aid]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Kathleen|title=The Battered Women Movement and the Creation of the Wife Beating Problem|journal=Social Problems|date=February 1982|volume=29|issue=3|pages=207–220|jstor=800155|doi=10.1525/sp.1982.29.3.03a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time almost every European country has opened shelters to help domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fileserver.wave-network.org/researchreports/WAVE_Report_2015.pdf|title=WAVE Report 2015|last=Logar|first=Rosa|date=1 January 2016|website=|publisher=WAVE – Women against Violence Europe, Bacherplatz 10/6, A-1050 Vienna|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two countries even offer shelters for particular ethnicities and cultures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, a new development in Europe is that countries like the Netherlands and Austria opened social housing for long term stays.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One reason for this growth is the Istanbul Convention against Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, a convention signed by forty-seven [[Council of Europe]] member states in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/home|title=Home|website=Istanbul Convention&lt;br /&gt;Action against violence against women and domestic violence|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Convention sets the creation of women's shelters as a minimum standard for compliance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Following [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] two thirds of local authorities in England have cut funding for women's refuges since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland Council funding for women's refuges cut by nearly £7m since 2010] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the first women's refuge, known as [[Elsie Refuge]], was opened in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] in 1974 by a group of women's liberation activists. Many others followed, with 11 established around the country by the middle of 1975 and many more to follow. Initially these services were entirely reliant on volunteer efforts and donations from the community, but they subsequently secured government funding under the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/forty_years_of_the_elsie_refuge_for_women_and_children|title=Forty years of the Elsie Refuge for Women and Children {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, government policy has recently seen some moves to dismantle the women's refuge movement, so that in New South Wales since 2014 the management of many refuges has been handed over to large religious agencies so that they now often operate as generic homeless services rather than specifically catering to women and children escaping domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newmatilda.com/2015/03/23/regional-womens-refuges-are-being-ripped-apart/|title=Regional Women's Refuges Are Being Ripped Apart|date=2015-03-23|website=New Matilda|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/womens-refuges-closing-down-after-reform-fails-them-20140618-zse72.html|title=Women's refuges closing down after reform fails them|last=Browne|first=Rachel|date=2014-06-21|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

=== General purpose ===
Women's shelters offer temporary refuge for women escaping acts of [[domestic violence]] or [[intimate partner violence]]. Many women become homeless in this situation because they are financially dependent on their abuser and these resources help to incentivize and support escape.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"&gt;McNulty, M., Crowe, T., Kroening, C., VanLeit, B., &amp; Good, R. (2009). Time use of women with children living in an emergency homeless shelter for survivors of domestic violence. ''OTJR: Occupation, Participation &amp; Health'', ''29''(4), 183 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of stay for women is between thirty and sixty days in the United States.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; However, this varies in different countries and in Europe, for example, four countries limit stays to a few weeks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Transitional housing]], another form of women's shelter, offers stays of up to a year while certain communities offer public and private housing for even longer periods.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Utilization ===
There is high demand for shelter services in the United States. A one-day national census done by the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] found that emergency shelters served over 66,581 people in one day and over 9,000 requests could not be met during the same period.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;Dutton, M. A., James, L., Langhorne, A., &amp; Kelley, M. (2015). Coordinated Public Health Initiatives to Address Violence Against Women and Adolescents. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''24''(1), 80–85 6p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2014.4884&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe there is a similar pattern of over-demand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Utilization by women is not consistent across the population of intimate partner violence victims, however. Women with children tend to use shelters more often as well as those that are injured physically.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 370. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, rural women have more trouble accessing services due to isolation and a lack of resources.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011"&gt;Peek-Asa, C., Wallis, A., Harland, K., Beyer, K., Dickey, P., &amp; Saftlas, A. (2011). Rural Disparity in Domestic Violence Prevalence and Access to Resources. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''20''(11), 1743 7p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2011.2891&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other services offered ===
Shelters are usually offered as part of a comprehensive domestic violence program that can also include a [[crisis hotline]], services for non-sheltered children, an education program, a community speaker list, and an offender treatment program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shelters themselves also offer a variety of services. They provide counseling, support groups and skills workshops to help women move on independently.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 359–374. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; These act as tools of empowerment for women in conjunction with goal setting programs. Lastly, they offer support for children as well as legal and medical advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 362. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt;

Most residents of women's shelters are the children of women who are victims of violence. This is one reason why more than half of shelters offered services to this portion of the population in a survey of 215 shelters in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Services for children often include counseling and group therapy options that are meant to strengthen parent-child relationships and help with mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Recently, shelters also responded to increasing numbers of male victims by offering help mostly in the form of hotel vouchers.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Male residents ===
{{see also|Domestic violence against men#Responses}}
In the United States, certain shelters do not permit access to men.  This practice was challenged in ''Blumhorst v. Haven Hills,'' a court case in California (''Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC291977''). However, the court dismissed the case because the plaintiff lacked standing &amp;ndash; he was not involved in an abusive relationship and did not need shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Dragiewicz &amp; Yvonne Lindgren, The Gendered Nature of Domestic Violence: Statistical Data for Lawyers Considering Equal Protection Analysis, 17 Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 229, 268 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Certain groups are critical of the smaller amount of resources available to men in the United States and across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tsui, V. (2014). Male Victims of Intimate Partner Abuse: Use and Helpfulness of Services. ''Social Work'', ''59''(2), 121–130 10p. doi:sw/swu007&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources dispute the view that male-only refuges are wanted or needed by most male victims, arguing that the issue has been misrepresented out of misogyny rather than genuine concern for male victims.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons (20 May 2008) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhaff/263/26310.htm#n224 ''House of Commons Sixth Report''] House of Commons. Retrieved 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Istanbul Convention, for example, states that the creation of women's shelters is not discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some shelters do permit access today, including the Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] which offers services to both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dapdc.org/|title=The Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County|website=www.dapdc.org|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their own reports, around three percent of DAP supported individuals have been men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/general-news/20131007/help-domestic-abuse-victims-for-35-years|title=Help domestic abuse victims for 35 years|website=www.delcotimes.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 100 places were opened to house male victims of domestic violence in Northamptonshire, or to house families barred from other shelters, such as women with older male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146783/First-refuges-battered-husbands-offer-support-male-victims.html|title=First refuges for battered husbands offer support to male victims|date=16 February 2009|work=Mail Online|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, approximately 8 percent of women's shelters are also open to adult men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11495-eng.htm|title=Shelters for abused women in Canada, 2010|last2=Cotter|first2=Cotter|website=Statistics Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|last1=Burczycka|first1=Marta|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

=== United States ===

Women's shelters in the United States are supported at a state and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs|title=Grant Programs {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of the funding offered at the state level, however, comes from the federal government through grants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Services are generally administered through Domestic Violence Intervention Programs (DVIPs) funded by the Family Violence Services Act, the [[Victims of Crime Act of 1984]], and the [[Violence Against Women Act]]. Various non-profits also contribute to the services offered and provide a national voice for the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples include the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] which represents fifty-six U.S. states and territories, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, and local United Ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trynova.org/|title=National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) – Championing Dignity Compassion Victims Crime and CrisisNational Organization for Victim Assistance|website=www.trynova.org|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports show that on any day over 5,000 women are unable to use services because of a lack of funding or space.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011" /&gt; Many states have also cut their funds for women's shelters. In 2009, [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] of [[California]] cut $16 million in state funding to [[domestic violence]] programs because of the state's budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26domestic.html|title=Losing State Aid, California Women's Shelters Cut Back or Close|date=25 September 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 [[Washington (state)|Washington]] governor [[Christine Gregoire]] released a budget proposal stripping all state funding for domestic violence and women's shelters across Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Taking It Seriously: Repairing Domestic Violence Sentencing in Washington State|url=http://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2029&amp;context=sulr|journal=Seattle University Law Review|volume=34|pages=963–992|last1=Sully|first1=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of budget cuts caused several shelters to close their doors, leaving women with no safe haven to escape Intimate partner violence. Local communities are now also taking it upon themselves to create a safe place for domestic violence refugees. In Grand Forks, [[British Columbia]], a small community of less than 3,600, people organized the Boundary Women's Coalition, to support their local women's shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1, 1993|title=Help for battered women in rural areas.|url=http://business.highbeam.com/436992/article-1G1-14776961/help-battered-women-rural-areas|journal=Chatelaine|volume=66|issue=11|page=46|via=Highbeam}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Women often suffer lasting mental conditions from their abuse including [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s (PTSD).&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Since women in shelters have more likely experienced severe physical and mental abuse than those who do not utilize these services, they are also more likely to experience PTSD.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt; In fact, a national organizational survey compiled four separate studies of female support group or shelter users and reported PTSD rates between 45% and 84% (Astin, Lawrence, Pincus, &amp; Foy, 1990; Houskamp &amp; Foy,1991; Roberts, 1996a; Saunders, 1994).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These emotional and mental consequences have an effect on women's career opportunities and ability to function in normal life.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Women's shelters try to counteract these effects as well as prevent future instances of abuse. However, PTSD can prohibit women from utilizing shelter resources effectively.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Shelter utilization may lead to the better functioning of survivors and fewer reports of abuse in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, J., Nava, A., Gilroy, H., Paulson, R., &amp; Maddoux, J. (2012). Testing Two Global Models to Prevent Violence against Women and Children: Methods and Baseline Data Analysis of a Seven-Year Prospective Study. ''Issues In Mental Health Nursing'', ''33''(12), 872 11p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research that studied 3,410 residents of 215 domestic violence across the United States linked longer shelter stays with increased well-being and better help-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"&gt;Lyon, E., Lane, S., &amp; Menard, A. (2008). Domestic violence shelters: Survivors experiences. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225025.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a result of increased knowledge about services and options available to women in vulnerable positions as well as increased empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012" /&gt; This may indicate that transition services and longer residential offerings are more valuable.

=== Criticism ===
Many women report re-abuse after leaving a shelter.  A sample study done by Bybee and Sullivan, which analyzed data from 124 victims who utilized shelters, found no positive effect on re-abuse three years after shelter use.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, D., Sullivan, C. (. (0001). Predicting re-victimization of battered women 3 years after exiting a shelter program (English). ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', ''36''(1–2), 85–96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, with current resource restraints in the United States, standard shelters do not provide the PTSD or psychotherapeutic treatments necessary for full support.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"/&gt; They also have issues with under-serving the community because of a shortage of funded staff, a lack of bilingual staff, and inadequate facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shelters in Europe are similarly limited and only eight countries fulfill the minimum standards for shelters set by the Istanbul Convention.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another criticism of the shelters in Europe is that they have strict age limits that keep male children out and certain shelters discriminate against women from other countries or who identify as lesbian or transgender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The funeral industry in America emerged after the Civil war as a means of disposing of the countless bodies that were accumulated during the war.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iccfa.com/reading/2000-2009/future-role-women-funeral-industry|title=The Future Role of Women in the Funeral Industry|last=Broaddus|first=Ellen|date=November 2005|website=ICFM Magazine|publisher=International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association|access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, care of the sick and recently deceased was largely done at home by women.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] led to the need to transport many bodies long distances from their place of death to the final resting place, and thus to the common practice of [[embalming]] bodies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2015/08/92557/undertaker-funeral-director-jobs|title=These Two Millennials Want To Change The Way We Die|last=Lebsack|first=Lexy|date=26 October 2016|website=Refinery29|publisher=Caitlin Doughty Undertaking LA Interview|access-date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the chemicals required in the embalming process professionals were needed to care for North America's deceased.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As time progressed caring for the deceased transitioned from being a practice performed in the home to an extremely profitable industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early development of the funeral industry, undertaking became one of the few trades that allowed women to participate during a time when the business world predominately consisted of “landowning, educated, white men.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although women were not prohibited from entering the death service industry they were rarely given the position of [[undertaker]] unlike their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the Victorian era, women were only allowed to care for the bodies of women and children due to the time period’s strict enforcement of propriety.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mysendoff.com/2011/06/history-of-women-in-the-funeral-industry-2/|title=History of Women in the Funeral Industry|last=Gillies|first=Matthew|date=|website=The Definitive Funeral Planning and Information Resource Site|publisher=|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this fact “the further the funeral industry headed toward becoming a profession, the further women were left behind.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To further exclude women from the funeral industry, Civil War-era trades journals, for instance, ''The Casket and Embalmer’s Monthly'', published articles to discourage women from entering the trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, Lina D. Odou pioneered and advocated for women’s involvement in embalming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Odou is quoted as saying, "Over and over again have I heard mothers ask undertakers if they could not furnish women embalmers for their dead daughters, and many others to whom the dead are sacred have asked the same question, and I have invariably heard such men say there are no women to be had for such a purpose."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lack of female embalmers, due to social stigma, motivated Odou to become an expert in the field by studying in Switzerland; and later in 1899 she opened an institute for women at the undertaking establishment of the Reverend Stephen Merritt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Odou's first class graduated 10 students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She established the Lina D. Odou Embalming Institute in 1901.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Present-day ==
Small family owned [[funeral home]]s are still in practice, although large specialist organizations managing funerals have gained prominence due to societal and technical changes and the [[institutionalization]] of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. The Lifecycle of the UK Funeral Industry|last=Parsons|first=Brian|date=July 1999|pages=127–145|journal=Mortality|volume=4|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The funeral industry is laden with sexism and specific roles based on sex.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theothersideoffunerals.blogspot.ca/2012/04/sexisim-in-funeral-industry.html|title=Sexism in the Funeral Industry|last=Handy|first=A|date=April 2012|website=The Other Side of Funerals|publisher=The Other Side of Funerals|access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a stigma against females as funeral directors that lasted until 1980; it was extremely difficult for women to find employment in the funeral industry outside of a family practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_41ef08e2-4b7a-5bbd-94f8-740c6665f488.html|title=Not Just a Man's Job: More Women Are Funeral Home Directors|last=Hallman|first=Randy|date=13 December 2015|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females have recently started to regain prominence in the funeral industry, as of recently more than half (57%) of mortuary science students are women.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/20/funeral-directors-women/|title=Why Your Funeral Will Probably Be Run by a Woman|last=Fisher|first=Anne|date=20 August 2015|journal=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral homes such as White Lady Funerals has a staff completely composed of women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Yves Bolduc''' (born March 6, 1957 in [[Alma, Quebec]]) is a doctor and politician in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]]. He was named the new Minister of Health and Social Services of Quebec on June 25, 2008 succeeding [[Philippe Couillard]] who resigned on the same day following five years as Minister for that portfolio.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Politique/2008/06/25/003-bolduc-ministre-sante.shtml Gouvernement Charest : Bolduc succède à Couillard | Politique | Radio-Canada.ca&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was member of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] of the [[Quebec City]] riding of [[Jean-Talon]]. He is a member of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]].

==Education and professional career==
Bolduc holds a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.), a [[master's degree]] from the [[École nationale d'administration publique]] and a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[bioethics]] from the [[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi]]. He started his studies at the [[Laval University|Université Laval]] where he obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[health sciences]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plq.org/bolduc/biographie.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013012953/http://www.plq.org/bolduc/biographie.php |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolduc worked as a [[general practitioner]] since 1981 and as a [[coroner]] since 1985. He was also the general manager of the Health and Social services center of the [[La Vallée-de-l'Or Regional County Municipality|Vallée-de-l'Or]] in the [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]] region and ran the professional services department of the Lac Saint-Jean Health and Social Services Center for fourteen years. He was also president of the Association des Conseils de médecins, dentistes et pharmaciens du Québec and a member of the Alma Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.canoe.com/infos/quebeccanada/archives/2008/06/20080626-052901.html Canoe – Infos – Québec-Canada: Un autre missionnaire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his years as a practitioner, Bolduc was more specialized in service accessibility, and he recently implemented methods inspired from the [[Toyota]] assembly line to better manage the operating room at the [[Val-d'Or]] Hospital.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/abitibi/2008/06/21/002-csss-valdor.shtml L'approche Toyota&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

Bolduc ran as a member of the Liberal Party during the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 general election]] in the riding of [[Lac-Saint-Jean (electoral district)|Lac Saint-Jean]]. However, he was defeated by the [[Parti Québécois]] candidate [[Alexandre Cloutier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20080625/CPACTUALITES/80625059/6488/CPACTUALITES Rémi Nadeau et Martin Ouellet : Yves Bolduc succède à Philippe Couillard | Actualités | Cyberpresse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The PQ swept the entire [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]] region in that election.

By becoming a member of the [[Jean Charest]] cabinet, Bolduc became the first unelected Minister since the PQ's [[David Levine (medical administrator)|David Levine]], who was named delegate minister for health in the [[Bernard Landry]] cabinet in 2002. About only 40 other non-elected members since 1874 were named to Cabinet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Bolduc ran in a by-election on September 29 in the [[Jean-Talon]] riding left vacant by the departure of Couillard. Bolduc was easily elected, receiving 58% of the vote.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lcn.canoe.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2008/09/20080929-211449.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
While Quebec Education Minister in 2015, Mr. Bolduc publicly defended the policy which allowed a school administrator in Quebec City to strip search a 15-year-old student.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/yves-bolduc-says-teen-strip-search-allowed-in-high-schools-1.2960521&lt;/ref&gt; The statements have caused outrage among some Quebecers who have started a petition asking for his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/yves-bolduc-backtracks-on-school-strip-search-policy-1.2961320&lt;/ref&gt; He later announced a re-examination of the rules, stating an independent party will be investigating the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/02/18/quebec-reviewing-policies-after-school-strip-search-of-girl-15.html Policy review news story]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following much speculation, Bolduc announced his resignation as both Education Minister and MNA on February 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authier|first=Philip|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/education-minister-yves-bolduc-poised-to-resign-reports-say|title= Yves Bolduc turns his back on politics, heads back to medicine|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=February 26, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
