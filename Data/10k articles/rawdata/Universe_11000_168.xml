== Description ==
Aerolux gas discharge light bulbs contained low pressure gas, either neon or argon, or a mixture of the two. Also within the bulb were metal sculptures coated with phosphors. These phosphors fluoresced when excited by [[glow discharge]]. Because glow discharge occurs readily at 110-120 [[volt]]s AC, one could use these bulbs in standard household lamps in the United States.

The phosphors used in the bulbs were somewhat brittle, necessitating care in handling. Shaking or jarring the bulbs would cause flaking and migration of the phosphors to other parts of the metallic sculpture. Such handling would leave non-fluorescing portions of the sculpture and/or migration of phosphors to other surfaces within the bulb.

Aerolux bulbs consumed about 3-5 watts of power. The bulbs had high yield of light produced versus electricity consumed, generally in the range of 50-60 [[Lumen (unit)|lumen]]s/[[watt]], compared to 12-18 lumens/watt for a [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten filament incandescent bulb]].

'''African Petroleum Producers Association''', '''APPA''' (''Association des pays africains producteurs de pétrole'' in [[French language|French]], ''Associação de Produtores de Petróleo Africanos'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and ''رابطة منتجي النفط الأفريقية'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is an organisation of [[Africa]]n countries producing petroleum. It was founded in 1986. The headquarters of the organisation are in [[Brazzaville]] in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. The Organization has since changed its name to African Petroleum Producers Organization. &lt;ref&gt;Petroleum reform talk: APPA to APPO: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/petroleum-reform-talk-appa-appo&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding of APPA was spearheaded by [[Nigeria]] as an effort to mitigate the nation's dependency on Western technology and Western markets for oil export revenues. The objective of APPA was to promote cooperation in petrochemical research and technology.

[[Image:Moringa oleifera Blanco1.125.png|right|thumb|240px|Behenic acid comes from the ben oil tree, ''Moringa oleifera'']]

'''Behenic acid''' (also '''docosanoic acid''') is a [[carboxylic acid]], the saturated [[fatty acid]] with formula C&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. In appearance, it consists of white to cream color crystals or powder with a melting point of 80&amp;nbsp;°C and boiling point of 306&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Sources==
At 9%, it is a major component of [[Ben oil]] (or behen oil), which is extracted from the seeds of the [[Moringa oleifera|Ben-oil tree (''Moringa oleifera'')]].  It is so named from the [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Iranian calendar|month]] ''[[Bahman]]'', when the roots of this tree were harvested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.numericana.com/answer/culture.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Behenic acid is also present in some other oils and oil-bearing plants, including [[rapeseed]] ([[canola]]) and [[peanut oil]] and skins. It is estimated that one ton of peanut skins contains {{convert|13|lb|kg}} of behenic acid.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;[http://www.hbci.com/~wenonah/new/pnutskin.htm USDA Scientists Find Treasure in Peanut Skins].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
As a dietary oil, behenic acid is poorly absorbed. In spite of its low bioavailability compared with [[oleic acid]], behenic acid is a [[cholesterol]]-raising saturated fatty acid in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Caterm, Nilo B and Margo A Denke. January 2001 [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/73/1/41 Behenic acid is a cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acid in humans]. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, v 73, No. 1, pp41-44.{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Commercially, behenic acid is often used to give [[hair conditioner]]s and [[moisturizer]]s their smoothing properties.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; It is also used in [[lubricating oil]]s, and as a solvent evaporation retarder in paint removers. Its amide is used as an anti-foaming agent in [[detergent]]s, [[Polishing|floor polishes]] and dripless [[candle]]s. Reduction of behenic acid yields [[behenyl alcohol]].

[[Pracaxi oil]] (from the seeds of ''[[Pentaclethra|Pentaclethra macroloba]]'') is a natural product with one of the highest concentrations of behenic acid, and is used in hair conditioners.

A '''beltweigher''' or '''belt weigher''' is a piece of industrial [[control system|control equipment]] used to gauge the mass or flow rate of material travelling over a troughed (cupped) conveyor belt of any length which is able to adequately contain the material being weighed.  These are also known as belt scales, dynamic scales, conveyor scales, and in-motion weighers.  Many such  [[check weigher]]s or [[feed weighers]] are an active part of the process flow control of the conveyor line.

A belt weigher replaces a short section of the support mechanism of the belt, which might be one or more sets of [[Idler-wheel|idler]] rollers, or a short section of channel or plate.   This weighed support is mounted on [[load cell]]s, either pivoted, counterbalanced or not, or fully suspended. The mass measured by the load cells is [[integral|integrated]] with the belt speed to compute the mass of material moving on the belt, after allowing for the mass of the belt itself.  Belt weighers generally include the necessary electronics to perform this calculation, often in the form of a small industrialized [[microprocessor]] system.

A belt weigher is normally mounted in a well supported straight section of belt, with no vertical or sideways curvature, and as close to level as is practicable.  The weighed support must be aligned vertically and horizontally with the adjacent supports to avoid tensile forces in the belt skewing the measurement.
Due the belt tension variation, frequent check calibration must be done. 

Outputs from belt weighers are typically:
* pulses at predefined increments of mass
* an [[analog signal|analogue]] signal proportional to the flow rate

In addition, some belt weigher controllers will offer features such as driving an output to stop the belt when a predefined mass of material has been measured, or a range of alarms to indicate nil flow, belt slippage and belt stoppage.

Uses include mineral and aggregate extraction, continuous mixing processes, control of [[variable rate feeder]]s, port handling and ship loading processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19197">'''Bilayer graphene''' is a material consisting of two layers of [[graphene]]. One of the first reports of bilayer graphene was in the seminal 2004 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper by [[Andre Geim|Geim]] and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Novoselov, K. S. |author2= Geim, A. K. |author3=Morozov, S. V. |author4= Jiang, D. |author5=Zhang, Y. |author6= Dubonos, S. V. |author7= Grigorieva, I. V. |author8=Firsov, A.A. |title= Electric Field Effect in Atomically Thin Carbon Film |year=2004 |journal= Science |volume=306 |issue=5696 |pages= 666–669 |arxiv= cond-mat/0410550 |bibcode = 2004Sci...306..666N |doi = 10.1126/science.1102896 |pmid=15499015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they described devices "which contained just one, two, or three atomic layers"

== Structure ==

Bilayer graphene can exist in the AB, or Bernal-stacked form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K Yan |author2=H Peng |author3=Y Zhou |author4=H Li |author5=Z Liu |title= Formation of bilayer Bernal graphene: layer-by-layer epitaxy via chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nano Lett.|volume=11 |pages=1106–10|year=2011|doi=10.1021/nl104000b|bibcode = 2011NanoL..11.1106Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; where half of the atoms lie directly over the center of a hexagon in the lower graphene sheet, and half of the atoms lie over an atom, or, less commonly, in the AA form, in which the layers are exactly aligned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Z Liu |author2=K Suenaga PJF Harris |author3=S Iijima |title= Open and closed edges of graphene layers |journal= Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=102|pages=015501 |year=2009|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.102.015501|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102a5501L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bernal stacked graphene, twin boundaries are common; transitioning from AB to BA stacking.&lt;ref name="nl204547v"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/nl204547v |title=Twinning and Twisting of Tri- and Bilayer Graphene |year=2012 |last=Min |first=Lola |last2=Hovden |first2=Robert |last3=Huang |journal=Nano Letters |volume=12 |issue=3 |first3=Pinshane |last4=Wojcik |first4=Michal |last5=Muller |first5=David A. |last6=Park |first6=Jiwoong |pages=1609–1615|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.1609B |pmid=22329410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twisted layers, where one layer is rotated relative to the other, have also been observed.&lt;ref name="nl204547v"/&gt;

[[Quantum Monte Carlo]] methods have been used to calculate the binding energies of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene, which are 11.5(9) and 17.7(9) meV per atom, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= E. Mostaani, N. D. Drummond and V. I. Fal'ko|title= Quantum Monte Carlo Calculation of the Binding Energy of Bilayer Graphene  |journal= Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=115|pages=115501 |year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.115501|arxiv = 1506.08920 |bibcode = 2015PhRvL.115k5501M |pmid=26406840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the observation that the AB-stacked structure is more stable than the AA-stacked structure.

== Synthesis ==

Bilayer graphene can be made by exfoliation from graphite &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y Zhang |author2=T Tang |author3=C Girit |author4=Z Hao |author5=MC Martin |author6=A Zettl |author7=MF Crommie |author8=YR Shen |author9=F Wang |title= Direct observation of a widely tunable bandgap in bilayer graphene|journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=820–23 |year=2009|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..820Z |doi = 10.1038/nature08105 |pmid=19516337}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= W Liu |title= Controllable and rapid synthesis of high-quality and large-area Bernal stacked bilayer graphene using chemical vapor deposition |journal= Chem. Mater.|volume=26|pages=907–15 |year=2014|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1021/cm4021854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Rodney S. Ruoff]] and colleagues showed that large single-crystal bilayer graphene could be produced by oxygen-activated chemical vapour deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Y Hao |displayauthors=etal |title= Oxygen-activated growth and bandgap tunability of large single-crystal bilayer graphene |doi=10.1038/nnano.2015.322 |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=11 |pages=820–23 |year=2016|bibcode = 2016NatNa..11..426H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year a Korean group reported the synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystal AB-stacked bilayer graphene &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=VL Nguyen |displayauthors=etal |title= Wafer-Scale Single-Crystalline AB-Stacked Bilayer Graphene |doi= 10.1002/adma.201601760|journal= Adv. Mater. |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tunable bandgap ==

Like monolayer graphene, bilayer graphene has a zero bandgap and thus behaves like a semimetal. In 2007, researchers predicted that a bandgap could  be introduced if an electric displacement field were applied to the two layers: a so-called tunable [[band gap]].&lt;ref name="PRB75.155115"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.75.155115 |title=Ab initio theory of gate induced gaps in graphene bilayers |year=2007 |last=Min |first=Hongki |last2=Sahu |first2=Bhagawan |last3=Banerjee |first3=Sanjay |last4=MacDonald |first4=A. |journal=Physical Review B |volume=75 |issue=15|page=155115|arxiv = cond-mat/0612236 |bibcode = 2007PhRvB..75o5115M }}&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental demonstration of a tunable bandgap in bilayer graphene came in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y Zhang |author2=T Tang |author3=C Girit |author4=Z Hao |author5=MC Martin |author6=A Zettl |author7=MF Crommie |author8=YR Shen |author9=F Wang |title= Direct observation of a widely tunable bandgap in bilayer graphene. |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=820–23 |year=2009|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..820Z |doi = 10.1038/nature08105 |pmid=19516337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 researchers observed 1D ballistic electron conducting channels at bilayer graphene domain walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= L Ju |title= Topological valley transport at bilayer graphene domain walls. |journal=Nature |volume=520|pages=650–55|year=2015|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2015Natur.520..650J |doi = 10.1038/nature14364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group showed that the band gap of bilayer films on silicon carbide could be controlled by selectively adjusting the carrier concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T Ohta |title= Controlling the Electronic Structure of Bilayer Graphene|journal= Science  |volume=313 |pages=951–954 |year=2006 |doi = 10.1126/science.1130681|bibcode = 2006Sci...313..951O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent complex states ==

In 2014 researchers described the emergence of complex electronic states in bilayer graphene, notably the fractional [[Anomalous quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall effect]] and showed that this could be tuned by an electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=  A Kou | title=Electron-hole asymmetric integer and fractional quantum Hall effect in bilayer graphene  |year=2014 |journal=Science|volume=345|issue=6192|pages=55–57|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1312.7033 |bibcode = 2014Sci...345...55K |doi = 10.1126/science.1250270 |pmid=24994644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=  K Lee | title= Chemical potential and quantum Hall ferromagnetism in bilayer graphene |year=2014 |journal=Science|volume=345|issue=6192|pages= 58–61|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1401.0659 |bibcode = 2014Sci...345...58L |doi = 10.1126/science.1251003 |pmid=24994645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=  P Maher | title=Tunable fractional quantum Hall phases in bilayer graphene |year=2014 |journal=Science|volume=345|issue=6192|pages=61–64|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1403.2112 |bibcode = 2014Sci...345...61M |doi = 10.1126/science.1252875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state was reported  in bilayer graphene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=  Li J I A | title=Even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene  |year=2017|doi = 10.1126/science.aao2521|arxiv=1705.07846|bibcode=2017Sci...358..648L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excitonic Condensation ==

Bilayer graphene showed the potential to realize a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of [[exciton]]s.&lt;ref name="PRL104.096802"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barlas | first1 = Y. | last2 = Côté | first2 = R. | last3 = Lambert | first3 = J. | last4 = MacDonald | first4 = A.

Exciton condensates in bilayer systems have been shown theoretically to carry a large [[Electric current|current]].&lt;ref name="nphys1055"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Su | first1 = J.

== Superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene==
Pablo Jarillo-Herrero of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and colleagues from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan]], have reported the discovery of [[superconductivity]] in bilayer graphene with a twist angle of 1.1° between the two layers. The discovery was announced in two papers published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature26160|author= Y Cao, V Fatemi, S Fang, K Watanabe, T Taniguchi, E Kaxiras, P Jarillo-Herrero |title= Direct observation of a widely tunable bandgap in bilayer graphene. |journal=Nature |year=2018|arxiv=1803.02342|bibcode=2018Natur.556...43C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature26154 |author= Y Cao, V Fatemi, A Demir,, S Fang, SL Tomarken, JY Luo,  J D Sanchez-Yamagishi, K Watanabe, T Taniguchi, E Kaxiras, R C Ashoori, P Jarillo-Herrero |title= Correlated insulator behaviour at half-filling in magic-angle graphene superlattices. |journal=Nature|year=2018|arxiv=1802.00553|bibcode=2018Natur.556...80C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bilayer graphene was prepared from exfoliated monolayer graphene, with the second layer being manually rotated to a set angle with respect to the first layer. A Tc value of 1.7 K was observed with such specimens. Jarillo-Herrero has suggested that it may be possible to “...... imagine making a superconducting transistor out of graphene, which you can switch on and off, from superconducting to insulating. That opens many possibilities for quantum devices.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graphene superlattices could be used for superconducting transistors|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/03/graphene-superlattices-could-be-used-for-superconducting-transistors.html |publisher=[[The Next Big Future]] |accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field effect transistors ==

Bilayer graphene can be used to construct [[Field-effect transistor|field effect transistors]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiori|first=Gianluca|last2=Iannaccone|first2=Giuseppe|date=March 2009|title=On the Possibility of Tunable-Gap Bilayer Graphene FET|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4785198/|journal=IEEE Electron Device Letters|volume=30|issue=3|pages=261–264|doi=10.1109/led.2008.2010629|issn=0741-3106|via=|arxiv=0810.0128|bibcode=2009IEDL...30..261F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureNano2010.89"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schwierz | first1 = F. | title = Graphene transistors | doi = 10.1038/nnano.2010.89 | journal = Nature Nanotechnology | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 487–496 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20512128| pmc = |bibcode = 2010NatNa...5..487S }}&lt;/ref&gt; or tunneling field effect transistors,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiori|first=Gianluca|last2=Iannaccone|first2=Giuseppe|date=October 2009|title=Ultralow-Voltage Bilayer Graphene Tunnel FET|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5233800/|journal=IEEE Electron Device Letters|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1096–1098|doi=10.1109/led.2009.2028248|issn=0741-3106|via=|arxiv=0906.1254|bibcode=2009IEDL...30.1096F}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploiting the small energy gap. However, the energy gap is smaller than 250 meV and therefore requires the use of low operating voltage (&lt; 250 mV), which is too small to obtain reasonable performance for a field effect transistor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but is very suited to the operation of tunnel field effect transistors, which according to theory from a paper in 2009 can operate with an operating voltage of only 100 mV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016 researchers proposed the use of bilayer graphene to increase the output voltage of [[Tunnel field-effect transistor|tunnel transistors]] (TT). They operate at a lower operating voltage range (150 mV) than silicon transistors (500 mV). Bilayer graphene's energy band is unlike that of most semiconductors in that the electrons around the edges form a (high density) [[van Hove singularity]]. This supplies sufficient electrons to increase current flow across the energy barrier. Bilayer graphene transistors use "electrical" rather than "chemical" doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/graphene-transistor-clock-speeds-100-ghz/43499|title=Ultra-low power graphene-based transistor could enable 100 GHz clock speeds|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=May 24, 2016|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==   Ultrafast lithium diffusion ==

In 2017 an international group of researchers showed that bilayer graphene could act as a single-phase mixed conductor which exhibited Li diffusion faster than in graphite by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kühne, M |title= Ultrafast lithium diffusion in bilayer graphene |journal= Nature Nanotechnology |volume=12 |pages= 895–900 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1038/nnano.2017.108|arxiv=1701.02399 |bibcode=2017NatNa..12..895K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with the fast electronic conduction of graphene sheets, this system offers both ionic and electronic conductivity within the same single-phase solid material. This has important implications for energy storage devices such as [[lithium ion batteries]].

==   Ultrahard carbon from epitaxial bilayer graphene ==

Researchers from [[the City University of New York]] have shown that sheets of bilayer graphene on silicon carbide temporarily become harder than diamond upon impact with the tip of an [[atomic force microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gao, Y |title= Ultrahard carbon film from epitaxial two-layer graphene |journal= Nature Nanotechnology |volume=13 |pages= 133–138 |year=2018 |doi= 10.1038/s41565-017-0023-9|arxiv=1801.00520 |bibcode=2018NatNa..13..133G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed to a graphite-diamond transition, and the behavior appeared to be unique to bilayer graphene. This could have applications in personal armor.

== Porous nanoflakes ==

Hybridization processes change the intrinsic properties of graphene and/or induce poor interfaces. In 2014 a general route to obtain unstacked graphene via facile, templated, catalytic growth was announced. The resulting material has a specific surface area of 1628 m2 g-1, is [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] and has a [[mesoporous]] structure.&lt;ref name=rd1403&gt;{{cite web|author=Tue, 03/04/2014 - 3:35pm |url=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/03/researchers-develop-intrinsically-unstacked-double-layer-graphene |title=Researchers develop intrinsically unstacked double-layer graphene |doi=10.1038/ncomms4410 |publisher=Rdmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05|bibcode = 2014NatCo...5E3410Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material is made with a mesoporous nanoflake template. Graphene layers are deposited onto the template. The carbon atoms accumulate in the mesopores, forming protuberances that act as spacers to prevent stacking. The protuberance density is approximately {{val|5.8|e=14|u=m-2}}. Graphene is deposited on both sides of the flakes.&lt;ref name=rd1403/&gt;

During CVD synthesis the protuberances produce intrinsically unstacked double-layer graphene after the removal of the nanoflakes. The presence of such protuberances on the surface can weaken the π-π interactions between graphene layers and thus reduce stacking. The bilayer graphene shows a specific surface area of {{val|1628|u=m2/g}}, a pore size ranging from 2 to 7&amp;nbsp;nm and a total pore volume of {{val|2.0|u= cm3/g}}.&lt;ref name=rd1403/&gt;

Using bilary graphene as cathode material for a [[lithium sulfur battery]] yielded reversible capacities of 1034 and 734 mA h/g at discharge rates of 5 and 10 C, respectively. After 1000 cycles reversible capacities of some 530 and 380 mA h/g were retained at 5 and 10 C, with [[coulombic efficiency]] constants at 96 and 98%, respectively.&lt;ref name=rd1403/&gt;

Electrical conductivity of 438 S/cm was obtained. Even after the infiltration of sulfur, electrical conductivity of 107 S cm/1 was retained. The graphene's unique porous structure allowed the effective storage of sulfur in the interlayer space, which gives rise to an efficient connection between the sulfur and graphene and prevents the diffusion of polysulfides into the [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref name=rd1403/&gt;

The '''Campo de los Alisos National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Campo de los Alisos}}, literally "Field of [[Alder]]s") is a [[National parks of Argentina|federal protected area]] in [[Tucumán Province]], [[Argentina]]. Established on 9 August 1995,&lt;ref name=decree1/&gt; it houses a representative sample of the southern [[Yungas]] montane jungle [[biodiversity]] in good state of conservation.

Located in the [[Chicligasta Department]] on the eastern slope of the ''Nevados del Aconquija'', the park has an area of {{convert|17000|ha|km2 sqmi|abbr=on}}. The Aconquija mountains are the southern extension of the [[Calchaquíes Valleys]], the western first steps raising from the [[Gran Chaco]] plain into the [[Argentine Northwest|Northwest]] region. Annual rainfall here oscillates between {{convert|100|-|200|mm|abbr=on}}

==Biodiversity==
[[Flora (plants)|Flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] vary considerably with the different heights, from a jungle at lower levels to snow-covered mountainous terrain at {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} &lt;!-- there is much more in the official page, but I can't translate the technical terms! --&gt;

'''Cuprate''' loosely refers to a material that can be viewed as containing anionic [[copper]] complexes.  Examples include tetrachloridocuprate ([CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;),  the superconductor [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], and the organocuprates ([Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term cuprates derives from the Latin word for copper, ''cuprum''.   The term is mainly used in three contexts - [[oxide]] materials, anionic [[coordination complex]]es, and anionic [[organocopper compound]]s.

==Oxides==
One of the simplest oxide-based cuprates is the copper(III) oxide KCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This species can be viewed as the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salt of the polyanion [{{chem|CuO|2|−}}]&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  As such the material is classified as a cuprate.  This dark blue [[diamagnetic]] solid is produced by heating [[potassium peroxide]] and [[copper(II) oxide]] in an atmosphere of oxygen:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Potassium Cuprate (III)|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|edition=2nd|editor=G. Brauer|publisher=Academic Press|year=1963|location=NY|volume=1|page=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 CuO   →  2 KCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Coordination complexes==
Copper forms many anionic "cuprate" [[coordination complex]]es with negatively charged ligands such as cyanide, hydroxide, and halides. Copper(I) derivatives tend to be colorless, copper(II) complexes are often turquoise-blue, and copper(III) and copper(IV) complexes are often orange-red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEwj1WZKThEC&amp;pg=PA1264|pages=1252–1264|title=Inorganic chemistry|author1=Egon Wiberg |author2=Nils Wiberg |author3=Arnold Frederick Holleman |publisher=Academic Press|year=2001|isbn=0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hexafluorocuprat(iv).png|thumb|upright|left|Hexafluorocuprate(IV)]]
One example of a copper(I)-based cuprate is tetracyanocuprate(I), [Cu(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Copper(II) anions are most common, especially the chlorocuprates, such as trichlorocuprate(II) [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, tetrachlorocuprate(II) [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and pentachlorocuprate(II) [CuCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd"/&gt;   The light blue solid sodium tetrahydroxycuprate is well known; it is prepared by heating cupric hydroxide with concentrated sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;"Sodium Tetrahydroxocuprate (II) in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 1015.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NaOH   →   Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
Dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides in the [[Grignard reaction]]. It is prepared by mixing [[lithium chloride]] (LiCl) and [[copper(II) chloride]] (CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in [[tetrahydrofuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=73;81;83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8B3KEpkqxIC&amp;pg=PA81|title=Bioactive natural products|author=Atta-ur-Rahman|publisher=Elsevier|year= 2002|isbn=0-444-51004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also rare copper(III) and copper(IV) complexes such as the [[Potassium hexafluorocuprate(III)|hexafluorocuprate(III)]] [CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Caesium hexafluorocuprate(IV)|hexafluorocuprate(IV)]] [CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s.

==Organic cuprates==
{{main|Organocopper compound}}
Cuprates have a role in [[organic synthesis]]. Organic cuprates often have the formula [CuR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [CuR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, where R is an alkyl or aryl.  These reagents find use as nucleophilic [[alkylating reagent]]s.  In stark contrast to the oxidic cuprates, the handling of these organocopper requires [[air-free technique]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=101pNv3QpEIC&amp;pg=PA61|pages=61–65|title=Transition metals in the synthesis of complex organic molecules|author=Louis S.

[[File:Double fold.svg|thumbnail|A double fold is made by first folding the test piece backwards and then forwards to its initial position (one complete oscillation).]]
{{for|the book by Nicholson Baker|Double Fold}}
A '''double fold''' is a process of folding a [[paper]] sample first backwards and then forwards about the same line, i.e. one complete oscillation. The number of double folds that is required to make a test piece break is used to determine the material's [[folding endurance]] and [[fold number]].

The total folding angle (about the folding line) differs depending on which folding tester is used, for instance the Köhler–Molin instrument folds about 156° on each side of the vertical line, resulting in a complete [[oscillation]] of about 2 &amp;times; 312° for each double fold, while the [[MIT]] instrument employs a folding angle of about 135° on each side (that is, a complete oscillation of about 2 &amp;times; 270° for each complete double fold).&lt;ref&gt;ISO 5626:1993 Paper &amp;ndash; Determination of folding endurance, Annex A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the first double fold is more than one complete oscillation since the flap needs to be folded from vertical to its starting position before the counting begins.

The process was analyzed and criticized by [[Nicholson Baker]] in his 2001 book ''[[Double Fold|Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper]]''.

[[Image:Ecotypes of Physcomitrella patens.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Four different [[ecotypes]] of ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', stored at the [[International Moss Stock Center]]]]

In [[evolutionary ecology]], an '''ecotype''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Greek: ''οίκος'' = home and ''τύπος'' = type, coined by [[Göte Turesson]] in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''ecospecies''', describes a genetically distinct geographic variety, [[Population biology|population]] or [[Race (biology)|race]] within a [[species]], which is genotypically [[Adaptation|adapted]] to specific environmental conditions.

Typically, though ecotypes exhibit [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences (such as in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] or [[physiology]]) stemming from environmental heterogeneity, they are capable of interbreeding with other geographically adjacent ecotypes without loss of fertility or vigor.

==Definition==
An ecotype is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different than a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Mayr|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|chapter=VIII-Nongeographic speciation|pages=194–195|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mAIjnLp6r_MC&amp;pg=PA194|isbn=9780674862500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Ecotypes are closely related to [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]]. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]] is the occurrence in the equilibrium of two or more distinctly different phenotypes within a population of a species, in other words, the occurrence of more than one '''form''' or '''morph'''. The frequency of these discontinuous forms (even that of the rarest) is too high to be explained by [[mutation]]. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a [[panmictic]] population (whose all members can potentially interbreed). Polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations of species by natural selection (most famously [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans) in contrast to ''transient polymorphisms'' where conditions in a habitat change in such a way that a "form" is being replaced completely by another.

In fact, Begon, Townsend, and Harper assert that

{{Cquote|''There is not always clear distinction between local ecotypes and genetic polymorphisms.''}}

The notions "form" and "ecotype" may appear to correspond to a static phenomenon, however; this is not always the case. Evolution occurs continuously both in time and space, so that two ecotypes or forms may qualify as distinct species in only a few generations. Begon, Townsend, and Harper use an illuminating analogy on this:

{{Cquote|''… the origin of a species, whether [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]], is a process, not an event. For the formation of a new species, like the boiling of an egg, there is some freedom to argue about when it is completed.''}}

Thus ecotypes and morphs can be thought of as precursory steps of potential [[speciation]].

==Range and distribution==
Experiments indicate that sometimes ecotypes manifest only when separated by great spatial distances (of the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km). This is due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] whereby different but adjacent varieties of the same species (or generally of the same [[taxonomic rank]]) interbreed, thus overcoming local selection. However other studies reveal that the opposite may happen, i.e., ecotypes revealing at very small scales (of the order of 10 m), within populations, and despite hybridization.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

In ecotypes, it is common for continuous, gradual geographic variation to impose analogous phenotypic and genetic variation.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt; This situation is called [[Cline (biology)|cline]]. A well-known example of a cline is the skin color gradation in indigenous human populations worldwide, which is related to latitude and amounts of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;"Race".  (2009). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the distribution of ecotypes is [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]] or multimodal. This means that ecotypes may display two or more distinct and discontinuous phenotypes even within the same population. Such phenomenon may lead to [[speciation]] and can occur if conditions in a local environment change dramatically through space or time.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

==Examples==

* [[Earthworms]] fall into four different ecotypes. Compost earthworms prefer warm and moist environments with a ready supply of fresh compost material. [[Epigeic]] earthworms live on the surface of the soil in [[leaf litter]] and tend not to make burrows but live in and feed on the leaf litter. Endogeic earthworms live in and feed on the soil, making horizontal burrows through the soil to move around and to feed and they will reuse these burrows to a certain extent. Anecic earthworms make permanent vertical burrows in soil, feeding on leaves on the soil surface that they drag into their burrows.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.earthwormsoc.org.uk/earthworm-information/earthworm-information-page-2 Earthworm ecotypes], information from the Earthworm Society of Britain about the different ecotypes of British earthworms.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Kenya''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption, import and export in Kenya. Kenya's current effective installed (grid connected) electricity capacity is 2,351 MW, with peak demand of 1,802 MW, as at June 2018.&lt;ref name="1R"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity demand crosses 1,800 MW mark |access-date=3 July 2018 |first=Neville |last=Otuki |

Just until recently the country lacked significant domestic reserves of [[fossil fuel]]. The country has over the years had to import substantial amounts of [[crude oil]] and natural gas. This might change with the discovery of oil reserves in Kenya, which relied on oil imports to meet about 42 percent of its energy needs in 2010. As of the end of June 2016, 55% of Kenyans were connected to the National grid, which is one of the highest connection rates in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/882938/kenya-is-rolling-out-its-national-electricity-program-in-half-the-time-it-took-america/ | title=Kenya’s national electrification campaign is taking less than half the time it took America |access-date=3 July 2018 |

===Renewable energy===
{{Main article|Renewable energy in Kenya|Geothermal power in Kenya|Wind power in Kenya}}
Kenya is currently the largest producer of geothermal energy in Africa. It is one of two countries in Africa that produce geothermal energy, the other being Ethiopia. In 2010, geothermal accounted for almost 20 percent of Kenya's total electricity generation. The country has the potential to produce 10,000 megawatts of geothermal-powered electricity, according to Kenya's state-owned Geothermal Development Company.&lt;ref name="7R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/country.php?iso=KEN |title=Kenya's Key Energy Statistics |publisher=Eia.gov | date=30 May 2013 |access-date=3 July 2018 |author=U.S. Energy Information Administration |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total renewable energy capacity is at 60%, with most of that coming from Hydro-Power.&lt;ref name="8R"&gt;{{cite web|date=18 June 2012 | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613001823/http://www.iaea.org/nuclearenergy/nuclearknowledge/schools/NEM-school/2012/Japan/PDFs/week2/CR6_Kenya.pdf |format=Archived from the Original |title=Kenya’s Energy Demand and the role of Nuclear energy in future energy generation mix |access-date=4 July 2018 |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) | author=Catherine Kathambi Kianji |location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroelectric power===
{{Main article|Hydroelectric power in Kenya}}

===Utilities===
In Kenya, there are plans by the [[government of Kenya]], to end the monopoly of the electricity distribution market; but until that happens, power distribution is only held by one company; [[Kenya Power and Lighting Company]] (Kenya Power).&lt;ref name="9R"&gt;{{cite news|title=House seeks to end Kenya Power's monopoly |url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/House-seeks-to-end-Kenya-Power-monopoly/-/539546/1910994/-/3d10fs/-/index.html |

However, [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company]] (KenGen), is responsible for generating approximately 90% of installed capacity. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are responsible for about 10% of installed capacity. The following IPPs are active in Kenya: (a) Westmont (b) AEP Energy Africa (Iberafrica)&lt;ref name="10R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/business/SA-firm-buys-out-Moi-era-power-producer-Iberafrica/996-4637426-fi1srk/index.html |title=SA firm buys out Moi-era power producer Iberafrica |date=29 June 2018 |access-date=4 July 2018 |

===Consumption===
The biggest consumer of electricity in Kenya is [[Kenya Pipeline Company]], followed by [[Bamburi Cement]].&lt;ref name="12R"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Bamburi cement put off mega plans for alternative solar energy |access-date=4 July 2018 |date=18 December 2017 |

Of these, the largest 6,000, were responsible for 60 percent of the national power consumption, averaging in excess of 15,000 electricity units per month.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

==Petroleum==

===Imports===
Kenya had one of the largest crude oil refineries in East Africa, the 90,000-barrels-per-day (bbl/d) Mombasa refinery. The refinery typically operated below capacity and processed Murban heavy crude from Abu Dhabi and other heavy Middle-Eastern crude grades. The refinery was shut down in February 2016.&lt;ref name="13R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nation.co.ke/business/Refinery-to-become-storage-facility/996-3086224-x1xk2cz/index.html | title=Refinery plant to be used a storage facility |date=21 February 2016 |access-date=4 July 2018 |first=Immaculate | last=Karambu |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Kenya imported about 33,000 bbl/d of crude oil entirely from the United Arab Emirates, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). Kenya imported 51,000 bbl/d of refined oil products in 2011, according to KNBS. Kenya has a product pipeline system that transports petroleum products from Mombasa to inland areas.&lt;ref name="14R"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2015/07/kenya-pipeline-signs-financing-for-sh35bn-mombasa-nairobi-line/ |title=Kenya Pipeline signs financing for Sh35 billion Mombasa-Nairobi Line | date=15 July 2015 |access-date=4 July 2018 |location=Nairobi | publisher=[[98.4 Capital FM]] |author=Capital News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, Kenya consumed {{convert|2480000000|liter|0}}, of [[diesel fuel]]. The same year, the country used {{convert|1672800000|liter|0}}, of refined [[gasoline|petrol]].&lt;ref name="15R"&gt;{{cite web|date=9 October 2017 |access-date=4 July 2018 |url=https://www.nation.co.ke/business/Diesel-consumption-drops-time-in-7-years/996-4131012-dbhnaa/index.html |title=Diesel consumption drops for first time in 7 years |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |first=Neville |last=Otuki |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reserves===
In 2012 oil was discovered in Kenya. As of May 2016, proven reserves were estimated at 766 million barrels. This puts Kenya ahead of [[Uzbekistan]] in the global rankings. [[Tullow Oil]], one of the companies prospecting for oil in the country, is of the opinion that the national reserves are in excess of 1 billion barrels.&lt;ref name="16R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/681250/kenya-may-have-a-lot-more-oil-than-it-previously-thought/ |title=Kenya may have a lot more oil than it previously thought |author=Lily Kuo |date=11 May 2016 |publisher=[[Quartz Africa]] |location=New York City |access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
After the collapse of negotiations to build the [[Uganda-Kenya Crude Oil Pipeline]], Kenya began to make plans to build the	{{convert|554|mi|km}} [[Kenya Crude Oil Pipeline]] on its own.&lt;ref name="17R"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36121081 |title=Uganda picks Tanzania for oil pipeline, drops Kenya plan |access-date=4 July 2018 |date=23 April 2016 | author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18R"&gt;{{cite news |first=George |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Opinion-and-Analysis/Fast-track-Turkana-Lamu-pipeline-/-/539548/3177856/-/item/0/-/ahd6cjz/-/index.html |

==Challenges==
Fuelwood demand in the country is 3.5 million tonnes per year while its supply is 1.5 million tonnes per year. The massive deficit in fuelwood supply has led to high rates of deforestation in both exotic and indigenous vegetation resulting in adverse environmental effects such as desertification, [[land degradation]], droughts and famine.&lt;ref name="19R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1I41C7-OZATP | title=Corrupt officials to blame for loss of Kenya’s forest cover: government report |access-date=4 July 2018 |date=3 May 2018 | publisher=[[Reuters|Reuters Africa]] |first=John |last=Ndiso |

===Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP)===
Seven countries came together because they saw mutual benefit in having one power pool. The original countries were:&lt;ref name="20R"&gt;{{cite web|location=Washington, DC |author=World Bank

Later, more countries joined the pool, including:&lt;ref name="21R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eappool.org/ | title=About The Eastern Africa Power Pool |access-date=4 July 2018 |date=2016 |publisher=The Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) |author=EAPP |location=Addis Ababa}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) Tanzania (b) Libya (c) Djibouti and (d) Uganda.&lt;ref name="21R"/&gt;

The objective of the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) is to increase the volume and reduce the cost of electricity supply in Kenya; and to provide revenues to Ethiopia through the export of electricity from Ethiopia to Kenya.&lt;ref name="21R"/&gt; The process of connecting the Ethiopian grid to the Kenyan grid is underway.&lt;ref name="22R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/08/02/power-line-to-reduce-costs-by-seven-shillings_c1607695 |title=Power line to reduce costs by seven shillings |date=2 August 2017 |access-date=4 July 2018 | newspaper=[[The Star (Kenya)]] | first=Abel |last=Muhaita | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya also plans to be connected to the South African grid, through Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. That  process is also underway as of July 2018.&lt;ref name="23R"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya+to+link+to+SA+power+grid+by+2015+/-/2560/1477184/-/eri8mp/-/index.html | title=Kenya to link to Southern African power grid by 2015 |

===Geothermal power===
Geothermal power plants, which convert steam generated from hot rocks deep underground into electricity, have a prominent place in Kenya’s overarching development plans. These include the Vision 2030, the NCCAP, and the current ‘5000+ MW in 40 months initiative’. Geothermal power has the potential to provide reliable, cost-competitive, baseload power with a small carbon footprint, and reduces vulnerability to climate by diversifying power supply away from hydropower, which currently provides the majority of Kenya’s electricity. Kenya has set out ambitious targets for geothermal energy. It aims to expand its geothermal power production capacity to 5,000 MW by 2030, with a medium-term target of installing 1,887 MW by 2017. As of October 2014, Kenya has an installed geothermal capacity of approximately 340 MW. Although there is significant political will and ambition, reaching these ambitions is a major challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cdkn.org/resource/nama-geothermal-power-lessons-kenya/?loclang=en_gb|title=INSIDE STORY: Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) to accelerate geothermal power: Lessons from Kenya - Climate and Development Knowledge Network|work=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
{{Main article|Nuclear energy in Kenya}}
In 2017, the Kenya Nuclear Electrification Board (Kneb) estimated that a 1,000 MW nuclear plant could be operational by 2027 and cost Ksh500-600 billion ($5-$6 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya plans nuclear plant by 2027|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya-plans-to-set-up-nuclear-plant-by-2027/2560-4215876-14gd00jz/index.html |website=The East African|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en-UK|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2010 Former Energy and Petroleum Ministry PS Patrick Nyoike&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Office of public communications:Partick Nyoike |url=http://www.communication.go.ke/ministry.asp?personid=77 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100921165128/http://communication.go.ke/ministry.asp?personid=77 |archivedate=21 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced, that Kenya aims to build a 1,000 MW [[Nuclear power|nuclear power plant]] between 2017–2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/business-news/81424-kenya-to-commission-first-nuclear-plant-in-2022-|title=Kenya to commission first nuclear plant in 2022|date=2013-08-06|work=archive.is |access-date=2017-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130806030856/http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/business-news/81424-kenya-to-commission-first-nuclear-plant-in-2022- |archivedate=6 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For Kenya to achieve middle-income status, Nyoike viewed nuclear energy as the best way to produce safe, clean, reliable and base load (constant supply) electricity. The projected cost using South Korean technology was US$3.5 billion.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;

[[Electric power system]]s consist of generation plants of different energy sources, transmission networks, and distribution lines. Each of these components can have environmental impacts at multiple stages of their development and use including in their construction, during the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]], and in their decommissioning and disposal. We can split these impacts into operational impacts (fuel sourcing, global atmospheric and localized pollution) and construction impacts (manufacturing, installation, decommissioning, and disposal). This page looks exclusively at the operational '''environmental impact of electricity generation'''. The page is organized by energy source and includes impacts such as water usage, emissions, local pollution, and wildlife displacement.

More detailed information on electricity generation impacts for specific technologies and on other environmental impacts of electric power systems in general can be found under the [[:Category:Environmental impact of the energy industry]].

==Water usage==
Water usage is one of the most obvious environmental impacts of electricity generation. All thermal cycles (coal, natural gas, nuclear, geothermal, and biomass) use water as a cooling fluid to drive the [[thermodynamic cycle]]s that allow electricity to be extracted from heat energy. Other energy sources such as wind and solar use water for cleaning equipment, while hydroelectricity has water usage from evaporation from the reservoirs. The amount of water usage is often of great concern for electricity generating systems as populations increase and droughts become a concern. In addition, changes in water resources may impact the reliability of electricity generation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies. NREL Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900. March 2011. By Jordan Macknick, Robin Newmark, Garvin Heath, and KC Hallett. https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The power sector in the United States withdraws more water than any other sector and is heavily dependent on available water resources. According to the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], in 2005, thermo-electric power generation water withdrawals accounted for 41 percent (201 Bgal/d) of all freshwater withdrawals. Nearly all of the water withdrawn for thermoelectric power was surface water used for once-through cooling at power plants. Withdrawals for [[irrigation]] and public supply in 2005 were 37% and 13% of all freshwater withdrawals respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kenny, J.F.; Barber, N.L.; Hutson, S.S.; Linsey, K.S.; Lovelace, J.K.; Maupin, M.A. ''Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2005''. U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1344. Reston, VA: USGS, 2009; p. 52. https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1344/&lt;/ref&gt; Likely future trends in water consumption are covered here.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS Annual Meeting 17–21 February 2011, Washington DC. Sustainable or Not? Impacts and Uncertainties of Low-Carbon Energy Technologies on Water. Dr Evangelos Tzimas, European Commission, JRC Institute for Energy, Petten, Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of water usage of electricity generation distinguish between water withdrawal and water consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]], “withdrawal” is defined as the amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for use, while “consumption” refers to the amount of water that is evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops, or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both water withdrawal and consumption are important environmental impacts to evaluate.

General numbers for fresh water usage of different power sources are shown below.

Steam-cycle plants (nuclear, coal, NG, solar thermal) require a great deal of water for cooling, to remove the heat at the steam condensers. The amount of water needed relative to plant output will be reduced with increasing [[boiler]] temperatures. Coal- and gas-fired boilers can produce high steam temperatures and so are more efficient, and require less cooling water relative to output. Nuclear boilers are limited in steam temperature by material constraints, and solar is limited by concentration of the energy source.&lt;!-- Needs some citation --&gt;

Thermal cycle plants near the ocean have the option of using [[seawater]]. Such a site will not have cooling towers and will be much less limited by environmental concerns of the discharge temperature since dumping heat will have very little effect on water temperatures. This will also not deplete the water available for other uses.  [[Nuclear power in Japan]] for instance, uses no cooling towers at all because all plants are located on the coast. If dry cooling systems are used, significant water from the water table will not be used. Other, more novel, cooling solutions exist, such as sewage cooling at the [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station]].

Hydroelectricity's main cause of water usage is both evaporation and seepage into the water table.

==Fossil fuels==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2018|section}}

{{Main|Fossil fuel}}
{{See also|Environmental impact of the oil shale industry}}
Most electricity today is generated by burning fossil fuels and producing [[steam]] which is then used to drive a [[steam turbine]] that, in turn, drives an [[electrical generator]].

Such systems allow electricity to be generated where it is needed, since fossil fuels can readily be transported. They also take advantage of a large infrastructure designed to support consumer [[automobile]]s. The world's supply of fossil fuels is large, but finite. Exhaustion of low-cost fossil fuels will have significant consequences for energy sources as well as for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and many other things. Various estimates have been calculated for exactly when it will be exhausted (see [[Peak oil]]). New sources of fossil fuels keep being discovered, although the rate of discovery is slowing while the difficulty of extraction simultaneously increases.

More serious are concerns about the emissions that result from [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|fossil fuel burning]]. Fossil fuels constitute a significant repository of [[carbon]] buried deep underground. Burning them results in the conversion of this carbon to [[carbon dioxide]], which is then released into the atmosphere. The estimated CO2 emission from the world's electrical power industry is 10 billion tonnes yearly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071114163448.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in an increase in the Earth's levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which enhances the [[greenhouse effect]] and contributes to [[global warming]]. The linkage between increased carbon dioxide and global warming is well accepted, though fossil-fuel producers vigorously contest these findings.

Depending on the particular fossil fuel and the method of burning, other emissions may be produced as well.  [[Ozone]], sulfur dioxide, [[Nitrogen oxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and other gases are often released, as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]]. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides contribute to [[smog]] and [[acid rain]]. In the past, plant owners addressed this problem by building very tall [[flue-gas stack]]s, so that the pollutants would be diluted in the atmosphere. While this helps reduce local contamination, it does not help at all with global issues.

Fossil fuels, particularly [[coal]], also contain dilute [[radioactive]] material, and burning them in very large quantities releases this material into the environment, leading to low levels of local and global [[radioactive contamination]], the levels of which are, ironically, higher than a [[nuclear power station]] as their radioactive contaminants are controlled and stored.

Coal also contains traces of toxic heavy elements such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]] and others. Mercury vaporized in a power plant's [[boiler]] may stay suspended in the atmosphere and circulate around the world. While a substantial inventory of mercury exists in the environment, as other man-made emissions of mercury become better controlled, power plant emissions become a significant fraction of the remaining emissions. Power plant emissions of mercury in the United States are thought to be about 50 tons per year in 2003, and several hundred tons per year in [[Electric power industry in China|China]]. Power plant designers can fit equipment to power stations to reduce emissions.

According to Environment Canada:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The electricity sector is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues. Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and acid rain and the formation of fine particulate matter. It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit carbon dioxide, which may contribute to climate change. In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species. In particular, hydro dams and transmission lines have significant effects on water and biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/energie-energy/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=C00AD28F-1|title=Electricity Generation |accessdate=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coal mining practices in the United States have also included [[surface mining|strip mining]] and [[mountaintop removal mining|removing mountain tops]]. Mill tailings are left out bare and have been leached into local rivers and resulted in most or all of the rivers in coal producing areas to run red year round with sulfuric acid that kills all life in the rivers.

The efficiency of some of these systems can be improved by cogeneration and geothermal ([[combined heat and power]]) methods. Process steam can be extracted from steam turbines. [[Waste heat]] produced by [[thermal]] generating stations can be used for space heating of nearby buildings. By combining electric power production and heating, less fuel is consumed, thereby reducing the environmental effects compared with separate heat and power systems.

==Switching from fuels to electricity==
Electric cars burn no petroleum, thereby shifting any environmental impact from the car user to the electric utility. In [[Energy in South Africa|South Africa an electric]] car, will be powered by coal generated electricity and harm the environment. In [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway an electric]] car will be powered by hydroelectricity and be harmless. Electric cars by themselves are neither beneficial or harmful, it depends how your region generates electricity.

Homeowners can get 90% efficiency using natural gas to heat their home. Heat pumps are very efficient and burn no natural gas, shifting the environmental impacts from homeowners to electric utilities. Switching from natural gas to electricity in Alberta Canada burns natural gas and coal at about a 40% efficiency to supply the heat pump. In Quebec Canada where electric resistance heating is common, the heat pump will use 70% less hydroelectricity. Heat pumps may be beneficial for the environment or not, it depends how your region generates electricity.

==Nuclear power==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2018|section}}
[[Image:Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]] - a plant that cools by direct use of ocean water, not requiring a cooling tower]]
{{Main|Environmental effects of nuclear power}}
{{See also|Nuclear power debate}}
Nuclear power plants do not burn fossil fuels and so do not directly emit carbon dioxide; because of the high energy yield of nuclear fuels, the carbon dioxide emitted during mining, enrichment, fabrication and transport of fuel is small when compared with the carbon dioxide emitted by fossil fuels of similar energy yield.

A large nuclear power plant may reject waste heat to a natural body of water; this can result in undesirable increase of the water temperature with adverse effect on aquatic life.

Emission of radioactivity from a nuclear plant is controlled by regulations. Abnormal operation may result in release of radioactive material on scales ranging from minor to severe, although these scenarios are very rare.

Mining of uranium ore can disrupt the environment around the mine. Disposal of spent fuel is controversial, with many proposed long-term storage schemes under intense review and criticism. Diversion of fresh or spent fuel to weapons production presents a risk of [[nuclear proliferation]]. Finally, the structure of the reactor itself becomes radioactive and will require decades of storage before it can be economically dismantled and in turn disposed of as waste.

==Renewable energy==
Renewable power technologies can have significant environmental benefits. Unlike [[coal]] and [[natural gas]], they can generate electricity and fuels without releasing significant quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, however the greenhouse gas savings from a number of [[biofuel]]s have been found to be much less than originally anticipated, as discussed in the article [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels]].

Both solar and wind have been criticized from an aesthetic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, methods and opportunities exist to deploy these renewable technologies efficiently and unobtrusively: fixed solar collectors can double as [[noise barrier]]s along highways, and extensive roadway, parking lot, and roof-top area is currently available; [[photovoltaic cell|amorphous photovoltaic cells]] can also be used to tint windows and produce energy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of renewable energy also argue that current infrastructure is less aesthetically pleasing than alternatives, but sited further from the view of most critics.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
{{more citations needed|date=January 2018|section}}
{{Main|Hydroelectricity#Advantages_and_disadvantages}}
The major advantage of conventional [[hydroelectric]] [[dams]] with [[reservoirs]] is their ability to store potential power for later electrical production. The combination of a natural supply of energy and production on demand has made hydro power the largest source of renewable energy by far. Other advantages include longer life than fuel-fired generation, low operating costs, and the provision of facilities for water sports.  Some dams also operate as pumped-storage plants balancing supply and demand in the generation system. Overall, hydroelectric power can be less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear energy, and areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry.

However, in addition to the advantages above, there are several disadvantages to dams that create [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs|large reservoirs]].  These may include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, release of [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|significant amounts of carbon dioxide]] at construction and flooding of the reservoir, disruption of aquatic ecosystems and bird life, adverse impacts on the river environment, potential risks of sabotage and terrorism, and in rare cases catastrophic failure of the dam wall.

Some dams only generate power and serve no other purpose, but in many places large reservoirs are needed for flood control and/or irrigation, adding a hydroelectric portion is a common way to pay for a new reservoir. Flood control protects life/property and irrigation supports increased agriculture. Without power turbines, the downstream river environment would improve in several ways, however dam and reservoir concerns would remain unchanged.

[[Small hydro]] and [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] are two low impact alternatives to hydroelectric reservoirs, although they may produce [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent power]] due to a lack of stored water.

====Tidal====
{{further|Tidal power#Environmental concerns}}

=====Tidal turbines=====

Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted and are typically placed near the bottom of the water column.

The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. Because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment such as dolphins and whales). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting [[sediment]] processes. Depending on the size of the project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment build up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tidal barrage=====

[[Tidal barrage]]s are dams built across the entrance to a bay or estuary that captures potential tidal energy with turbines similar to a conventional hydrokinetic dam. Energy is collected while the height difference on either side of the dam is greatest, at low or high tide. A minimum height fluctuation of 5 meters is required to justify the construction, so only 40 locations worldwide have been identified as feasible.

Installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the bay or [[estuary]], affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats. Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

===Biomass===
{{further|Biomass#Environmental impact}}

Electrical power can be generated by burning anything which will combust. Some electrical power is generated by burning crops which are grown specifically for the purpose. Usually this is done by fermenting plant matter to produce [[ethanol]], which is then burned. This may also be done by allowing organic matter to decay, producing [[biogas]], which is then burned. Also, when burned, wood is a form of biomass fuel.

Burning biomass produces many of the same emissions as burning fossil fuels. However, growing biomass captures carbon dioxide out of the air, so that the net contribution to global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is small.

The process of growing biomass is subject to the same environmental concerns as any kind of [[agriculture]]. It uses a large amount of land, and [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s may be necessary for cost-effective growth. Biomass that is produced as a by-product of agriculture shows some promise, but most such biomass is currently being used, for plowing back into the soil as fertilizer if nothing else.

===Wind power===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wind turbine]] --&gt;
{{Main|Environmental effects of wind power}}

====Onshore wind====

Wind power harnesses mechanical energy from the constant flow of air over the surface of the earth. Wind power stations generally consist of [[wind farm]]s, fields of [[wind turbine]]s in locations with relatively high winds. A primary publicity issue regarding wind turbines are their older predecessors, such as the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm]] in California. These older, smaller, wind turbines are rather noisy and densely located, making them very unattractive to the local population. The downwind side of the turbine does disrupt local low-level winds. Modern large wind turbines have mitigated these concerns, and have become a commercially important energy source. Many homeowners in areas with high winds and expensive electricity set up small wind turbines to reduce their electric bills.

A modern wind farm, when installed on agricultural land, has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all energy sources:&lt;ref name=sustain&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf Why Australia needs wind power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101080556/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |date=1 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It occupies less land area per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated than any other renewable energy conversion system, and is compatible with grazing and crops.
* It generates the energy used in its construction within just months of operation.
* Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by its construction are small and declining. There are no emissions or pollution produced by its operation.
* Modern wind turbines rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per minute) that they are rarely a hazard to birds.&lt;ref name=sustain/&gt;

Landscape and heritage issues may be a significant issue for certain wind farms. However, when appropriate planning procedures are followed, the heritage and landscape risks should be minimal. Some people may still object to wind farms, perhaps on the grounds of aesthetics, but there is still the supportive opinions of the broader community and the need to address the threats posed by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tai.org.au/documents/dp_fulltext/DP91.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225091609/http://www.tai.org.au/documents/dp_fulltext/DP91.pdf |date=25 February 2012 }} Wind Farms
The facts and the fallacies&lt;/ref&gt;

====Offshore wind====

Offshore wind is similar to terrestrial wind technologies, as a large [[windmill]]-like turbine located in a fresh or saltwater environment. Wind causes the blades to rotate, which is then turned into [[electricity]] and connected to the grid with cables. The advantages of offshore wind are that winds are stronger and more consistent, allowing turbines of much larger size to be erected by vessels. The disadvantages are the difficulties of placing a structure in a dynamic ocean environment.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

The turbines are often scaled-up versions of existing land technologies. However, the foundations are unique to offshore wind and are listed below:

=====Monopile foundation=====

Monopile foundations are used in shallow depth applications (0–30 m) and consist of a pile being driven to varying depths into the seabed (10–40 m) depending on the soil conditions. The pile-driving construction process is an environmental concern as the noise produced is incredibly loud and propagates far in the water, even after mitigation strategies such as bubble shields, slow start, and acoustic cladding. The footprint is relatively small, but may still cause scouring or artificial reefs. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=====Tripod fixed bottom=====

Tripod fixed bottom foundations are used in transitional depth applications (20–80 m) and consist of three legs connecting to a central shaft that supports the turbine base. Each leg has a pile driven into the seabed, though less depth is necessary because of the wide foundation. The environmental effects are a combination of those for monopile and gravity foundations.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=====Gravity foundation=====

Gravity foundations are used in shallow depth applications (0–30 m) and consist of a large and heavy base constructed of steel or concrete to rest on the seabed. The footprint is relatively large and may cause scouring, artificial reefs, or physical destruction of habitat upon introduction. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=====Gravity tripod=====

Gravity tripod foundations are used in transitional depth applications (10–40 m) and consist of two heavy concrete structures connected by three legs, one structure sitting on the seabed while the other is above the water. As of 2013, no offshore windfarms are currently using this foundation. The environmental concerns are identical to those of gravity foundations, though the scouring effect may be less significant depending on the design.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=====Floating structure=====

Floating structure foundations are used in deep depth applications (40–900 m) and consist of a balanced floating structure moored to the seabed with fixed cables. The floating structure may be stabilized using buoyancy, the mooring lines, or a ballast. The mooring lines may cause minor scouring or a potential for collision. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

===Geothermal power===
{{Main|Geothermal power}}

Geothermal energy is the heat of the Earth, which can be tapped into to produce electricity in power plants. Warm water produced from geothermal sources can be used for industry, agriculture, bathing and cleansing. Where underground steam sources can be tapped, the steam is used to run a steam turbine. Geothermal steam sources have a finite life as underground water is depleted. Arrangements that circulate surface water through rock formations to produce hot water or steam are, on a human-relevant time scale, renewable.

While a geothermal power plant does not burn any fuel, it will still have emissions due to substances other than steam which come up from the geothermal wells. These may include [[hydrogen sulfide]], and carbon dioxide. Some geothermal steam sources entrain non-soluble minerals that must be removed from the steam before it is used for generation; this material must be properly disposed. Any (closed cycle) steam power plant requires cooling water for [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s; diversion of cooling water from natural sources, and its increased temperature when returned to streams or lakes, may have a significant impact on local ecosystems.

Removal of ground water and accelerated cooling of rock formations can cause earth tremors. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) fracture underground rock to produce more steam; such projects can cause earthquakes. Certain geothermal projects (such as one near Basel, Switzerland in 2006) have been suspended or canceled owing to objectionable seismicity induced by geothermal recovery.&lt;ref name=Fairley10&gt;Peter Fairley, ''Earthquakes Hinder Green Energy Plans'', ''IEEE Spectrum'',ISSN 0018-9235, Volume 48 No. 10 (North American edition), April 2011 pp. 14-16&lt;/ref&gt; However, risks associated with "hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes, and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring" and "should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the Hot Rock geothermal energy resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA11478.pdf |title=Induced Seismicity and Geothermal Power Development in Australia |author=Geoscience Australia |publisher=Australian Government |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143551/http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA11478.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar power===
{{Main|Solar power}}

Currently solar photovoltaic power is used primarily in Germany and Spain where the governments offer financial incentives. In the U.S., Washington State also provides financial incentives. Photovoltaic power is also more common, as one might expect, in areas where sunlight is abundant.

It works by converting the sun's radiation into direct current (DC) power by use of [[photovoltaic]] cells. This power can then be converted into the more common AC power and fed to the [[Electrical grid|power grid]].

Solar photovoltaic power offers a viable alternative to fossils fuels for its cleanliness and supply, although at a high production cost. Future technology improvements are expected to bring this cost down to a more competitive range.

Its negative impact on the environment lies in the creation of the solar cells which are made primarily of [[silica]] (from sand) and the extraction of silicon from silica may require the use of fossil fuels, although newer manufacturing processes have eliminated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Solar power carries an upfront cost to the environment via production, but offers clean energy throughout the lifespan of the solar cell.

Large scale electricity generation using photovoltaic power requires a large amount of land, due to the low [[power density]] of photovoltaic power. Land use can be reduced by installing on buildings and other built up areas, though this reduces efficiency.

===Concentrated solar power===
{{Main|Concentrated solar power}}

Also known as [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], this technology uses various types of mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce heat. This heat is used to generate electricity in a standard [[Rankine cycle]] turbine. Like most thermoelectric power generation, this consumes water. This can be a problem, as solar powerplants are most commonly located in a desert environment due to the need for sunlight and large amounts of land. Many concentrated solar systems also use exotic fluids to absorb and collect heat while remaining at low pressure. These fluids could be dangerous if spilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/27/news/mn-12205 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Storage Tank at Solar Power Plant in Desert Explodes; Immediate Area Is Evacuated | date=27 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negawatt power==
{{Main|Negawatt power}}

Negawatt power refers to investment to reduce electricity consumption rather than investing to increase supply capacity. In this way investing in Negawatts can be considered as an alternative to a new power station and the costs and environmental concerns can be compared.

Negawatt investment alternatives to reduce consumption by improving efficiency include:
* Providing customers with energy efficient lamps - low environmental impact
* Improved thermal insulation and airtightness for buildings - low environmental impact
* Replacing older industrial plant - low environmental impact. Can have a positive impact due to reduced emissions.

Negawatt investment alternatives to reduce peak electrical load by time shifting demand include:
* [[Storage heater]]s - older systems had asbestos. Newer systems have low environmental impact.
* [[Demand response]] control systems where the electricity board can control certain customer loads - minimal environmental impact
* [[Thermal storage]] systems such as ice storage systems to make ice during the night and store it to use it for air conditioning during the day - minimal environmental impact
* [[Pumped storage hydroelectricity]] - can have a significant environmental impact - see [[Hydroelectricity]]
* other [[Grid energy storage]] technologies - impact varies

Note that time shifting does not reduce total energy consumed or system efficiency; however, it can be used to avoid the need to build a new power station to cope with a peak load.

The '''February 1969 nor'easter''' was a severe [[winter storm]] that affected the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]] between February 8 and February 10.&lt;ref name="Kocin1"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nor'easter]] developed on February 8, and as it moved towards the northeast, intensifying to become a powerful storm. The system dropped paralyzing snowfall, often exceeding {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}}. [[New York City]] bore the brunt of the storm, suffering extensive disruption. Thousands of travelers became stranded on roads and in airports. Overall, at least 94 people lost their lives to the storm. Following the event, the mayor of New York, [[John Lindsay]], was criticized for failing to respond to the snowstorm adequately. Some areas of the city remained uncleared for over a week after the storm, and city schools were closed for several days.

==Synoptic history==
An [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] moved generally eastward from [[Oklahoma]] and produced heavy rains from [[Missouri]] to [[Ohio]] on February 8. By February 9, it had reached [[Kentucky]]. A new, secondary low pressure system formed over [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] along the [[warm front]] associated with the primary low. As the secondary low matured along the [[U.S. East Coast]], the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the [[Mid-Atlantic States]], and heavy snow began to fall from [[New Jersey]] northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.&lt;ref name="Kocin1"/&gt;

The primary low dissipated, and the secondary low continued to intensify as it moved northeastward from the [[North Carolina]] coast to [[Long Island]]. Its forward motion slowed substantially, leading to increased precipitation totals over land. By 0000 UTC on February 10, the storm deepened to 970 [[millibars]], having strengthened 32 millibars in an 18-hour period. At 1200 UTC, it was situated off [[Cape Cod]], still an intense cyclone.&lt;ref name="Kocin1"/&gt; On February 11, the storm moved out of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NOAA Central Library Data Imaging Project|title=Daily Weather Maps for February 11, 1969|date=February 11, 1969|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=January 8, 2010|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/1969/19690210-19690216.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Miniskirts in snow storm.jpg|left|thumb|Empty streets of New York City during the storm. This scene is in [[Manhattan]]]]
The storm produced paralyzing snowfall from New Jersey through most of New England. Forecasts severely underestimated the duration of the storm, often predicting just a chance of snow.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Own Moritz |title=Winter of Discontent: Lindsay's Snowstorm, 1969 |date=October 22, 1998 |publisher=''[[The New York Daily News]]'' |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/10/22/1998-10-22_winter_of_discontent_lindsay.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230231446/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/10/22/1998-10-22_winter_of_discontent_lindsay.html |archivedate=December 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest totals—often exceeding {{convert|42|in|cm|abbr=on}}—were reported in the [[Bangor, Maine]] area with [[Lewiston, Maine]] topping {{convert|32|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

New York City was struck particularly hard by the storm. [[Central Park]] reported {{convert|15|in|cm}} of snow, and [[John F.

==Aftermath==
Following the storm, then-mayor [[John Lindsay]] was criticized for not dealing with the snow adequately. Portions of the city remained unplowed a week after the nor'easter, leading the mayor into "political misfortune".&lt;ref name="Kocin1"/&gt; Lindsay's visit to Queens was poorly received, and his limousine had trouble driving through the streets of [[Rego Park]]. The mayor was booed by residents of [[Kew Gardens Hills]]. The storm became known as the "Lindsay Snowstorm", and created a political crisis;&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; as a result, Lindsay lost the Republican primary for the next mayoral election.&lt;ref name="storm"&gt;Waugh, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay was able to win the mayoral election by running on a third-party ticket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.3/lizzi.html|title=The History Cooperative|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2012-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202085609/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.3/lizzi.html|archivedate=2008-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was politically weakened by the crisis.

The storm also had an economic impact. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and [[American Stock Exchange]] (AMEX) closed as a result of the storm. It was the first time in history that the NYSE closed for a full day due to the weather, and the first time since 1918 that AMEX had done so. All [[commodity exchanges]] in New York City and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] also closed.&lt;ref name="economic effects"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|title=NYSE, Amex boards closed by snowstorm|date=February 10, 1969|publisher=''The Montreal Gazette''|accessdate=January 8, 2010|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hX4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ILkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2384,2283683&amp;dq=snowstorm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FPT1fueltestPhebus.png|right|thumb|450px|This is a false colour tomography picture of a bundle (FPT1) of 18 irradiated fuel rods (23 GWd/tU mean burn-up) degraded under steam as part of the PHEBUS set of experiments. The black and blue is for areas of low density while red is an area of high density. It can be seen that the fuel has failed mechanically and has formed a pool near the bottom of the bundle, the bottom of the bundle did not melt.]]

A '''fuel element failure''' is a rupture in a [[nuclear reactor]]'s fuel cladding that allows the nuclear fuel or [[fission product]]s, either in the form of dissolved [[radioisotope]]s or [[hot particle]]s, to enter the [[Nuclear reactor coolant|reactor coolant]] or storage water.

The ''de facto'' standard [[nuclear fuel]] is [[uranium dioxide]] or a mixed uranium/[[plutonium dioxide]]. This has a higher melting point than the [[actinide]] metals.  Uranium dioxide resists corrosion in water and provides a stable matrix for many of the fission products; however, to prevent fission products (such as the noble gases) from leaving the uranium dioxide matrix and entering the coolant, the pellets of fuel are normally encased in tubes of a corrosion-resistant metal alloy (normally [[Zircaloy]] for water-cooled reactors).

Those elements are then assembled into bundles to allow good handling and cooling.  As the fuel [[nuclear fission|fissions]], the radioactive [[fission product]]s are also contained by the cladding, and the entire fuel element can then be disposed of as [[nuclear waste]] when the reactor is refueled.

If, however, the cladding is damaged, those fission products (which are not immobile in the uranium dioxide matrix) can enter the reactor coolant or storage water and can be carried out of the core, into the rest of the primary cooling circuit, increasing contamination levels there.

In the [[European Union|EU]], some work has been done in which fuel is overheated in a special research reactor named PHEBUS. During these experiments the emissions of radioactivity from the fuel are measured and afterwards the fuel is subjected to [[Post Irradiation Examination]] to discover more about what happened to it.

==Controversy==
In November 2015, a group led by P. Pietrukowicz published a paper arguing against the existence of Galaxy X. These authors argued that the four stars were not actually Cepheid variable stars and that their distances might be very different than claimed in the discovery paper of Chakrabarti et al. On this basis, the authors stated that "there is no evidence for a background dwarf galaxy".&lt;ref name=Pietrukowicz-2015/&gt; However the galaxy is still regarded to exist by others, with the stars being examined to be actual Cepheids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k5lCWKNvZg |title= The Dark Mystery of Galaxy X |author= SciShow Space |date= 5 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gallium phosphate''' (GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or gallium orthophosphate) is a colorless trigonal crystal with a hardness of 5.5 on the [[Mohs scale]].  GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is isotypic with [[quartz]], possessing very similar properties, but the [[silicon]] atoms are alternately substituted with [[gallium]] and [[phosphorus]], thereby doubling the [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]].  GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has many advantages over quartz for technical applications, like a higher [[electromechanical coupling coefficient]] in [[crystal oscillator|resonators]], due to this doubling.
Contrary to quartz, GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not found in nature.  Therefore, a [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal]] process must be used to synthesize the crystal.

==Modifications==
GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; possesses, in contrast to quartz, no α-β [[phase transition]], thus the low temperature structure (structure like α-quartz) of GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is stable up to 970°C, as are most of its other physical properties.  Around 970°C another phase transition occurs which changes the low quartz structure into another structure similar with [[cristobalite]].

==Structure==
The specific structure of GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows the arrangement of tetrahedrons consisting of GaO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; that are slightly tilted.  Because of the helical arrangement of these tetrahedrons, two modifications of GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exist with different [[optical rotation]] ([[Chirality (chemistry)|left and right]]).

==Sources==
GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; does not occur in nature; thus it must be grown synthetically.  Presently, only one company in Austria produces these crystals commercially.

==History and technical importance==
[[piezoelectric sensor|Pressure sensors]] based on quartz have to be cooled with water for applications at higher temperatures (above 300°C).  Starting in 1994 it was possible to substitute these big sensors with miniaturized, non cooled ones, based on GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Further exceptional properties of GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  for applications at high temperatures include its nearly temperature independent piezo effect and excellent [[electrical insulation]] up to 900°C.  For bulk resonator applications, this crystal exhibits [[crystal oscillator|temperature compensated cuts]] of up to 500°C while having [[crystal oscillator|Q factors]] comparable with quartz. Due to these material properties, GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  is very suitable for [[piezoelectric sensor|piezoelectric pressure sensors]] at high temperatures and for high temperature [[microbalance]].

The '''Generalized Maxwell model''' also known as the '''Maxwell–Wiechert model''' (after [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and E&amp;nbsp;Wiechert&lt;ref name=Wiechert1&gt;Wiechert, E (1889); "Ueber elastische Nachwirkung", Dissertation, Königsberg University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiechert2&gt;Wiechert, E (1893); "Gesetze der elastischen Nachwirkung für constante Temperatur", Annalen der Physik, 286, 335–348, 546–570&lt;/ref&gt;) is the most general form of the linear model for [[viscoelasticity]]. In this model several [[Maxwell material|Maxwell elements]] are assembled in parallel. It takes into account that the [[Relaxation time|relaxation]] does not occur at a single time, but in a set of times.  Due to the presence of molecular segments of different lengths, with shorter ones contributing less than longer ones, there is a varying time distribution.  The Wiechert model shows this by having as many spring–dashpot Maxwell elements as are necessary to accurately represent the distribution.  The figure on the right shows the generalised Wiechert model.&lt;ref name=Roylance&gt;Roylance, David (2001); "Engineering Viscoelasticity", 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tschoegl&gt;Tschoegl, Nicholas W. (1989); "The Phenomenological Theory of Linear Viscoelastic Behavior", 119-126&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gluaiseacht for Global Justice''' is an Irish environmental, peace and [[social justice]] group. ''Gluaiseacht'' ({{IPA-ga|ˈɡl̪ˠuəʃəxt̪ˠ}} means "movement" in the [[Irish language]].  The group believes in [[non-violent]] resistance to the current form of [[capitalist]] [[globalisation]]. It was originally a network of Ecological and One World Societies at universities and colleges throughout [[Ireland]]. It is a member of the [[Irish Environmental Network]].

Gluaiseacht has been involved in [[anti-nuclear protests]] at the [[Vanguard-class submarine|Trident submarine]] base in [[Faslane]], [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2001/1022/breaking31.html MEP McKenna arrested at Scottish base]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-mep-and-students-arrested-during-big-antinuclear-protest-at-scottish-base-330441.html Irish MEP and students arrested during big anti-nuclear protest at Scottish base]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sellafield]] nuclear plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2001/1219/breaking65.html Irish protestors due at opening of MOX plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2002/0214/breaking57.html Eleven Irish arrested at Sellafield protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">In [[grid (electricity)|electrical grids]], a power system network integrates [[Electric power transmission|transmission grids]], [[Electricity distribution|distribution grids]], distributed generators and loads that have connection points called busses.  A bus in home [[circuit breaker panel]]s is much smaller than those used on the grid, where [[busbar]]s can be 50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter in [[electrical substation]]s.  Traditionally, these grid connections are unidirectional [[Link (telecommunications)#Point-to-multipoint|point to multipoint]] links.  In [[distributed generation]] grids, these connections are bidirectional, and the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Features in [[smart grid]]s are designed to manage these conditions.

A premises is generally said to have obtained ''grid connection'' when its service location becomes powered by a live connection to its service transformer.

A [[power station]] is generally said to have achieved ''grid connection'' when it first supplies power outside of its own boundaries. However, a town is only said to have achieved ''grid connection'' when it is connected to several [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] sources, generally involving long-distance transmission.

==Balancing Authority, Tie Facility and Interconnection==
A balancing autorithy is the responsible entity that integrates resource plans ahead of time, maintains load-interchange-generation balance within a Balancing Authority Area, and supports Interconnection frequency in real time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://openei.org/wiki/Definition:Balancing_Authority Balancing Authority  Glossary of Terms Used in Reliability Standards], [[OpenEI]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmission facility(ies) are interconnecting Balancing Authority Areas. Interconnection consists of one or more balancing area authorities that balance demand and generation within certain geographic areas of the interconnection. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63037.pdf Balancing Area Coordination] - [[NREL]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ionized-air glow''' is the [[fluorescent]] emission of characteristic blue–purple–violet light, of color called [[Electric blue (color)|electric blue]], by [[air]] subjected to an energy flux. &lt;!-- not sure if the name is correct. move the article to better name if you have better idea. --&gt;

==Processes==
When energy is deposited to air, the air molecules become excited. As air is composed primarily of [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], excited N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules are produced. These can react with other molecules, forming mainly [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen(II) oxide]]. [[Water vapor]], when present, may also play a role; its presence is characterized by the hydrogen emission lines. The reactive species present in the plasma can readily react with other chemicals present in the air or on nearby surfaces.

===Deexcitation of nitrogen===
The excited nitrogen deexcites primarily by emission of a photon, with emission lines in ultraviolet, visible, and infrared band:
:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''hν''
The blue light observed is produced primarily by this process.&lt;ref name="inorgch"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&amp;pg=PA1655&amp;dq=blue+glow+air+radiation&amp;num=50&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=blue%20glow%20air%20radiation&amp;f=false Inorganic chemistry] by Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman, p. 1655, Academic Press, 2001,
{{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectrum is dominated by lines of single-ionized nitrogen, with presence of neutral nitrogen lines.

===Deexcitation of oxygen===
The excited state of oxygen is somewhat more stable than nitrogen. While deexcitation can occur by emission of photons, more probable mechanism at atmospheric pressure is a chemical reaction with other oxygen molecules, forming [[ozone]]:&lt;ref name="inorgch"/&gt;
: O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction is responsible for the production of ozone in the vicinity of strongly radioactive materials and electrical discharges.

==Occurrence==
Excitation energy can be deposited in air by a number of different mechanisms:
* [[Ionizing radiation]] is the cause of blue glow surrounding sufficient quantities of strongly [[radioactive]] materials in air, e.g. some [[radioisotope]] specimens (e.g. [[radium]] or [[polonium]]), [[particle beam]]s (e.g. from [[particle accelerator]]s) in air, the blue flashes during [[criticality accident]]s, and the eerie/low brightness "purple" to "blue" glow enveloping the [[mushroom cloud]] during the first several dozen seconds after [[nuclear explosion]]s near sea level. An effect that has been observed only at night from [[Nuclear weapons testing|atmospheric nuclear test]]s owing to its low brightness, with observers noticing it following the pre-dawn [[Trinity (test)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webofstories.com/play/robert.christy/9  The Trinity Test: 'An eery and awesome sight' by Robert Christy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/christy-robert.pdf National Academy of Sciences, Robert F.

* Within minutes after the steam explosion that caused the [[Chernobyl accident]] at 01:23 local time, a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. One such survivor, [[Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster#Yuvchenko|Alexander Yuvchenko]], recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a "very beautiful" [[LASER]]-like beam of [[light blue|light bluish]] light, caused by the ionization of air, that appeared to [[space|flood up into infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/cherno-alexander_yuvchenko.htm |title=Cheating Chernobyl This interview was first published in New Scientist print edition Source : New Scientist web site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pripyat.com/en/articles/chernobyl-20-years.html |title=Chernobyl 20 years on}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dry air, the color of produced light (e.g. by lightning) is dominated by the emission lines of nitrogen, yielding the spectrum with primarily blue emission lines. The lines of neutral nitrogen (NI), neutral oxygen (OI), singly ionized nitrogen (NII) and singly ionized oxygen (OII) are the most prominent features of a lightning emission spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VOGZs1G3ZYIC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=lightning+spectrum+hydrogen#v=onepage&amp;q=lightning%20spectrum%20hydrogen&amp;f=false Lightning] by Martin A. Uman, p. 139, Courier Dover Publications, 1984 {{ISBN|0-486-64575-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutral nitrogen radiates primarily at one line in red part of the spectrum. Ionized nitrogen radiates primarily as a set of lines in blue part of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyV-kXVFDyUC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=lightning+spectrum+hydrogen#v=onepage&amp;q=lightning%20spectrum%20hydrogen&amp;f=false All about lightning] by Martin A. Uman, p. 96, Courier Dover Publications, 1986 {{ISBN|0-486-25237-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest signals are the 443.3, 444.7, and 463.0&amp;nbsp;nm lines of singly ionized nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leonardo.met.tamu.edu/people/faculty/orville/PDF/1975_Spectrum_Lightning.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violet hue can occur when the spectrum contains emission lines of atomic hydrogen. This may happen when the air contains high amount of water, e.g. with lightnings in low altitudes passing through [[rain]] [[thunderstorm]]s. Water vapor and small water droplets ionize and dissociate easier than large droplets, therefore have higher impact on color.&lt;ref name="physfor"/&gt;

===Ionized air glow vs Čerenkov radiation===
Despite the similarity of light color produced, the Čerenkov radiation is generated by a fundamentally different mechanism.

[[Cherenkov radiation|Čerenkov radiation]] is produced by charged particles which are traveling through a [[dielectric]] substance at a speed greater than the [[speed of light]] in that medium. The only types of charged particle radiation produced in the process of a [[criticality accident]] ([[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactions) are [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, [[positron]]s (which all come from the radioactive decay of unstable [[Decay product|daughter products]] of the fission reaction) and energetic ions which are the daughter products themselves. Of these, only beta particles have sufficient penetrating power to travel more than a few centimeters in air. Since [[air]] is a very low [[density]] material, its [[index of refraction]] (around ''n''=1.0002926) differs very little from that of a vacuum (''n''=1) and consequently the speed of light in air is only about 0.03% slower than its speed in a vacuum. Therefore, a beta particle emitted from decaying fission products would need to have a velocity greater than 99.97% ''[[Speed of light|c]]'' in order to produce Čerenkov radiation. Because the energy of beta particles produced during nuclear decay do not exceed energies of about 20 [[MeV]] (20.6 MeV for [[boron|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;B]] is likely the most energetic with 17.9 MeV for [[Sodium|&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na]] being the next highest energy beta emitter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/indx_dec.jsp Decay Radiation Search]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the energy needed for a beta particle to attain 99.97% c is 21.1 MeV &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Biggl({m_ec^2\over{\sqrt{1 -{1\over{n^2}}}}} \ \approx\  3.385\times10^{-12}\mathrm{J}\ =\ 21.12\ \mathrm{MeV}\Biggr)&lt;/math&gt;, the possibility of Čerenkov radiation produced in air via a fission criticality or a radioactive decay is virtually eliminated.

Čerenkov radiation can be however readily observed in more optically dense environments, ''e.g.'' in [[water]] or in transparent solids.

KAMINI is cooled and moderated by light water, and fueled with uranium-233 metal produced by the [[thorium fuel cycle]] harnessed by the neighbouring [[FBTR]] reactor. 

{{As of|2006}}, it is the world’s only [[Thorium-based nuclear power|thorium-based experimental reactor]].

KAMINI was the first and is currently the only reactor in the world designed specifically to use [[Uranium-233]] fuel. Use of the large [[Thorium]] reserves to produce [[Nuclear fuel]] is a [[India's three-stage nuclear power programme|key strategy of India's nuclear energy program]].

For energy production, the kite is operated in consecutive "pumping cycles" with alternating reel-out and reel-in phases:&lt;ref name="rolfchapter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uwechapter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fechner|first1=Uwe|last2=Schmehl|first2=Roland|date=2018|contribution=Flight Path Planning in a Turbulent Wind Environment|editor-last1=Schmehl|editor-first1=Roland|title=Airborne Wind Energy|series=Green Energy and Technology|pages=361-390|publisher=Springer|location=Singapore|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-1947-0_15}}&lt;/ref&gt; during reel-out the kite is flown in crosswind maneuvers (transverse to the incoming wind, commonly figure of eight patterns). This creates a large pulling force which is used to pull the tether from a ground-based drum that is connected to a generator. 
In this phase electricity is generated. Once the maximum tether length is reached, the kite is reeled back, but this time depowered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmehl|first1=Roland|title=Simulated de-powering of a LEI tube kite for power generation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2wGbwT9Ws|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that it can be retracted with a low aerodynamic resistance. This phase consumes a small fraction of the previously generated power such that in total net energy is produced. The electricity is buffered by a rechargeable battery unit, or, in a kite park configuration, several systems can be operated with phase shifts such that the battery capacity can be reduced.&lt;ref name="pietrochapter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faggiani|first1=Pietro|last2=Schmehl|first2=Roland|date=2018|contribution=Design and Economics of a Pumping Kite Wind Park|editor-last1=Schmehl|editor-first1=Roland|title=Airborne Wind Energy|series=Green Energy and Technology|pages=391-411|publisher=Springer|location=Singapore|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-1947-0_16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Koundi et le jeudi national''''' is a 2010 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
[[Koundi]] is a large village with around 1,200 inhabitants, located in [[Cameroon]]'s [[East Region (Cameroon)|East Province]]. Aware of Koundi's richness in timber, the villagers decide to use it to alleviate poverty. They organise a union, the Organisation for Communal Interests, and create a [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantation over several hectares to be able to depend on themselves. They also institute "National Thursday": Once a month, they all work on the development of the cocoa plantation. Village life is shown through the prism of self-management.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; limits the mass of the favored dark matter candidate, WIMPs, that interact via the weak interaction to &lt;math&gt;\approx 2&lt;/math&gt; GeV. This bound arises as follows. The lower the mass of WIMPs is, the lower the annihilation cross section, which is of the order &lt;math&gt;\approx m^2/M^4&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the WIMP mass and ''M'' the mass of the Z-boson. This means that low mass WIMPs, which would be abundantly produced in the early universe, freeze out (i.e. stop interacting) much earlier and thus at a higher temperature, than higher mass WIMPs. This leads to a higher relic WIMP density. If the mass is lower than &lt;math&gt;\sim 2&lt;/math&gt; GeV the WIMP relic density would overclose the universe.

Some of the few loopholes allowing one to avoid the Lee-Weinberg bound without introducing new forces below the electroweak scale have been ruled out by accelerator experiments (i.e. [[CERN]], [[Tevatron]]), and in decays of [[B meson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

A viable way of building light dark matter models is thus by postulating new light bosons. This increases the annihilation cross section and reduces the coupling of dark matter particles to the Standard Model making them consistent with accelerator experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

== Motivation ==

In recent years, light dark matter has become popular due in part to the many benefits of the theory. Sub-GeV dark matter has been used to explain the positron excess in the [[galactic center]] observed by [[INTEGRAL]], excess [[gamma rays]] from the galactic center &lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="836">A '''light non-aqueous phase liquid''' (LNAPL) is a [[groundwater]] contaminant that is not soluble in water and has lower [[density]] than [[water]], in contrast to a [[DNAPL]] which has higher density than water. Once a LNAPL infiltrates the ground, it will stop at the height of the [[water table]] because the LNAPL is less dense than water. Efforts to locate and remove LNAPLs is relatively less expensive and easier than for DNAPLs because LNAPLs float on top of the water in the underground water table.

Examples of LNAPLs are [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylene]], and other [[hydrocarbons]].

== Genetic markers ==
{{main|Genetic marker}}
In genetics, a '''molecular marker''' (identified as [[genetic marker]]) is a fragment of [[DNA]] that is associated with a certain location within the [[genome]]. Molecular markers are used in molecular biology and biotechnology to identify a particular sequence of DNA in a pool of unknown DNA.

=== Types of genetic markers ===

There are many types of genetic markers, each with particular limitations and strengths. Within genetic markers there are three different categories: "First Generation Markers", "Second Generation Markers", and "New Generation Markers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Molecular Markers: History, Features and Applications |last=Maheswaran |first=M. |date=2004 |journal=Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of markers may also identify dominance and co-dominance within the genome.&lt;ref name="articles.extension.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Traditional Molecular Markers - eXtension |url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/32356/traditional-molecular-markers |website=articles.extension.org |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying dominance and co-dominance with a marker may help identify heterozygotes from homozygotes within the organism. Co-dominant markers are more beneficial because they identify more than one allele thus enabling someone to follow a particular trait through mapping techniques. These markers allow for the amplification of particular sequence within the genome for comparison and analysis.

Molecular markers are effective because they identify an abundance of genetic linkage between identifiable locations within a chromosome and are able to be repeated for verification. They can identify small changes within the mapping population enabling distinction between a mapping species, allowing for segregation of traits and identity. They identify particular locations on a chromosome, allowing for physical maps to be created. Lastly they can identify how many alleles an organism has for a particular trait (bi allelic or poly allelic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Molecular Markers: History, Features and Applications |last=Maheswaran |first=M. |date=August 2014 |journal=Advanced Biotech |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genomic markers as mentioned, have particular strengths and weakness, so, consideration and knowledge of the markers is necessary before use. For instance, a RAPD marker is dominant (identifying only one band of distinction) and it may be sensitive to reproducible results. This is typically due to the conditions in which it was produced. RAPD's are used also under the assumption that two samples share a same locus when a sample is produced.&lt;ref name="articles.extension.org"/&gt; Different markers may also require different amounts of DNA. RAPD's may only need 0.02ug of DNA while an RFLP marker may require 10ug of DNA extracted from it to produce identifiable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/19/default.asp |title=Molecular Breeding and Marker-Assisted Selection |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12 |website=International Service For The Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications |publisher=ISAAA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently, SNP markers have turned out to be a potential tool in breeding programs in several crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Contreras-Soto RI, Mora F, de Oliveira MAR, Higashi W, Scapim CA, Schuster I (|first=|year=2017|title=A Genome-Wide Association Study for Agronomic Traits in Soybean Using SNP Markers and SNP-Based Haplotype Analysis|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=2|pages=1–22|via=Web of Sciences|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0171105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mapping of genetic markers ==
Molecular mapping aids in identifying the location of particular markers within the genome. There are two types of maps that may be created for analysis of genetic material. First, is a physical map, that helps identify the location of where you are on a chromosome as well as which chromosome you are on. Secondly there is a linkage map that identifies how particular genes are linked to other genes on a chromosome. This linkage map may identify distances from other genes using (cM) centiMorgans as a unit of measurement. Co-dominant markers can be used in mapping, to identify particular locations within a genome and can represent differences in phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mapping with molecular markers |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21962/ |date=2000-01-01 |first=Anthony JF |last=Griffiths |first2=Jeffrey H. |last2=Miller |first3=David T. |last3=Suzuki |first4=Richard C. |last4=Lewontin |first5=William M. |last5=Gelbart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linkage of markers can help identify particular polymorphisms within the genome. These polymorphisms indicate slight changes within the genome that may present nucleotide substitutions or rearrangement of sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Molecular Linkage Maps |url=http://forages.oregonstate.edu/tallfescuemonograph/genomic_tools/techniques/linkage_maps |website=forages.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When developing a map it is beneficial to identify several polymorphic distinctions between two species as well as identify similar sequence between two species.

== Application in plant sciences ==
When using molecular markers to study the genetics of a particular crop, it must be remembered that markers have restrictions. It should first be assessed what the genetic variability is within the organism being studied. Analyze how identifiable particular genomic sequence, near or in candidate genes. Maps can be created to determine distances between genes and differentiation between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/19/default.asp |title=Molecular breeding and marker-assisted selection |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12 |website=International Service For The Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications |publisher=ISAAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic markers can aid in the development of new novel traits that can be put into mass production. These novel traits can be identified using molecular markers and maps. Particular traits such as color, may be controlled by just a few genes. Qualitative traits (requires less that 2 genes) such as color, can be identified using MAS (marker assisted selection). Once a desired marker is found, it is able to be followed within different filial generations. An identifiable marker may help follow particular traits of interest when crossing between different genus or species, with the hopes of transferring particular traits to offspring.

One example of using molecular markers in identifying a particular trait within a plant is, Fusarium head blight in wheat. Fusarium head blight can be a devastating disease in cereal crops but certain varieties or offspring or varieties may be resistant to the disease. This resistance is inferred by a particular gene that can be followed using MAS (Marker Assisted Selection) and QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular markers and their applications in cereals breeding |last=Korzun |first=Viktor |date= |journal=Session I: MAS in Plants |doi= |pmid= |url=http://www.fao.org/biotech/docs/korzun.pdf |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; QTL's identify particular variants within phenotypes or traits and typically identify where the GOI (Gene of interest) is located. Once the cross has been made, sampling of offspring may be taken and evaluated to determine which offspring inherited the traits and which offspring did not. This type of selection is becoming more beneficial to breeders and farmers because it is reducing the amount of pesticides, fungicides and insecticides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another way to insert a GOI is through mechanical or bacterial transmission. This is more difficult but may save time and money.

=== Applications of markers in cereal breeding ===

# Assessing variability of genetic differences and characteristics within a species.
# Identification and fingerprinting of genotypes.
# Estimating distances between species and offspring.
# Identifying location of QTL's.
# Identification of DNA sequence from useful candidate genes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Application ===
It has 5 applications in fisheries and aquaculture:
#Species Identification 
#Genetic variation and population structure study in natural populations 
#Comparison between wild and hatchery populations 
#Assessment of demographic bottleneck in natural population
#markers assisted breeding 

== Biochemical markers ==
[[Biochemical marker]]s are generally the protein marker. These are based on the change in the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule. The most important protein marker is [[alloenzyme]]. alloenzymes are variant forms of an enzyme that are coded by different alleles at the same locus and this alloenzymes differs from species to species. So for detecting the variation alloenzymes are used. These markers are type-i markers.

Advantages:
*Co-dominant markers.
*Less price.
Disadvantages:
*Require prior information.
*Low polymorphism power.
Applications:
*Linkage mapping.
*Population studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5070">'''Output transformerless''' ('''OTL''') is a type of [[vacuum tube]] audio [[power amplifier]], which omits an [[Transformer types#Audio transformer|output transformer]] for the purpose of greater linearity and fidelity. Conventional vacuum tube amplifier designs rely upon an output transformer to couple the amplifier's output stage to the [[loudspeaker]]. Instead, OTLs use one of two primary methods for output stage coupling: direct coupling (DC) or capacitive coupling (AC).

== Additional definitions ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
There is some contention with respect to applying the broader term "OTL" to capacitively coupled designs and variants. The need to delineate these designs from their directly coupled counterparts has led to the informal adoption of several additional terms, including:

* OCL (output capacitorless) — distinguishes OTL designs lacking an output coupling capacitor (directly coupled)
* DC-OTL — denotes a directly coupled design; synonymous with OCL
* AC-OTL — denotes an AC (capacitively) coupled design
* Z-OTL — denotes a small class of variants, based on US Patent 5,612,646.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berning|first1=David|title=ZOTL Pre One Audio Preamplifier|url=http://davidberning.com/products/preone|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While strictly speaking not transformerless, it  avoids a bulky audio frequency transformer and its frequency restrictions, and essentially modulates the high impedance output of a vacuum stage with a high frequency carrier so it can pass through a small multi-winding high frequency transformer to be applied to a low impedance speaker load.

== Differentiation of designs ==

=== By coupling methods: direct versus capacitive coupling and variants ===

Background: The output coupling method of a vacuum tube amplifier generally serves two basic purposes:

* Negation (blocking) of high DC voltages in the output section to prevent a damaging flow of direct electric current through the loudspeaker.
* Matching the relatively high output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the conventional vacuum tube to the relatively low impedance of conventional loudspeakers.

==== Direct coupled designs ====

In direct coupled OTL designs, both the necessary blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and the selection of vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker. Typically, direct coupled OTL amplifiers will have a user-adjustable DC offset control, which allows the user to trim off any residual DC voltage residing at the amplifier's output terminals prior to operation. Servo-controlled variants also exist.

==== Capacitively coupled designs ====

Like the direct coupled designs, capacitively coupled designs rely on the selection of tube types with a sufficiently low impedance to effect the transfer of power to the loudspeaker. However, unlike direct coupled designs, capacitively coupled designs do not have inherent DC blocking by virtue of their topology. Instead, DC voltage in the output section is blocked by an ''output coupling capacitor'' - typically a large-value (3000-6000μF) electrolytic capacitor - which is interposed between the amplifier's output section and the loudspeaker.

=== By output section topology ===

There are several practical approaches to the design of an OTL amplifier's output section, each with their own respective strengths and weaknesses. While certain topologies lend themselves well to direct coupling, others are more suitable for capacitive coupling. The various designs in service may thus be grouped based upon their common output section topologies. Common topologies include:

* ''Futterman'' type and variants (Examples: Counterpoint, Fourier, Julius Futterman, New York Audio Labs (NYAL), Prodigy Audio Labs., Silvaweld et al.)
* ''[[Circlotron]]'' type (Examples: Atma-Sphere Music Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[[Atma-Sphere Music Systems, Inc|Atma-Sphere's]] patented technology [http://www.atma-sphere.com/Resources/OTLs_Defined.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Joule Electra, Tenor et al.)
* ''Totem-pole'' type (Many examples, including SEPP and the White Cathode Follower)
* ''H-bridge'' type (Few examples)
* ''Single-ended'' type (Examples: Transcendent Sound SE-OTL, various low-power headphone amplifiers)

== OTL Applications ==

OTL power amplifiers for driving loudspeakers require multiple tubes in parallel to obtain the required drive current.  An alternative is to use high impedance loudspeakers (now rare, but the Philips produced 400 and 800 ohm speakers, such as type number: AD4690/M800).

OTL headphone amplifiers are more common, as typical headphones require the current that a single pair of tubes can provide.

OTL designs are sometimes also used when [[Line driver|driving long communication or interconnect cables]], when a predictable and low output impedance is required.

'''Overpressure''' (or '''blast overpressure''') is the pressure caused by a [[shock wave]] over and above normal [[atmospheric pressure]].  The shock wave may be caused by [[sonic boom]] or by [[explosion]], and the resulting overpressure receives particular attention when measuring the [[effects of nuclear weapon]]s or [[thermobaric bomb]]s.

== Effects of overpressure ==

According to an article in the journal [[Toxicological Sciences]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Blast overpressure (BOP), also known as high energy impulse noise, is a damaging outcome of explosive detonations and firing of weapons. Exposure to BOP shock waves alone results in injury predominantly to the hollow organ systems such as auditory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems."&lt;ref&gt;"Pulmonary Biochemical and Histological Alterations after Repeated Low-Level Blast Overpressure Exposures",
Nabil M. Elsayed, and Nikolai V. Gorbunov, Toxicological Sciences, 2007 95(1):289-296 , online version 2006, http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/95/1/289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An [[bomb suit|EOD suit]] worn by [[bomb disposal]] experts can protect against the deadly effects of BOP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Real-life Hurt Locker: how bomb-proof suits work |first=John |last=Pavlus |date=March 4, 2010 |url=http://dvice.com/archives/2010/03/hurt-locker-sui.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overpressure calculation for an enclosed space ==
Overpressure in an enclosed space is determined using "Weibull's formula":&lt;ref&gt;Hans R. W. Weibull (October 1968) "Pressures recorded in partially closed chambers at explosion of TNT charges" ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''152''' (1) :  357-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4474052.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = 2410 \left( {m \over V} \right)^{0.72}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*2410 is a constant based on {{convert|1|bar|kPa psi|lk=on}}
*&lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; = [[net explosive mass]] calculated using all explosive materials and their relative effectiveness
*&lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; = volume of given area (primarily used to determine volume within an enclosed space)

In [[physics]], '''Peek's law''' defines the electric potential gap necessary for triggering a [[corona discharge]] between two wires:

&lt;!--:&lt;math&gt;e_v = m_v g_v \delta r \ln \left ({S \over r} \right )&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;e_v = m_v g_v r \ln \left ({S \over r} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

''e''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the "visual critical corona voltage" or "corona inception voltage" (CIV), the voltage &lt;!--(in kilovolts) {unit is a nonsense if you do not provide an actual numerical quantity or the unit of the rest of the quatities} --&gt; required to initiate a visible corona discharge between the wires.

''m''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is an irregularity factor to account for the condition of the wires.  For smooth, polished wires, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.  For roughened, dirty or weathered wires, 0.98 to 0.93, and for [[electrical cable|cable]]s, 0.87 to 0.83, namely the surface irregularities result in diminishing the corona threshold voltage. 

''r'' is the [[radius]] of the wires in cm.

''S'' is the distance between the center of the wires.

''g''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the "visual critical" [[electric field]], and is given by:

&lt;!--::&lt;math&gt;g_v = g_0 \delta \left ( 1 + {0.301 \over \sqrt{\delta r}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;g_v = g_0 \delta \left ( 1 + {c \over \sqrt{\delta r}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

δ is the air density factor &lt;!--It is calculated by the equation:
:: &lt;math&gt;\delta = {3.92 b \over 273 + t}&lt;/math&gt;
: where
:* ''b'' = pressure in centimeters of mercury
:* ''t'' = temperature in degrees Celsius

: At --&gt;with respect to [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|SATP]] (25°C and 76 [[cmHg]]):

&lt;!--::&lt;math&gt;\delta = {3.92\cdot76 \over 273 + 25} = 1&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\delta = {\rho \over \rho_{SATP}}&lt;/math&gt;

''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the "disruptive electric field."

''c'' is an empirical dimensional constant.

: The values for the last two parameters are usually considered to be about 30-32 [[kilovolt|kV]]/[[centimeter|cm]] (in air) and 0.301 cm&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. This latter law can be considered to hold also in different setups, where the corresponding voltage is different due to geometric reasons.

'''Polydioctylfluorene''' (PFO) is an [[organic compound]], a [[polymer]] of [[9,9-dioctylfluorene]], with formula (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is an [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] [[conductive polymer]] that characteristically emits blue light.&lt;ref name=palilis&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leonidas C. Palilis |author2=David G. Lidzey |author3=Michael Redecker |author4=Donal D. C. Bradley  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1999 | title = Bright and efficient blue light-emitting diodes based on conjugated polymer blends | journal = Proc. SPIE | volume = 3797 | pages = 383 | doi = 10.1117/12.372734}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Like other [[polyfluorene]] polymers, it has been studied as a possible material for [[light-emitting diode]]s

==Structure==
The [[monomer]] has an [[aromatic compound|aromatic]] [[fluorene]] core -C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;- with two [[alkane|aliphatic]] [[octane|''n''-octyl]] -C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; tails attached to the central carbon. Polydioctylfluorene (PFO) can be found in liquid-crystalline, glassy, [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], semi-crystalline or β-chain formation. This variety is on account of the intermolecular forces that PFO can participate in. The secondary forces present in PFO are typically [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]], which are relatively weak. These weak forces makes it a solid that can also be used as a film on a substrate. The glassy films formed by PFO chains form solutions in good solvents, meaning it is at least partially [[Solubility|soluble]]. These van der Waals also add complexity to the microstructure of PFO, which is why it has a wide range of solid formations. The solid formations though, typically form low density due to the low cooling rate of the polymer.  The density of polydioctylfluorene is measured by using the process of [[ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp049631w | volume=108 | title=Joint Theoretical and Experimental Characterization of the Structural and Electronic Properties of Poly(dioctylfluorene-alt-N-butylphenyl diphenylamine) | journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | pages=5594–5599 | last1 = Sancho-García | first1 = J. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chain stiffness is also prominent in PFO, because of this it is predicted that the molecular weight is a factor of 2.7 lower than [[polystyrene]], which can produce an approximation of 190 repeat units in a standard PFO chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/polb.23601 | volume=53 | title=Interplay between solid state microstructure and photophysics for poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) within oriented polyethylene hosts | journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics | pages=22–38 | last1 = Perevedentsev | first1 = Aleksandr}}&lt;/ref&gt; By changing the strain and temperature applied to the polymer’s structure results in an alteration of the PFO’s properties.  Thermal treatment such as friction transfer can be applied to the structure, this is a way to alter the properties.  The friction transfer aligns the structure to become crystalline or liquid crystalline.  Polymer 196 is the most commonly studied type of polydioctylfluorene.  In studies, polymer 196 has shown the most promising properties and the best crystallinity.  Within the crystal structure of polymer 196 octyl side chains are inserted between the layer of the polymer to provide more space for efficiency in structuring the material.

In studies, the structure of polydioctylfluorene was observed by using [[Grazing incidence diffraction|grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction]] after applying friction to the structure.  Experiments revealed PFO was present in crystalline films and liquid crystalline after cooling and use of friction.  As a result of the friction exerted, twofold symmetry in PFO was broken.  The friction transfer used to obtain a single crystal film is important in the process of fabricating polarized light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/pj/journal/v39/n12/abs/pj2007177a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Polydioctylfluorene, can also be known as polymer 196 to polyfluorene. The molar mass of PFO ranges between 24,000-41,600 (g/mol)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=m8D-dHddKywC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=poly+dioctylfluorene+melting+point&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRFBidyluq&amp;sig=TCa_YuOzLah1OJuMraiU8n-_ksE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwA2oVChMIo6_Z qYnhyAIVi20-Ch1TBg1K#v=onepage&amp;q=poly%20dioctylfluorene%20melting%20point&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this varying molar mass, many other properties vary as well. For example, the [[glass transition]] temperature can fall somewhere between 72-113 degrees Celsius. The absolute wavelength emitted by PFO can range between 386-389&amp;nbsp;nm in a solution of CHCl3, and falls around 389 in a solution of THF. The absolute film wavelength of PFO though falls between 380-394&amp;nbsp;nm. The melting point of a crystalline molecule of PFO is predicted to be about 150 degrees Celsius.

There have also been reports that some of the solid states of polydioctylfluorene are composted in sheet-like layers which are about 50-100&amp;nbsp;nm thick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150119/ncomms6977/full/ncomms6977.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these sheets, the glassy and semicrystalline states can be formed (excluding amorphous, liquid crystalline, and beta chain states).  When cooled quickly, the chains tightly align, giving PFO a close [[Atomic packing factor|packing factor]], though because of the high complexity of the chains, this sometimes gets messy and creates the amorphous state. The parts of the molecule that add this complexity are the carbon rings (that are located in the backbone) making the molecule overall large in size.

==Applications==
The formation of beta-phase chains in PFO can be formed through [[dip-pen nanolithography]], to represent wavelength changes in [[metamaterial]]s. The dip-pen technique allows a scale of 500&amp;nbsp;nm &gt; to be visible. The beta chains can be converted into the glassy films by adding extra stress to the main fluorine backbone unit, whether beta chains are formed is determined by peaks in wavelength absorption. Beta chains can also be confirmed to be present by using [[solvent]] to non-solvent mixtures. If the molecule were to be dipped into this mixture for ten seconds, the chains with no dissolution of films are able to produce these said beta chains.

Polydioctylfluorene is a polymer light-emitting device known as PLED, which covalently bonds to the carbon hydrogen chains. PFO is a [[copolymer]] of basic polyfluorene, which enables it to release [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] light. This basic fluorene backbone strengthens the molecule on account of the carbon rings.The cross-linking in polydioctylfluorene structure provides an efficient technique for hole-transport layers to emit light.  Also, when a solvent-polymer compound is added the β-phase crystalline structure to be maintained.  Efficiency in current can reach a maximum of about 17&amp;nbsp;cd/A and maximum luminance obtained can be approximately 14,000&amp;nbsp;cd/m(2).  The hole-transport layers (HTLs) improve the polymer’s anode hole injection and greatly increase electron blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15740157 | doi=10.1021/ja044455q | volume=127 | title=High-performance hole-transport layers for polymer light-emitting diodes.

Soc. | pages=3172–83 |vauthors=Yan H, Lee P, Armstrong NR, Graham A, Evmenenko GA, Dutta P, Marks TJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By having the capability to control the microstructure of phase domains gives an opportunity to optimize the [[Optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] properties of PFO based products.  When needs for optoelectronic emittance are reached in polydioctylfluorene, the [[electroluminescence]] given off in dependent on the active layer in the conjugate polymer.  Another way to affect the optoelectronic properties is by altering how dense the phase chain segments are ordered. Low densities can be achieved from tremendously slow crystallization while on the other hand directional crystalline solution can be achieved by use of thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/25742/1/Perevedentsev-A-2015-PhD-thesis.pdf Chain conformation and the photophysics of polyfluorenes]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14100">A '''power purchase agreement''' ('''PPA'''), or '''electricity power agreement''', is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller) and one which is looking to purchase electricity (the buyer). The PPA defines all of the commercial terms for the sale of electricity between the two parties, including when the project will begin commercial operation, schedule for delivery of electricity, penalties for under delivery, payment terms, and termination. A PPA is the principal agreement that defines the revenue and credit quality of a generating project and is thus a key instrument of project finance. There are many forms of PPA in use today and they vary according to the needs of buyer, seller, and financing counter parties.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Thumann, Eric A. Woodroof Energy Project Financing: Resources and Strategies for Success - 2009- Page 93 "WHAT IS A POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (PPA)? A power purchase agreement is a long-term agreement to buy power from a company that produces electricity. A third-party financier will provide the capital to build, operate, and ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Carmichael, Paul H. Rosenfield ''Accountants' Handbook, Special Industries and Special Topics'' 2003 Page 38 "The fact that an agreement is labeled a “power purchase agreement” is not conclusive. If a contract “conveys the right to use property, plant and equipment,” the contract should be accounted for as a lease. Other power purchase contracts.."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A '''power purchase agreement''' (PPA) is a legal contract between an electricity generator (provider) and a power purchaser (buyer, typically a utility or large power buyer/trader).  Contractual terms may last anywhere between 5 and 20 years, during which time the power purchaser buys energy, and sometimes also capacity and/or ancillary services, from the electricity generator.  Such agreements play a key role in the financing of independently owned (i.e. not owned by a [[public utility|utility]]) electricity generating assets. The seller under the PPA is typically an independent power producer, or "IPP."

In the case of [[distributed generation]] (where the generator is located on a building site and energy is sold to the building occupant), commercial PPAs have evolved as a variant that enables businesses, schools, and governments to purchase electricity directly from the generator rather than from the utility. This approach facilitates the financing of distributed generation assets such as photovoltaic, micro-turbines, reciprocating engines, and fuel cells.

== Parties involved ==

=== The seller ===
Under a PPA, the seller is the entity that owns the project. In most cases, the seller is organized as a [[special purpose entity]] whose main purpose is to facilitate [[Nonrecourse debt|non-recourse]] [[project financing]].

=== The buyer ===
Under a PPA, the buyer is typically a utility or a company that purchases the electricity to meet its customers' needs. In the case of distributed generation involving a commercial PPA variant, the buyer may be the occupant of the building—a business, school, or government for example. Electricity traders may also enter into PPA with the Seller.

== Regulation in the United States ==

In the United States, PPAs are typically subject to regulation by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC). FERC determines which facilities  applicable for PPAs under the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].&lt;ref name="FERC"&gt;"[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/fed-sta/ene-pol-act.asp FERC]." FERC.gov. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; PPAs facilitate the financing of distributed generation assets such as photovoltaic, microturbines, reciprocating engines, and fuel cells.

PPAs are typically subject to regulation at the state and federal level to varying degrees depending on the nature of the PPA and the extent to which the sale of electricity is regulated where the project is sited. In the U.S., FERC determines which facilities are considered to be exempt wholesale generators (EWG) or qualifying facilities and are applicable for PPAs under the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]].&lt;ref name="FERC"/&gt;

== Where appropriate ==
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) may be appropriate where:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PPPIRC|title=PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|url=http://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/ppp-sector/energy-power/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the projected revenue of the project is uncertain and so some guarantees as to quantities purchased and price paid are required to make the project viable;
* protection from cheaper or subsidized domestic or international competition (e.g., where a neighboring power plant is producing cheaper power) is desired;
* there is one or a few major customers that will be taking the bulk of the product - for example, a government may be purchasing the power generated by a power plant - the government will want to understand how much it will be paying for its power and that it has the first call on that power, the project company will want certainty of revenue;
* purchaser wishes to secure security of supply.
* with '''solar power''' projects in non-profit companies in order to reduce costs for installation of the solar energy system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-ca.org/article/how-convert-your-hoa-solar-power-4-simple-steps#solarpowerpurchaseagreement|title=Convert Your HOA to Solar Power with These Four Steps - Educational Community for Homeowners (ECHO)|author=|date=|website=www.echo-ca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing ==
The PPA is often regarded as the central document in the development of independent electricity generating assets (power plants). Because it defines the revenue terms for the project and credit quality, it is key to obtaining non-recourse project financing.

One of the key benefits of the PPA is that by clearly defining the output of the generating assets (such as a solar electric system) and the credit of its associated revenue streams, a PPA can be used by the PPA provider to raise non-recourse financing&lt;ref&gt;"[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Non-Recourse+Finance Free Online Dictionary: Non-Recourse Finance]." TheFreeDictionary.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; from a bank&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.people.hbs.edu/besty/projfinportal/glossary.htm Financial Glossary]." People.hbs.edu. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or other financing counterparty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/counterparty Free Online Dictionary: Counterparty]." TheFreeDictionary.com. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contract timeline ==

=== Effective date ===
The PPA is considered contractually binding on the date that it is signed, also known as the [[effective date]]. Once the project has been built, the effective date ensures that the purchaser will buy the electricity that will be generated and that the supplier will not sell its output to anyone else except the purchaser.&lt;ref name="AGMRC"&gt;"[http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/WindPowerPurchaseAgreements_E4AEB5E96D0B5.pdf#P AGMRC]." AGMRC.org. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial operation ===
Before the seller can sell electricity to the buyer, the project must be fully tested and commissioned to ensure reliability and comply with established commercial practices.  The commercial operation date is defined as the date after which all testing and commissioning has been completed and is the initiation date to which the seller can start producing electricity for sale (i.e. when the project has been substantially completed).  The commercial operation date also specifies the period of operation, including an end date that is contractually agreed upon.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;

=== Preemptive termination date ===
Typically, termination of a PPA ends on the agreed upon commercial operation period.  A PPA may be terminated if abnormal events occur or circumstances result that fail to meet contractual guidelines.  The seller has the right to curtail the delivery of energy if such abnormal circumstances arise, including natural disasters and uncontrolled events.  The PPA may also allow the buyer to curtail energy in circumstances where the after-tax value of electricity changes.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;
When energy is curtailed, it is usually because one of the parties involved was at fault, which results in paid damages to the other party.  This may be excused in extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters and the party responsible for repairing the project is liable for such damages.  In situations where liability is not defined properly in the contract, the parties may negotiate [[force majeure]] to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;

== Operation and metering ==
Maintenance and operation of a generation project is the responsibility of the seller.  This includes regular inspection and repair, if necessary, to ensure prudent practices.  Liquidated damages will be applied if the seller fails to meet these circumstances.  Typically, the seller is also responsible for installing and maintaining a meter to determine the quantity of output that will be sold.  Under this circumstance, the seller must also provide real-time data at the request of the buyer, including atmospheric data relevant to the type of technology installed.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;

== Sales ==

=== Delivery point ===
The PPA will distinguish where the sale of electricity takes place in relation to the location of the buyer and seller.  If the electricity is delivered in a "busbar" sale, the delivery point is located on the high side of the transformer adjacent to the project.  In this type of transaction, the buyer is responsible for transmission of the energy from the seller.  Otherwise, the PPA will distinguish another delivery point that was contractually agreed on by both parties.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;

=== Pricing ===
Electricity rates are agreed upon as the basis for a PPA.  Prices may be flat, escalate over time, or be negotiated in any other way as long as both parties agree to the negotiation.  In a regulated environment, an Electricity Regulator will regulate the price. A PPA will often specify how much energy the supplier is expected to produce each year and any excess energy produced will have a negative impact on the sales rate of electricity that the buyer will be purchasing.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;  This system is intended to provide an incentive for the seller to properly estimate the amount of energy that will be produced in a given period of time.

=== Billing and payments ===
The PPA will also describe how invoices are prepared and the time period of response to those invoices.  This also includes how to handle late payments and how to deal with invoices that became final after periods of inactivity regarding challenging the invoice.  The buyer also has the authority to audit those records produced by the supplier in any circumstance.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt; There is a defined timeline when PPA Provider has to send an invoice to the Generator or vice versa and if that timeline is not met then it has its own consequences, which varies from one PPA Provider to another.

=== Performance terms ===
The buyer will typically require the seller to guarantee that the project will meet certain performance standards.  Performance guarantees let the buyer plan accordingly when developing new facilities or when trying to meet demand schedules, which also encourages the seller to maintain adequate records.  In circumstances where the output from the supplier fails to meet the contractual energy demand by the buyer, the seller is responsible for retributing such costs.  Other guarantees may be contractually agreed upon, including availability guarantees and power-curve guarantees.  These two types of guarantees are more applicable in regions where the energy harnessed by the renewable technology is more volatile.&lt;ref name="AGMRC" /&gt;

== Example contracts ==
A basic sample PPA between the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] and a wind power generating entity was developed as a reference for future PPAs.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bpa.gov/power/pgc/wind/EX_C_PPA_2.pdf USDOE &amp; BPA PPA]." BPA.gov. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Solar PPAs are now being successfully utilized in the California Solar Initiative's Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) program.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Solar/mash.htm MASH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113122649/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Solar/mash.htm |date=2010-11-13 }}." CPUC.CA.gov. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
This aspect of the successful CSI program was just recently opened for applications.

PPAs can be managed in the European market by service providers. The legal agreements between the statewide power sectors(seller) and the trader(buyer/who buys large quantity of power) will be treated as the PPA in power sector.

[[Data center]] owners [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]], and [[Microsoft]] have used PPAs to offset the [[Greenhouse gas|emissions]] and power usage of [[cloud computing]]. Some [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] with heavy carbon emission footprints and energy usage such as [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] have also shown interest in PPAs. In 2017, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to purchase using a PPA from the utility company [[Iberdrola]] in [[Mexico]] for 220 MW of new [[Wind power|wind farm energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21723160-american-firms-can-offset-donald-trumps-pullout-paris-big-business-sees-promise|title=Big business sees the promise of clean energy|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alitalia.a320-200.i-bikc.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[Airbus A320]] powered aircraft]]

A '''powered aircraft''' is an [[aircraft]] that uses onboard [[Air propulsion|propulsion]] with mechanical power generated by an [[aircraft engine]] of some kind.

Aircraft propulsion nearly always uses either a type of propeller, or a form of [[jet propulsion]]. Other potential propulsion techniques such as [[ornithopters]] are very rarely used.

==Methods of propulsion==

===Rotating aerofoils===

====Propeller aircraft====
[[File:Tupolev Tu-95 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[Tupolev Tu-95]]]]

A [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]] or airscrew comprises a set of small, wing-like aerofoil ''blades'' set around a central hub which spins on an axis aligned in the direction of travel.  The blades are set at a ''[[Blade pitch|pitch]]'' angle to the airflow, which may be fixed or variable, such that spinning the propeller creates aerodynamic lift, or ''thrust'', in a forward direction.

A ''[[Tractor configuration|tractor]]'' design mounts the propeller in front of the power source, while a ''[[Pusher configuration|pusher]]'' design mounts it behind.  Although the pusher design allows cleaner airflow over the wing, tractor configuration is more common because it allows cleaner airflow to the propeller and provides a better [[weight distribution]].

''[[Contra-rotating propellers]]'' have one propeller close behind another on the same axis, but rotating in the opposite direction.

A variation on the propeller is to use many broad blades to create a fan. Such fans are usually surrounded by a ring-shaped fairing or duct, as ''[[ducted fan]]s''.

Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers.

The earliest designs used [[Human-powered flight|man power]] to give [[dirigible]] balloons some degree of control, and go back to [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] in 1784. Attempts to achieve heavier-than-air man-powered flight did not succeed fully until [[Paul MacCready]]'s [[Gossamer Condor]] in 1977.
[[File:Gossamer Albatross II in flight.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gossamer Albatross]], a [[Human-powered flight|human-powered aircraft]]]]

The first powered flight of an aircraft was made in a [[steam aircraft|steam-powered]] dirigible by [[Henri Giffard]] in 1852. Attempts to marry a practical lightweight [[steam engine]] to a practical fixed-wing airframe did not succeed until much later, by which time the internal combustion engine was already dominant.

From the first controlled powered fixed-wing aircraft flight by the [[Wright brothers]] until [[World War II]], propellers turned by the [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] were virtually the only type of propulsion system in use.  The piston engine is still used in the majority of smaller aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes and slower speeds suited to propellers.

Turbine engines need not be used as jets (see below), but may be geared to drive a propeller in the form of a [[turboprop]]. Modern helicopters also typically use turbine engines to power the rotor. Turbines provide more power for less weight than piston engines, and are better suited to small-to-medium size aircraft or larger, slow-flying types. Some turboprop designs mount the propeller directly on an engine turbine shaft, and are called [[propfan]]s.

Other less common power sources include:
*Electric motors, often linked to solar panels to create a [[Electric aircraft|solar-powered aircraft]].
*Rubber bands, wound many times to store energy, are mostly used for flying models.

====Rotorcraft====
{{Main|Rotorcraft}}

Rotorcraft have spinning blades called a ''rotor'' which spins in the horizontal plane to provide lift. Forward thrust is usually obtained by angling the rotor disc slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed backwards; these are called [[helicopter]]s. Other rotorcraft are [[compound helicopter]]s and [[autogyro]]s which sometimes use other means of propulsion, such as propellers and jets.

The rotor of a helicopter may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as an internal-combustion engine or jet turbine. [[Tip jet]]s, fed by gases passing along hollow rotor blades from a centrally mounted engine, have been experimented with. Attempts have even been made to mount engines directly on the rotor tips.

===Jet propulsion===

====Jet aircraft====
{{Main|Jet aircraft}}

[[Airbreathing jet engine]]s provide thrust by taking in air, compressing the air, injecting fuel into the hot compressed air mixture in a [[combustion chamber]], the resulting accelerated exhaust ejects rearwards through a turbine which drives the compressor. The reaction against this acceleration provides the engine thrust.

[[File:Ba b777-200 g-ymmd arp.jpg|thumb|A [[jet engine|jet-engined]] [[Boeing 777]] taking off]]

Jet engines can provide much higher thrust than propellers, and are naturally efficient at higher altitudes, being able to operate above {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. They are also much more fuel-efficient at normal flight speeds than [[rocket]]s. Consequently, nearly all high-speed and high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.

The early [[turbojet]] and modern [[turbofan]] use a spinning compressor and turbine to provide thrust. Many, mostly in military aviation, add an [[afterburner]] which injects extra fuel into the hot exhaust.

Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the crude [[pulse jet engine|pulse jet]], high-speed [[ramjet]] and the still-experimental supersonic-combustion ramjet or [[scramjet]]. These mechanically simple designs require an existing airflow to work and cannot work when stationary, so they must be launched by a catapult or rocket booster, or dropped from a mother ship.

The bypass turbofan engines of the [[SR-71 Blackbird|Lockheed SR-71]] were a hybrid design – the aircraft took off and landed in jet turbine configuration, and for high-speed flight the afterburner was lit and the turbine bypassed, to create a ramjet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013|reason=Dubious, yes air is bypassed, but some is still needed to power the turbine which powers the compressor.}}

The [[motorjet]] was a very early design which used a piston engine in place of the combustion chamber, similar to a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] piston engine except that the thrust is derived from the turbine instead of the crankshaft. It was soon superseded by the turbojet and remained a curiosity.

====Rocket-powered aircraft====
{{Main|Rocket-powered aircraft}}

[[Rocket]] propulsion offers very high thrust for light weight and has no height limit, but suffers from high fuel consumption and the need to carry oxidant as well as propellant.

Rocket-powered aircraft have been experimented with, and during the Second World War the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Messerschmitt ''Komet'']] fighter was developed and used operationally. 
Since then they have been restricted to specialised niches, such as the [[Bell X-1]] which broke the sound barrier or the [[North American X-15]] which was capable of flying at extremely high altitudes at the border with space as it was not dependent on atmospheric oxygen.

Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main powerplant, typically in the case of [[rocket-assisted take off]] to give more power for a heavily loaded aircraft or reduce the takeoff run. In a number of designs such as the prototype "mixed-power" [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] a rocket was used to provide high-speed climb and speed to reach the target while a smaller turbojet provided a slower and more economical return to base.

===Ornithopter===
{{Main|Ornithopter}}
The ornithopter obtains thrust by flapping its wings. When the wing flaps, as opposed to gliding, it continues to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide a [[thrust]] component.

Working devices have been created for flight research and as prototypes, but the vertical oscillation of the fuselage, which tends to accompany the wing flapping, limits their usefulness. The only practical application is a flying [[Ornithopter#Recent developments|model hawk]] used to freeze prey animals into stillness so that they can be captured.

Toys in the form of a flying model bird are also popular.

==Methods of powering lift==
{{Main|Powered lift}}

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] obtains lift from airflow over the wing resulting from motion due to forward thrust. A few other types, such as the rotary-winged [[autogyro]], obtain lift through similar methods.

Some types use a separate power system to create lift. These include the rotary-winged [[helicopter]] and craft that use [[lift jet]]s (e.g. the [[flying bedstead]]).

A [[hot air balloon]] requires a power source (normally a gas burner) for lift, but is not normally considered a "powered aircraft".

{{Infobox roentgenium}}
'''Roentgenium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Rg''' and [[atomic number]] 111. It is an extremely radioactive [[synthetic element]] that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a [[half-life]] of 2.1&amp;nbsp;minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 10.7&amp;nbsp;minutes. Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] near [[Darmstadt]], Germany. It is named after the physicist [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] ([[Ö#O-umlaut|also spelled]] Roentgen), who discovered [[X-ray]]s.

In the [[periodic table]], it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in the [[group 11 element]]s, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[gold]] in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, [[copper]], [[silver]], and gold, although it may show some differences from them.

===Official discovery===
Roentgenium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] by an international team led by [[Sigurd Hofmann]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], on December 8, 1994.&lt;ref name=95Ho01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01291182|title=The new element 111|year=1995|author=Hofmann, S.|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik A|volume=350|pages=281–282|last2=Ninov|first2=V.|last3=Heßberger|first3=F.P.|last4=Armbruster|first4=P.|last5=Folger|first5=H.|last6=Münzenberg|first6=G.|last7=Schött|first7=H.

:{{nuclide|link=yes|Bismuth|209}} + {{nuclide|link=yes|Nickel|64}} → {{nuclide|Roentgenium|272}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|10neutron}}

This reaction had previously been conducted at the [[JINR|Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]) in 1986, but no atoms of &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Rg had then been observed.&lt;ref name=93TWG&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

===Naming===
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], roentgenium should be known as ''eka-[[gold]]''. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''unununium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uuu''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the naming of elements of atomic numbers greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[systematic element name]] as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]], until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it ''element 111'', with the symbol of ''E111'', ''(111)'' or even simply ''111''.&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt;

The name ''roentgenium'' (Rg) was suggested by the GSI team&lt;ref name="IUPAC-Rg"/&gt; in 2004, to honor the German physicist [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], the discoverer of [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-Rg"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/2004/pdf/7612x2101.pdf |title=Name and symbol of the element with atomic number 111|author=Corish|journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|date=2004|volume= 76|issue=12|pages=2101–2103|doi=10.1351/pac200476122101|last2=Rosenblatt|first2=G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was accepted by [[IUPAC]] on November 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-Rg"/&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of roentgenium}}
Roentgenium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of roentgenium have been reported with atomic masses 272, 274, 278–283, and 286 (283 and 286 unconfirmed), two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but unconfirmed [[metastable state]]s. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

===Stability and half-lives===
All roentgenium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1&amp;nbsp;minutes. (The unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 10.7&amp;nbsp;minutes, which would make it one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known; likewise, the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Rg appears to have a long half-life of about 5.1&amp;nbsp;minutes.) The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Rg and &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; The undiscovered isotope &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Rg has been predicted to be the most stable towards [[beta decay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nie |first=G. K. |arxiv=nucl-th/0512023 |title=Charge radii of β-stable nuclei |date=2005 |doi=10.1142/S0217732306020226|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|volume=21|issue=24|pages=1889–1900|bibcode = 2006MPLA...21.1889N }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; The unknown isotope &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;Rg is also expected to have a long half-life of 1&amp;nbsp;second. Before their discovery, the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, and &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1&amp;nbsp;second, 1&amp;nbsp;minute, and 4&amp;nbsp;minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, 17&amp;nbsp;seconds, and 2.1&amp;nbsp;minutes respectively. Similarly, the measured half-life of the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Rg of 5.1&amp;nbsp;minutes, while long, is less than the 10&amp;nbsp;minutes that had previously been predicted for it.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

==Predicted properties==

===Chemical===
Roentgenium is the ninth member of the 6d series of [[transition metals]]. Since [[copernicium]] (element 112) has been shown to be a [[group 12 element|group 12]] metal, it is expected that all the elements from [[rutherfordium|104]] to 111 would continue a fourth transition metal series.&lt;ref name="DoiX"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1595/147106708X297486|title=The Periodic Table and the Platinum Group Metals|date=2008|last1=Griffith|first1=W. P.|journal=Platinum Metals Review|volume=52|issue=2|pages=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations on its [[ionization potential]]s and [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] are similar to that of its lighter homologue [[gold]], thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other [[group 11 element]]s, [[copper]], [[silver]], and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Roentgenium is predicted to be a [[noble metal]]. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements, roentgenium is predicted to show stable +5 and +3 oxidation states, with a less stable +1 state. The +3 state is predicted to be the most stable. Roentgenium(III) is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold(III), but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds. Gold also forms a somewhat stable −1 state due to relativistic effects, and it has been suggested roentgenium may do so as well:&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; nevertheless, the [[electron affinity]] of roentgenium is expected to be around {{convert|1.6|eVpar|abbr=on|lk=on}}, significantly lower than gold's value of {{convert|2.3|eVpar|abbr=on}}, so roentgenides may not be stable or even possible.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; The 6d orbitals are destabilized by [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] and [[spin–orbit interaction]]s near the end of the fourth transition metal series, thus making the high oxidation state roentgenium(V) more stable than its lighter homologue [[gold(V) fluoride|gold(V)]] (known only in one compound) as the 6d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent. The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, {{chem|RgF|6|-}} is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|4|-}}, which is expected to be more stable than {{chem|RgF|2|-}}. Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seth |first1=M. |last2=Cooke |first2=F. |last3=Schwerdtfeger |first3=P. |last4=Heully |first4=J.-L. |last5=Pelissier |first5=M. |date=1998 |journal=J.

The probable chemistry of roentgenium has received more interest than that of the two previous elements, [[meitnerium]] and [[darmstadtium]], as the valence s-[[Electron shell#Subshells|subshells]] of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Calculations on the molecular compound Rg[[hydrogen|H]] show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium–hydrogen bond, even though spin–orbit interactions also weaken it by {{convert|0.7|eVpar|abbr=on}}.

It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with [[ammonia]], [[phosphine]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref name=Hancock/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
Roentgenium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the [[body-centered cubic]] structure, unlike its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] which crystallize in the [[face-centered cubic]] structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them.&lt;ref name=bcc/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 28.7&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from roentgenium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough roentgenium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, all have an outer electron configuration nd&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;(n+1)s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For each of these elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;(n+1)s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to [[spin-orbit coupling]] between the d electrons, this state is split into a pair of energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; level is stabilized to such an extent that it becomes the ground state and the 6d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance.&lt;ref name="e-conf"/&gt; The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==
Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established&lt;ref name="Düllmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Düllmann |first1=Christoph E. |date=2012 |title=Superheavy elements at GSI: a broad research program with element 114 in the focus of physics and chemistry |journal=Radiochimica Acta |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |doi=10.1524/ract.2011.1842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; For chemical studies to be carried out on a [[transactinide element|transactinide]], at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1&amp;nbsp;second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week.&lt;ref name="DoiX"/&gt; Even though the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Rg, the most stable known roentgenium isotope, is 100&amp;nbsp;seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from [[copernicium]] to [[livermorium]],&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="Düllmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eichler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eichler |first=Robert |date=2013 |title=First foot prints of chemistry on the shore of the Island of Superheavy Elements  |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1212/1212.4292.pdf |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |publisher=IOP Science |volume=420 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/420/1/012003 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |pages=012003|arxiv=1212.4292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ''n''s subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Rg and &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Rg are promising for chemical experimentation and may be produced as the granddaughters of the [[moscovium]] isotopes &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Mc respectively;&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661}}&lt;/ref&gt; their parents are the [[nihonium]] isotopes &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and &lt;sup&gt;285&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, which have already received preliminary chemical investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aksenov |first1=Nikolay V. |last2=Steinegger |first2=Patrick |first3=Farid Sh. |last3=Abdullin |first4=Yury V. |last4=Albin |first5=Gospodin A. |last5=Bozhikov |first6=Viktor I. |last6=Chepigin |first7=Robert |last7=Eichler |first8=Vyacheslav Ya. |last8=Lebedev |first9=Alexander Sh. |last9=Mamudarov |first10=Oleg N. |last10=Malyshev |first11=Oleg V. |last11=Petrushkin |first12=Alexander N. |last12=Polyakov |first13=Yury A. |last13=Popov |first14=Alexey V. |last14=Sabel'nikov |first15=Roman N. |last15=Sagaidak |first16=Igor V. |last16=Shirokovsky |first17=Maksim V. |last17=Shumeiko |first18=Gennadii Ya. |last18=Starodub |first19=Yuri S. |last19=Tsyganov |first20=Vladimir K. |last20=Utyonkov |first21=Alexey A. |last21=Voinov |first22=Grigory K. |last22=Vostokin |first23=Alexander |last23=Yeremin |first24=Sergey N. |last24=Dmitriev |date=July 2017 |title=On the volatility of nihonium (Nh, Z = 113) |journal=The European Physical Journal A |volume=53 |issue=158 |doi=10.1140/epja/i2017-12348-8|bibcode=2017EPJA...53..158A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schöningen spears''' are a set of eight wooden [[throwing spears]] from the [[Palaeolithic Age]] that were excavated between 1994 and 1998 in the [[Open-pit mining|open-cast]] [[lignite]] mine in [[Schöningen]], [[Helmstedt (district)|Helmstedt]] district, Germany, together with an associated cache of approximately 16,000 animal bones. The excavations took place  under the management of [[Hartmut Thieme]] of the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage (NLD).

Originally assessed as being between 380,000 and 400,000 years old,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Thieme, Reinhard Maier (Hrsg.): ''Archäologische Ausgrabungen im Braunkohlentagebau Schöningen.''

Ausstellungskatalog Blaubeuren 2005, S. 47-70.&lt;/ref&gt; they represent the oldest completely preserved [[hunting weapons]] of prehistoric Europe so far discovered. 
As such they predate the age of [[Neanderthal Man]] (by convention taken to emerge after 300,000 years ago), and is associated with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.
The spears support the practice of [[Paleolithic hunting|hunting]] by [[archaic humans]] in Europe in the late [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The age of the spears was estimated from their stratigraphic position, "sandwiched between deposits of the [[Elsterian]] and [[Saalian]] glaciations, and situated within a well-studied sedimentary sequence."&lt;ref&gt;Thieme, H. 1997: Lower Paleolithic hunting spears from Germany. Nature 385(27), 807-810.&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently, [[thermoluminescence dating]] of heated flints in a deposit beneath that which contained the spears suggested that the spears were between 337,000 and 300,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, D. and M. Krbetschek. 2015: The age of the Lower Paleolithic occupation at Schöningen. Journal of Human Evolution 89, 46-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and location ==
[[File:Schöningen 13 II Grabung © P. Pfarr NLD.jpg|thumb|Excavation site]]
[[File:Moon Lake shoreline - Riding Mountain National Park.JPG|thumb|The [[littoral zone]] of a lake]]
The site of the finds (Schöningen 13/II sedimentary sequence 4) is one of 13 Palaeolithic places of discovery in the open-cast, lignite mine (working area, south) that was excavated in the course of the [[Archaeological field survey|prospection]] of the [[quaternary]] surface [[Stratum|layer]] from 1992 to 2009.

The {{convert|60|by|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} excavation base that was excluded from coal mining represents a small segment of a former [[littoral zone]]. This zone has been visited over millennia, between the [[Anglian (stage)|Elster]]- and [[Wolstonian Stage|Saale]] ice ages, by humans and animals alike. The pedestal displays five massive, layered [[Sedimentation|sediment packages]] that were created by varying levels of the lake and [[silting]]-up processes.

Thanks to the quick, airtight covering of the archaeological layers by mud, the organic materials are exceptionally well preserved.  In the sequence of the sedimentary layers, [[climate change]]s can be read with a high resolution - from a warm, dry phase to airy [[deciduous forests]] to [[tundra]].
The spears themselves are from an approximately {{convert|10|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|50|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} long strip, parallel to the former lake shore in the sedimentary layer four, the late [[Hoxnian Stage|Holstein-interglacial]]. The archaeological layers beneath have only been partially excavated and have been an objective of a research [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG (German Research Association)]] since 2010.

Together with the spears, some [[stone artefact]]s, [[Stone chip|chips]] as well as over 10,000 animal bones were found, amongst them 90% horse bones, followed by [[red deer]] and [[European bison]].&lt;ref&gt;Voormolen B. 2008: Ancient Hunters, Modern Butcher Schöningen 13II -4, a kill-butchery site dating from the northwest European Lower Palaeolithic. Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; The horse bones come from ''Equus mosbachensis'' and are indicative of at least 20 individuals. They show numerous cut marks made by stone tools, but only a few bite marks made by animals. The site is interpreted by the excavator Harald Thieme as testimony of a hunting event as well as the following cutting up and preparation of the kill. According to his scenario, the thick [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] at the lake shore gave the hunters cover, from where the horses, trapped between the hunters and the lake, were culled with accurate spear throws.  Because there are bones of young animals amongst the horse bones, he concludes that the hunt took place in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Musil R. 2007: Die Pferde von Schöningen: Skelettreste einer ganzen Wildpferdherde in: Thieme H. (ed.) Die Schöninger Speere – Mensch und Jagd vor 400 000 Jahren. pp. 136-140, Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart, {{ISBN|3-89646-040-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he sees evidence of ritualistic activity, because the spears were left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Thieme H. 2007. Warum ließen die Jäger die Speere zurück? in: Thieme H. (ed.) 2007: Die Schöninger Speere – Mensch und Jagd vor 400 000 Jahren. pp. 188-190 Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart, {{ISBN|3-89646-040-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Schöningen Speer VII im Sediment 1997 © P. Pfarr NLD.jpg|thumb|A spear ''in situ'']]
The spears, deformed by the load of the [[sediment]] pressure, are made from slim, straight [[spruce]] stems – except for spear IV which is made from [[pine]] wood. The spears vary in length from {{convert|1.82|to|2.25|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}, with diameters ranging from {{convert|29|to|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.

They have been worked very thoroughly and are evidence of highly developed technological skills and of a workmanlike tradition.{{original research inline|date=December 2013}}  Like in today’s [[Javelin throw|tournament javelins]], the greatest diameter and therefore its centre of gravity is in the front third of the shaft. The tips are worked symmetrically from the base of the stems, and the end of the tips were worked beside the [[Medullary ray (botany)|medullary ray]], the weakest part of the stem, on purpose.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In their throwing qualities, the Schöningen Spears are equal to modern tournament javelins. During tests, athletes could throw replicas up to {{convert|70|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Thieme H. 1999: Altpaläolithische Holzgeräte aus Schöningen, Lkr. Helmstedt. Germania 77, pp. 451-487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golek M &amp; Rieder H 1999: Erprobung der Altpalaolithischen Wurfspeere von Schöningen in: Stadion, Internationale Zeitschrift für Geschichte des Sports Nr. XXV Academia Verlag Sankt Augustin, S. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of the wood is likely to be climatically determined, because during the cooler climate near the end of the [[interglacial]], conifers grew close to the site of the finds.&lt;ref&gt;Urban B. 2007: Interglacial Pollen Records from Schöningen, North Germany in: F. Sirocko et al. (ed.): The Climate of Past Interglacials. Development in Quaternary Science Vol.7, S. 417-444&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other discoveries ==
More unique wooden artefacts were found at the place of discovery of the wild horse hunting camp: a charred wooden staff ([[skewer]]) as well as a wooden tool, tapered at both ends, interpreted as a [[throwing stick]].&lt;ref name="Thieme"&gt;Thieme H. 1999: Altpaläolithische Holzgeräte aus Schöningen, Lkr. Helmstedt. Germania 77, S. 451-487&lt;/ref&gt; The stone tools at the place of discovery consist of different [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]-shaped and pointed forms. Evidence of [[Blank (archaeology)|blank]] production is missing; much [[Retouch (lithics)|retouched]] debris proves the reworking of the brought-along tools.

Also among the finds are the so-called "grooved wooden tools", excavated at the place of discovery No. 12. Made from the extremely hard wooden branch-bases of the [[European silver fir]], and noticeably incised at one end, they may have been used as a mounting for [[Blade (archaeology)|stone blades]]. If this interpretation is correct, they are the oldest composite tools of [[Human|mankind]].&lt;ref name="Thieme"/&gt;

Thanks to the good preservation conditions at the place of discovery, there are many finds of small animals, among them small mammals, fish, [[molluscs]] and insects. Together with the [[Fruit|carpological remains]] they make a detailed reconstruction of the [[climate]] and the environment of the passing of an interglacial period possible.

==Significance==
[[File:La Chaîne des Aravis.JPG|thumb|Seven of the spears are made of spruce (''Picea abies'') wood]]
[[File:Schöningen 13 II-4 Skelettreste © NLD + K. Cornelius.jpg|thumb|Associated bone fossils]]
The spears and the place of discovery have revolutionized the picture of the [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural and social development]] of early humans. Previously, the widespread opinion was that  ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (and [[Neanderthal]]s, regarded as a descendant of ''H. heidelbergensis'') were simple beings without language that lived on plants and [[carrion]]. The spears and their correlated finds are evidence of complex technological skills and are the first obvious proof for an active [[Big game hunting|(big game) hunt]]. It seems that ''[[H. heidelbergensis]]'' could hunt herd animals that can run faster than a human, and this suggests that they had sophisticated hunting strategies, a complex [[social structure]] and developed forms of communication (language ability). ''[[H. heidelbergensis]]'' therefore already had intellectual and cognitive skills like anticipatory planning, thinking, and acting, that up until then had only been attributed to [[Anatomically modern humans|modern humans]].&lt;ref&gt;Thieme H. 2007.

In Conard N.J. (ed.): Woher kommt der Mensch. S. 69-97. Attempto Verlag. Tübingen {{ISBN|3-89308-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the excavations on top of the excavation base continued in the framework of a project by the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage in [[Hannover]] and the Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology of the Institute of Pre- and Protohistory and Mediaeval Archaeology, supported by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Association)]]. Numerous cooperation partners domestic and abroad are involved in the reprocessing and the evaluation of the excavations: [[Rijksuniversiteit Leiden]] (paleontology), [[Leuphana University Lueneburg]] (palynologie), [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg|Senckenberg Research Institute and Nature Museum]] in Frankfurt am Main, [[Leibniz University Hannover]](geology), Institute for Quaternary Lumbers Langnau (wood anatomy), [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)|Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz]] and others.

In 2009, [[Lower Saxony]] allocated public funds from the increased funds for the economy package II for the construction of a research and development centre. The centre, close to the place of discovery, is devoted to the inter-disciplinary research of the Schöningen places of discovery, as well as to the [[Pleistocene]] archaeology, and presents the original finds in an experience-orientated, modern exhibition.  The transparent research and laboratory area as well as an interactive visitor’s laboratory link the areas “research” and “museum”. A 24 hectare outdoor area presents typical [[plant communities]] of the interglacial, among them a pasture for [[wild horse]]s. The place has been planned as an extracurricular place of learning. The [[building contractor]] was the town of Schöningen. Responsible for the conception and contextual planning was the Lower Saxony State Service of Cultural Heritage. The centre was opened at the beginning of 2013.

== Controversy ==
Archaeologists at the [[University of Tübingen]] have questioned some of the initial interpretations of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Balter, Michael. 2014. The killing ground. Science 6 June 2014: 344 (6188), 1080-1083. DOI:10.1126/science.344.6188.1080&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Isotope]] analysis and wear patterns on the horses' teeth show a wide variety of habitat and diet amongst the animals, indicating that the faunal assemblage accumulated in many small events, rather than one large slaughter. [[Soil morphology#Micromorphology|Sediment analysis]] shows that the red colour previously thought to be a result of [[hearth]]s and burning are actually iron compounds forming as the lake levels dropped in recent times. Lake algae, sponges, and small crustaceans found in the sediments show that the spears were never on dry land and that the deposit has always been submerged. These data suggest that instead of representing a big hunting event, the spears suggest less social complexity than originally suggested. They also suggest that the horses were hunted in shallow water rather than at the lake edge.

Several groups of [[tetrapods]] have undergone '''secondary aquatic adaptation''', an evolutionary transition from being purely [[Terrestrial_animal|terrestrial]] to living at least part of the time in water. These animals are called "secondarily aquatic" because although their ancestors lived on land for hundreds of millions of years, they all originally descended from aquatic animals (see [[Evolution of tetrapods]]). These ancestral tetrapods had never left the water, and were thus '''primarily aquatic''', like modern [[Fish|fishes]]. Secondary aquatic [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s tend to develop in early speciation as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, [[natural selection]] causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water.

==Anapsid==
{{main|Anapsid}}
''[[Archelon]]'' is a type of giant [[sea turtle]] dating from the [[Cretaceous]] Period, now long extinct.  Its smaller cousins survive as the [[sea turtles]] of today.

''[[Mesosaurus]]'' (and other mesosaurids) were another group of anapsid [[reptiles]] to secondarily return to the sea, eschewing shells, and are also long extinct.

==Diapsid==
{{main|Diapsid}}
Living at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the [[mosasaur]]s resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct 66 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. 

Modern diapsids which have made their own adaptions to allow them to spend significant time in the water include marine [[iguana]]s and marine [[crocodile]]s. [[Sea snakes]] are extensively adapted to the marine environment, giving birth to live offspring in the same way as the Euryapsida (see below) and are largely incapable of terrestrial activity.  The arc of their adaptation is evident by observing the primitive [[Laticauda]] genus, which must return to land to lay eggs.

==Euryapsida==
{{main|Euryapsida}}
These marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans. In the case of [[ichthyosaur]]s adapting as fully as the [[dolphins]] they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Euryapsida is now no longer considered a valid taxonomic group (Motani, 2009).

==Cetacea==
{{Main|Cetacea|Evolution of cetaceans}}
During the [[Paleocene]] Epoch (about 66 - 55 million years ago), a group of [[wolf]]-like [[artiodactyl]]s related to ''[[Pakicetus]]'' began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. They were the ancestors of modern whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The cetacea are extensively adapted to marine life and cannot survive on land at all. Their adaptation can be seen in many unique physiognomic characteristics such as the dorsal [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], [[baleen]] teeth, and the cranial 'melon' organ used for aquatic [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. The closest extant terrestrial relative to the whale is the [[hippopotamus]], which spends much of its time in the water and whose name literally means "horse of the river".

==Sirenians==
{{main|Sirenian|Evolution of sirenians}}
The ancestors of the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean.

==Pinnipeds==
{{main|Pinniped}}
The fossil records show that [[phocid]]s existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and [[odobenid]]s about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that.

==Polar bears==
{{main|Polar bear}}
Although polar bears spend most of their time on the ice rather than in the water, polar bears show the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (high levels of body fat and nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago. The polar bear has thick fur and layers of fat on its body to protect it from the cold.

==Speculative theories==
===Humans===
{{main|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}
Proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis believe that part of [[human evolution]] includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, [[bipedalism]], increased [[subcutaneous fat]], [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]], [[vernix caseosa]], a hooded [[human nose|nose]] and various other physiological and anatomical changes. The idea is not accepted by most scholars who study human evolution.&lt;ref name = Meier&gt;{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=r_Wit4KYSmMC&amp;pg=PA57 57–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{How to|date=September 2009}}
'''Surfboard wax''' (also known as '''surfwax''') is a formulation of natural and/or synthetic [[wax]] for application to the deck of a [[surfboard]], [[bodyboard]], or [[skimboard]], to keep the surfer from slipping off the board when paddling out or riding a wave.  It is also used to increase grip on the paddle of a surf [[kayak]] or [[dragon boat]].

Surfboard wax is generally composed of a mixture of [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], [[beeswax]] or other hard waxes; [[petroleum jelly]] can also be added to create a softer wax. Often exotic scents like [[coconut]] or bubblegum are added to give the wax an attractive scent. There are also natural alternatives available containing only organic substances like beeswax, vegetable oils (such as coconut or hemp oil), pine resin, tree pulp and natural essential oils. Many different commercial brands and varieties of surfboard wax optimized for different climates and water temperatures may be found at a surf shop.

==Removal==
Removing the wax can be time-consuming, or it can take just take a few minutes.  A plastic scraper (typically found on the back of a [[wax comb]]) can be used to remove the wax in large chunks. Residual wax that has not been removed by scraping can be dealt with using a soft cloth, either on its own or in combination with (for example) coconut oil. Various commercial solvents are also available. Solvents, however, are usually avoided as they can damage the surface or paint job of the board.

Another method that many surfers prefer is to let their board lie in the sun with the deck side up. After about ten minutes, beach sand is spread onto the melted wax and the sand is then rubbed. This method enables surfers to take all the wax off at once. The board is then left smooth and ready to be stored away or to be re-waxed. A surfer can also use a wax comb to scrape or comb the wax off the board.

==Maintaining==
There are two methods that surfers use to maintain their wax. Usually a [[wax comb]] is used to maintain the grip of the wax. Usually, the comb is used to engrave a cross-cut pattern into the wax to create a tackier surface.

==Temperature==
Most surfboard wax comes labeled with a water temperature range for which it is ideal.  Wax used in water colder than its rating will become hard and not provide the stickiness needed to stay on the board, while wax used in water warmer than its rating may melt.

Some surfers layer different temperatures of wax to create the level of firmness and stickiness desired. 

The normal procedure is to lay down a thin base coat of a high temperature wax, usually labeled for tropical water, to build up bumps and texture.  This will not melt off.  Then a layer of temperature-appropriate wax or sticky wax is applied on top of that.  This ensures that, as one changes the wax for different temperatures, the cold water wax will not come into contact with the board directly.  However some waxes are designed to work in all water conditions and have the ability to remain on the board at any temperature.

==Application==
[[File:Surfwax.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Man applies surfboard wax to skimboard at beach.]]
Surfboard wax is applied by first putting a base coat onto the clean board.  This harder base coat forms a bump pattern on the surfboard which the surfer will then stick to.  The base coat is then topped with a top coat of wax of an appropriate temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |author=John Dang |url=http://www.surfscience.com/topics/learn-to-surf/surfing-101/how-to-wax-a-surfboard/ |title=How To Wax A Surfboard |publisher=''surfscience.com'' |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are a few techniques that can be used to apply the wax to a surfboard, from rubbing small circles to making diagonal lines.  There is little difference in the end result, the application a surfer uses simply depends on preference. When re-applying surfboard wax it is always crucial to remove all prior layers of wax in order to ensure the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to wax a surfboard - Disrupt Surfing|url = https://www.disruptsurfing.com/how-to-wax-a-surfboard/|website = Disrupt Surfing|accessdate = 2015-12-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] of 1989 had devastated the shore around [[Prince William Sound]], diminishing the marine population. Consequently, the [[fishery]] industry in the area faced a sharp fall on their fish catch and revenue. Feeling little had been done to study the impact of the spill, a group of fishermen sailed off to begin a [[blockade]] of the Valdez Narrows on August 20, 1993. While tankers must pass through Valdez Narrows to enter the port of [[Valdez oil terminal|Valdez]], seven tankers were held off in the three-day blockade.

As oil was continuing to pump through the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]], and tankers were keeping off shore, the storage tanks in Valdez would soon overflow. With the probability in interrupting the oil flow to prevent an overflow, and also facing a growing loss in profits, the government came in to settle the blockade. The blockade was called off after Interior Secretary [[Bruce Babbitt]] promised to release $5 million of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill restoration funds for ecosystem-wide studies.

Comprehensive studies of the effects of the spill toward the ecosystem around [[Prince William Sound]] began in the following year.

[[File:Ranque-Hilsch Vortex Tube.svg|thumb|300px|right|Separation of a compressed gas into a hot stream and a cold stream]]
The '''vortex tube''', also known as the '''Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube''', is a [[mechanical device]] that separates a compressed [[gas]] into hot and cold streams. The gas emerging from the "hot" end can reach temperatures of 200 [[Celsius|°C]]&amp;nbsp;(392 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), and the gas emerging from the "cold end" can reach {{convert|−50|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Circus"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Flying Circus of Physics|date = |work = |last = Walker|first = Jearl|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year = 1975|isbn = 0-471-91808-3|page = 97|chapter = The madness of stirring tea}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no [[moving parts]].

Pressurised gas is injected tangentially into a ''swirl chamber'' and [[acceleration|accelerated]] to a high rate of [[rotation]]. Due to the [[cone (geometry)|conical]] [[nozzle]] at the end of the tube, only the outer shell of the compressed gas is allowed to escape at that end. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex.

== Method of operation ==

To explain the temperature separation in a vortex tube, there are two main approaches:

=== Fundamental approach: the physics  ===

This approach is based on first-principles physics alone and is not limited to vortex tubes only, but applies to moving gas in general. It shows that temperature separation in a moving gas is due only to enthalpy conservation in a moving frame of reference.

The thermal process in the vortex tube can be estimated in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat content into the kinetic energy of rotation. The total enthalpy, which is the sum of the [[enthalpy]] and the kinetic energy, is conserved. 2) The peripheric rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the [[Recuperator|heat recuperation]] effect takes place between the quickly rotating peripheric flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the peripheric one. 3) The kinetic energy of rotation turns into the heat by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the heat recuperation process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the peripheric flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.

The main physical phenomenon of the vortex tube is the temperature separation between the cold vortex core and the warm vortex periphery. The "vortex tube effect" is fully explained with the work equation of Euler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node91.html] - Z.S. Spakovszky. Unified: thermodynamics and propulsion (Lecture notes), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. 2007. ch. 12.3.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Euler's turbine equation, which can be written in its most general vectorial form as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 = Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2012| title = Thermodynamics of angular propulsion in fluids | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 054504-1–054504-4 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.054504 | bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e4504P | pmid=23006180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T - \frac{ \vec v \cdot \vec \omega \times  \vec r}{c_p}=\mbox{const} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is the total, or [[stagnation temperature]] of the rotating gas at radial position &lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt;, the absolute gas velocity as observed from the stationary frame of reference is denoted with &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;; the angular velocity of the system is &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c_p &lt;/math&gt; is the isobaric heat capacity of the gas. This equation was published in 2012; it explains the fundamental operating principle of vortex tubes. The search for this explanation began in 1933 when the vortex tube was discovered and continued for more than 80 years.

The above equation is valid for an adiabatic turbine passage; it clearly shows that while gas moving towards the center is getting colder the peripheral gas in the passage is "getting faster". Therefore, vortex cooling is due to angular propulsion. The more the gas cools by reaching the center, the more rotational energy it delivers to the vortex and thus the vortex rotates even faster. This explanation stems directly from the law of energy conservation. Compressed gas at room temperature is expanded in order to gain speed through a nozzle; it then climbs the centrifugal barrier of rotation during which energy is also lost. The lost energy is delivered to the vortex, which speeds its rotation. In a vortex tube, the cylindrical surrounding wall confines the flow at periphery and thus forces conversion of kinetic into internal energy, which produces hot air at the hot exit.

Therefore, the vortex tube is a rotorless [[turboexpander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = Jeliazko G. | last2 =  Straatman | first2 = Anthony G. | year = 2015 | title = Vortex tube effect without walls | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Physics | volume = 93| issue = 8| pages = 850–854| doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0227 | bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..850P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a rotorless radial inflow turbine (cold end, center) and a rotorless centrifugal compressor (hot end, periphery). The work output of the turbine is converted into heat by the compressor at the hot end.

=== Phenomenological approach ===
This approach relies on observation and experimental data. It is specifically tailored to the geometrical shape of the vortex tube and the details of its flow and is designed to match the particular observables of the complex vortex tube flow, namely turbulence, acoustic phenomena, pressure fields, air velocities and many others. The earlier published models of the vortex tube are phenomenological. They are:

# Radial pressure difference: centrifugal compression and air expansion
# Radial transfer of angular momentum
# Radial acoustic streaming of energy
# Radial heat pumping

More on these models can be found in recent review articles on vortex tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = Y. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = A critical review of temperature separation in a vortex tube | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177710001226 | journal = Exper. Therm.

The phenomenological models were developed at an earlier time when the turbine equation of Euler was not thoroughly analyzed; in the engineering literature, this equation is studied mostly to show the work output of a turbine; while temperature analysis is not performed since turbine cooling has more limited application unlike power generation, which is the main application of turbines. Phenomenological studies of the vortex tube in the past have been useful in presenting empirical data. However, due to the complexity of the vortex flow this empirical approach was able to show only aspects of the effect but was unable to explain its operating principle. Dedicated to empirical details, for a long time the empirical studies made the vortex tube effect appear enigmatic and its explanation – a matter of debate.

==History==
The vortex tube was invented in 1931 by French physicist [[Georges J. Ranque]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Joseph Ranque, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=01952281&amp;PageNum=1&amp;&amp;IDKey=A993EA1585E3&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PALL%2526S1=1952281.PN.%2526OS=PN/1952281%2526RS=PN/1952281 “Method and apparatus for obtaining from a fluid under pressure two currents of fluids at different temperatures,”] U.S. Patent no. 1,952,281 (filed:  December 6, 1932 ; issued:  March 27, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; It was rediscovered by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1934 while he was searching for a device to perform isotope separation, see [[Helikon vortex separation process]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac|last=Farmelo|first=Graham|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-02210-6|location=New York|pages=248-9,307,311,313-4,321,431}}&lt;/ref&gt;   German physicist {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Hilsch|de}} improved the design and published a widely read paper in 1947 on the device, which he called a ''Wirbelrohr'' (literally, whirl pipe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilsch | first1 = Rudolf | year = 1947 | title = The use of the expansion of gases in a centrifugal field as cooling process | url = | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 108–113 | doi=10.1063/1.1740893| bibcode = 1947RScI...18..108H}}  Translated from the original German article: Rudolf Hilsch (1946) "Die Expansion von Gasen im Zentrifugalfeld als Kälteprozeß" (The expansion of gases in a centrifugal field as a cooling process), ''Zeitschrift für Naturforschung'', '''1''' : 208–214.

From 1952 to 1963, C. Darby Fulton, Jr. obtained four U.S. patents relating to the development of the vortex tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3208229.html|title=Free Patents Online|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Fulton began manufacturing the vortex tube under the company name Fulton Cryogenics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Greg|date=October 1976|title=Vortex Tubes Blow Hot and Cold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=vortex+tubes+popular+science&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz84SQkPjVAhVL7YMKHe6ZCLMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vortex%20tubes%20popular%20science&amp;f=false|journal=Popular Science|volume=209:4|pages=123–125 et al|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Fulton sold the company to Vortec, Inc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The vortex tube was used to separate gas mixtures, oxygen and nitrogen, carbon dioxide and helium, carbon dioxide and air in 1967 by Linderstrom-Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Chengming Gao, Experimental Study on the Ranque-Hilsch Vortex Tube, (2005) page 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Vortex tubes are constructed of stainless steel and use a generator and valve made of brass and sealed with viton o-rings to allow their use in the widest range of environments.&lt;/ref&gt;
Vortex tubes also seem to work with liquids to some extent, as demonstrated by Hsueh and Swenson in a laboratory experiment where free body rotation occurs from the core and a thick boundary layer at the wall. Air is separated causing a cooler air stream coming out the exhaust hoping to chill as a refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Balmer. Pressure-driven Ranque-Hilsch temperature separation in liquids. Trans. ASME, ''J. Fluids Engineering'', 110:161–164, June 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 R. T. Balmer applied liquid water as the working medium. It was found that when the inlet pressure is high, for instance 20-50 bar, the heat energy separation process exists in incompressible (liquids) vortex flow as well. Note that this separation is only due to heating; there is no longer cooling observed since cooling requires compressibility of the working fluid.

==Efficiency==
Vortex tubes have lower efficiency than traditional [[air conditioning]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polihronov | first1 = J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = | title = The maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of vortex tubes | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Physics | volume =  93| issue = | pages =  1279–1282| doi = 10.1139/cjp-2015-0089 | bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93.1279P}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly used for inexpensive spot cooling, when compressed air is available.

==Applications==

===Current applications===
Commercial vortex tubes are designed for industrial applications to produce a temperature drop of up to 71&amp;nbsp;°C (127&amp;nbsp;°F). With no moving parts, no electricity, and no Freon, a vortex tube can produce refrigeration up to {{convert|6000|BTU/h|abbr=on}} using only filtered compressed air at 100 PSI (6.9 bar). A control valve in the hot air exhaust adjusts temperatures, flows and refrigeration over a wide range.&lt;ref&gt;Newman Tools Inc. http://www.newmantools.com/vortex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortex tubes are used for cooling of cutting tools ([[lathe]]s and [[Milling machine|mill]]s, both manually-operated and [[CNC]] machines) during machining. The vortex tube is well-matched to this application: machine shops generally already use compressed air, and  a fast jet of cold air provides both cooling and removal of the "chips" produced by the tool. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the need for liquid coolant, which is messy, expensive, and environmentally hazardous.

This process is usually carried out by a [[multi wire saw]] which cuts multiple wafers from the same crystal at the same time. These wafers are then [[Lapping|polished]] to the desired degree of [[Flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]] and thickness.

==Major producers==
[[File:The Bow in Calgary.jpg|thumb|left|Cenovus headquarters, Calgary]] WCS was launched in December 2004 as a new heavy oil stream by [[Cenovus]] (then EnCana), [[Canadian Natural Resources|Canadian Natural Resources Limited]], [[Suncor]] (then Petro-Canada) and [[Talisman Energy|Talisman Energy Inc.]]{{Sfn|CME Group|2012}}{{sfn|CAPP|2013}}{{sfn|Argus|2012}}{{sfn|Suncor|2013|1}}{{sfn|Cenovus|2010}} [[File:PetroCanadaCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Suncor Energy headquarters, Calgary]]

Since it came onstream WCS has been blended at the Husky Hardisty terminal.{{sfn|Argus|2012}}[[File:Wcp 01.jpg|thumb|right|Husky headquarters in Calgary.  Husky has been blending WCS since 2004]]{{Sfn|Husky Energy|2002-2015}}{{sfn|Argus|2012}} According to Argus, in 2012 the WCS blend is produced by only the four companies mentioned above. "[T]he prospects for adding new producers are complicated by the internal rules set in place to compensate each producer for its contributions to the blend."{{sfn|Argus|2012}}

Companies tied to WCS as benchmark such as MEG Energy Corp, whose output is bitumen, benefit with an annual cash flow increase of 40% with every $5 increase in the price of WCS.{{Sfn|Jones|2015}} Crude from MEG's 210,000-barrel-a-day Christina Lake oil sands site is marketed as Access Western Blend, which competes with WCS. Others such as BlackPearl Resources Inc. and Northern Blizzard Resources Inc also benefit from the higher WCS price. "In the seven weeks that heavy crude has staged its rebound, MEG shares are up 27 per cent, BlackPearl’s 37 per cent and Northern Blizzard’s 21 per cent."{{Sfn|Jones|2015}}

According to a report by real estate consultants [[Avison Young]], by August 2015 in downtown Calgary, "layoffs by major oil and gas companies" were reflected in higher vacancy rates in the second quarter.&lt;ref name="ghost towers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/ghost-vacancies-haunt-downtown-calgary-as-oil-patch-layoffs-empty-office-buildings?__lsa=c940-0dbd | title=‘Ghost vacancies’ haunt downtown Calgary as oil patch layoffs empty office buildings | publisher=Financial Post | date=12 August 2015 | accessdate=9 September 2015 | author=Geoffrey Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical pricing WCS==
By 18 March 2015 the price of benchmark crude oils, WTI had dropped to $US43.34/bbl.{{Sfn|Financial Post, Calgary Herald|2015a}}{{rp|D6-D7}} from a high in June 2014 with WTI priced above US$107/bbl and Brent above US$115/bbl.{{Sfn|Krishnan|2014}}{{Sfn|Petroleum Services Association of Canada|2014}} WCS, a bitumen-derived crude, is a heavy crude that is similar to Californian heavy crudes, Mexico's Maya crude or Venezuelan heavy crude oils.{{Sfn|Foran|2013}} On 15 March 2015 the differential between WTI and WCS was US$13.8. Western Canadian Select was among the cheapest crude oils in the world{{Sfn|Tobben|Murtaugh|2014}} with a price of US$29.54/bbl on 15 March 2015,{{Sfn|Financial Post, Calgary Herald|2015a}}{{Sfn|Ewart|2015}}{{rp|C6-7}} its lowest price since April 2009.

== Characteristics ==
"The extremely viscous oil contained in oil sands deposits is commonly referred to as bitumen" ([[CAS Registry Number|CAS]] 8052-42-4) At the Husky Hardisty terminal, Western Canadian Select is blended from sweet synthetic and condensate diluents from 25 existing Canadian heavy conventional and unconventional bitumen crude oils.{{sfn|Cenovus|2010}}{{sfn|Argus|2012}}{{Sfn|Mohr|2014}}{{Sfn|TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers}}{{Sfn|Cenovus|2013}}

Western Canadian Select is a heavy crude oil with an [[API gravity]] level of between 19 and 22 (API),{{sfn|Platts|2012}}{{sfn|Platts|2013}} 20.5° (Natural Gas and Petroleum Products 2009).{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}

Western Canadian Select's characteristics are described as follows: [[List of crude oil products|Gravity]], Density (kg/m3) 930.1,{{Sfn|Cenovus|2010}} MCR (Wt%) 9.6,{{sfn|Cenovus|2010}} Sulphur (Wt%) 2.8-3.5%,{{sfn|Platts|2013}} TAN (Total Acid number) of (Mg KOH/g) 0.93.{{sfn|Cenovus|2010}}

Refiners in North America consider a crude with a TAN value greater than 1.0 as "high-TAN". A refinery must be retrofitted in order to handle high TAN crudes. Thus, a high TAN crude is limited in terms of the refineries in North America that are able to process it. For this reason, the TAN value of WCS is consistently maintained under 1.0 through blending with light, sweet crudes and condensate.

"Oil sands crude oil does not flow naturally in pipelines because it is too dense. A diluent is normally blended with the oil sands bitumen to allow it to flow in pipelines. For the purpose of meeting pipeline viscosity and density specifications, oil sands bitumen is blended with either synthetic crude oil (synbit) and/or condensate ([[Dilbit]])."{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}} WCS may be referred to as a syndilbit, since it may contain both synbit and dilbit.&lt;ref name="Alberta_Energy2011"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/CAREGlossary.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cost Analysis and Reporting Enhancement - Glossary of Terms |work=Alberta Energy |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=25 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In a study commissioned by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State (DOS)]], regarding the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] project, the DOS assumes "that the average crude oil flowing through the pipeline would consist of about 50% Western Canadian Select (dilbit) and 50% Suncor Synthetic A (SCO)."{{sfn|Lattanzio|2013}}{{rp|9}}

== Volumes ==

By September 2014 Canada was exporting 3,026 thousand bpd to the United States. This increased to its peak of 3,789 thousand bpd in September, 2015 and 3,401 thousand bpd in October, 2015.

Although the first replicable facility will not be online before 2019, Suncor hopes to eventually implement the technology on its leases at Meadow Creek, Lewis, MacKay River and Firebag.&lt;ref name="low-cost barrel" /&gt;

== Price of Crude Oil ==
{{main article|Price of petroleum}}

The '''price of petroleum''' as quoted in news in North America, generally refers to the [[spot price|WTI Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price]] per barrel (159 liters) of either [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]]/[[Light crude oil|light crude]] as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) for delivery at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], or of [[Brent Crude|Brent]] as traded on the [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE, into which the [[International Petroleum Exchange]] has been incorporated) for delivery at [[Sullom Voe]]. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, is a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light crude oil, lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] (USGC) regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827). [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.

The [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a "big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude.”{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}

The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).

"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40°. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5°."{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}

[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.

"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.

By March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}

According to the Financial Post, most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS "has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country."{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the National Bank of Canada, claims “WCS has "some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel." WCS has "better transparency and broader participation" than Maya. However, he explained that in 2015 "one of the only ways to take a position in oil is to use an ETF that is tied to WTI."{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} Simard claims that when the global price of oil is lower, for example, "the first barrels to be turned off in a low-price environment are heavy barrels" making WCS "closer to the floor" than WTI.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}

In order to address the transparency and liquidity issues facing WCS, Auspice created the [[Canadian Crude Index]] (CCI), which serves as a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for [[Petroleum production in Canada|oil produced in Canada]].&lt;ref name="CCIbenchmark"&gt;[http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches-first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/]|http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches-first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI allows investors to track the price, risk and [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the Canadian commodity.&lt;ref name="CCIbenchmark" /&gt; The CCI can be used to identify opportunities to speculate outright on the price of Canadian crude oil or in conjunction with [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) to put on a spread trade which could represent the differential between the two.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;[http://content.auspicecapital.com/AuspiceCCIFactSheet2015.pdf]|http://content.auspicecapital.com/AuspiceCCIFactSheet2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI provides a fixed price reference for Canadian Crude Oil by targeting  an exposure that represents a three-month rolling position in crude oil.&lt;ref name="threemonthrolling"&gt;[http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53a1ca9ce4b030ded763dbc2/t/55260223e4b0805894981ebb/1428554275298/Canadian+Crude+Excess+Return+Index+Methodology+3.0.1.pdf]|http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53a1ca9ce4b030ded763dbc2/t/55260223e4b0805894981ebb/1428554275298/Canadian+Crude+Excess+Return+Index+Methodology+3.0.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To create a price representative of Canadian crude the index uses two futures contracts: A fixed price contract, which represents the price of crude oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and a basis differential contract, which represents the difference in price between Cushing and [[Hardisty]], Alberta.&lt;ref name="threemonthrolling" /&gt; Both contracts are priced in U.S. dollars per barrel. Together, these create a fixed price for Canadian crude oil, and provide an accessible and transparent index to serve as a benchmark to build investable products upon, and could ultimately increase its demand to global markets.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

In the spring of 2015, veteran journalist specializing in energy and finance, Jeffrey Jones, described how the price of WCS "surged more than 70 per cent, outpacing West Texas intermediate (WTI), Brent" and "quietly" became the "hottest commodity in North American energy."{{Sfn|Jones|2015}} In April 2015, Enbridge filled a "new 570,000-barrel-a-day pipeline."{{Sfn|Bloomberg|2015}} A May 2015 TD Securities report provides some of the factors contributing the WCS price gains as "normal seasonal strength driven by demand for the thick crude to make asphalt as road paving", improvements to WCS access to various U.S. markets in spite of pipeline impediments, five-year high production levels and high heavy oil demand in U.S. refineries particularly in the US Midwest, a key market for WCS.{{Sfn|Jones|2015}}

By 9 September 2015, the price of WCS was US$32.52 and the WTI-WCS differential was differential US$13.35.&lt;ref name="FP_2015_09_09"&gt;{{cite news  |title=Commodities | publisher=Financial Post, Calgary Herald | date=9 September 2015 | pages=D6-D7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crude oil differentials and Western Canadian Select (WCS) ===

By June 2015 the differential between WTI and WCS was US$7.8, the lowest it has ever been.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}

In a 2013 white paper for the [[Bank of Canada]],{{sfn|Alquist|Guénette|2013}} authors Alquist and Guénette examined implications for high global oil prices for the North American market. They argued that North America was experiencing a crude oil inventory surplus. This surplus combined with the "segmentation of the North American crude oil market from the global market", contributed to "the divergence between continental benchmark crudes such as WTI and Western Canada Select (WCS) and seaborne benchmark crudes such as Brent (Figure 3).11 I."{{sfn|Alquist|Guénette|2013}}{{rp|7}}

Alberta's Minister of Finance argues that WCS "should be trading on par with Mayan crude at about $94 a barrel."{{sfn|Van Loon|2013}} Maya crudes are close to WCS quality levels.{{sfn|Moore|2011}} However, Maya was trading at US$108.73/bbl in February 2013, while WCS was US$69/bbl. In his presentation to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2013 John Foran demonstrated that Maya had traded at only a slight premium to WCS in 2010. Since then WCS price differentials widened "with rising oil sands and tight oil production and insufficient pipeline capacity to access global markets."{{Sfn|Foran|2013}} Mexico enjoys a location discount with its proximity to the heavy oil-capable refineries in the Gulf Coast. As well, Mexico began to strategically and successfully seek out joint venture refinery partnerships in the 1990s to create a market for its heavy crude oil in the U.S. Gulf. In 1993, ([[Pemex|Petróleos Mexicanos]], the state-owned Mexican oil company) and Shell Oil Company agreed on a joint US$1 billion refinery upgrading construction project which led to the construction of a new coker, hydrotreating unit, sulfur recovery unit and other facilities in Deer Park, Texas on the Houston Ship Channel in order to process large volumes of PEMEX heavy Maya crude while fulfilling the U.S. Clean Air Act requirements.{{sfn|PR|1993}}

By July 2013, Western Canadian Select (WCS) "heavy oil prices climbed from US$75 to more than US$90 per barrel — the highest level since mid-2008, when WTI oil prices were at a record (US$147.90) — just prior to the 2008-09 'Great Recession'."{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} WCS "heavy oil prices were "expected to remain at the US$90, which is closer to the world price for heavy crude and WCS 'true, inherent value'."{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} The higher price of WCS oil off WTI was explained by "new rail shipments alleviating some export pipeline constraints — and the return of WTI oil prices to international levels."{{sfn|Mohr|2013}}

By January 2014 there was a proliferation of trains and pipelines carrying WCS along with an increased demand on the part of U.S. refineries. By early 2014 there were approximately 150,000 barrels a day of heavy oil being transported by rail.{{Sfn|Lewis|2014}}

According to the Government of Alberta's June 2014 Energy Prices report the price of WCS rose 15% from $68.87 in April 2013 to $79.56 in April 2014 but experienced a low of $58 and a high of $91.{{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}} During the same time period the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 10.9% averaging $102.07 a barrel in April 2014.{{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}{{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}

=== Getting to tidewater: landlocked ===

Heavy discounts on Albertan crudes in 2012 were attributed to crudes being "landlocked" in the U.S. Midwest.  Since that time, several major pipelines have been constructed to release that glut, including Seaway, the Southern leg of Keystone XL and Flanagan South.

However, significant obstacles persist in approvals on pipelines to export crude from Alberta. In April 2013, Calgary-based Canada West Foundation warned that Alberta is "running up against a [pipeline capacity] wall around 2016, when we will have barrels of oil we can’t move."{{sfn|Hussain|2013}} For the time being, rail shipments of crude oil have filled the gap and narrowed the price differential between Albertan and North American crudes. However, additional pipelines exporting crude from Alberta will be required to support ongoing expansion in crude production.

[[File:Keystone-pipeline-route.svg|150px|right|thumb|2012 proposed route of Keystone XL pipeline, since revised]] Frustrated by delays in getting approval for Keystone XL (via the US Gulf of Mexico), the Northern Gateway Project (via Kitimat, BC) and the expansion of the existing [[Kinder Morgan#Trans Mountain Oil Pipeline|Trans Mountain]] line to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Alberta has intensified exploration of two northern projects "to help the province get its oil to tidewater, making it available for export to overseas markets."{{sfn|Hussain|2013}} Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], spent $9 million by May, 2012 and $16.5 million by May, 2013 to promote Keystone XL.{{sfn|Goodman|2013}}

In the United States, Democrats are concerned that Keystone XL would simply facilitate getting Alberta oil sands products to tidewater for export to China and other countries via the American Gulf Coast of Mexico.{{sfn|Goodman|2013}}

On 1 August 2013, [[TransCanada Corporation|TransCanada]] CEO [[Russ Girling]] announced that the company was moving forward on the $12 billion 4,400-kilometre (2,700 mile) [[Energy East pipeline]] pipeline project with a proposed completion date in 2017 or 2018.{{sfn|Zawadzki|Sheppard|2013}} In the long term, this would mean that WCS could be shipped to Atlantic tidewater via deep water ports such as Quebec City{{sfn|Lewis|2013}} and Saint John. Potential heavy oil overseas destinations include India,{{sfn|Lewis|2013}} where super refineries capable of processing vast quantities of oil sands oil are already under construction. In the meantime, Energy East pipeline would be used to send light sweet crude, such as Edmonton Par crude{{sfn|Lewis|2013}} from Alberta to eastern Canadian refineries Montreal/Quebec City, for example. Eastern Canadian refineries, such as Imperial Oil Ltd. 88,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Dartmouth, N.S.,{{sfn|Lewis|2013}} currently import crude oil from North and West Africa and Latin America, according to Mark Routt, "a senior energy consultant at KBC in Houston, who has a number of clients interested in the project." The proposed Energy East Pipeline will have the potential of carrying 1.1-million barrels of oil per day from Alberta and Saskatchewan to eastern Canada.{{sfn|TransCanada|2013}}

Patricia Mohr, a Bank of Nova Scotia senior economist and commodities analyst, in her report{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} on the economic advantages to Energy East, argued that, Western Canada Select, the heavy oil marker in Alberta, "could have earned a much higher price in India than actually received" in the first half of 2013 based on the price of Saudi Arabian heavy crude delivered to India" if the pipeline had already been operational.{{sfn|Lewis|2013}}In her report, Bohr predicted that initially Quebec refineries, owned by Suncor Energy Inc. and Valero, for example could access comprise light oil or upgraded synthetic crude from Alberta's oil sands via Energy East to displace "imports priced off more expensive Brent crude."{{sfn|Lewis|2013}} In the long term, supertankers using the proposed Irving/TransCanada deep-sea Saint John terminal could ship huge quantities of Alberta's blended bitumen, such as WCS to the super refineries in India. Mohr predicted in her report that the price of WCS would increase to US$90 per barrel in July, 2013 up from US$75.41 in June."{{sfn|Lewis|2013}}

Canada's largest refinery, capable of processing 300,000 barrels of oil per day, is owned and operated by [[Irving Oil]], in the deep-water port of Saint John, New Brunswick, on the east coast. A proposed $300-million deep water marine terminal, to be constructed and operated jointly by TransCanada and Irving Oil Ltd., would be built near Irving Oil's import terminal with construction to begin in 2015.{{sfn|CBC|2013}}

Maine-based [[Portland–Montreal Pipe Line|Portland–Montreal Pipe Line Corporation]], which consists of Portland Pipe Line Corporation (in the United States) and Montreal Pipe Line Limited (in Canada), is considering ways to carry Canadian oil sands crude to Atlantic tidewater at Portland's deep-water port.{{sfn|Sherwood|2013}} The proposal would mean that crude oil from the oil sands would be piped via the Great Lakes, Ontario, Quebec and New England to Portland, Maine. The pipelines are owned by [[ExxonMobil]] and Suncor.

By 2011, output from the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota Crude was increasing faster than pipelines could be built. Oil producers and pipeline companies turned to railroads for transportation solutions.{{Sfn|Clark|2011}} Bakken oil competes with WCS for access to transportation by pipeline and by rail. By the end of 2010, Bakken oil production rates had reached {{convert|458000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, thereby outstripping the pipeline capacity to ship oil out of the Bakken.{{Sfn|Fox News|2010}}{{Sfn|Clark|2011}} By January 2011 Bloomberg News reported that Bakken crude oil producers were using railway cars to ship oil.{{Sfn|Clark|2011}}

In 2013, there were new rail shipments of WCS.{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} Since 2012, the amount of crude oil transported by rail in Canada had quadrupled and by 2014 it was expected to continue to surge.{{Sfn|George-Cosh|2014}}

In August 2013, then-U.S. Development Group's (now USD Partners) CEO, Dan Borgen, a Texas-based oil-by-rail pioneer, shifted his attention away from the U.S. shale oil plays towards the Canadian oil sands.{{Sfn|Leff|2013}} Borgen "helped introduce the energy markets to specialized terminals that can quickly load mile-long oil tank trains heading to the same destination - facilities that .... revolutionized the U.S. oil market."{{Sfn|Leff|2013}} Since 2007, [[Goldman Sachs]] has played a leading role in financing USD's "expansion of nearly a dozen specialized terminals that can quickly load and unload massive, mile-long trains carrying crude oil and ethanol across the United States."{{Sfn|Letts|2013a}} USD's pioneering projects included large-scale “storage in transit” (SIT) inspired by the European model for the petrochemicals industry.{{Sfn|Letts|2013a}} USD sold five of the specialized oil-by-rail US terminals to "Plains All American Pipeline for $500 million in late 2012, leaving the company cash-rich and asset light."{{Sfn|Letts|2013a}}{{Sfn|Leff|2013}} According to Leff, concerns have been raised about the link between Goldman Sachs and USD.

{{quote|"Understanding the trading flows through such lynchpin oil facilities can provide valuable insight for oil traders, who scour the market for information that may help them predict how much oil is being shipped to different parts of the country. Large price discounts for oil in locations poorly served by pipelines have offered traders attractive opportunities if they can figure out how to get the crude to higher-priced markets. Data on crude-by-rail shipments is particularly opaque, with government figures only available months after."|Jonathan Leff 2013a}}

By January 2014 there was a proliferation of trains and pipelines carrying WCS along with an increased demand on the part of U.S. refineries. By early 2014 there were approximately 150,000 barrels a day of heavy oil being transported by rail.{{Sfn|Lewis|2014}}

The price of WCS rose in August 2014 as anticipated expansions in crude-by-rail capacity at Hardisty increased when USDG Gibson Energy's Hardisty Terminal, the new state-of-the-art crude-by-rail origination terminal and loading facility with pipeline connectivity,{{Sfn|Gibson Inc|2015}} became operational in June 2014 with a capacity to load up to two 120-rail car unit trains per day (120,000 of heavy crude bbd).{{Sfn|USD Partners|2015}}{{Sfn|Argus|2014}} The Hardisty rail terminal can load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day "with 30 railcar loading positions on a fixed loading rack, a unit train staging area and loop tracks capable of holding five unit trains simultaneously."{{Sfn|USD Partners|2015}} By 2015 there was "a newly-constructed pipeline connected to Gibson Energy Inc.’s Hardisty storage terminal" with "over 5 million barrels of storage in Hardisty."{{Sfn|USD Partners|2015}}

=== Canadian Pacific Railway ===
{{main article|Canadian Pacific Railway}}

In 2014, CPR COO [[Keith Creel]] said CPR was in a growth position in 2014 thanks to the increased Alberta crude oil (WCS) transport that will account for one-third of CPR's new revenue gains through 2018 "aided by improvements at oil-loading terminals and track in western Canada."{{Sfn|George-Cosh|2014}} By 2014 CP was shaped by CEO [[Hunter Harrison]] and American activist shareholder [[Bill Ackman]]. Americans own 73% of CP shares, while Canadians and Americans each own 50% of CN.&lt;ref name="farmers_miss_CWB_2014"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Globe and Mail |title=Why so many farmers miss the Wheat Board |author=[[Jake MacDonald]]|date=27 November 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2015 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/why-so-many-farmers-miss-the-wheat-board/article21810531/?from=23966156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to improve returns for their shareholders, railways cut back on their workforce and downsized the number of locomotives.&lt;ref name="farmers_miss_CWB_2014" /&gt;

Creel said in a 2014 interview that the transport of Alberta's heavy crude oil would account for about 60% of the CP's oil revenues, and light crude from the Bakken Shale region in Saskatchewan and the U.S. state of North Dakota would account for 40%. Prior to the implementation of tougher regulations in both Canada and the United States following the [[Lac-Mégantic rail disaster]] and other oil-related rail incidents which involved the highly volatile, sensitive light sweet Bakken crude, Bakken accounted for 60% of CP's oil shipments. Creel said that "It [WCS is] safer, less volatile and more profitable to move and we’re uniquely positioned to connect to the West Coast as well as the East Coast.{{Sfn|George-Cosh|2014}}

Rail way officials claim that more Canadian oil-by-rail traffic is "made up of tough-to-ignite undiluted heavy crude and raw bitumen."{{Sfn|Williams|2015}}

CPR's high capacity North Line, which runs from Edmonton to Winnipeg, is connected to "all the key refining markets in North America."{{Sfn|USD Partners|2015}} Chief Executive Hunter Harrison told the ''Wall Street Journal'' in 2014 that Canadian Pacific would improve tracks along its North Line as part of a plan to ship Alberta oil east.{{Sfn|George-Cosh|2014}}

== WCS waterborne ==

On 21 September 2014 Suncor Energy Inc. loaded its first tanker of heavy crude, about 700,000 barrels of WCS, onto the tanker [[Minerva Gloria]] at the port of [[Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel, Quebec|Sorel]] near [[Montreal, Quebec]]. The Minerva Gloria is an [[Aframax|Aframax Crude Oil Tanker]] double hulled tanker with a [[Deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) 115,873 ton capacity.

=== Repsol and WCS ===

The Spanish oil company [[Repsol]] (REP.MC) obtained the licence from the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] to export 600,000 barrels of WCS from the United States.{{Sfn|Parraga|2014}} The WCS was shipped via [[Freeport (Texas)|Freeport]], Texas in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] (USGC) to the port of [[Bilbao]] on the [[Suezmax]] oil tanker, the [[Alexei Kosygin|Aleksey Kosygin]]. It is considered to be "the first re-export of Canadian crude from the USGC to a non-US port."{{Sfn|Platts|2014}} as the "US government tightly controls any crude exports, including of non-US grades."{{Sfn|Platts|2014}} The Brussels-based [[European Union]]'s [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA){{Sfn|Huffington Post Canada|2014}} monitored the trade. WCS, with its API of 20.6 and sulphur content of 3.37%, has been controversial.{{Sfn|Lewis|2014a}}

In December 2014, Repsol agreed to buy [[Talisman Energy]] (TLM.TO), Canada's fifth-largest independent oil producer, for US$8.3 billion which is estimated to be at about 50 per cent of Talisman's value in June 2014. By December 2014, the price of WCS had dropped to US$40.38 from $79.56 in April 2014.{{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}} The global demand for oil decreased, production increased and the price of oil plunged starting in June and continuing to drop through December.{{Sfn|Toyer|Rodriguez|2014}}

== Bull or Bear Markets in Crude Oil in the US ==

Investors placed bullish bets in the six weeks from January through February 8, 2013, on oil futures based on the U.S. central bank's bond-buying program that "adds liquidity to the financial markets." The demand, and therefore the price, of commodities in general and oil in particular falls if and when such a program is scaled back. Even a rumor that a hedge fund is in trouble and was liquidating positions can cause the price of U.S. crude oil to fall. Signs of strong demand of crude oil from China and India with hopes of a [[Market tightness|tighter market]] can raise the price and even an oil rally. Investors also refer to the Energy Information Administration reports on U.S. inventories of commercial crude oil. The higher the inventory of crude oil, the lower the price. U.S. inventories of commercial crude oil hit their highest level on February 15, 2013 since July 2012."{{Sfn|Krishnan|Brown|2013}}

== Western Canadian Select Derivatives Market ==

Most Western Canadian Select is piped to Illinois for refinement and then to [[Cushing, Oklahoma]] for sale. Western Canadian Select (WCS) [[futures contracts]] are available on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME)while bilateral [[over-the-counter]] WCS [[swap (finance)|swap]]s can be cleared on [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME)'s ClearPort or by NGX.{{sfn|Argus|2012}}

== Refineries ==

WCS is transported from Alberta to refineries with capacity to process heavy oil from the oil sands. The [[Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts|Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (Padd II)]], in the US Midwest, have experience running the WCS blend.{{sfn|Argus|2012}}{{sfn|Moore|2011}}{{sfn|Hackett|2013}} Most of WCS goes to refineries in the Midwestern United States where refineries "are configured to process a large percentage of heavy, high-sulfur crude and to produce large quantities of transportation fuels, and low amounts of heavy fuel oil."{{sfn|Hackett|2013}} While the US refiners "invested in more complex refinery configurations with higher processing capability" that use "cheaper feedstocks" like WCS and Maya, Canada did not. While Canadian refining capacity has increased through scale and efficiency, there are only 19 refineries in Canada compared to 148 in the United States.{{sfn|Hackett|2013}}

WCS crude oil with its "very low API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity and high sulphur content and levels of residual metals"{{sfn|Moore|2011}}{{sfn|Hackett|2013}} requires specialized refining that few Canadian refineries have. It can only be processed in refiners modified with new metallurgy capable of running high-acid (TAN) crudes.

"The transportation costs associated with moving crude oil from the oil fields in Western Canada to the consuming regions in the east and the greater choice of crude qualities make it more economic for some refineries to use imported crude oil. Therefore, Canada’s oil economy is now a dual market. Refineries in Western Canada run domestically produced crude oil, refineries in Quebec and the eastern provinces run primarily imported crude oil, while refineries in Ontario run a mix of both imported and domestically produced crude oil. In more recent years, eastern refineries have begun running Canadian crude from east coast offshore production."{{sfn|Hackett|2013}}

US refineries import large quantities of crude oil from Canada, Mexico, Columbia and Venezuela, and they began in the 1990s to build coker and sulfur capacity enhancements to accommodate the growth of these medium and heavy sour crude oils while meeting environment requirements and consumer demand for transportation fuels. "While US refineries have made significant investments in complex refining hardware, which supports processing heavier, sourer crude into gasoline and distillates, similar investment outside the US has been pursued less aggressively.{{sfn|Moore|2011}}{{rp|3}}{{sfn|Hackett|2013}} Medium and heavy crude oil make up 50% of US crude oil inputs and the US continues to expand its capacity to process heavy crude.{{sfn|Moore|2011}}{{rp|3}}{{sfn|Hackett|2013}}

Lloydminster heavy oil, a component in the Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy oil blend, is processed at the CCRL Refinery Complex heavy oil [[upgrader]] which had a fire in the [[Coker unit|coker]] of the heavy oil upgrader section of the plant, on February 11, 2013. It was the third major incident in 16 months, at the Regina plant.{{sfn|Welsch|Harvey|2013}} The price of Western Canadian Select weakened against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil.{{sfn|Welsch|Harvey|2013}}

===Pine Bend Refinery===
{{main article|Pine Bend Refinery}}

The Pine Bend Refinery, the largest [[oil refinery]] in [[Minnesota]], located in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] gets 80% of its incoming heavy crude from the Athabasca oil sands.{{Sfn|Sassoon|2011}} The crude oil is piped from the northwest to the facility through the [[Lakehead Pipeline|Lakehead]] and [[Minnesota Pipeline|Minnesota]] pipelines which are also owned by [[Koch Industries]]. Most [[petroleum]] enters and exits the plant through a Koch-owned, 537-mile [[pipeline transport|pipeline system]] that stretches across Minnesota and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Sassoon_2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sassoon|first=David|title=Koch Brothers Positioned To Be Big Winners If Keystone XL Pipeline Is Approved|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/10/idUS292515702420110210|newspaper=Reuters|date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.

===Repsol===
{{main article|Repsol}}
Repsol responded to the enforcement in January 2009 of the European Union's reduced sulphur content in automotive petrol and diesel from 50 to 10 parts per million, with heavy investment in upgrading their refineries. They upgrading three of their five refineries in Spain ([[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], [[A Coruña]], [[Bilbao]], [[Puertollano]] and [[Tarragona]]) with cokers that have the capacity to refine Western Canadian Select heavy oil. Many other European refineries closed as margins decreased.{{Sfn|Platts|2014}} Repsol tested the first batches of WCS at its Spanish refineries in May 2014.{{Sfn|Parraga|2014}}

====Cartagena refinery====
{{main article|Cartagena refinery}}

In 2012 Repsol completed its €3.15-billion upgrade and expansion of its Cartagena refinery in [[Murcia]], Spain which included a new coking unit capable of refining heavy crude like WCS.{{Sfn|Tippee|2012}}

====Petronor====
{{main article|Petronor}}
Repsol's 2013 completed upgrades, which included a new coker unit and highly efficient cogeneration unit at their [[Petronor]] refinery at [[Muskiz]] near [[Bilbao]], cost over 1 billion euros and represents "the largest industrial investment in the history of the Basque Country."{{Sfn|Repsol|2013}} This new coker unit will produce "higher-demand products such as propane, butane, gasoline and diesel" and " eliminate the production of fuel oil."{{Sfn|Repsol|2013}} The cogeneration unit will reduce CO2 emissions and help achieve Spain's [[Kyoto protocol]] targets. The refinery is self-sufficient in electricity and capable of distributing power to the grid.{{Sfn|Repsol|2013}}

=== Blenders: ANS, WCS, Bakken Oil ===

In their 2013 article published in [[Oil &amp; Gas Journal]], Auers and Mayes suggest that the "recent pricing disconnects have created opportunities for astute crude oil blenders and refiners to create their own substitutes for waterborne grades (like [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS)) at highly discounted prices. A "pseudo" Alaskan North Slope substitute, for example, could be created with a blend of 55% Bakken and 45% Western Canadian Select at a cost potentially far less than the ANS market price." They argue that there are financial opportunities for refineries capable of blending, delivering, and refining "stranded" cheaper crude blends, like Western Canadian Select(WCS). In contrast to the light, sweet oil produced "from emerging shale plays in North Dakota ([[Bakken formation|Bakken]]) and Texas ([[Eagle Ford]]) as well as a resurgence of drilling in older, existing fields, such as the [[Permian basin]]", the oil sands of Alberta is "overwhelmingly heavy."{{Sfn|Auers|Mayes|2013}}

===Impact of Bakken tight oil on WCS===
{{main article|Bakken formation}}

The CIBC reported that the oil industry continued to produce massive amounts of oil in spite of a stagnant crude oil market. Oil production from the [[Bakken formation]] alone was forecast in 2012 to grow by 600,000 barrels every year through 2016. By 2012, Canadian tight oil and oil sands production was also surging.{{Sfn|Alberta Oil|2012}}

By the end of 2014, as the demand for global oil consumption continued to decline, the remarkably rapid oil output growth in ‘light, tight’ oil production in the North Dakota [[Bakken formation|Bakken]], the [[Permian basin|Permian]] and [[Eagle Ford]] Basins in Texas, while rejuvenating economic growth in "U.S. refining, petrochemical and associated transportation industries, rail &amp; pipelines", [it also] "destabilized international oil markets."{{Sfn|Mohr|2014}}
 
Since 2000, the wider use of [[Extraction of petroleum|oil extraction]] technologies such as [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Directional drilling|horizontal drilling]], have caused [[North Dakota oil boom|a production boom]] in the [[Bakken formation]] which lies beneath the northwestern part of [[North Dakota]].{{Sfn|Shactman|2011}}{{Sfn|Fernando|Jin|2010}}{{Sfn|Shaffer|2012}} WSC and Bakken compete for pipelines and railway space. By the end of 2010, oil production rates had reached {{convert|458000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, thereby outstripping the pipeline capacity to ship oil out of the Bakken.{{Sfn|Fox News|2010}}{{Sfn|Clark|2011}} This oil competes with WCS for access to transportation by pipeline and rail. Bakken production has also increased in Canada, although to a lesser degree than in the US, since the 2004 discovery of the Viewfield Oil Field in Saskatchewan. The same techniques of horizontal drilling and multi-stage massive hydraulic fracturing are used. In December 2012, 2,357 Bakken wells in Saskatchewan produced a record high of {{convert|71000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=2}}.{{Sfn|Kohlruss et al|2013}} The Bakken Formation also produces in Manitoba, but the yield is small, averaging less than {{convert|2000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sigfig=1}} in 2012.{{Sfn|Government of Manitoba|2013}}

"Just over 21% of North Dakota’s total 2013 gross domestic product (GDP) of $49.77 billion comes from natural resources and mining."{{Sfn|24/7 Wall Street|2014}}

{{quote|"The state levies a 5% production tax on the gross value at the wellhead of all oil produced in the state, with some exceptions. The state also levies an oil extraction (excise) tax on produced oil. In 2012 the state collected $1.68 billion in oil revenues, up 71.4% over its 2011 collections. Oil taxes provide 42.3% of the state’s total net revenues, nearly four times the individual income tax and more than eight times the revenue received from corporate income taxes. The state’s 5% oil production tax is split between state and county governments. The state treasurer takes 20% that it then allocates to cities and to an impact grant program. The remaining 80% is split between the state and county governments according to a mandated formula."|source=Auskick 2014}}

{{quote|"The state created a legacy fund in 2010 — similar to a sovereign wealth fund in foreign nations — to salt away some of the state’s revenues from oil and gas production. By law, 30% of the state’s oil and gas taxes (after some mandated distributions) are deposited in the legacy fund. This has resulted in oil and gas tax collections of $446.3 million for fiscal year 2012, $824.7 million for fiscal year 2013 and $926.6 million for fiscal year 2014."|source=Auskick 2014}}

== Royalties ==

Royalty rates in Alberta are based on the price of WTI. That royalty rate is applied to a project's net revenue if the project has reached payout or Gross Revenue if the project has not yet reached payout. A project's revenue is a direct function of the price it is able to sell its crude for. Since WCS is a benchmark for oil sands crudes, revenues in the oil sands are discounted when the price of WCS is discounted. Those price discounts flow through to the royalty payments.

The Province of Alberta receives a portion of benefits from the development of energy resources in the form of royalties that fund in part programs like health, education and infrastructure.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|1}}

In 2006-7, the oil sands royalty revenue was $2.411 billion. In 2007/08, it rose to $2.913 billion and it continued to rise in 2008/09 to $2.973 billion. Following the revised Alberta Royalty Regime, it fell in 2009/10 to $1.008 billion.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}} In that year, Alberta's total resource revenue "fell below $7 billion...when the world economy was in the grip of recession."{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}}

In February 2012, the Province of Alberta "expected $13.4 billion in revenue from non-renewable resources in 2013-14.{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} By January 2013, the province was anticipating only $7.4 billion. "30 per cent of Alberta’s approximately $40-billion budget is funded through oil and gas revenues. Bitumen royalties represent about half of that total."{{sfn|O'Donnell|Gerein|2013}} In 2009/10, royalties from the oil sands amounted to $1.008 billion (Budget 2009 cited in Energy Alberta 2009.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|10}}

In order to accelerate development of the oil sands, the federal and provincial governments more closely aligned taxation of the oil sands with other surface mining resulting in "charging one per cent of a project’s gross revenues until the project’s investment costs are paid in full at which point rates increased to 25 per cent of net revenue. These policy changes and higher oil prices after 2003 had the desired effect of accelerating the development of the oil sands industry.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|1}} "A revised Alberta Royalty Regime was implemented on January 1, 2009.{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}{{rp|7}} through which each oil sands project pays a gross revenue royalty rate of 1% (Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011:30).&lt;ref name="energy_alberta2011" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011 summarizes the [[petroleum fiscal regime]]s for the western provinces and territories. The Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes described how royalty payments were calculated:&lt;ref name="energy_alberta2011" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

{{quote|"After an oil sands royalty project reaches payout, the royalty payable to the Crown is equal to the greater of: (a) the gross revenue royalty (1% - 9%) for the period, and (b) the royalty percentage (25% - 40%) of net revenue for the period. Effective January 1, 2009 the royalty percentage of net revenue is also indexed to the Canadian dollar price of WTI. It is 25% when the WTI price is less than or equal to $55/bbl, rising linearly to a maximum of 40% when the price reaches $120/bbl.

For royalty purposes, net revenue equals project revenue less allowed costs."|Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes}}When the price of oil per barrel is less than or equal to $55/bbl indexed against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) (Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011:30)(Indexed to the Canadian dollar price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) (Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes 2011:30) to a maximum of 9%). When the price of oil per barrel is less than or equal to $120/ bbl indexed against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) "payout."&lt;ref name="energy_alberta2011" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

Payout refers "the first time when the developer has recovered all the allowed costs of the project, including a return allowance on those costs equal to the Government of Canada long-term bond rate ["LTBR"].&lt;ref name="energy_alberta2011"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Tenure/pdfs/FISREG.pdf|format=PDF|title=Oil and Gas Fiscal Regimes: Western Canadian Provinces and Territories|date=June 2011|work=Alberta Department of Energy|isbn=978-0-7785-9423-9|location=Edmonton, Alberta}} This summarizes the petroleum fiscal regimes for the western provinces and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In order to encourage growth and prosperity and due to the extremely high cost of exploration, research and development, oil sands and mining operations pay no corporate, federal, provincial taxes or government royalties other than personal income taxes as companies often remain in a loss position for tax and royalty purposes for many years. Defining a loss position becomes increasingly complex when [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] multi-national energy companies are involved. Suncor claims their realized losses were legitimate and that [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) is unfairly claiming "$1.2-billion" in taxes which is jeopardizing their operations.{{sfn|Vanderklippe|2013b}}

=== Oil Sands Royalty Rates ===

"Bitumen Valuation Methodology (BVM) is a method to determine for royalty purposes a value for bitumen produced in oil sands projects and either upgraded on-site or sold or transferred to affiliates. The BVM ensures that Alberta receives market value for its bitumen production, taken in cash or bitumen royalty-in-kind, through the royalty formula. Western Canadian Select (WCS), a grade or blend of Alberta bitumens, diluents (a product such as [[naphtha]] or [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] which is added to increase the ability of the oil to flow through a pipeline) and conventional heavy oils, developed by Alberta producers and stored and valued at Hardisty, AB was determined to be the best reference crude price in the development of a BVM."{{sfn|Government of Alberta|2009}}

=== Bitumen Bubble ===
[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production.png|thumb|150px|Athabasca Oil Sands Planned Production 2012]]

In January 2013, the then [[Premier of Alberta]], [[Alison Redford]], used the term bitumen bubble to explain the impact of a dramatic and unanticipated drop in the amount of taxes and revenue from the oil sands linked to the deep discount price of Western Canadian Select against [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]] and Maya crude oil, would result in deep cuts in the 2013 provincial budget.{{sfn|Kleiss|2013}} In 2012 oil prices rose and fell all year. Premier Redford described the "bitumen bubble" as the differential or "spread between the different prices and the lower price for Alberta's Western Canadian Select (WCS)." In 2013 alone, the "bitumen bubble" effect will result in about six billion dollars less in provincial revenue.{{sfn|Redford|2013}}

'''Wind power''' is the use of [[wind|air flow]] through [[wind turbine]]s to provide the [[mechanical power]] to turn [[electric generator]]s. Wind power, as an alternative to burning [[fossil fuel]]s, is plentiful, [[renewable energy|renewable]], widely distributed, [[Sustainable energy|clean]], produces no [[greenhouse gas]] emissions during operation, consumes no water, and uses little land.&lt;ref name="landuse"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fthenakis | first1 = V. | last2 = Kim | first2 = H.

Wind power gives [[variable renewable energy|variable power]], which is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. 
It is therefore used in conjunction with other [[electric power source]]s to give a reliable supply.

== History ==
{{Main article|History of wind power}}
[[File:Wind turbine 1888 Charles Brush.jpg|thumb|[[Charles F. Brush|Charles Brush's]] windmill of 1888, used for generating electric power.]]

Wind power has been used as long as humans have put [[sailing ships|sails]] into the wind. For more than two millennia [[Windmill|wind-powered machines]] have ground grain and pumped water. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the [[Polder#Polders and the Netherlands|polders of the Netherlands]], and in arid regions such as the [[American mid-west]] or the [[Australian outback]], [[wind pump]]s provided water for livestock and steam engines.

The first windmill used for the production of electric power was built in [[Scotland]] in July 1887 by [[Prof James Blyth]] of [[Anderson's College]], Glasgow (the precursor of [[Strathclyde University]]).&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price |first=Trevor J |title=James Blyth – Britain's First Modern Wind Power Engineer |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=191–200 |date=3 May 2005 |doi=10.1260/030952405774354921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth's {{convert|10|m|ft}} high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at [[Marykirk]] in [[Kincardineshire]] and was used to charge [[accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] developed by the Frenchman [[Camille Alphonse Faure]], to power the lighting in the cottage,&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power.&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc |title=World First for Scotland Gives Engineering Student a History Lesson |last=Shackleton |first=Jonathan |publisher=The Robert Gordon University |accessdate=20 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063550/http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was "the work of the devil."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

Across the Atlantic, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887–1888 by [[Charles F. Brush]],&lt;ref&gt;Anon. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mr-brushs-windmill-dynamo/ Mr. Brush's Windmill Dynamo], ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 63 No. 25, 20 December 1890, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F. Brush] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080908061207/http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm |date=8 September 2008 }}, Danish Wind Industry Association. Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brush wind turbine had a rotor {{convert|17|m|ft}} in diameter and was mounted on an {{convert|18|m|ft}} tower. Although large by today's standards, the machine was only rated at 12&amp;nbsp;kW. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 [[incandescent light bulb]]s, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush's laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Wind Energy" in Cutler J. Cleveland (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Energy''. Vol. 6, Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-1-60119-433-6}}, 2007, pp. 421–422&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] that provide electric power to national electrical networks.

Wind energy is the [[kinetic energy]] of air in motion, also called [[wind]].
Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary surface with area ''A'' during the time ''t'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(Avt\rho)v^2 = \frac{1}{2}At\rho v^3,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=physics&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/S2010/EP/Materials4Students/Valentine/Grogg.pdf | title=Harvesting the Wind: The Physics of Wind Turbines | format=PDF | accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[density of air]]; ''v'' is the wind [[speed]]; ''Avt'' is the volume of air passing through ''A'' (which is considered perpendicular to the direction of the wind); ''Avtρ'' is therefore the mass ''m'' passing through "A". Note that ½ ''ρv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume.

Power is energy per unit time, so the wind power incident on ''A'' (e.g. equal to the rotor area of a wind turbine) is:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{1}{2}A\rho v^3.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=physics /&gt;

Wind power in an open air stream is thus ''proportional'' to the ''third power'' of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.

Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth, affected by areas of high pressure and of low pressure.&lt;ref name="what is wind?"&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304181329/http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html|archivedate=4 March 2011 | title=What is wind? | year=2010 | website=Renewable UK: Education and careers | publisher=Renewable UK | accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over the period from 1979 to 2010, 1.31 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/13919173/A%2032-year%20Perspective%20on%20the%20Origin%20of%20Wind%20Energy%20in%20a%20warming%20Climate.pdf?sequence=1|title=A 32-year perspective on the origin of wind energy in a warming climate|journal=Renewable Energy| volume=77 |pages=482–492 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2014.12.045|last1=Huang|first1=Junling|last2=McElroy|first2=Michael B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[wind resource assessment]] it is possible to provide estimates of wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. A global assessment of wind power potential is available via the [[Global Wind Atlas]] provided by the [[Technical University of Denmark]] in partnership with the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="global_wind_atlas"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/11/28/mapping-the-worlds-wind-energy-potential Mapping the World's Wind Energy Potential] ''[[World Bank]]'', 28 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/news/2017/11/new-global-wind-atlas-to-be-presented-at-windeurope-conference New Global Wind Atlas to be presented at WindEurope Conference] ''[[Technical University of Denmark]]'', 21 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as [[Renewables.ninja]] provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staffell | first1 = Iain | last2 = Pfenninger | first2 = Stefan | title = Using bias-corrected reanalysis to simulate current and future wind power output | date = 1 November 2016
 | journal = Energy | volume = 114 | pages = 1224–1239 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.068}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More detailed, site specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers will maintain in-house modeling capabilities.

The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/how-much-wind-energy-is-there-brian-hurley-wind-site-evaluation-ltd.html | title=How Much Wind Energy is there?&amp;nbsp;– Brian Hurley&amp;nbsp;– Wind Site Evaluation Ltd | last=Hurley | first=Brian | publisher=Claverton Group | accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Axel Kleidon of the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]] in Germany, carried out a "top down" calculation on how much wind energy there is, starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere. He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted.&lt;ref name=nsc2012 /&gt;

Cristina Archer and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] presented a "bottom-up" estimate, which unlike Kleidon's are based on actual measurements of wind speeds, and found that there is 1700 TW of wind power at an altitude of 100&amp;nbsp;metres over land and sea. Of this, "between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and cost-competitive manner".&lt;ref name=nsc2012&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328491.700-power-paradox-clean-might-not-be-green-forever.html?full=true&amp;print=true | title=Power paradox: Clean Might Not Be Green Forever |author1=Ananthaswamy, Anil |author2=Le Page, Michael |lastauthoramp=yes | date=30 January 2012 | website=New Scientist }}

&lt;/ref&gt; They later estimated 80 TW.&lt;ref name=Jacobson2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = M. Z. | last2 = Archer | first2 = C.

The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there.

To assess prospective wind power sites a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.savenkov.org/publications/Savenkov_on_the_truncated_weibull_distribution_2009.pdf |author=Savenkov, M |year=2009 |title=On the truncated weibull distribution and its usefulness in evaluating potential wind (or wave) energy sites |journal=University Journal of Engineering and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222120957/http://www.savenkov.org/publications/Savenkov_on_the_truncated_weibull_distribution_2009.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]] model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a [[Rayleigh distribution]] can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wind-power-program.com/wind_statistics.htm | title=Wind Statistics and the Weibull Distribution | publisher=Wind-power-program.com | accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wind farm is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used for production of electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. For example, [[Gansu Wind Farm]], the largest wind farm in the world, has several thousand turbines. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Almost all large wind turbines have the same design&amp;nbsp;— a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with three blades, attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower.

In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (often 34.5 kV), power collection system and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Johan|last2=Meneveau|first2=Charles|date=1 March 2012|title=Optimal turbine spacing in fully developed wind farm boundary layers|journal=Wind Energy|volume=15|issue=2|pages=305–317|doi=10.1002/we.469|bibcode=2012WiEn...15..305M}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a [[transformer]] for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Generator characteristics and stability ===

[[Induction generator]]s, which were often used for wind power projects in the 1980s and 1990s, require [[reactive power]] for [[Excitation (magnetic)|excitation]] so [[Electrical substation|substations]] used in wind-power collection systems include substantial [[capacitor]] banks for [[power factor correction]]. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so [[Wind energy software|extensive modelling]] of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.

Today these generators aren't used any more in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have [[Low voltage ride through]]-capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Falahi|first=G.|last2=Huang|first2=A.|date=1 October 2014|title=Low voltage ride through control of modular multilevel converter based HVDC systems|journal=IECON 2014 – 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society|pages=4663–4668|doi=10.1109/IECON.2014.7049205|isbn=978-1-4799-4032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern concepts use either [[Doubly fed electric machine|doubly fed machines]] with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2014.08.037|title=The state of the art of wind energy conversion systems and technologies: A review|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=88|page=332|year=2014|last1=Cheng|first1=Ming|last2=Zhu|first2=Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a [[grid code]] to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid.

Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.&lt;ref name="Hulazan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewables-info.com/drawbacks_and_benefits/offshore_wind_power_%E2%80%93_advantages_and_disadvantages.html|title=Offshore wind power&amp;nbsp;– Advantages and disadvantages |last=Hulazan|first=Ned|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Renewable Energy Articles|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millborrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windpowermonthly.com/go/europe/news/1021043/Cutting-cost-offshore-wind-energy/|title=Cutting the cost of offshore wind energy|last=Millborrow|first=David|date=6 August 2010|website=Wind Power Monthly|publisher=Haymarket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Siemens]] and [[Vestas]] are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power. [[Ørsted (company)|Ørsted]], [[Vattenfall]] and [[E.ON]] are the leading offshore operators.&lt;ref name=btm2010o /&gt; As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to [[BTM Consult]], more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the US.&lt;ref name="btm2010o" /&gt; The UK's investments in offshore wind power have resulted in a rapid decrease of the usage of coal as an energy source between 2012 and 2017, as well as a drop in the usage of natural gas as an energy source in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/winds-of-change-britain-now-generates-twice-as-much-electricity-from-wind-as-coal-89598|title=Winds of change: Britain now generates twice as much electricity from wind as coal|last=Wilson|first=Grant|work=The Conversation|access-date=17 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collection and transmission network ===

In a [[wind farm]], individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.
[[File:Vetropark Košava Zagajica.ogv|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Wind Power in [[Serbia]]]]
A transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.

One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Wald, Matthew (26 August 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Wind Energy Bumps Into Power Grid’s Limits]. ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.&lt;ref&gt;Power System Analysis and Design.Glover, Sarma, Overbye/ 5th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/news/there-is-a-problem-withwind-power-in-maine_2013-08-04.html?pagenum=full Inadequate transmission lines keeping some Maine wind power off the grid – The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram].

In 2015 wind power constituted 15.6% of all installed power generation capacity in the European Union and it generated around 11.4% of its power.&lt;ref name=EWEA2015 /&gt;

World wind generation capacity more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006, doubling about every 3 years. 
[[Wind power in the United States|The United States pioneered wind farms]] and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s. 
In 1997 installed capacity in Germany surpassed the United States and led until once again overtaken by the United States in 2008. 
China has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the United States in 2010 to become the world leader. 
As of 2011, 83 countries around the world were using wind power on a commercial basis.&lt;ref name=ren212011 /&gt;

The actual amount of electric power that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the [[nameplate capacity]] by the [[capacity factor]], which varies according to equipment and location. 
Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of 35% to 44%.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Tidball and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/48595.pdf "Cost and Performance Assumptions for Modeling Electricity Generation Technologies"], US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, November 2010, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth trends ===
[[File:GlobalWindPowerCumulativeCapacity-withForecast.png|thumb|right|Worldwide installed wind power capacity forecast&lt;ref name="GWEC_Market" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GWEC_Forcast" /&gt;]]

The wind power industry set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth resulting in the 60 GW mark being passed.&lt;ref name="GWEC-Forecast-2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/market-forecast-2012-2016/ |title=Market Forecast for 2016–2020 |date= |accessdate=27 May 2016 |website=report |publisher=GWEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. [[Global Wind Energy Council]] (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector has become one of the important players in the energy markets, with the total investments reaching {{Currency|329|USD}}bn ({{Currency|296.6|EUR}}bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.&lt;ref name="GWEC-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/vip/GWEC-Global-Wind-2015-Report_April-2016_22_04.pdf |title=Global Wind Report 2014 – Annual Market Update |page=9 |date=22 April 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |format=PDF |website=report |publisher=GWEC |quote=2015 was an unprecedented year for the wind industry as annual installations crossed the 60 GW mark for the first time, and more than 63 GW of new wind power capacity was brought on line. The last record was set in 2014 when over 51.7 GW of new capacity was installed globally. In 2015 total investments in the clean energy sector reached a record USD 329 [[Billion|bn]] (EUR 296.6 bn). The new global total for wind power at the end of 2015 was 432.9 GW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gwec2007" /&gt;

Although the [[wind power industry]] was affected by the [[Late-2000s recession|global financial crisis]] in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW by the end of 2020&lt;ref name="GWEC-Forecast-2016" /&gt; and 4,042 GW by end of 2050.&lt;ref name="GWEC-Forecast-2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/GWEO2014_WEB.pdf |title=Global Wind Energy Outlook 2014 |date= October 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |format=PDF |website=report |publisher=GWEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore for the next few years are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.

In the EU in 2015, 44% of all new generating capacity was wind power; while in the same period net fossil fuel power capacity decreased.&lt;ref name=EWEA2015/&gt;

=== Capacity factor ===

Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm's annual [[energy]] production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the [[capacity factor]]. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at the upper end of the range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.&lt;ref name="ceereCapInter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=capacity-factor-50&gt;{{cite web|last=Shahan |first=Zachary |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2012/7/27/wind-turbine-net-capacity-factor-50-the-new-normal/|title=Wind Turbine Net Capacity Factor&amp;nbsp;– 50% the New Normal? |publisher=Cleantechnica.com |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;MW turbine with a capacity factor of 35% will not produce 8,760&amp;nbsp;MW·h in a year (1 × 24 × 365), but only 1 × 0.35 × 24 × 365&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3,066&amp;nbsp;MW·h, averaging to 0.35&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;/ref&gt;

Online data is available for some locations, and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output.&lt;ref name="MassMaritime" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iesoOntarioWind" /&gt; For example, the German nationwide average wind power capacity factor over all of 2012 was just under 17.5% (45,867 GW·h/yr / (29.9 GW × 24 × 366) = 0.1746),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/news/electricity-production-from-solar-and-wind-in-germany-in-2012.pdf |title=Electricity production from solar and wind in Germany in 2012 |date=8 February 2013 |publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FPO6HLOq?url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/news/electricity-production-from-solar-and-wind-in-germany-in-2012.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2013 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the capacity factor for Scottish wind farms averaged 24% between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref name =WindPower&gt;(6 April 2011) [http://www.jmt.org/news.asp?s=2&amp;cat=Campaigning&amp;nid=JMT-N10561 Report Questions Wind Power’s Ability to Deliver Electricity When Most Needed] John Muir Trust and Stuart Young Consulting, Retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike fueled generating plants, the capacity factor is affected by several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site and the size of the [[Electric generator|generator]] relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less [[electric power]] (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may [[Stall (flight)|stall]] out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.&lt;ref name=capacity-factor-50 /&gt;&lt;ref name="capFactors" /&gt;

A 2008 study released by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that the capacity factor of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves, and projected further improvements for future capacity factors.&lt;ref name="Windpowering" /&gt; In 2010, the department estimated the capacity factor of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/TCDB/ |title=Transparent Cost Database |publisher=En.openei.org |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual average capacity factor for wind generation in the US has varied between 29.8% and 34% during the period 2010–2015.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_6_07_b Table 6.7B, Capacity factors], Electric Power Monthly, June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation. The wind power penetration in world electric power generation in 2015 was 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2016 – Electricity|url=http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2016/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2016-electricity.pdf|publisher=BP|accessdate=12 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910023428/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2016/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2016-electricity.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2016 – Renewable energy |url=http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2016/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2016-renewable-energy.pdf |publisher=BP |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit for a particular [[Electrical grid|grid]] will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for [[energy storage]], demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include [[Operating reserve|reserve generating]] and [[Electric power transmission#Capacity|transmission capacity]] to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty.&lt;ref name="tacklingUS" /&gt; These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable energy]] or [[hydropower]] with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.&lt;ref name="NGestimates" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minnesota" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESB2004Study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sinclairMerz" /&gt;

A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum,&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, Tino.

In Australia, the state of South Australia generates around half of the nation's wind power capacity. By the end of 2011 wind power in South Australia, championed by Premier (and Climate Change Minister) Mike Rann, reached 26% of the State's electric power generation, edging out coal for the first time.&lt;ref name="National Policy 2012"&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, 11 June 2012, "What States Can Do: The Clean Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage South Australia, with only 7.2% of Australia's population, had 54% of Australia's installed capacity.&lt;ref name="ree2011prelim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National Policy 2012"/&gt;

=== Variability ===

{{Main article|Variable renewable energy}}
{{Further information|Grid balancing}}

[[File:Toro de osborne.jpg|thumb|Wind turbines are typically installed in favorable windy locations. In the image, wind power [[Wind power in Spain|generators in Spain]], near an [[Osborne bull]].]]

Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables.

Fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation.

Wind power is variable, and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of [[intermittent power source]]s such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.

Presently, grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of [[natural gas]] spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.&lt;ref name="is windpower reliable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clavertonReliable" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milligan, Michael (October 2010) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49019.pdf Operating Reserves and Wind Power Integration: An International Comparison]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

GE has installed a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery similar to that of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.&lt;ref&gt;Bullis, Kevin. "[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514331/wind-turbines-battery-included-can-keep-power-supplies-stable/ Wind Turbines, Battery Included, Can Keep Power Supplies Stable]" [[Technology Review]], 7 May 2013. Accessed: 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK there were 124 separate occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell to less than 2% of installed capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windaction.org/posts/30544-report-questions-wind-power-s-ability-to-deliver-electricity-when-most-needed#.WHkNM7kSiyA "Analysis of UK Wind Generation"] 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002.&lt;ref name="Denmark" /&gt; Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC.&lt;ref name="Czisch-Giebel" /&gt; Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power.&lt;ref name="Denmark" /&gt; According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the ''Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology'', interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, [[baseload power|baseload electric power]] which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.&lt;ref name="connecting_wind_farms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer2007" /&gt;

Conversely, on particularly windy days, even with penetration levels of 16%, wind power generation can surpass all other electric power sources in a country. In Spain, in the early hours of 16 April 2012 wind power production reached the highest percentage of electric power production till then, at 60.46% of the total demand.&lt;ref name=eolica/&gt; In Denmark, which had power market penetration of 30% in 2013, over 90&amp;nbsp;hours, wind power generated 100% of the country's power, peaking at 122% of the country's demand at 2&amp;nbsp;am on 28 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecontributor.com/environment/how-wind-met-all-denmark%E2%80%99s-electricity-needs-90-hours|title=How Wind Met All of Denmark's Electricity Needs for 90 Hours|author=Bentham Paulos|website=The Contributor|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[International Energy Agency]] forum presented costs for managing intermittency as a function of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.&lt;ref name="abbess" /&gt;

The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world:

{{quote|In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electric power grids". In fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the [[International Energy Agency]], has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more.|&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Amory Lovins|year=2011|title=Reinventing Fire|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|page=199|title-link=Reinventing Fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Solar power]] tends to be complementary to wind.&lt;ref name="windsun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smallWindSystems" /&gt; On daily to weekly timescales, [[high pressure area]]s tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas [[low pressure area]]s tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[Wind power in California|California]] is an exception.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cleveland_water_crib" /&gt; Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant" /&gt;

=== Predictability ===

{{Main article|Wind power forecasting}}
Wind power forecasting methods are used, but predictability of any particular wind farm is low for short-term operation. For any particular generator there is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in an hour and a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/wind/systemsintegration/system_integration_basics.html |title=Wind Systems Integration Basics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607000124/http://www.nrel.gov/wind/systemsintegration/system_integration_basics.html |archivedate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, studies by Graham Sinden (2009) suggest that, in practice, the variations in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed. As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.&lt;ref name = Diesendorf&gt;{{cite journal| author=Diesendorf, Mark |year=2007 |title=Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy |page=119 |quote=Graham Sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom. He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200 km to 0.25 at 600 km separation (a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.) There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom, and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year.|title-link=Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable.&lt;ref name="huang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwig.org/IEA_Report_on_variability.pdf |title=Variability of Wind Power and other Renewables: Management Options and Strategies |publisher=IEA |year=2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230204247/http://www.uwig.org/IEA_Report_on_variability.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind power hardly ever suffers major technical failures, since failures of individual wind turbines have hardly any effect on overall power, so that the distributed wind power is reliable and predictable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Kristen |title=The reliability of wind power |url=http://www.mndaily.com/2012/11/5/reliability-wind-power |newspaper=Minnesota Daily |date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source? |date=October 2014}} whereas conventional generators, while far less variable, can suffer major unpredictable outages.

=== Energy storage ===
{{main article|Grid energy storage}}{{see also|List of energy storage projects}}
[[File:Adam Beck Complex.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations|Sir Adam Beck Generating Complex]] at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls, Canada]], includes a large [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage hydroelectricity reservoir]]. During hours of low electrical demand excess [[electrical grid]] power is used to pump water up into the reservoir, which then provides an extra 174 MW of electric power during periods of peak demand.]]

Typically, conventional [[hydroelectricity]] complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.

Alternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] such as [[compressed air energy storage]] and [[thermal energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant|Dinorwig pumped-storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.&lt;ref name="dinorwig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="futureStorage" /&gt;

In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the U.S. states of [[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electric power demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;&lt;ref name="geothermal_incentive" /&gt; widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC "[[super grid]]". In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least USD 60 bn,&lt;ref name="slogin" /&gt; while the society value of added windpower would be more than that cost.&lt;ref name=usvis&gt;"[https://www.energy.gov/windvision A New Era for Wind Power in the United States]" page XIV. ''[[United States Department of Energy]]'', 2013. Retrieved: March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has an installed capacity of wind and solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012.&lt;ref name="DW Welle-2012.11.11"&gt;Birkenstock, Günther.

Retrieved 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days [[Global strategic petroleum reserves|strategic reserves]] of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf|title=European Renewable Energy Network|format=PDF|page=71|date=January 2012|author=Altmann, M.|publisher=European Parliament|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity credit, fuel savings and energy payback ===

The capacity credit of wind is estimated by determining the capacity of conventional plants displaced by wind power, whilst maintaining the same degree of system security.&lt;ref name="The facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power/ |title=Capacity Credit of Wind Power: Capacity credit is the measure for firm wind power |website=Wind Energy the Facts |publisher=EWEA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325212512/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power/capacity-credit-values-of-wind-power.html |title=Capacity Credit Values of Wind Power |publisher=Wind-energy-the-facts.org |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fCg8P8x1?url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power/capacity-credit-values-of-wind-power.html |archivedate=11 March 2009 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Wind Energy Association]], production of wind power in the United States in 2015 avoided consumption of 73 billion gallons of water and reduced {{co2}} emissions by 132 million metric tons, while providing USD 7.3 bn in public health savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awea.org/windandwater Wind Energy Conserving Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063748/http://www.awea.org/windandwater |date=5 June 2016 }}.

The energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life, [[Energy Return on Energy Invested]], of wind power varies but averages about 20–25.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160409063616/http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152560/ Energy return on investment (EROI) for wind energy].

&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the energy payback time is typically around a year.

== Economics ==

Wind turbines reached [[grid parity]] (the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources) in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.&lt;ref name="businessgreen"&gt;[http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2124487/onshore-wind-reach-grid-parity-2016 "Onshore wind to reach grid parity by 2016"], BusinessGreen, 14 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind power is [[capital intensive]], but has no fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;Dolf Gielen. "[http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-WIND_POWER.pdf Renewable Energy Technologies: Cost Analysis Series: Wind Power]" ''[[International Renewable Energy Agency]]'', June 2012. Accessed: 19 October 2013. Quote: "wind is capital intensive, but has no fuel costs"&lt;/ref&gt; The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgridus.com/non_html/c3-3_NG_wind_policy.pdf Transmission and Wind Energy: Capturing the Prevailing Winds for the Benefit of Customers]. National Grid US (September 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[marginal cost]] of wind energy once a station is constructed is usually less than 1-cent per kW·h.&lt;ref name="Patel" /&gt;

However, the estimated [[average cost]] per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be in excess of twenty years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. In 2004, wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s, and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt [[Wind turbine|turbines]] were mass-produced.&lt;ref name="helming" /&gt; In 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 2008–2010 but still above 2002 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LBNL/NREL Analysis Predicts Record Low LCOE for Wind Energy in 2012–2013 |website=US Department of Energy Wind Program Newsletter |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/wind/newsletter/detail.cfm/articleId=45 |accessdate=10 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305025648/http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/wind/newsletter/detail.cfm/articleId%3D45 |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated, "Wind's costs have dropped over the past two years, in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently.... about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electric power, and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year.... winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street's banks.... Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles.... 5,600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States, more than double the number at this point in 2010. Thirty-five percent of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind, more than new gas and coal plants combined, as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves."&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;

A British Wind Energy Association report gives an average generation cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005).&lt;ref name="BWEA" /&gt; Cost per unit of energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50.&lt;ref name="eiadoe" /&gt; Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011.&lt;ref name="ccc" /&gt; In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; it is also expected that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future.&lt;ref name=nicola/&gt; The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive [[peaking power plant]]s.&lt;ref name="meritorder" /&gt;

A 2012 EU study shows [[Cost of electricity by source|base cost]] of onshore wind power similar to coal, when subsidies and [[externalities]] are disregarded. Wind power has some of the lowest external costs.&lt;ref name=eu2012&gt;"[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/studies/doc/20141013_subsidies_costs_eu_energy.pdf Subsidies and costs of EU energy.

In February 2013 [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] New Energy Finance (BNEF) reported that the cost of generating electric power from new wind farms is cheaper than new coal or new baseload gas plants. When including the current [[Carbon pricing in Australia|Australian federal government carbon pricing]] scheme their modeling gives costs (in Australian dollars) of $80/MWh for new wind farms, $143/MWh for new coal plants and $116/MWh for new baseload gas plants. The modeling also shows that "even without a carbon price (the most efficient way to reduce economy-wide emissions) wind energy is 14% cheaper than new coal and 18% cheaper than new gas."&lt;ref name="bnef.com/2013/02/07/renewable-cheaper"&gt;{{cite news |title = Renewable energy now cheaper than new fossil fuels in Australia |newspaper = Bloomberg New Energy Finance |location = Sydney |publisher = Bloomberg Finance |date = 7 February 2013 |url = http://about.bnef.com/2013/02/07/renewable-energy-now-cheaper-than-new-fossil-fuels-in-australia/ |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130209233311/http://about.bnef.com/2013/02/07/renewable-energy-now-cheaper-than-new-fossil-fuels-in-australia/ |archivedate = 9 February 2013 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Part of the higher costs for new coal plants is due to high financial lending costs because of "the reputational damage of emissions-intensive investments". The expense of gas fired plants is partly due to "export market" effects on local prices. Costs of production from coal fired plants built in "the 1970s and 1980s" are cheaper than renewable energy sources because of depreciation.&lt;ref name="bnef.com/2013/02/07/renewable-cheaper" /&gt; In 2015 BNEF calculated LCOE prices per MWh energy in new powerplants (excluding carbon costs) :

''[[Lazard]]'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 US DOE report showed that in some cases [[power purchase agreement]] prices for wind power had dropped to record lows of $23.5/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/2014-Wind-Technologies-Market-Report-8.7.pdf 2014 Wind Technologies Market Report]. (PDF) . energy.gov (August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost has reduced as wind turbine technology has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/14/banner-year-us-wind-industry | title = A Banner Year for the U.S. Wind Industry | author = Danielson, David | date = 14 August 2012 | website = Whitehouse Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300&amp;nbsp;feet to 400&amp;nbsp;feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry’s New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of initiatives are working to reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the [[Carbon Trust]] Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims to reduce the cost of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/offshorewind |title=Offshore Wind Accelerator | publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrik Stiesdal]], former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind will be one of the cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/about-us/press/2014/09/global-wind-expert-offshore-wind-one-of-cheapest-uk-energy-sources-by-2025 |title=Global wind expert says offshore wind will be one of the cheapest UK energy sources by 2025 | publisher=The Carbon Trust |date=23 September 2014|accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrik Stiesdal|Stiesdal, Henrik]].

According to international surveyors, this study shows that cost cutting is projected to fluctuate between 24% and 30% by 2030.

Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from [[subsidy|subsidies]] in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.

In the US, wind power receives a production tax credit (PTC) of 1.5¢/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW·h produced, for the first ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW·h in 2012, the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012, to include construction begun in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=6 January 2013 | title = Wind Energy Gets a Boost Off Fiscal Cliff Deal | url = http://www.progressive.org/wind-energy-gets-boost-off-fiscal-cliff-deal

These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/11/italian-small-wind-growing-with-feed-in-tariffs |title=Italian Small Wind Growing with Feed-in Tariffs |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |author=Gipe, Paul |date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cmia.net/Portals/0/Repository/GWEC%20China%20wind%20tariffs.57301d14-f357-4176-9ebb-7d6921a7ef9d.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230536/http://www.cmia.net/Portals/0/Repository/GWEC%20China%20wind%20tariffs.57301d14-f357-4176-9ebb-7d6921a7ef9d.pdf | archivedate=2 May 2013 | title=The Development of Wind Power Tariffs in China| format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In December 2013 U.S. Senator [[Lamar Alexander]] and other Republican senators argued that the "wind energy production tax credit should be allowed to expire at the end of 2013"&lt;ref name="Tax Analysts TNT-2013.12.17-243-20"&gt;{{cite web | title=2013 TNT 243-20 Senators Say Wind Energy Credit Should Be Allowed To Expire | publisher=[[Tax Analysts]] | date=17 December 2013 | author=Alexander, Lamar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.

Secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power, even if there is a [[Renewable Energy Certificates|premium price for the electricity]]. For example, [[Corporate social responsibility|socially responsible manufacturers]] pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure. Companies use wind-generated power, and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong "green" efforts. In the US the organization Green-e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits.&lt;ref name="green-e" /&gt;
Turbine prices have fallen significantly in recent years due to tougher competitive conditions such as the increased use of energy auctions, and the elimination of subsidies in many markets. For example, [[Vestas]], a wind turbine manufacturer, whose largest onshore turbine can pump out 4.2 megawatts of power, enough to provide electricity to roughly 5,000 homes, has seen prices for its turbines fall from €950,000 per megawatt in late 2016, to around €800,000 per megawatt in the third quarter of 2017.&lt;ref name="As Wind Power Sector Grows, Turbine Makers Feel the Squeeze"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/energy-environment/wind-turbine-vestas.html | title=As Wind Power Sector Grows, Turbine Makers Feel the Squeeze | author=Reed, Stanley | date= 9 November 2017 | publisher=TNT }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in [[New York City]], where, since 2009, a number of building projects have capped their roofs with [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov-type helical wind turbines]]. Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings' overall consumption, they help to reinforce the building's 'green' credentials in ways that "showing people your high-tech boiler" cannot, with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]].&lt;ref name="NY Times-2014.05.27"&gt;

Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use [[grid energy storage]], thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.&lt;ref name="home-made" /&gt;

Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, [[photovoltaic]] or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.&lt;ref name="Cleantechnica-2009.05.13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/05/13/exploiting-the-downsides-of-wind-and-solar/ | title=Wind, Solar-Powered Street Lights Only Need a Charge Once Every Four Days | last=Kart | first=Jeff | date=13 May 2009 | website=Clean Technica | publisher=Clean Technica | accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Carbon Trust]] study into the potential of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electric power (0.4% of total UK electric power consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emission savings. This is based on the assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electric power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h.&lt;ref name="CarbonSmallTrust" /&gt; A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored [[Energy Saving Trust]] in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's electric power needs by 2050.&lt;ref name="New Scientist-2006.01.21"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamer | first=Mick | date = 21 January 2006 | title = The Rooftop Power Revolution | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2535 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925351.400-the-rooftop-power-revolution.html?full=true#bx253514B1 | accessdate = 11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed generation]] from [[renewable resource]]s is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of [[climate change]].

[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Livestock]] grazing near a wind turbine.&lt;ref name="livestock_ignore" /&gt;]]

The environmental impact of wind power when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the [[IPCC]], in assessments of the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources]], wind turbines have a [[median]] value of between 12 and 11 ([[gram|g]]{{CO2}}[[Carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kWh]]) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology – specific cost and performance parameters |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |publisher=IPCC |accessdate=1 August 2014 |page=10 |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616215117/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. pg 37 to 40,41 |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929140555/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other [[low carbon power]] sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest [[global warming potential]] per unit of electrical energy generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008|title=Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=37|page=37|year=2012|last1=Guezuraga|first1=Begoña|last2=Zauner|first2=Rudolf|last3=Pölz|first3=Werner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it, as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Wind Energy Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html |title=Wind energy Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=British Wind Energy Association |accessdate=21 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419225935/http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html |archivedate=19 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may&lt;ref name="Eilperin" /&gt; or may not&lt;ref name="rspb"/&gt; be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of [[peat bogs]],&lt;ref name="blanketpeat"/&gt; affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.

Wind turbines generate some noise. At a residential distance of {{convert|300|m}} this may be around 45&amp;nbsp;dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on|0}} distance they become inaudible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/post/92442325225/how-loud-is-a-wind-turbine How Loud Is A Wind Turbine?].

[[Nuclear power]] and [[fossil fuel]]s are [[energy subsidies|subsidized by many governments]], and wind power and other forms of renewable energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.elistore.org/Data/products/d19_07.pdf |title=Estimating U.S. Government Subsidies to Energy Sources: 2002–2008 |publisher=Environmental Law Institute |date=September 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072837/http://www.elistore.org/Data/products/d19_07.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74&amp;nbsp;billion for energy subsidies to support [[R&amp;D]] for [[nuclear power]] ($50 billion) and [[fossil fuels]] ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] received a total of US$26&amp;nbsp;billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely [[solar power]], wind power, and [[biofuels]].&lt;ref name=per /&gt; History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.&lt;ref name=per&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007).

According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) (2011), energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production. "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits".&lt;ref name=IEA-FS2011&gt; {{cite web | url= http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf | title=World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet How will global energy markets evolve to 2035? | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120204112700/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2012 | publisher=IEA | date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''Deploying Renewables 2011'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.

However, IEA's views are not universally accepted. Between 2010 and 2016, subsidies for wind were between 1.3¢ and 5.7¢ per kWh. Subsidies for coal, natural gas and nuclear are all between 0.05¢ and 0.2¢ per kWh over all years. On a per-kWh basis, wind is subsidized 50 times as much as traditional sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/05/30/why-do-federal-subsidies-make-renewable-energy-so-costly/#48349c06128c Why Do Federal Subsidies Make Renewable Energy So Costly?].

Following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], Germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy commercialization]], with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel-2011.03.23"&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,752791,00.html | title=Will Nuke Phase-Out Make Offshore Farms Attractive? | author=Schultz, Stefan | date=23 March 2011 | website=Der Spiegel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid Strategies]] in October 2007, 89 per cent of respondents said that using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power was positive for [[Canada]], because these sources were better for the environment. Only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be unreliable and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angus-reid.com/uppdf/ARS_Energy.pdf | title=Canadians favour energy sources that are better for the environment | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318232442/http://www.angus-reid.com/uppdf/ARS_Energy.pdf | archivedate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a Saint Consulting survey in April 2007, wind power was the [[alternative energy]] source most likely to gain public support for future development in Canada, with only 16% opposed to this type of energy. By contrast, 3 out of 4 Canadians opposed nuclear power developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tscg.biz/media/releases/Saint%20Index%20Canada%202007%20Energy.pdf | title=Wind power developments are least likely to be opposed by Canadians&amp;nbsp;– Nuclear power opposed by most | format=PDF | publisher=Saint Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 survey of residents living around [[Scotland]]'s 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html|date=25 August 2003|publisher=British Wind Energy Association | title=Wind farms make good neighbours | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215024756/http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html | archivedate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant.&lt;ref name="BBC News-2010.10.19"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11569466 | title = Rise in Scots wind farm support | date = 19 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wind turbine]]s are devices that convert the wind's [[kinetic energy]] into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of [[windmill]] development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and [[Vertical axis wind turbine|vertical axis]] types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as [[Battery charger|battery charging]] for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the [[electrical grid]]. Arrays of large turbines, known as [[wind farm]]s, have become an increasingly important source of [[renewable energy]] and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s.

Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a [[wind turbine]] to extract energy from the [[wind]].&lt;ref name="BERR"&gt; {{cite web | publisher =UK Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform | title =Efficiency and performance | url =http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | accessdate =29 December 2007 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090205054846/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | archivedate =5 February 2009 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert [[mechanical energy|mechanical rotation]] into [[electrical power]], and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.

In 1919 the German physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law|Betz limit]] can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Betz|Betz, A.]]; Randall, D. G. (trans.). ''Introduction to the Theory of Flow Machines'', Oxford: [[Pergamon Press]], 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Wind turbine aerodynamics|aerodynamics of a wind turbine]] are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the [[aerodynamics]] of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/what-factors-affect-the-output-of-wind-turbines/ | title=What factors affect the output of wind turbines? | publisher=Alternative-energy-news.info | date=24 July 2009 | accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the aerodynamic [[Wind turbine design#Blade design|design of the blades]], the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's [[Wind turbine design#The hub|rotor hub]], [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]], [[Wind turbine design#Tower|tower structure]], [[Electric generator|generator]], controls, and foundation.&lt;ref name="univ2011"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Zehnder, Alan T. |author2=Warhaft, Zellman

Turbine design makes extensive use of computer modelling and simulation tools. These are becoming increasingly sophisticated as highlighted by a recent state-of-the-art review by Hewitt et al.&lt;ref name="hewitt2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Hewitt, Sam |author2=Margetts, Lee |author3=Revell, Alistair |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Building a digital wind farm |journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering | date= 18 April 2017 |doi=10.1007/s11831-017-9222-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further design factors must also be considered when integrating wind turbines into [[electrical grid|electrical power grids]].

'''Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center''' is an [[accredited]] learning center located in [[Finland, Minnesota]]. It is a learning center that focuses on k-12 environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.wolf-ridge.org/about_wolf_ridge/i_about_us.shtml|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1969, Jack Pichotta created a program for students in a [[high school]] in [[Cloquet, Minnesota]]. The program replaces a week of normal classes and instead teaches about [[Environmentalism|environmental]] topics. These environmental topics are taught by over 100 environmental specialists. Pichotta joined a group of concerned educators to discuss environmental education in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://wolf-ridge.org/about/|publisher=Wolf-Ridge.org|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pichotta and his team decided to use a closed down [[U.S. Forest Service]] camp as a school to teach about the environment. The camp was named Isabella Environmental Learning center after the camp's previous name, Isabella Job Corps Camp.

In 1974 Pichotta and his team decided that the program would need a new permanent location. Between 1975 and 1985 the program moved to [[Finland, Minnesota]] and eventually evolved into Wolf Ridge.

==Campus==
Wolf Ridge's main campus was built in the [[Sawtooth Mountains (Minnesota)|Sawtooth Mountains]] on a [[precipice]] overlooking [[Lake Superior]]. The campus contains about 2000 acres of mixed conifer-hardwood forest. Wolf Ridge has 2 small lakes- Raven Lake and Wolf Lake, as well as several streams. The Baptism River also flows through the property. Hills on campus include the tallest, Mystical Mountain, which stands at ~1500 feet and Marshal Mountain, which stands at 1405 feet. The main campus consists of a Dining Hall, an Energy Center, an Education Building, and a Science Center, as well as both the East Dorm and the West Dorm.
