The '''Alliance for Peace and Freedom''' ('''APF''') is a [[far-right]] [[European political party]] founded on 4 February 2015. The main member parties had been involved in the now defunct [[European National Front]].

The APF maintains contacts with conservative circles in [[Russia]] and supports the policies of [[Vladimir Putin]], especially in the [[Ukraine crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/556ed172-d0b9-11e4-982a-00144feab7de.html#axzz3sG5rgdWo|title=To Russia with love, from Europe's far-right fringe|website=ft.com|date=22 March 2015|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains friendly relations with the [[Syrian Baath Party]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriatimes.sy/index.php/news/local/18192-alliance-of-peace-and-freedom-delegation-europe-must-take-syria-s-side-and-fight-terrorism|title=Alliance of Peace and Freedom delegation: Europe must take Syria's side and fight terrorism|website=syriatimes.sy|date=6 June 2015|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armed Forces of South Russia''' or '''AFSR''' ({{Lang-ru|Вооружённые силы Юга России|translit=Vooruzhyonniye sily Yuga Rossii, VSYuR}}) were formed on 8 January 1919, it incorporated many of the smaller formations of the [[White Army]] in [[South Russia (Russian Civil War)|South of Russia]] (called "White South" in [[Soviet historiography]]), including the [[Volunteer Army]] (which was renamed the Caucasian Volunteer Army).
Besides that, the AFSR included the [[Don Army]], the Crimean-Azov Army, the Forces of Northern Caucasus and the Turkestan Army.

In January 1919, it numbered 51,000 Infantry, 34,000 Cavalry, 204 Field guns, 682 machine guns and 6 armoured trains. By July 1919 it had grown to 104,000 Infantry, 56,000 Cavalry, 600 Field guns, 1,500 machine guns, 19 aircraft, 34 armoured trains, 1 Cruiser, 5 Destroyers, 4 Submarines and 20 Gunboats.{{cn|date=December 2017}}
By October, after heavy losses and the transfer of units to other armies, the armies' strength fell drastically.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

The [[Volunteer Army]] from its inception until January 23, 1919 carried the same name. Then after becoming a part of the Armed Forces of South Russia, from January 23, 1919, until May 22, 1919, it was renamed to Caucasus Volunteer Army. On May 22, it split into two formations: the [[Caucasus Army of VSUR|Caucasus Army]], and the Volunteer Army. The Caucasus Army disbanded on January 29, 1920 and was replaced by the short-lived Kuban Army. Troops of the Kuban Army ended up surrendering by April 18–20, 1920 to the [[Red Army]]. The Volunteer Army continued to exist from May 22, 1919 until March 26/27, 1920, when the remaining troops were [[Evacuation of Novorossiysk (1920)|evacuated from Novorossiysk]] to [[Crimea]]. Most then merged there with Wrangel's forces.

In early April 1920, [[Anton Denikin]], commander-in-chief of the AFSR, delegated all authority to [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Pyotr Wrangel]], who took command of the so-called "[[Russian Army (1920)|Russian Army]]", which included all units remaining from the AFSR after its defeat in the Northern Caucasus.

'''Ban Bossy''' is a [[self censorship]] campaign launched in 2014 by [[LeanIn.org]]. The campaign criticizes the use of the word "bossy" to describe assertive girls and women, proposing that the word is stigmatizing and may discourage girls and women from seeking positions of leadership.&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dad: I'm Going to Keep Calling My Daughter Bossy|url=http://time.com/27200/dad-why-im-going-to-keep-calling-my-daughter-bossy/|publisher=''[[Time Warner]]''|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion ==
Sponsored primarily by [[Sheryl Sandberg]], [[Lean In|LeanIn.org]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]], the campaign features prominent bossy women and various sponsors urging people to pledge not to use the word.

Featured advocates who appear in Ban Bossy promotional material in addition to Sandberg include [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jane Lynch]], [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Arne Duncan]], [[Anna Maria Chávez]],&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sandberg|first1=Sheryl|last2=Chávez|first2=Anna Maria|title=Sheryl Sandberg and Anna Maria Chávez on 'Bossy,' the Other B-word|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304360704579419150649284412|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Beckham]], and [[Beyoncé]], who stated "leadership is more important to boys than girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5930509/beyonce-backs-campaign-to-ban-bossy-watch |title=Beyonce Backs Campaign to 'Ban Bossy': Watch |publisher=Billboard |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jolie Lee |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/03/10/ban-bossy-sheryl-sandberg-beyonce-gardner/6262309/|title=Beyonce, Jennifer Garner, Jane Lynch join 'Ban Bossy" campaign.|publisher=USAToday.com |date=2014-05-10 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPost1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook COO Sandberg's ludicrous crusade against bossy|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/17/facebook-coo-sandbergs-ludicrous-crusade-against-bossy/|publisher=''[[New York Post]]''|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYDNews1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, Jane Lynch join prominent women in #BanBossy campaign|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/beyonce-jennifer-garner-join-banbossy-campaign-article-1.1716554|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|accessdate=8 August 2014|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign website also features training material designed for schools, teachers, parents and children to further the project.

== Criticism ==
The campaign has received criticism since its launch. [[Joan Rivers]] commented that she found the online movement to be "so stupid" and added, "I find it outrageous and I find it petty ... and I find we're so damn uptight in this country that this whole country is being divided."&lt;ref name="SiriusXM1"&gt;{{cite web|title='It's so stupid'– Joan Rivers isn't a fan of 'ban bossy'|url=http://blog.siriusxm.com/2014/03/25/its-so-stupid-joan-rivers-isnt-a-fan-of-ban-bossy/|publisher=[[SiriusXM]] |accessdate=11 April 2014|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phil Mason]] has drawn parallels between the banning of words and [[authoritarianism]], observing that telling people what words they can or cannot use is inherently bossy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thunderf00t |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVKyesBzDAs |title=Epic Feminist Fails of our time: 'Ban Bossy' |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-03-29 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Margaret Talbot]] criticized the campaign itself as bossy and instead suggested reclaiming the word, much as has been done for "nerd" and "queer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dont-ban-bossy|title=Don’t Ban "Bossy"|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Talbot|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[Media Research Center#NewsBusters|NewsBusters]]'' blogger Katie Yoder described Beyoncé's support of the campaign as hypocritical, in light of how the word "bitch" is spoken nine times on the singer's [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/katie-yoder/2014/03/18/ban-bossy-beyonc-says-b-9x-new-album|title=Ban 'Bossy?'

The '''Barbary Wars''' were a series of conflicts that culminated in two wars fought at different times over the same reasons between the [[United States]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Barbary states]] (the ''de jure'' possessions of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but ''de facto'' independent, [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunis]], [[Regency of Algiers|Algiers]], and [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripoli]]) of [[North Africa]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Sweden|Swedes]] had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800; they were eventually joined by the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertyclassroom.com/warpowers/|title=Presidential War Powers: The Constitutional Answer|author=Woods, Tom|accessdate=9 July 2014|website=Libertyclassroom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At issue was the [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary pirates]]' demand for [[tribute]] from American merchant vessels in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. If ships of a given country failed to pay, pirates would attack the ship and take their goods, and often enslave crew members or hold them for ransom. 

When [[Thomas Jefferson]] became President of the United States in March 1801, he refused to pay tribute and sent a [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval]] fleet to the Mediterranean; the fleet bombarded various fortified pirate cities in present-day [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Algeria]], ultimately extracting concessions of fair passage from their rulers.  [[James Madison]], Jefferson's successor, directed military forces for the second war in 1815, shortly after the conclusion of the [[War of 1812]] against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]].

==Barbary corsairs==
{{Main article|Barbary corsairs}}
The '''Barbary corsairs''', sometimes called '''Ottoman corsairs''' or '''[[Berber people|Berber]] pirates''', were pirates and [[privateer]]s who operated from North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers. This area was known in [[Europe]] as the [[Barbary Coast]], a term derived from the name of its Berber inhabitants. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along [[West Africa]]'s [[Atlantic]] seaboard and even to the eastern coast of [[South America]] with [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;A 44-gun Algerian corsair appeared at Río de la Plata in 1720. [[Cesáreo Fernández Duro]], ''Armada española desde la unión de los reinos de Castilla y de León'', Madrid, 1902, Vol. VI, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and into the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] as far north as [[Iceland]], but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing ships, they engaged in ''[[Ghazw|razzia]]s'', raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], and [[Portugal]], but also in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], and as far away as [[Iceland]]. The main purpose of their attacks was to capture European [[slavery|slaves]] for the [[Arab slave trade|Arab slave market]] in North Africa.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
Since the 1600s, the Barbary pirates had attacked [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] shipping along the North Coast of Africa, holding captives for ransom or enslaving them.  Ransoms were generally raised by families and local church groups. The British became familiar with [[captivity narratives]] written by Barbary pirates' prisoners and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Colley, ''Captives: Britain, Empire, and the World, 1600–1850'', New York: Anchor Books Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the pirates attacked American ships. On December 20, 1777, Morocco's sultan [[Mohammed III of Morocco|Mohammed III]] declared that merchant ships of the new American nation would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The [[Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship]] stands as America's oldest unbroken friendship treaty&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Priscilla H. and Richard S. Roberts, ''Thomas Barclay 1728–1793: Consul in France, Diplomat in Barbary'', Lehigh University Press, 2008, pp. 206–223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/s/d/rm/rls/perfrpt/2002/html/18995.htm |title=Milestones of American Diplomacy, Interesting Historical Notes, and Department of State History |accessdate=2007-12-17 |work=U.S. Department of State }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a foreign power. In 1787, Morocco became one of the first nations to recognize the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=41811 |title=Cohen Renews U.S.-Morocco Ties |accessdate=2009-03-12 |format=mil |work=U.S. Department of Defense }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1780s, realizing that American vessels were no longer under the protection of the [[Royal Navy|British navy]], the Barbary pirates had started seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. As the U.S. had disbanded its [[Continental Navy]] and had no seagoing military force, its government agreed in 1786 to pay tribute to stop the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory ''The Wars of the Barbary Pirates'', London: Osprey, 2006 pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1794, at the urging of President [[George Washington]], the [[United States Congress]] voted to authorize the building of [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy|six heavy frigates]] and establish the [[United States Navy]], in order to stop these attacks and demands for more and more money.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory ''The Wars of the Barbary Pirates'', London: Osprey, 2006 page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had signed treaties with all of the Barbary states after its independence was recognized between 1786-1794 to pay tribute in exchange for leaving American merchantmen alone, and by 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million or a fifth of the government's annual budget then in tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory ''The Wars of the Barbary Pirates'', London: Osprey, 2006 pages 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; These demands for tribute had imposed a heavy financial drain and by 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory ''The Wars of the Barbary Pirates'', London: Osprey, 2006 page 37&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans resented these payments, arguing that the money would be better spent on a navy that would protect American ships from the attacks of the Barbary pirates, and in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 Presidential Election]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] won in part against incumbent second President [[John Adams]], in part by noting that the United States was "subjected to the spoliations of foreign cruisers" and was humiliated by paying "an enormous tribute to the petty tyrant of Algiers".&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes, Gregory ''The Wars of the Barbary Pirates'', London: Osprey, 2006 page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Barbary War (1801–1805)==
{{Main article|First Barbary War}}

The '''First Barbary War''' (1801–1805), also known as the '''Tripolitian War''' or the '''Barbary Coast War''', was the first of two wars fought between the alliance of the United States and several European countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tripolitan War | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/asia-and-africa/north-african-history/tripolitan-war | date=2000 | publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] (from ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History'') | accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VeteranMuseum"&gt;{{cite web | title=War with the Barbary Pirates (Tripolitan War) | url=http://www.veteranmuseum.org/war-history/war-barbary-pirates-tripolitan-war | publisher=''veteranmuseum.org'' | accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Northwest Africa]]n Berber [[Muslim]] states known collectively as the Barbary states. These were Tripoli and Algiers, which were quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and (briefly) the independent [[Alaouite dynasty|Sultanate]] of [[Morocco]]. This war began during Thomas Jefferson's term when he refused to pay tribute, an amount that was greatly increased when he became president. A U.S. naval fleet was sent on May 13, 1801, at the beginning of the war under the command of Commodore [[Richard Dale]]. Other notable officers in the fleet included [[Stephen Decatur]], assigned to the frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|6}} and [[William Bainbridge]] in command of ''Essex'' which was attached to Commodore [[Richard Dale]]'s squadron which also included {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|2}}, {{USS|President|1800|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris, 1837]] pp.63–64, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

During this war, the ship ''Philadelphia'' was blockading [[Tripoli Harbor|Tripoli's harbor]] when she ran aground on an uncharted reef. Under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan [[gunboat]]s, the Captain, William Bainbridge, tried to refloat her by casting off all of her guns and other objects that weighed it down. The ship was eventually captured and the crew taken prisoners and put into slavery. To prevent this powerful war ship from being used by the Barbary pirates the ship was later destroyed by a raiding party led by [[Stephen Decatur]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker|Tucker, 1937]] p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mackenzie|MacKenzie, 1846]] pp.331–335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Barbary War (1815)==
{{Main article|Second Barbary War}}

The '''Second Barbary War''' (1815), also known as the '''Algerine''' or '''Algerian War''', was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s North African regencies of Tripoli, Tunis and Algeria, known collectively as the Barbary states. The war between the Barbary States and the U.S. ended in 1815; the international dispute would effectively be ended the following year by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The war brought an end to the American practice of paying tribute to the pirate states and helped mark the beginning of the end of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination (16th–18th centuries). Within decades, European powers built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leiner|Liener, 2007]], pp.39–50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect in United States==
{{See also|Original six frigates of the United States Navy}}
When the United States military efforts of the early 19th century were successful against the pirates, partisans of the [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] contrasted their presidents' refusals to buy off the pirates by paying tribute with the failure of the preceding [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] administration to suppress the piracy. The Federalist Party had adopted the slogan, "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute," but had failed to end the attacks on merchant ships. From 1796–1797 French raiders seized some 316 American merchant ships flying American colors. To counter this ongoing advent three frigates, {{USS|United States|1797|6}}, {{USS|Constitution}} and {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}, were soon built to answer the call for security.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simons|Simons, 2003]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later==
In the 21st century, the United States again conducted military operation in the North African area, specifically participating in the intervention against the government of [[Libya]], and this operation has sometimes been termed in the media as the continuation of the previous Barbary Wars and given the name "[[2011 military intervention in Libya|Third Barbary War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/03/the-third-barbary-war/72749/|title=The Third Barbary War|first=Yoni|last=Appelbaum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Blue Mass''' is a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated annually in the [[Catholic Church]] for those employed in the "public safety field" (i.e. [[police officer]]s, [[firefighter]]s, [[correctional officer]]s, [[911 operator]]s and [[Emergency medical services|EMS personnel]]).&lt;ref name="oakland"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oaklandnorth.net/2014/10/14/oakland-police-firefighters-honored-at-oakland-blue-mass |title=Oakland police, firefighters honored at Blue Mass  |publisher=Oakland North |date=2014-10-14 |website=  |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The color blue relates to the blue-colored uniforms predominantly used by these services.&lt;ref name="Walla Walla Union-Bulletin - 30 September 2014 - St. Pat's hosts Blue Mass for law enforcers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://union-bulletin.com/news/2014/sep/30/st-pats-hosts-blue-mass-law-enforcers|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141226052629/http://union-bulletin.com/news/2014/sep/30/st-pats-hosts-blue-mass-law-enforcers|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 December 2014|title=St. Pat's hosts Blue Mass for law enforcers|last=Charnley Eveland|first=Annie|work=[[Walla Walla Union-Bulletin]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=30 September 2014|website=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Red Mass, the service honors those who have died in the line of duty and those currently serving as first responders.&lt;ref name="cardinal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cardinalsblog.adw.org/2014/05/with-prayers-and-gratitude-the-blue-mass |title= With Prayers and Gratitude: The Blue Mass  |last= [[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl]]  |first=Donald |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archdiocese of Washington]] |date=2014-05-14 |website= Cardinal's Blog |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mass is an opportunity for the community to show gratitude to first responders and their families.&lt;ref name="angels"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://angelsoveramerica.org/press-release/what-is-a-blue-mass |title=What is a Blue Mass? |last= Long |first=Carolyn K. |publisher=Angels Over America |date=2011-08-05 |website=  |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In Washington, D.C. the service is held in conjunction with [[National Police Week]].&lt;ref name="angels" /&gt;  Psalm 91:11, "For He will give His angels [especial] charge over you to accompany and defend and preserve you in all your ways [of obedience and service]," are often invoked during the service.&lt;ref name="angels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/bluemass.shtml |title=20th Annual Blue Mass |publisher=St. Patrick Catholic Church|date=2014-05-06 |website=  |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though usually held in a Catholic church, the events are generally considered to be [[ecumenical]] or non-denominational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/local/2014/09/23/blue-mass-indio-riverside-county/16087179/ |title= Showing gratitude for those who serve | publisher=Saint David of Wales Catholic parish |date=2014-09-22|website=  |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blue Mass dates to September 29, 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://colton.citynewsgroup.com/articles/dee231827be1f6f54562bc50d8ed2cba |title=Blue Mass Honors Fallen Police and Firefighters |publisher=City News Group Inc. |date=2014-10-24 |website= Colton City News |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Rev.

'''Border Force''' is a part of the [[Home Office]], responsible for frontline [[border control]] operations at air, sea and rail ports in the [[United Kingdom]]. The force was part of the now defunct [[UK Border Agency]] from its establishment in 2008 until [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] demerged it in March 2012 after severe criticism of the senior management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17099143|title=Theresa May to split up UK Border Agency|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 March 2012, Border Force has been a law-enforcement command within the Home Office, accountable directly to ministers. Border Force is responsible for immigration and customs at 140 rail, air and sea ports in the UK and western Europe, as well as thousands of smaller airstrips, ports and marinas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/speeches/statement-vine-report|title=Home Secretary's statement on border security - Oral statements to Parliament - GOV.UK|website=Homeoffice.gov.uk|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the Border Force is monitored by the [[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration]].

Border Force officers are not police constables and the Border Force is not a police force.  However, aside from powers listed below in relation to immigration and customs, section 2 of the Borders Act 2007 does allow designated members of the Border Force to detain anyone for any criminal offence or arrest warrant at a port if the Border Officer thinks they would be liable to arrest by a police constable.  The power allows detention for 3 hours pending the arrival of a police constable.  The power also applies to points of entry in Belgium and France where Border Officers work whereby the Border Officer will turn the detained person over to French or Belgian police officers as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/section/2|title=UK Borders Act 2007|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
Border Force was born out of a confusing decade for the UK immigration and customs after several attempts of reform and re-structure. Prior to 2007 three agencies were responsible for border control in the UK, HMRC (HMCE till 2005) dealt with customs, Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) dealt with all immigration roles within the UK and at the border, and UKVisas issued visas both from the UK and its offices abroad. As early as 2003 a single "border police force" had been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3219549.stm|title=UK needs 'border security force'|date=28 October 2003|accessdate=30 December 2017|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 HMCE and Inland revenue merged to form HMRC. HMRC were still response for customs control at the border until 2008. Throughout 2006 and 2007 there were suggestions for a merged border control department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5207112.stm|title=Reid plans border-control force|date=23 July 2006|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially this plan was to turn the Immigration and Nationality Directorate into a uniformed body of Immigration officers at the border, the Border and Immigration Agency. The BIA was created on 1 April 2007  and short lived. It was replaced only a year later on 1 April 2008 by the UK Border Agency. The UK Border agency was a merger of the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA), UKvisas and the port customs functions of HM Revenue and Customs. It created one of the largest law enforcement bodies in the UK.

UKBA had a chequered history. There were difficulties with the management of student visas under Tier 4 of the Points-Based System. The assessment of the [[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration|Independent Chief Inspector]], carried out between July and August 2010, found that there was an inconsistent response towards applications, with some cases given extra time to prepare and others dismissed for minor reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/16/ukborderagency_report_fails/ |title=UK Border Agency: Good at making cash, crap at making decisions |author=John Oates |date=16 February 2011 |publisher=The Register |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Home Affairs Select Committee issued a report that found that 124,000 deportation cases had been shelved by the UKBA. The report said the cases had been dumped in a "controlled archive", a term used to try to hide the fact from authorities and auditors that it was a list of lost applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casciani |first=Dominic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15581877 |title=UK Border Agency attacked for 'dumping' missing cases |publisher=BBC |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following allegations that staff were told to relax some identity checks, in November 2011 the UK Home Office suspended [[Brodie Clark]], the Head of the [[UK Border Agency]];&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; Carole Upshall, director of the Border Agency South and European Operation;&lt;ref name=DMail2057784/&gt; Graham Kyle, director of operations at Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; The Home Office investigated allegations that Clark had agreed to "open up the borders" at certain times in ways ministers would "not have agreed with".&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; It is alleged that between July and the end of October 2011, queues at passport control were "managed" so as not to annoy holiday makers.&lt;ref name=DMail2057784&gt;{{cite news|author=James Slack |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057784/UK-border-chief-axed-passport-controls-Top-civil-servant-faces-sack-decision-left-Britain-open-terrorists-criminals.html#ixzz1cmliZq21 |title=UK border chief axed passport controls: Top civil servant faces sack over decision that left Britain open to terrorists and criminals |work=Daily Mail |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] reported that staff may have been told not to scan [[biometric passport]]s at certain times. A biometric passport contains a digital image of the holder's face, which can be used to compare with the printed version and check the passport has not been forged.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; It is also believed that "warning index checks" at Heathrow and Calais were also suspended, which would have applied strict security checks against official watchlists of terrorists, criminals, and deported illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/05/head-of-uk-border-force-suspended |title=Head of UK border force suspended |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=12 April 2012 |location=London |date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Clark refused the offer to take early retirement, he was suspended and the investigation began.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15601988 |title=BBC News – Head of UK border force Brodie Clark suspended |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-week inquiry led by former Metropolitan Police detective Dave Wood,  head of the agency's enforcement and crime group at the time, sought to discover to what extent checks were scaled down, and what the security implications might have been. A second investigation, led by former [[MI6]] official Mike Anderson, the Director General of the Home Office's strategy, immigration and international group, sought to investigate wider issues relating to the performance of UKBA regarding racism. The issues relating to lost documents and case files was still going on at the same time, along with a backlog of cases. 

It was then announced on 5 November by Theresa May that an independent inquiry would also be undertaken, led by the [[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration|Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency]], John Vine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Mason |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15608238 |title=Inquiry into border agency passport check claims |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following all these combined failings, UK Border Force became a separate organisation on 1 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theresa May to split up UK Border Agency |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17099143 |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Director General of Border Force was the former Chief Constable of [[Wiltshire Police]] [[Brian Moore (police officer)|Brian Moore]], who was appointed on secondment on an interim basis to last until 31 August 2012 and was expected to apply for the position permanently, despite criticism of his management of passport queues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Border Force chief faces battle to keep job over threat of four-hour immigration queues during Olympics |author=David Millward |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9282740/Border-Force-chief-faces-battle-to-keep-job-over-threat-of-four-hour-immigration-queues-during-Olympics.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 2012, Immigration Minister [[Damian Green]] confirmed that Moore had not applied for the post, despite Moore earlier telling the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] that he would be applying.

Tony Smith was appointed as interim Director General of Border Force on 19 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Home Affairs Select Committee, 18 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was previously Gold Commander for the London 2012 Olympic Programme and Regional Director for London and the South East in the [[UK Border Agency]]. and has spent forty years in border control and enforcement work.

[[Charles Montgomery (Royal Navy officer)|Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Montgomery]] was named as the new Director General on 25 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/charles-montgomery-border-force |title=New Director General of Border Force announced |date=25 January 2013 |publisher=Home Office |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 Montgomery left Border Force and Paul Lincoln a civil servant from the MOD and Home office appointed as the new Director General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-director-general-of-border-force-appointed|title=New Director-General of Border Force appointed|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the two had any previous experience of immigration or customs.

==Responsibilities==
The stated responsibilities of the [[Home Office]]'s Border Force are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside government: Border Force|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/border-force|publisher=UK Government (gov.uk)|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/border-force/about|title=About – Border Force|website=Gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* checking the immigration status of people arriving in and departing the UK
* searching baggage, vehicles and cargo for illicit goods or illegal immigrants
* patrolling the British coastline and searching vessels
* gathering intelligence
* alerting the police and security services to people of interest

Border Force is responsible for immigration and customs at 140 rail, air and sea ports in the UK and western Europe, as well as thousands of smaller airstrips, ports and marinas.

==Powers==
Staff hold a mixture of powers granted to them by their status as immigration officers and designated customs officials.

=== Immigration powers ===
{{Main article|Immigration officer#United Kingdom|l1=Immigration officer}}
Immigration officers have powers of arrest and detention conferred on them by the [[Immigration Act 1971]] and subsequent Immigration Acts, when both at ports and inland. In practice, non-arrest trained Border Force immigration officers exercise powers under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, while inland immigration officers work under S28A-H of the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 of the same Act, as do arrest-trained Border Force immigration officers at the frontier.

Historically, port and inland immigration officers received different training to reflect these different approaches to immigration enforcement, which is now reinforced by inland officers working for Immigration Enforcement, a separate Home Office Command.

"Designated Immigration Officers" are Border Force immigration officers who have been designated with additional detention powers, under Sections 1 to 4 of the UK Borders Act 2007, where a person at a port or airport is suspected of being liable to arrest by a police officer for non-border offences.

=== Customs powers ===
{{Main article|Customs officer#United Kingdom|l1=Customs officer}}
Border Force officers, designated as customs officials under the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, have wide-ranging powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest. They hold the same customs and excise powers as officers of [[HM Revenue and Customs]], but cannot use HMRC powers for non-border matters, such as Income Tax and VAT. Amongst their powers is the ability to arrest anyone who has committed, or whom the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect has committed, any offence under the Customs and Excise Acts. They may also seize prohibited and restricted goods, such as controlled drugs and firearms, as well as ensuring that imported goods bear the correct taxes and duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1979/cukpga_19790002_en_21#pt14-pb1-l1g177 |title=Section 138, Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c. 2) |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011174219/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1979/cukpga_19790002_en_21 |archivedate=11 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
{{Tone|section|date=June 2018}}
The Border Force Officer training pathway consists of three standalone
programmes aligned to professional frameworks including
the Operational Delivery Framework, Civil Service Competency
Framework and European Sectoral Qualifications Framework.

Core Skills 1 programme is a three part programme designed to
test both skills and knowledge of the immigration function at the Primary
Control Point (PCP), as well as some customs functions. The three parts
include pre course online learning, classroom learning and mentoring.

The classroom element is a three week programme combining assessment,
role-play, live and theoretical tests. This is then followed by a period of
consolidated learning (mentoring) in an operational environment, which
can take up to 4 weeks. Once all three strands of the programme have
been completed and all the necessary tests and assessments have been
passed, this will give successful officers the power to act under the Immigration Act.

Following this initial phase your training will include:
• ongoing on-the-job mentoring
• Some specialist training as well as the Core Skills 3 programme, which includes
further classroom training normally undertaken within 12 months.

Core Skills 2 is the customs course. This consists of a 5 week course plus about 5 weeks of mentoring. 

Core Skills 3 which is the investigation/casework immigration course. This consists of 15 day course plus 3/4 weeks of mentoring.

In addition there is Personal safety training (PST) (self defence/restraint/handcuffing/baton training).

==Organisation==
[[File:UK Border Agency office Sheffield.png|thumb|The Home Office buildings in [[Sheffield]]]]
Border Force has five operational regions: Central; Heathrow; North; South; and South East &amp; Europe. The regions have responsibility for securing the border 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at the UK’s ports, airports, postal depots and rail. This includes the Eurostar from Brussels and Paris to St Pancras International and the Eurotunnel from Coquelles to [[Folkestone]].

The regions’ varied work includes stopping 100 per cent of passengers arriving at ports or airports for immigration controls. Officers also conduct risk-led interceptions for controlled drugs, cash, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, offensive weapons, prohibited goods, counterfeit goods and clandestine entrants. They do this at passenger and freight controls, covering passengers travelling on foot, by car, coaches, freight vehicles, as well as air freight and sea containers.

===Common travel area===
Immigration control within the United Kingdom is managed within a wider [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA). The CTA is an intergovernmental agreement that allows freedom of movement within an area that encompasses the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands (Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Alderney) and the Republic of Ireland. Authorised entry to any of the above essentially allows entry to all the others but it is the responsibility of the person entering to ensure that they are properly documented for entry to other parts of the CTA. Despite the CTA it is still possible to be deported from the UK to the Republic of Ireland and vice versa.

===Juxtaposed controls===
Entry to the UK via the [[Channel Tunnel]] from France or Belgium or by ferry through selected ports in north-east France is controlled by [[Juxtaposed controls|juxtaposed immigration controls]] in Britain, France, and [[Belgium]], i.e. travellers clear UK passport control in France or Belgium and those travelling to France or Belgium clear French controls while in the UK. Belgium does not maintain controls in the UK as the first Schengen country entered is France. UK Border Force checkpoints in France are operated at [[Gare de Calais-Fréthun]], [[Gare de Lille Europe]], Channel Tunnel, [[Calais]] ferry terminal, [[Dunkirk]] ferry terminal and [[Gare du Nord]] station, Paris. For passengers arriving by the Eurostar train from Marne-la Vallée Chessy, UK border control takes place at the arrival stations in the UK. A checkpoint operated at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] until the port closed in August 2010.  [[United States border preclearance]] is an equivalent system operated by that country's [[USCBP|equivalent to the UKBF]] at some airports outside the US.

==Equipment==
===Officer equipment===
Border Force officers wear a uniform with rank insignia. Border Force uniform is navy blue and, currently, modelled on the Metropolitan Police uniform. Border Force officers can make use of [[stab vest|body armour]] and carry handcuffs, as well as extendable batons. Limb restraints are also in circulation. Officers also carry [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|Tetra radios on the secure Airwave network]], often with earpieces, to communicate with other officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvKWcFd2-s UK Border Force Documentary, Season 2, Episode 3] (YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, officers may also carry other useful police equipment, such as torches. Torches currently issued, depending on location and job role, include Lenser LED P7.2 and Maglite LED 2D &amp; 3D Cell.

Specialist forgery detection equipment is available at ports and airports to identify false passports and identity documents. Customs officials make use of a variety of specialised tools and equipment when searching cars, lorries, aircraft, container ships and other items crossing the border.

=== Rank insignia ===
Uniformed Border Force officers have their rank displayed on shoulder epaulettes, attached to their shirt, jumper or jacket. Warranted officers below Senior Officer rank may also have their identification number displayed. The rank and epaulette styling is in line with many other border agencies and shares close similarities with its Australian counterpart, the [[Australian Border Force]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Vessels===
{{Main|List of customs cutters of UK Border Force}}
All vessels of the Border Force bear the [[ship prefix]] "HMC"—[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's]] [[Cutter (boat)|Cutter]]. Between May and October 2015 two of the vessels, HMC ''Protector'' and [[HMC Seeker|HMC ''Seeker'']], were deployed in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] conducting search and rescue operations. The Border Force also has a recently chartered vessel named [[MV VOS Grace|MV ''VOS Grace'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2016-01-26/24322/|title=Migration: Mediterranean Sea: Written question - 24322|website=Parliament.uk|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bourgeois nation''' was a term coined by adherents of fascism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Fascism views a nation led by standard [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] culture as being associated with [[Fitness (biology)|unfit]] [[sedentary lifestyle]], [[individualism]], [[plutocracy]], and economic exploitation of [[Proletariat|proletarian]] people and [[proletarian nation]]s, that fascism views as inconsistent with virile nationhood.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. Vintage Books edition. Vintage Books, 2005. Pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell. ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France''. Princeton University Press edition. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1996. Pp. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi 2000. Pp. 163"&gt;Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. First paperback edition. Santa Barbara, California, USA: University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benito Mussolini]] denounced bourgeois nations for being based on the [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] rule of the rich and for engaging in oppressive economic exploitation of [[proletarian nation]]s such as [[Italy]], and in particular negatively referred to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as "the fattest and most bourgeois nation in the world".&lt;ref name="Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi 2000. Pp. 163"/&gt; Mussolini described bourgeois nations as seeking to assert hegemony over the ability to pursue [[imperialism]] while hypocritically denying proletarian nations from being allowed to pursue imperialism.&lt;ref name="Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi 2000. Pp. 163"/&gt; Mussolini described such plutocratic bourgeois nations as seeking to dominate the world economy at the expense of proletarian nations.&lt;ref name="Richard Bessel 2000. Pp. 171"&gt;Richard Bessel. ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany: Comparisons and Contrasts''. 4th edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937 to 1939, Mussolini openly encouraged Italians to foster an anti-bourgeois attitude by having Italians send in anti-bourgeois cartoons to be published in newspapers, and by denouncing "social games, five o'clock tea, vacations, compassion for Jews, preference for armchairs, desire for compromise, desire for money" as indulgent bourgeois practices.&lt;ref&gt;"LIFE on the Newsfronts of the World". ''LIFE magazine''. 9 January 1939. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1938, Mussolini escalated a public relations campaign against Italy's bourgeoisie, accusing them of preferring private gain to national victory.&lt;ref name="Denis Mack Smith 1997. p. 394"&gt;Smith, Denis Mack, Modern Italy: A Political History (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]]'s [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] also rejected the bourgeois culture of states associated with materialistic consumption, profiteering, and exploitative plutocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Stacke Roderick. Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies. Pp. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany during the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] that he obscenely referred to as "cowardly shits".&lt;ref&gt;Kritika: explorations in Russian and Eurasian history, Volume 7, Issue 4. Slavica Publishers, 2006. Pp. 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascism's conception of the bourgeois nation was influenced by the political and economic theories of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], who criticized [[capitalism]] for causing moral disintegration of societies that deteriorates the political order of societies.&lt;ref name="Richard Bessel 2000. Pp. 171"/&gt; Pareto's criticism of capitalism was focused on its moral aspects, but Pareto did not criticize capitalism for economic inequality.&lt;ref name="Richard Bessel 2000. Pp. 171"/&gt;  Pareto argued that as wealth increases, idealism decreases, causing both money and individuals to soften in strength.&lt;ref name="Richard Bessel 2000. Pp. 15"&gt;Richard Bessel. ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany: Comparisons and Contrasts''. 4th edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto claimed that the only means to rectify this weakening of strength was violence, war, or revolution.&lt;ref name="Richard Bessel 2000. Pp. 15"/&gt;

The '''Center for the National Interest''' is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[public policy]] [[think tank]].  The Center was established by former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on January 20, 1994  as the '''Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nixoncenter.org/index.cfm?action=showpage&amp;page=missionstatement The Nixon Center: Mission statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014212656/http://www.nixoncenter.org/index.cfm?action=showpage&amp;page=missionstatement |date=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group changed its name to '''The Nixon Center''' in 1998.  In 2001 the Center acquired ''[[The National Interest]]'', a bimonthly journal, in which it tends to promote the [[Realism in international relations|realist perspective on foreign policy]]. The Center's President is [[Dimitri Simes|Dimitri K. Simes]].   In March 2011, it was renamed the '''Center for the National Interest''' ('''CFTNI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for the National Interest|url=http://www.cftni.org/index-2.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815233028/http://cftni.org/index-2.html|archivedate=2011-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The center has a staff of approximately twenty people supporting six main programs: Energy Security and Climate Change, Strategic Studies, US-Russia Relations, U.S.-Japan Relations, China and the Pacific, and Regional Security (Middle East, Caspian Basin and South Asia).&lt;ref&gt;Abelson 2006, p. 89; The Nixon Center 2008, [http://www.nixoncenter.org/index.cfm?action=showpage&amp;page=programs Nixon Center programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925115047/http://www.nixoncenter.org/index.cfm?action=showpage&amp;page=programs |date=September 25, 2008 }}. Accessed 9-29-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it had an annual budget of $1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;Abelson 2006, p. 238 (Appendix One, Table AI.2).&lt;/ref&gt; The Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program of the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] ranked it as one of the top 30 think tanks in the United States in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;McGann 2007, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has consistently earned similar praise since then. According to the ''2014 Global Go To [[Think Tank]] Index Report'' ([[Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program]], [[University of Pennsylvania]]), the Center is number 43 (of 60) in the "Top Think Tanks in the United States".&lt;ref name="Global Go To"&gt;{{cite web| author=James G.

'''Chronemics''' is the study of the role of time in communication. It is one of several subcategories of the study of [[nonverbal communication]]. Other prominent  subcategories include [[Haptic communication|haptics]] (touch), [[kinesics]] (body movement), [[paralanguage|vocalics]] (paralanguage), and [[proxemics]] (the use of space).&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Thomas J. Bruneau of Radford University coined the term "chronemics" in the late 1970s to help define the function of time in human interaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chronemics can be briefly and generally defined as the study of human tempo as it related to human communication. More specifically, chronemics involves the study of both subjective and objective human tempos as they influence and are interdependent with human behavior. Further, chronemics involves the study of human communication as it relates to interdependent and integrated levels of time-experiencing. Previously, these interdependent and integrated levels have been outlined and discussed as: biological time; psychological time; social time; and cultural time. A number of classification systems exist in the literature of time. However, such systems are not applied to human interaction directly.&lt;ref name=Bruneau1980&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruneau|first=Thomas J.|editor-last=Key|editor-first=Mary Ritchie|year=1980|title=The Relationship of Verbal and Nonverbal Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbg98xnbIYwC|chapter=Chronemics and the Verbal-Nonverbal Interface|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbg98xnbIYwC&amp;pg=PA114|publisher=Mouton Press|pages=101–119|isbn=|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chronemics can be defined as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of time"{{Cite quote|date=October 2015}} – the way in which one perceives and values [[time]], structures time, and reacts to time frames communication. Time perception plays a large role in the nonverbal communication process. Time perceptions include [[punctuality]], willingness to wait, and interactions. The use of time can affect lifestyle, daily agendas, speed of speech, movements, and how long people are willing to listen.

Time can be used as an indicator of status. For example, in most companies the boss can interrupt progress to hold an impromptu meeting in the middle of the work day, yet the average worker would have to make an appointment to see the boss. The way in which different cultures perceive time can influence communication as well.

Cultures are sometimes{{When|date=October 2015}} considered '''monochronic''' or '''polychronic'''.

==Monochronic time==

A monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise, small units. Under this system, time is scheduled, arranged and managed.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] considers itself a monochronic [[society]]. This perception came about during the [[Industrial Revolution]], when "factory life required the labor force to be on hand and in place at an appointed hour" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;238). Many Americans like to think that to them, time is a precious resource not to be wasted or taken lightly. "We buy time, save time, spend time and make time. Our time can be broken down into years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and even milliseconds. We use time to structure both our daily lives and events that we are planning for the future. We have schedules that we must follow: appointments that we must go to at a certain time, classes that start and end at certain times, work schedules that start and end at certain times, and even our favorite TV shows, that start and end at a certain time."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory80.htm |title=Chronemics |last1=Lewis |first1=Nick |date=November 17, 2003 |publisher=Colorado State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215155552/http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory80.htm|archivedate=2005-02-15|accessdate=2015-10-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As communication scholar [[Edward T. Hall]] wrote regarding the American's viewpoint of time in the business world, "the schedule is sacred." Hall says that for monochronic cultures, such as the American culture, "time is tangible" and viewed as a commodity where "time is money" or "time is wasted." The result of this perspective is that monochronic cultures, place a paramount value on schedules, tasks and "getting the job done."{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}} These cultures are committed to regimented schedules and may view those who do not subscribe to the same perception of time as disrespectful, inefficient or unreliable.

==Polychronic time==

A polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once, and wider view of time is exhibited and time is perceived in large fluid sections.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of polychronic behaviors include: typing while answering telephones or taking notes while sitting participating in meetings. Polychronicity is in contrast to those who prefer monochronicity (doing one thing at a time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Keating |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-time-is-a-social-construct-164139110/?no-ist |title=Why Time is a Social Construct &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polychronic cultures are much less focused on the preciseness of accounting for each and every moment. As Raymond Cohen notes, polychronic cultures are more focused on tradition and relationships rather than on tasks—a clear difference from their monochronic counterparts. Cohen notes that "Traditional societies have all the time in the world.  The arbitrary divisions of the clock face have little saliency in cultures grounded in the cycle of the seasons, the invariant pattern of rural life, community life, and the calendar of religious festivities" (Cohen, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

Polychronic culture is more focused on relationships, rather than watching the clock. Polychronic societies have no problem being "late" for an appointment if they are deeply focused on some work or in a meeting that ran past schedule, because the concept of time is fluid and can easily expand or contract as need be. As a result, polychronic cultures have a much less formal perception of time. They are not ruled by precise calendars and schedules. Rather, "cultures that use the polychronic time system often schedule multiple appointments simultaneously so keeping on schedule is an impossibility."&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

===Measuring polychronicity===
Researchers have developed the following questionnaires to measure polychronicity:

* '''Inventory of Polychronic Values (IPV)''', developed by Bluedorn et al. (1999) which is a 10-item scale designed to assess "the extent to which people in a culture prefer to be engaged in two or more tasks or events simultaneously and believe their preference is the best way to do things."
* '''Polychronic Attitude Index (PAI)''', developed by Kaufman-Scarborough &amp; Lindquist in 1991, which is a 4-item scale measuring individual preference for polychronicity, in the following statements:
*# "I do not like to juggle several activities at the same time".
*# "People should not try to do many things at once".
*# "When I sit down at my desk, I work on one project at a time".
*# "I am comfortable doing several things at the same time".

===Cross-cultural perspectives on time===

Conflicting attitudes between the monochronic and polychronic perceptions of time can interfere with cross-cultural relations, and similar challenges can occur within an otherwise assimilated culture.&lt;ref name="time-sense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harley.com/writing/time-sense.html|title=Time Sense: Polychronicity and Monochronicity|date=January 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example in the United States is the [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaiian culture]], which employs two time systems: [[Haole]] time and Hawaiian time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you hear someone say, 'See you at two o'clock haole time,' they mean they will just that. Haole time is when the person will meet when they say they will meet. But if you were to hear someone say, 'I'll be there at two o'clock Hawaiian time,' then something different is implied. Hawaiian time is very lax and it basically means 'when you get there.'" —Nick Lewis&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Time orientations ==

The way an individual perceives time and the role time plays in their lives is a learned perspective.  As discussed by Alexander Gonzalez and Phillip Zimbardo, "every child learns a time perspective that is appropriate to the values and needs of his society" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;227).

There are four basic psychological time orientations:
# Past
# Time-line
# Present
# Future

Each orientation affects the structure, content, and urgency of communication (Burgoon, 1989).   The [[past]] orientation has a hard time developing the notion of elapsed time and these individuals often confuse present and past happenings as all in the same.  People oriented with time-line cognitivity are often detail oriented and think of everything in linear terms. These individuals also often have difficulty with comprehending multiple events at the same time.  Individuals with a present orientation are mostly characterized as pleasure seekers who live for the moment and have a very low risk aversion.  Those individuals who operate with [[future orientation]] are often thought of as being highly goal oriented and focused on the broad picture.

The use of time as a communicative channel can be a powerful, yet subtle, force in face-to-face ''interactions''. Some of the more recognizable types of interaction that use time are:

;Regulating interaction: This is shown to aid in the orderly transition of conversational [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]]. When the speaker is opening the floor for a response, they will pause. However, when no response is desired, the speaker will talk a faster pace with minimal pause. (Capella, 1985)
;Expressing intimacy: As relationships become more intimate, certain changes are made to accommodate the new relationship status. Some of the changes that are made include lengthening the time spent on mutual gazes, increasing the amount of time doing tasks for or with the other person and planning for the future by making plans to spend more time together (Patterson, 1990).
;Affect management: The onset of powerful emotions can cause a stronger affect, ranging from joy to sorrow or even to embarrassment. Some of the behaviors associated with negative affects include decreased time of gaze and awkwardly long pauses during conversations. When this happens, it is common for the individuals to try and decrease any negative affects and subsequently strengthen positive affects (Edelman &amp; Iwawaki, 1987).
;Evoking emotion: Time can be used to evoke emotions in an interpersonal relationship by communicating the value of the relationship. For example, when someone who you have a close relationship with is late, you may not take it personally, especially if that is characteristic of them. However, if it is a meeting with a total stranger, their disrespect for the value of your time may be taken personally and could even cause you to display negative emotions if and when they do arrive for the meeting.
;Facilitating service and task goals: Professional settings can sometimes give rise to interpersonal relations which are quite different from other "normal" interactions. For example, the societal norms that dictate minimal touch between strangers are clearly altered if one member of the dyad is a doctor, and the environment is that of a hospital examination room.

===Time orientation and consumers===
Time orientation has also revealed insights into how people react to advertising. Martin, Gnoth and Strong (2009) found that future-oriented consumers react most favorably to ads that feature a product to be released in the distant future and that highlight primary product attributes. In contrast, present-oriented consumers prefer near-future ads that highlight secondary product attributes. Consumer attitudes were mediated by the perceived usefulness of the attribute information.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, B.A.S., Gnoth, J., &amp; Strong, C. (2009). [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Gnoth-Strong-2009.pdf Temporal construal in advertising: The moderating role of temporal orientation and attribute importance upon consumer evaluations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217085226/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Gnoth-Strong-2009.pdf |date=2013-12-17 }}, ''Journal of Advertising'', 38 (3), 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and diplomacy ==

=== Cultural roots ===
Just as monochronic and polychronic cultures have different time perspectives, understanding the time orientation of a culture is critical to becoming better able to successfully handle [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] situations. Americans think they have, a future orientation. Hall indicates that for Americans "tomorrow is more important" and that they "are oriented almost entirely toward the future" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;35). The future-focused orientation attributes to at least some of the concern that Americans have with "addressing immediate issues and moving on to new challenges" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;35).

On the other hand, many polychronic cultures have a past-orientation toward time.

These time perspectives are the seeds for communication clashes in diplomatic situations. Trade negotiators have observed that "American negotiators are generally more anxious for agreement because "they are always in a hurry" and basically "problem solving oriented." In other words, they place a high value on resolving an issue quickly calling to mind the American catchphrase "some solution is better than no solution" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;114). Similar observations have been made of [[Japan]]ese-American relations. Noting the difference in time perceptions between the two countries, former ambassador to [[Tokyo]], [[Mike Mansfield]] commented "We're too fast, they're too slow" (Cohen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;118).

=== Influence on global affairs ===

Different perceptions of time across cultures can influence global communication. When writing about time perspective, Gonzalez and Zimbardo comment that "There is no more powerful, pervasive influence on how individuals think and cultures interact than our different perspectives on time—the way we learn how we mentally partition time into past, present and future." (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;227)

Depending upon where an individual is from, their perception of time might be that "the [[clock]] rules the day" or that "we'll get there when we get there."{{Cite quote|date=October 2015}}
Improving prospects for success in the global community requires understanding cultural differences, [[traditions]] and communication styles.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}}

The monochronic-oriented approach to negotiations is direct, linear and rooted in the characteristics that illustrate low context tendencies. The low context  culture approaches diplomacy in a lawyerly, dispassionate fashion with a clear idea of acceptable outcomes and a plan for reaching them. Draft arguments would be prepared elaborating positions. A monochronic culture, more concerned with time, deadlines and schedules, tends to grow impatient and want to rush to "close the deal."

More polychronic-oriented cultures come to diplomatic situations with no particular importance placed on time. Chronemics is one of the channels of [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] communication preferred by a High context Polychronic negotiator over verbal communication.The polychronic approach to negotiations will emphasis building trust between participants, forming coalitions and finding consensus. High context Polychronic negotiators might be charged with emotion toward a subject thereby obscuring an otherwise obvious solution.

== Control of time in power relationships ==
{{Also|Personal boundaries}}
Time has a definite relationship to [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Though power most often refers to the ability to influence people (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;314), power is also related to dominance and status (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;315).

For example, in the workplace, those in a leadership or management position treat time and – by virtue of position – have their time treated differently from those who are of a lower stature position. Anderson and Bowman have identified three specific examples of how chronemics and power converge in the [[workplace]] – waiting time, talk time and work time.

=== Waiting time ===
Researchers Insel and Lindgren (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;325) write that the act of making an individual of a lower stature wait is a sign of dominance. They note that one who "is in the position to cause another to wait has power over him. To be kept waiting is to imply that one's time is less valuable than that of the one who imposes the wait."

=== Talk time ===
There is a direct correlation between the power of an individual in an organization and conversation. This includes both length of conversation, turn-taking and who initiates and ends a conversation. Extensive research indicates that those with more power in an organization will speak more often and for a greater length of time. Meetings between superiors and subordinates provide an opportunity to illustrate this concept. A superior – regardless of whether or not they are running the actual meeting – lead discussions, ask questions and have the ability to speak for longer periods of time without interruption. Likewise, research shows that turn-taking is also influenced by power. Social psychologist Nancy Henley notes that "Subordinates are expected to yield to superiors and there is a cultural expectation that a subordinate will not interrupt a superior" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;326). The length of response follows the same pattern. While the superior can speak for as long as they want, the responses of the subordinate are shorter in length. [[Albert Mehrabian]] noted that deviation from this pattern led to negative perceptions of the subordinate by the superior. Beginning and ending a communication interaction in the workplace is also controlled by the higher-status individual in an organization. The time and duration of the conversation are dictated by the higher-status individual.

=== Work time === 
The time of high status individuals is perceived as valuable, and they control their own time. On the other hand, a subordinate with less power has their time controlled by a higher status individual and are in less control of their time – making them likely to report their time to a higher authority. Such practices are more associated with those in non-supervisory roles or in blue collar rather than [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professions. Instead, as power and status in an organization increases, the flexibility of the work schedule also increases. For instance, while administrative professionals might keep a [[Working time#9-to-5|9 to 5]] work schedule, their superiors may keep less structured hours. This does not mean that the superior works less. They may work longer, but the structure of their work environment is not strictly dictated by the traditional work day. Instead, as Koehler and their associates note "individuals who spend more time, especially spare time, to meetings, to committees, and to developing contacts, are more likely to be influential decision makers" (Guerrero, DeVito &amp; Hecht, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;327).

A specific example of the way power is expressed through work time is scheduling. As Yakura and others have noted in research shared by Ballard and Seibold, "scheduling reflects the extent to which the sequencing and duration of plans activities and events are formalized" (Ballard and Seibold, p.&amp;nbsp;6). Higher-status individuals have very precise and formal schedules – indicating that their stature requires that they have specific blocks of time for specific meetings, projects and appointments. Lower status individuals however, may have less formalized schedules. Finally, the schedule and appointment calendar of the higher status individual will take precedence in determining where, when and the importance of a specific event or appointment.

== Associated theories ==

=== Expectancy violations theory ===
Developed by [[Judee Burgoon]], [[expectancy violations theory]] (EVT) sees communication as the exchange of information which is high in relational content and can be used to violate the expectations of another which will be perceived as either positively or negatively depending on the liking between the two people.

When our expectations are violated, we will respond in specific ways. If an act is unexpected and is assigned favorable interpretation, and it is evaluated positively, it will produce more favorable outcomes than an expected act with the same interpretation and evaluation.

=== Interpersonal adaptation theory ===
{{Main|Interpersonal adaptation theory}}
The interpersonal adaptation theory (IAT), founded by Judee Burgoon, states that adaptation in interaction is responsive to the needs, expectations, and desires of communicators and affects how communicators position themselves in relation to one another and adapt to one another's communication. For example, they may match each other's behavior, synchronize the timing of behavior, or behave in dissimilar ways. It is also important to note that individuals bring to interactions certain requirements that reflect basic human needs, expectations about behavior based on social norms, and desires for interaction based on goals and personal preferences (Burgoon, Stern &amp; Dillman, 1995).

'''Civil Contract''' ({{lang-hy|Քաղաքացիական պայմանագիր}}, {{lang|hy-Latn|K՛aghak՛aciakan paymanagir}}, '''ՔՊ''', often shortened to Քաղպայմանագիր, ''K՛aghpaymanagir'') is a [[List of political parties in Armenia|political party]] in [[Armenia]] which was established on July 24, 2013 as an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]. Its governing board was formed on December 9, 2013. On May 30, 2015, it became a political party. Civil Contract participated in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 Armenian parliamentary election]] and the [[Yerevan City Council election, 2017|2017 Yerevan City Council election]] as part of the [[Way Out Alliance]] (''Yelk''). After the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution]] led by [[Nikol Pashinyan]], the Yelk [[political alliance]] rose to power and Civil Contract became part of the ruling coalition in the [[Armenian National Assembly|National Assembly]].

== {{anchor|Origins of Civil Contract}}History ==
[[File:Civil contract (Armenia) 2.jpg|thumbnail|July 3, 2014 press conference|alt=Man speaking to reporters from a podium]]
Civil Contract was known for the first time on January 23, 2013, when MP [[Nikol Pashinyan]] from the opposition bloc publicized a project to establish a new political process in the newspaper ''Haykakan Zhamanak'' (''The Armenian Times'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aravot-en.am/2013/01/30/151830/|title=Can Nikol Pashinyan’s Civic Contract Change Anything?|last=Harutyunyan|first=Tatev|date=January 30, 2013|work=Aravot Daily|access-date=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several months afterwards, the text of the contract was widely discussed in Armenian political forums. An updated version of the contract was published and Civil Contract, a new political union, was announced on July 24 of that year. The union announced that before its first conference, the text of the contract would be amended and clarified and a detailed road map created.

The Civil Contract Return Fund was established to ensure that the party's funding complies with Armenian law and its activities are democratically organized. Funds donated to Civil Contract will be stored in the fund's account and vault. Accounting will be conducted under the supervision of the board of trustees, which is independent of the governing board and controls the fund's expenditures. According to the party's contract, "Citizens who have donated money or property to the Contract shall have the right to request information on spending, and their demands are to be satisfied within three days' time."{{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== {{anchor|Funding of Civil Contract}}Funding ==
[[File:Civil contract (Armenia) 3.jpg|thumbnail|July 3, 2014 press conference|alt=Man at a podium, addressing reporters]]
The Civil Contract governing board published "Financing Politics and Civil Contract", an article touching on the issues of fiscal transparency and financing public and political life in Armenia, on April 26, 2014:

{{Quote|Financing politics is one of the essential entangled knots of the history of the Third Republic. How is the public-political activity financed in Armenia? It's a question the proper answer of which is not known. One can guess, put forward hypotheses, but the society does not have a reliable and verifiable answer to the question ... The most popular answer is that "we are funded by thousands of our supporters". This is an answer, which generates new questions: whom and how do the supporters give the money? Who takes it and under what conditions? How do others learn whether their retainer has donated that much, more or less money ... ?

From the very first stage of the debates over establishing “civil contract” public–political union the issues about funding the activities of the contract have been the subject of heated debate. How is the contract going to be financed? Who will be financing it? The answers to these questions were principal for us. And if we have serious ambition to achieve fundamental changes in public–political relations, we need to try to work ourselves out of the Armenian traditional funding mechanisms of political activity. We have formulated the problem the following way: if we need 1000 [[AMD]], we need to find not a single person that will give us that money, but we need to find 1000 people each of whom will donate 1 AMD.{{Full citation needed|date=November 2014}}}}

The '''Coalition of Women for Peace''' ({{lang-he|קואליציית נשים לשלום}}) is an umbrella organization of women's groups in [[Israel]], established in November 2000. It describes itself as "a feminist organization against the occupation of Palestine and for a just peace.".&lt;ref name="cwp-a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?page_id=340&amp;lang=en|title=About CWP|publisher=Coalition of Women for Peace|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWP says that it is "committed to ending the occupation and creating a more just society, while enhancing women’s inclusion and participation in the public discourse".&lt;ref name="cwp-a"/&gt;

The groups that founded the Coalition of Women for Peace are [[Machsom Watch]], Noga Feminist Journal, [[Women in Black]], The Fifth Mother, TANDI, [[Bat Shalom]], [[New Profile]] and NELED.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?page_id=2020&amp;lang=en CWP History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition of Women for Peace came to an agreement on their principles for a solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at a conference in Nazareth in November 2000.

# the struggle to end the occupation on the basis of two states for two peoples
# Jerusalem as two capitals for two states
# a just solution to the refugee problem based on UN resolutions
# involvement of women in peace negotiations
# reducing Israel’s militarism
# social and economic justice for all
# equal citizenship of the Palestinian citizens and integration of Israel into the Middle East

In 2009 the Coalition of Women for Peace held a series of ideological and political debates to revise these principles to reflect the current positions of its activists. This includes a political solution based on historical justice and international law (recognizing the two state solution as only one possible outcome) and support for the Right of Return of Palestinian refugees.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==View on Palestinian Statehood Bid==
CWP released a statement in September 2011 saying that a "mere declaration of statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is incapable of ending decades of occupation and racial discrimination based on legal mechanisms that match the UN definition of apartheid, to solve the refugee problem or to lead to civil equality between Jews and Palestinians citizens of Israel. These issues can only be resolved in a just agreement to end the occupation while maintaining the basic individual and collective rights of Palestinians, wherever they reside. We call for ending the occupation, maintaining the Palestinians right of return and the right to resist the occupation by all legitimate and popular forms of resistance acceptable by international norms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?p=2338&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
CWP was one of several non-profits whose funding by the [[New Israel Fund]] caused controversy because of CWP's support for some aspects of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS - boycott, divestment and sanctions]] campaign against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/61805/new-israel-fund-opening-in-australia/ New Israel Fund opening in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The funding by the NIF caused a row in Australia where the NIF was opening a new branch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwire.com.au/news/dear-robin-dear-jason/16418 Dear Robin, Dear Jason] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061205/http://www.jwire.com.au/news/dear-robin-dear-jason/16418 |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time, in May 2011, that the NIF decided to abruptly halt all funding to CWP, despite statements to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?p=2090&amp;lang=en CWP responds to NIF]&lt;/ref&gt; CWP posted on its website scathing letters to the NIF, saying "It seems particularly unfortunate that the exact timing of cutting off the relations of NIF and CWP has been dictated by [[NGO Monitor]]." and "The public attitude of NIF in relation to CWP is a rather disgraceful example of following and accepting the right-wing discourse and its strategies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?p=2102&amp;lang=en CWP full response to NIF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527085706/http://www.coalitionofwomen.org/?p=2102&amp;lang=en |date=2011-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick David Henderson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CMG}}  (10 April 1927&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4PN4GnsrSgC&amp;q=Patrick+David+Henderson+10+april+1927&amp;dq=Patrick+David+Henderson+10+april+1927&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMhdr8maTeAhWFBSwKHU8qA3UQ6AEILzAC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/ac700a10-c677-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 30 September 2018) was a British economist.  He was the chief economist at the Economics and Statistics Department at the [[OECD]] in 1984&amp;ndash;1992.&lt;ref name="economist_garbage_2004" /&gt; Before that he worked as an academic economist in Britain, first at Oxford (Fellow of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]]) and later at [[University College London]] (Professor of Economics, 1975&amp;ndash;1983); as a British civil servant (first as an Economic Advisor in [[HM Treasury]], and later as Chief Economist in the [[Ministry of Aviation]]); and as a staff member of the [[World Bank]] (1969&amp;ndash;1975).  In 1985 he gave the [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], which were published in the book ''Innocence and Design: The Influence of Economic Ideas on Policy'' (Blackwell, 1986).

After leaving the OECD, Henderson was an independent author and consultant, and acted as Visiting Fellow or Professor at the OECD Development Centre (Paris), the Centre for European Policy Studies (Brussels), [[Monash University]], the [[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]], the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]], the [[Melbourne Business School]], and [[Westminster Business School]]. Subsequently he was a Fellow of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]].&lt;ref name="gwpf"&gt;[http://www.thegwpf.org/who-we-are/academic-advisory-council/ Academic Advisory Council] - The Global Warming Policy Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Henderson was appointed to the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] as a Companion (CMG).

Henderson and [[Nigel Lawson]] appealed to then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to investigate the economic implications of the potential implementation of policies put forth by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings.

Henderson and [[Ian Castles]], a former head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics argued that the IPCC's projections of future emissions of greenhouse gases was flawed.&lt;ref name="economist_garbage_2004"&gt;{{citation |work=The Economist |date=27 May 2004 |accessdate=1 February 2016|title=Measuring Economies: Garbage In, Garbage Out |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2705923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC's forecasts of global output were based on national GDP converted to dollars using market exchange rates. Henderson and [[Ian Castles]] were critical of the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]] (SRES) report by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) that was published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;[http://www.lavoisier.com.au/papers/articles/IPPCissues.html Letters to the IPCC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="castles_henderson_2003" /&gt;{{rp|159–185}}&lt;ref name="castles_henderson_2003"&gt;Castles and Henderson (2003), [[Energy and Environment]], 14&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|415–435}} The core of their critique was the use of market exchange rates (MER) for international comparison, in lieu of the theoretically favoured [[Geary-Khamis dollar|PPP exchange rate]] which corrects for differences in purchasing power.&lt;ref name="Ref_h"&gt;Nordhaus (2007), [[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]], 29:349-372&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC rebutted this criticism.&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;{{citation |work=The Economist |date=13 February 2003 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/1579333 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |title=Hot Potato: the IPCC had better check its calculations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_j"&gt;{{citation |work=The Economist |date=6 November 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2016|title=Hot Potato Revisited: a lack-of-progress report on the IPCC |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2189568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_l"&gt;Gruebler et al. (2004), [[Energy and Environment]], 15:11-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_m"&gt;Holtsmark and Alfsen (2005), Climatic Change, 68:11-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;Manne et al. (2005), Climatic Change, 71:1-8&lt;/ref&gt; Castles and Henderson later acknowledged that they were mistaken that future greenhouse gas emissions had been significantly overestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2012/11/29/henderson-on-castles.html |accessdate=29 November 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817084306/http://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2012/11/29/henderson-on-castles.html |archivedate=17 August 2014 |title=Henderson on Castles |publisher=[[Bishop Hill (blog)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson has suggested about climate change that the science is not settled and criticized the [[Stern Review]] regarding the economics of global warming.  He has also published books that strongly criticize "[[corporate social responsibility]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/corporate-%C2%ADirresponsibility |title=Corporate irresponsibility|newspaper= [[Financial Post]] | date= 13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latterly he was chairman of the Academic Advisory Council of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]].&lt;ref name=nei-20130621&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionthe-more-things-change/ |title=The more things change... |author=David Henderson |publisher=''Nuclear Engineering International'' |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gwpf" /&gt;

He was educated at [[Ellesmere College|Ellesmere College, Shropshire]].

He died on 30 September 2018 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/about/secretary-general/david-henderson-1927-2018.htm David Henderson 1927-2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">A '''deliberative referendum''' is a [[referendum]] that increases public deliberation through purposeful institutional design.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2013) ″Deliberative Voting: Realising Constitutional Referendum Democracy″ Public Law p.557. &lt;/ref&gt; The term ‵deliberative referendum′ stems from [[deliberative democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″12(4) Election Law Journal p.509. &lt;/ref&gt; which emphasises that ″the legitimacy of decisions can be increased if ... decisions are preceded by authentic deliberation.″&lt;ref&gt;Leib, Ethan J (2006) ″Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?″ 54 Buffalo Law Review p.903.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative design features can promote public deliberation prior to and during the referendum vote to increase its actual and perceived legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Leib910&gt;Leib, Ethan J (2006) ″Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?″ 54 Buffalo Law Review p.910.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberative referendums encourage open-minded and informed reasoning, rather than rigid ″pre-formed opinions.″&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal pp.508-512.&lt;/ref&gt; ″[A]fter deliberations, citizens routinely alter their preferences″.&lt;ref name=Leib910/&gt;

In practice, a deliberative referendum includes a variety of institutional design features. These include using a [[citizens' jury]] to set referendum questions and educate the public, further public education via mandatory interactive tutorials before voting, and focusing referendums on broad values rather than technicalities.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2017) ″The Deliberative Case for Constitutional Referenda ″ Election Journal p. 214-215. &lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors note how legal regulation can also aid referendum deliberation.&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.523.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One deliberative referendum method increasingly in use is the [[Citizens' Initiative Review]]; this is a randomly-selected body, similar to a citizen's jury, convened specifically to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will later vote on.&lt;ref&gt; John Gastil and Robert Richards, ‘Making Direct Democracy Deliberative Through Random Assemblies’ (2013) 41(2) , Politics &amp; Society  (2013) 41 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Constitutional]] deliberative referendums can ″provide citizens with a meaningful say in determining the most fundamental constitutional decisions that affect their lives.″&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.510.&lt;/ref&gt; Voter deliberation is significant here as the referendum result could change the state’s political status or impact the enjoyment of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2013) ″Deliberative Voting: Realising Constitutional Referendum Democracy″ Public Law p.559.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain methods of food production and certain types of foods have greater environmental impacts than others.  The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] advises that avoiding eating beef is one of the two most important actions most people can take to help the environment&lt;ref name="earthsave"&gt;,{{cite web | url=http://www.earthsave.org/environment/foodchoices.htm | title=How Our Food Choices can Help Save the Environment | publisher=EarthSave | accessdate=August 15, 2015 | author=Boyan, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the large amounts of water needed to produce beef, the pollution from fecal, ammonia, carbon dioxide and methane waste associated with raising cows, the physical damage from grazing, and the destruction of wildlife habitat and rainforests to produce land for grazing.&lt;ref name=earthsave /&gt;  Industrially produced meat, such as that from animals raised in [[CAFO|Confined Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs]], has "the greatest impact of any food product on the environment".&lt;ref name=time1208 /&gt;

Packaging of commercially produced foods is also an area of concern,&lt;ref name=time1208 /&gt; because of the environmental impact of both the production of the packaging and the disposal of the packaging.

Transportation of commercially produced foods can increase that food's impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=time1208 /&gt;

===Labor practices===

Within the [[Food systems|food system]] there are many low-paid occupations.

===Distribution of wealth===
Since the 1980s, policies promoting global [[free trade]] have increased the amount of food exported from poorer countries, which may adversely affect the food available for their own populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brigham|first=Anne Margrethe|date=2011-11-01|title=Agricultural Exports and Food Insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Qualititative Configurational Analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2011.00554.x/abstract|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=29|issue=6|pages=729–748|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2011.00554.x|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign to reduce levels of food imports, however, may reduce the incomes of farmers in poorer countries, who rely on export sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/25/ethicalliving.foodanddrink|title=Air-freight food must pass fair trade test to retain organic label in future|last=Vidal|first=John|date=2007-10-25|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|last2=editor|first2=environment|language=English|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food availability===
Since the 1950s, the food system has become increasingly global and a small number of [[Multinational corporation|multi-national corporations]] now dominate trade in many foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Tim|date=2003-09-01|title=Food Industrialisation and Food Power: Implications for Food Governance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00223.x/abstract|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=21|issue=5-6|pages=555–568|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00223.x|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt; One result is that the proportion of industrially [[processed foods]] in diets is increasing globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=John|date=2010-09-27|title=Food consumption trends and drivers|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2793|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=365|issue=1554|pages=2793–2807|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0149|issn=0962-8436| pmc=2935122 |pmid=20713385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Public health]] researchers label these changes the [[nutrition transition]], arguing that, in poorer countries, they are causing increasing rates of [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popkin|first=Barry M|last2=Adair|first2=Linda S|last3=Ng|first3=Shu Wen|date=2012-01-01|title=Global nutrition transition and the pandemic of obesity in developing countries|url=https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x|journal=Nutrition Reviews|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x|issn=0029-6643| pmc=3257829 |pmid=22221213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food animal treatment===
Many food animals are raised inhumanely.

===Policy===
Many governmental food policies have [[unintended consequences]].

==Specific food choices==

===Meat===
[[File:Pigs at Polyface Farm.jpg|thumb|Free-range pigs grazing at [[Polyface Farm]], which promotes 'more sustainable' methods of animal husbandry.]]
{{Main|Ethics of eating meat}}
Some ethicists argue that the keeping and killing of animals for human consumption is in itself unethical.&lt;ref name="huffpo1501"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neil-zevnik/humane-animal-protein-an-_b_6482072.html | title=The Humane Omnivore: An Oxymoron? | work=The Huffington Post | date=January 26, 2015 | accessdate=August 13, 2015 | author=Zevnik, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that animal husbandry is "essential to sustainable farms, which don't rely on fossil fuels and chemicals," rather using animal waste as fertilizer and animal activity as weed and pest control and using animals to "convert vegetation that's inedible to humans, and growing on marginal, uncultivated land, into food."&lt;ref name="nyt1204" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic11"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/eating-animals/250179/ | title=Eating Animals | work=The Atlantic | date=December 20, 2011 | accessdate=August 13, 2015 | author=Niman, Nicolette Hahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method in which food animals are raised and the type of food animal affect the ethics of eating that animal. Farm-raised oysters cause minimal environmental damage and are raised humanely.&lt;ref name="oysters"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/04/consider_the_oyster.html | title=It's Okay for Vegans to Eat Oysters | work=Slate | date=April 7, 2010 | accessdate=August 13, 2015 | author=Cox, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy and eggs===
Dairy and egg production have ethical consequences, in particular in large-scale industrialized production.  Chickens and milk-animals raised in industrial operations are often treated inhumanely.

Small-scale production of eggs, such as by [[Backyard chickens|backyard chicken]] raisers and small diversified farms raising pastured birds or milk-animals, are less ethically fraught but still create some issues for ethicists.

===Seafood===
{{See also|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}
Industrial fishing has broad effects with ethical consequences.

===Crops===
Some foods produced in developing countries are exported in quantities that threaten the ability of local residents to affordably obtain their traditional foods.  Western demand for [[quinoa]], a traditional food in Bolivia Peru and Ecuador, has become so high that producers are eating significantly less of the grain, preferring to sell it for import instead and sparking concerns about malnutrition.&lt;ref name="guardian1301"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/14/quinoa-andes-bolivia-peru-crop | title=Quinoa brings riches to the Andes | work=The Guardian | date=January 14, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2015 | author=Collyns, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Fair trade debate}}
Some critics of the food ethics movement argue that parsing the various concerns is futile.&lt;ref name="nyt1204" /&gt;

[[FLO International|Fairtrade International]], the certifying body for Fair Trade products, has been accused of "misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices"&lt;ref name=ft0608 /&gt; and giving [[Fairtrade certification]] to at least one coffee association despite the fact they were "illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land."&lt;ref name=ft0608 /&gt;

==Areas of agreement==
Most food ethicists agree that some food choices are more ethical than others.

The '''Galician Youth Union''' (UMG, ''Unión da Mocidade Galega'' in [[Galician language]]) is the [[youth wing]] of the [[Galician People's Union]]. It was created in August 1977.

==History==
The document of the [[Galician People's Union]] (UPG) ''The youth of the party'', in February 1977, included the decision to create the UMG due to the increase in the number of supporters, members and activists of the [[Galician People's Union|UPG]] in high school or that were young workers. University students were already members of the [[Galician Revolutionary Students]] (ERGA). This led the party to the creation of a [[Youth wing|youth organization]] which, besides serving to bring to the [[Galician people|Galician]] youth "a [[Galician nationalism|patriotic]] and communist political line", could address the youth particular issues and problems effectively. The creation of UMG was ratified in the 1st Congress of [[Galician People's Union|UPG]] in August 1977, few days after the UMG itself was officially founded.

In the spring of 1977 a recruitment of militants was carried out, along with cell organization and theoretical and programmatic discussion. The constituent congress was held on the 14 and 15 August 1977, under the slogan "For a free and socialist [[Galiza]]". In that congress the UMG approved the statutes of the organization and a program that analyzed the specific situation of the [[Galician people|Galician youth]], the role of UMG that context and the alternatives that the organization should offer, including a table of "minimal demands". The UMG defined itself as the ''[[Galician nationalism|Patriotic]] and communist organization of [[Galiza]] and the [[youth wing]] of the [[Galician People's Union]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.calameo.com/books/000471136227f1c58ba55 Final document of the 1st congress of the Galician Youth Union.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the UMG participated in the creation of Galiza Nova, the [[youth wing]] of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG). Since then, UMG has subordinated its political action to [[Galiza Nova]], rarely doing solo acts. Since 1988, after the creation of [[Galiza Nova]] (BNG youth organization), UMG renounced to make public activity, focusing all their efforts in working for the BNG.

==Ideology==
Like the [[Galician People's Union|UPG]], the UMG declares itself [[Marxism|communist]] and [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]], and believes that the establishment of [[Scientific socialism|socialism]] in [[Galiza]] necessarily passes by the previous [[national liberation]] of the [[Galiza|country]]. Among [[Marxism]] the UMG follows the [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology, although the organization also includes in their ideology the thought of the [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalists]] previous to the [[Spanish Civil War]], like [[Castelao]], [[Alexandre Bóveda]] or [[Ramón Suárez Picallo]]. The UMG also considers itself the continuation of the [[Federación de Mocedades Galeguistas]].

==Organization==
The first statutes of UMG, established [[democratic centralism]] as the main organizational principle. The organization is formed as a pyramidal organization, divided into zones and localities and defining [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] as the basic fundamental core (called "Zone Assembly" since 1990). Local Committees and Area Committees are the intermediate direction bodies, while the [[Central Committee]] acts as the supreme body of the UMG between congresses and elected by (and in every) the National Congress. The Executive Committee is elected by the Central Committee. The highest governing body is the National Congress. Heading the UMG is the Secretary or general secretary, with executive functions.

The '''Gray Panthers''' are a series of multi-generational local [[advocacy]] networks in the United States which confront [[ageism]] and many other [[social justice]] issues. The organization was formed by [[Maggie Kuhn]] in response to her forced retirement from the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] at the age of 65 in 1970.

In addition to its initial response to the issue of forced retirement, Gray Panthers have challenged other ageist laws and stereotypes and engaged in anti-war activism, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] preservation, inter-generational housing, [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] advocacy, [[environmentalism]], the fair treatment of people in nursing homes, and the promotion of [[Single-payer healthcare|single-payer health care]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gray Panthers, NYC Network (Summer 2016). “Gray Panthers Summary.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009).

==History==

=== Founding history ===
Maggie Kuhn’s interest in older persons’ rights existed well before she founded the Gray Panthers in 1970. She was involved with the White House Conference on Aging in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,16.&lt;/ref&gt; and appalled by the way people in some [[retirement home]]s were treated.

What really sparked her determination to form an activist organization was when she found herself a victim of the lack of rights for older persons in 1970, forced to retire from a job she loved in the Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/obituaries/maggie-kuhn-89-the-founder-of-the-gray-panthers-is-dead.html|title=Maggie Kuhn, 89, Founder of the Gray Panthers, is Dead|last=Thomas Jr|first=Robert|date=23 April 1995|work=|access-date=14 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of passively accepting retirement, Kuhn decided to band together with other people she knew who were also forced to retire. The lack of accepting the status quo would not just form the Gray Panther organization, but also the Gray Panther name--“It’s a fun name. There’s a certain militancy, rather than just a docile acceptance of what our country’s doing.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/cs/quotes/a/maggie_kuhn.htm|title=Maggie Kuhn Quotes|last=Lewis|first=Jone Johnson|date=29 February 2016|website=About Education|publisher=|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kuhn formed the organization, her alliances were not just limited to other older persons facing a plight similar to her own. As indicated by the Gray Panthers’ slogan which endures to this day, “Age and Youth in Action,” she made it a priority to include people of all generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ken-dychtwald/liberating-aging_b_1555935.html|title=Liberating Aging|last=Dychtwald|first=Ken|date=30 May 2012|work=|access-date=14 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray Panthers membership continues to be inclusive of people of diverse ages.

=== Issues in the 1970s and 1980s ===
During this period, the main issues of the Gray Panthers included forced retirement, ageist stereotypes, cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and [[world peace]].

There had been a mandatory forced retirement age at 65, based on the perception that older persons could not be productive members of a workplace after that age. While that stereotype was difficult to overcome, the Panthers were ultimately successful in their efforts to overturn the law, and in 1986, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law banning mandatory retirement. The law was signed by [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]], as of that time the oldest ever President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other ageist stereotypes that the Gray Panthers wanted to end. In particular the stereotype that older persons were “impotent, frail, disabled, demented, or dependent.”&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; By confronting those stereotypes, the Gray Panthers were at the forefront of ideas some considered provocative—namely, ideas that older persons should be able to live in inter-generational housing,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that older people can and should freely have sex. And, of course, many of Maggie Kuhn’s quotes—including,”Old age is not a disease, it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses”—were used as weapons against ageist stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While the Gray Panthers wanted to counteract the stereotypes that older persons were weak, disabled, and incapable of doing much physical labor, the organization still cared deeply for people who were frail. As such, the organization was among the most vocal opponents to President Reagan’s proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the ban on mandatory retirement, this was an issue where the Gray Panthers were able to get what they wanted because Medicare and Social Security were saved from deep cuts.

Another key facet of Gray Panther work from its early years was its advocacy for [[peace]]. The Panthers, both young and old, were particularly vociferous in its opposition to the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/maggiegrowls/panthers.html|title=Maggie Growls|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and war in general was a part of the Gray Panthers platform from the very beginning. The organization’s work in being anti-war did not stop with Vietnam—the Panthers were opponents of several of President Reagan’s plans, such as his [[Strategic Defense Initiative|“Star Wars”]] and increased foreign intervention in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issues in the 1990s and 2000s ===
While mandatory retirement ages were abolished in 1986, there were still many threats and social injustices for Gray Panthers to address, including world peace, Medicare and Social Security Benefits, and single-payer health care. They would also become a prominent advocate for [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]].

The organization was prominent in protests against both Iraq Wars, in [[Gulf War|1991]] and [[Iraq War (2003–11)|2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2005/03/21/maggie-kuhn-and-the-gray-panthers/|title=Maggie Kuhn and the Gray Panthers|last=Williams|first=Jasmin K.|date=21 March 2005|work=|access-date=14 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjek, Roger (2009). Gray Panthers. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; There were even some Gray Panthers who were arrested over protests in the 2003. While such efforts were originally unsuccessful, protesting these wars resonated with younger generations of potential Gray Panthers, therefore, engaging the “youth” part of “Age and Youth in Action.” Furthermore, with the 2003 Iraq War, the Gray Panthers were critical of American intervention years before the majority of Americans shared similar opinions.

The Gray Panthers also advocated for a robust national health care system, whether it be through the preservation of Medicare and Social Security, or through single-payer health care. On these issues, the organization continued to succeed in preserving Medicare and Social Security, though the Clinton Administration’s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care proposal in 1993-94]] fell short of what the Gray Panthers wanted. In fact, the health care plan Maggie Kuhn championed what was described by The New York Times as “the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The organization protested [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]]’s [[Don't ask, don't tell|“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”]] policy which kept members of the military from being openly LGBT. The Gray Panthers were, therefore, at the forefront of an issue which was deeply unpopular at the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Present-day issues ===
In the present day, the Gray Panthers continue to be at the forefront of advocacy against ageism and for social justice at the local, national, and international levels.

Within the United States, the Gray Panthers have received considerable media attention for triggering an audit of [[Nursing home care|nursing home]] violations, confronting ageist stereotypes at all levels of society, and bringing attention to other issues which affect the quality of life of all seniors.  The Gray Panthers are working with the United States Department of Labor to ensure support for family caregivers, and are involved in discussions on how to deliver improved home health care in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Reform-at-nursing-homes-key-6859602.php|title=Reform at Nursing Homes Key|last=Kash|first=Laurie|date=29 February 2016|work=|access-date=14 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action and advocacy for older persons is not confined just to the United States.  The Gray Panthers have also become increasingly prominent at the [[United Nations]]. The organization is one of the strongest advocates for a binding global Convention to protect the Human Rights of Older Persons.  Gray Panthers has been instrumental in ensuring that the concerns of older persons have been enshrined in the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], the world’s blueprint for social, economic and environmental development. Ensuring that the rights of older women would be recognized, Gray Panthers successfully overcame resistance so that the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women had explicit protections.  Gray Panthers has become one of the most prominent American [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organizations]] advocating for the rights of older persons globally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Handover''', in the political-historical sense, often refers to the transfer of power of former [[colony|colonies]] (particularly those of [[Commonwealth of Nations|former British colonies]]) to the local people. The term was also used for the transfer of the [[Panama Canal]] and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] to [[Panama]], and the returns of sovereignty to [[Iraq]] by the [[United States]].
* The transfer of [[sovereignty]] of [[Hong Kong]], a former [[United Kingdom|British]] [[crown colony]], from UK to [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997. After the Handover, Hong Kong has become a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|''special administrative region'']], a  first-order division. See [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]].
* The transfer of sovereignty of [[Macau]] from [[Portugal]] to [[People's Republic of China]] in 1999, and has become a special administrative region.

Also the term (especially in the media) refers to the Olympic protocol during the closing ceremonies also known like Antwerp ceremonial when the mayor of the city that organized the Games returns the [[Olympic flag]] to the president of the [[International Olympic Committee]], who then passes it on to the mayor of the next city to host the [[Olympic Games]].

'''[[Healthcare rationing]] in the [[United States]]''' exists in various forms. Access to private [[health insurance]] is rationed on price and ability to pay. Those unable to afford a health insurance policy are unable to acquire a private plan except by employer-provided and other job-attached coverage, and insurance companies sometimes pre-screen applicants for pre-existing medical conditions. Applicants with such conditions may be declined cover or pay higher premuums and/or have extra conditions imposed such as a waiting period.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16obama.html|title=Why We Need Healthcare Reform|accessdate=2017-12-17|date=2009-08-15|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first1=Barack|last1=Obama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bulletin.aarp.org/opinions/othervoices/articles/secret_s_out___we.html |title=Jim Jaffe, "Secret's Out—We Already Ration Medical Care", AARP Bulletin Today, July 30, 2009 |access-date=2009-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926063641/http://bulletin.aarp.org/opinions/othervoices/articles/secret_s_out___we.html |archive-date=2009-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama Health Secretary Sebelius Claims Govt.

The poor are given access to [[Medicaid]], which is restricted by income and asset limits by [[means-testing]], and other federal and state eligibility regulations apply. [[Health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs), which are common among the rest of the population, restrict access to treatment by financial and clinical access limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cIFBgcfUt4C|title=Rationing America's medical care|author1=Martin A.

In the media and in academia, some have advocated explicit healthcare rationing to limit the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. They argue that a proper rationing mechanism would be more equitable and cost-effective.&lt;ref name="WhyRation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="charlierose.com"&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10443 Peter G.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) has argued that [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] are the primary driver of government spending in the long term.&lt;ref name="CBO Testimony"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf CBO Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Peter Singer]] wrote for the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States:&lt;ref name="WhyRation"/&gt;

{{Quote|"Health care is a scarce resource, and all scarce resources are rationed in one way or another. In the United States, most health care is privately financed, and so most rationing is by price: you get what you, or your employer, can afford to insure you for. But our current system of employer-financed health insurance exists only because the federal government encouraged it by making the premiums tax deductible. That is, in effect, a more than $200 billion government subsidy for health care. In the public sector, primarily Medicare, Medicaid and hospital emergency rooms, health care is rationed by long waits, high patient copayment requirements, low payments to doctors that discourage some from serving public patients and limits on payments to hospitals."}}

[[David Leonhardt]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' in June 2009 that rationing presently an economic reality: "The choice isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to health care than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally." He wrote that there are three primary ways the US rations healthcare:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#The increases in healthcare premiums reduce worker pay. In other words, more expensive insurance premiums reduce the growth in household income, which forces tradeoffs between healthcare services and other consumption.
#The increases also prevent smaller companies from affording health insurance for their workers.
#The cost prevents the certain types of care from being provided.

During 2007, nearly 45% of US healthcare expenses were paid for by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/PieChartSourcesExpenditures2007.pdf |title=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-Pie Charts-2007 |access-date=2009-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902052103/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/PieChartSourcesExpenditures2007.pdf |archive-date=2009-09-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, an estimated 46 million individuals in the United States did not have health insurance coverage. Also, an additional 14,000 or more people lost coverage every day for reasons such as loss.{{fact|date=December 2017}}
Health Care Rationing Through Inconvenience: The Third Party's Secret Weapon
Creator
Grumet, Gerald W.
In 2008, [[Tia Powell]] led a [[New York State]] work group to set up guidelines for rationing ventilators during a potential flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Dean, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/health/25vent.html Guidelines for Epidemics: Who Gets a Ventilator?], ''The New York Times'', March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods used==
===By insurance companies===
Dr. Gerald Grumet has chronicled how private insurers and third party payers delay and impede the utilization of medical services through creating inconvenience and confusion for both patients and physicians through complex claims review processes with layers of administrative handling that supersede the autonomy of treating physicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Health Care Rationing Through Inconvenience: The Third Party's Secret Weapon," Grumet, Gerald W., M.D., New England Journal of Medicine. 1989 Aug 31; 321(9): 607-611.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama noted that US healthcare was rationed based on income, type of employment, and pre-existing medical conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He stated that millions of Americans were denied coverage or face higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In an e-mail to Obama supporters, [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] wrote, "Reform will stop 'rationing' - not increase it.... It’s a myth that reform will mean a 'government takeover' of health care or lead to 'rationing.' To the contrary, reform will forbid many forms of rationing that are currently being used by insurance companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/blaise-nutter/axelrods-wh-email-truth-a_b_258634.html Huffington Post-Nutter-Axelrod's Whitehouse E-mail-August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study by researchers at the [[Urban Institute]] found that health spending for uninsured non-elderly Americans was only about 43% of health spending for similar, privately-insured Americans. That implied rationing by price and ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/rationing-health-care-what-does-it-mean/?pagemode=print NYT-Reinhardt-Rationing Healthcare-What Does it Mean?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fareed Zakaria]] wrote that only 38% of small businesses provided health insurance for their employees during 2009, versus 61% in 1993, because of rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/16/AR2009081601757.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 Washington Post-Zakaria-More Crises Needed?-August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc., UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people, allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $300 million in medical claims over five years. It also found that policyholders with breast cancer, lymphoma, and more than 1000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/careers/workingparents/blog/archives/2009/06/rationing_healt.html How Would You Ration Health Care?] Bloomberg Businessweek, citing ''LA Times'' article&lt;/ref&gt;

Private and public insurers all have their own drug formularies through which they set coverage limitations, which may include referrals to the insurance company for a decision on whether the company will approve its share of the costs. American formularies make generalized coverage decisions by class, with cheaper drugs at one end of the scale and more expensive drugs with more conditions for referral and possible denial at the other end. Not all drugs may be in the formulary of every company, and consumers are advised to check the formulary before they buy insurance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahip.org/content/default.aspx?bc=41|329|20888&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomena known as [[medical bankruptcy]] is unheard of in countries with [[universal health care]] in which medical copayments are low or no nonexistent.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In the United States, however, research shows{{who?|date=February 2018}} that many bankruptcies have a strong medical component, even among the insured.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Medical insurance before the [[Affordable Care Act]] allowed annual caps or lifetime caps on coverage, and the high cost of care made it common for insured persons to suffer bankruptcy after breaching those limits.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===By price===
A July 2009 [[NPR]] article quoted various doctors describing how America rations healthcare. Dr. Arthur Kellermann said: "In America, we strictly ration health care. We've done it for years.... But in contrast to other wealthy countries, we don't ration medical care on the basis of need or anticipated benefit. In this country, we mainly ration on the ability to pay. And that is especially evident when you examine the plight of the uninsured in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106168331 NPR-Healthcare Rationing Already Exists-July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationing by price means accepting that there is no triage according to need. Thus, in the private sector, it is accepted that some people get expensive surgeries such as liver transplants or non-life-threatening ones such as cosmetic surgery, when others fail to get cheaper and much more cost-effective care such as [[prenatal care]], which could save the lives of many fetuses and newborn children. Some places, like Oregon for example, explicitly ration Medicaid resources by using medical priorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957673,00.html Time Magazine-Ethics: Rationing Medical Care-Sept 09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling has discovered that Americans are much more likely than Europeans or Canadians to forgo necessary health care (such not seeking a prescribed medicine) on the grounds of cost.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Rationing by pharmaceutical companies===
Pharmaceutical manufacturers often charge much more for drugs in the United States than they charge for the same drugs in Britain, where they know that a higher price would put the drug outside the cost-effectiveness limits applied by regulators such as [[NICE]]]]. American patients, even if they are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, often cannot afford the copayments for drugs, which is rationing based on ability to pay.&lt;ref name="WhyRation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html|title=Why We Must Ration Health Care|first1=Peter|last1=Singer|accessdate=2017-12-17|date=2009-07-15|work=New York Times Magazine|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationing by government control===
After the death of Coby Howard in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Transplant for Coby: Oregon Boy's Death Stirs Debate Over State Decision Not to Pay for High-Risk Treatments|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-28/news/vw-21384_1_marrow-transplant|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=28 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oregon]] began a programme of public consultation to decide which procedures its [[Medicaid]] program should cover in an attempt to develop a transparent process for prioritizing medical services. Howard died of [[leukaemia]], which was not funded. His mother spent the last weeks of his life trying to raise $100,000 to pay for a [[bone marrow transplant]], but the boy died before treatment could begin. [[John Kitzhaber]] began a campaign arguing that thousands of low-income Oregonians lacked access to even basic health services, much less access to transplants. A panel of experts was appointed, the Health Services Commission, to develop a prioritized list of treatments. The state legislators decided where on the list of prioritised procedures the line of eligibility should be drawn. In 1995 there were 745 procedures, 581 of which were eligible for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Philip|last2=Hotze|first2=Timothy|title=Oregon’s Experiment with Prioritizing Public Health Care Services|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|date=April 2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=241–247|url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2011/04/pfor1-1104.html|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican [[Newt Gingrich]] argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. He expressed concern that although there is nothing in the proposed laws that would constitute rationing, the combination of three factors would increase pressure on the government to ration care explicitly for the elderly:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.healthtransformation.net/cs/opeds_news?pressrelease.id=2880 |title=Newt Gingrich, Los Angeles Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 16, 2009 "Healthcare Rationing-Real Scary" |access-date=2009-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822160948/http://www.healthtransformation.net/cs/opeds_news?pressrelease.id=2880 |archive-date=2009-08-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an expanded federal bureaucracy, the pending insolvency of Medicare within a decade, and
the fact that 25% of Medicare costs are incurred in the final year of life.

Princeton Professor [[Uwe Reinhardt]] wrote that both public and private healthcare programs can ration and rebutted the concept that governments alone impose rationing: "Many critics of the current health reform efforts would have us believe that only governments ration things.... On the other hand, these same people believe that when, for similar reasons, a private health insurer refuses to pay for a particular procedure or has a price-tiered formulary for drugs – e.g., asking the insured to pay a 35 percent coinsurance rate on highly expensive biologic specialty drugs that effectively put that drug out of the patient's reach — the insurer is not rationing health care. Instead, the insurer is merely allowing "consumers" (formerly "patients") to use their discretion on how to use their own money. The insurers are said to be managing prudently and efficiently, forcing patients to trade off the benefits of health care against their other budget priorities."&lt;ref&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/03/rationing-health-care-what-does-it-mean/?pagemode=print NYT-Rheinhardt-Rationing Healthcare: What Does It Mean?-July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2009, former Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] wrote against rationing by government entities, referring to what she interpreted as such an entity in current reform legislation as a "[[death panel]]" and "downright evil." Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation, [[H.R. 3200]], would allow Medicare for the first time to cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up a living will or planning hospice treatment. Patients would be allowed but not required to seek out such advice on their own. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/08/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5226795.shtml|title=Palin Weighs In On Healthcare Reform|accessdate=2017-12-17|date=2009-08-08|first1=Dan|last1=Farber|website=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as governor, Palin had supported such end of life counseling and advance directives from patients in Alaska in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.state.ak.us/archive.php?id=1094&amp;type=6 Office of the Governor of Alaska-Healthcare Decisions Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezra Klein]] described in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' how polls indicate senior citizens are increasingly resistant to healthcare reform because of concerns about cuts to the existing Medicare program that may be required to fund it. That is creating an unusual and potent political alliance, with Republicans arguing to protect the existing Medicare program although they historically opposed that and other major entitlement programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/28/AR2009082802109.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 Washington Post-Ezra Klein-No Government Healthcare! (Except for Mine)-August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO scoring of the proposed H.R. 3200 (America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009) included $219 billion in savings over 10 years, some of which would come from Medicare changes.&lt;ref name="CBO Report-July 14"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf CBO Report-July 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

===By economic value added===

A concept called "[[quality-adjusted life year]]" (QALY - pronounced "qualy") is used by [[Medicare (Australia)|Australian Medicare]] to measure the cost-benefit of applying a particular medical procedure. Ir reflects the quality and the quantity of life added by incurring a particular medical expense. The measure has been used for over 30 years in the country's universal single-payer healthcare system and has been implemented in several other countries to help with rationing decisions. Australia applies QALY measures to control costs and ration care and allows private supplemental insurance for those who can afford it.&lt;ref name="WhyRation"/&gt;

===By comparative effectiveness research===
[[File:Medicare spending per capita.png|thumb|Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006]]
Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs but no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care while significantly reducing costs through comparative effectiveness research. Writing in the ''New York Times'', [[David Leonhardt]] described how the cost of treating the most common form of early-stage, slow-growing [[prostate]] cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (radiation beam therapy):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Some doctors swear by one treatment, others by another. But no one really knows which is best. Rigorous research has been scant. Above all, no serious study has found that the high-technology treatments do better at keeping men healthy and alive. Most die of something else before prostate cancer becomes a problem.}}

According to economist [[Peter A. Diamond]] and research cited by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the US also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9317/05-29-NASI_Speech.pdf Peter Diamond-Healthcare and Behavioral Economics-May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Although the Mayo Clinic scores above the other two [in terms of quality of outcome], its cost per beneficiary for Medicare clients in the last six months of life ($26,330) is nearly half that at the UCLA Medical Center ($50,522) and significantly lower than the cost at Massachusetts General Hospital ($40,181)...The American taxpayer is financing these large differences in costs, but we have little evidence of what benefit we receive in exchange.}}

Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) Director [[Peter Orszag]] stated: "Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande The New Yorker-Gawande-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama has provided more than $1 billion in the 2009 stimulus package to jumpstart Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and to finance a federal CER advisory council to implement that idea. Economist [[Martin Feldstein]] wrote in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', "Comparative effectiveness could become the vehicle for deciding whether each method of treatment provides enough of an improvement in health care to justify its cost."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424052970204683204574358233780260914 WSJ-Feldstein-Obamacare All About Rationing-August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===By government===
Former Republican Secretary of Commerce [[Peter George Peterson]] indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of US finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25 to 33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions if quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended for a budget to be established for government healthcare expenses by establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. He advocated addressing those issues under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.&lt;ref name="charlierose.com"/&gt;

Arizona modified its Medicaid coverage rules because of a budget problem that included denying care for expensive treatments such as organ transplants to Medicaid recipients, including those who had previously been promised funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/us/03transplant.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|first=Marc|last=Lacey|title=Arizona Cuts Financing for Transplant Patients|date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC's [[Keith Olbermann]] and others{{whom|date=December 2017}} have dubbed Governor [[Jan Brewer]] and the state legislatures as a real life [[death panel]]{{fact|date=December 2017}} because many of those poor people who are now being denied funding will lose their lives or have health because of the political decision.

===By age===
In the US, the discussion on rationing healthcare for the elderly began to be noticed widely in 1983 when economist [[Alan Greenspan]] asked "whether it is worth it" in referring to the use of 30% of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] budget on 5-6% of those eligible who then die within a year of receiving treatment. In 1984, the Democratic governor of [[Colorado]], [[Richard Lamm]], was widely quoted but claimed to have been misquoted as saying that the elderly "have a duty to die and get out of the way."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/us/gov-lamm-asserts-elderly-if-very-ill-have-duty-to-die.html "Gov. Lamm asserts elderly, if very ill, have 'DUTY TO DIE'"]. ''[[NY Times]]. March 29, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical ethicist [[Daniel Callahan]]'s 1987 ''Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NH1T-sVvEw4C&amp;dq ''Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society'']. Daniel Callahan. Edition reprint. Georgetown University Press, 1995 (orig. pub. 1987). {{ISBN|0-87840-572-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses whether healthcare should be rationed by age. He calls the elderly "a new social threat" and selfish and for age to be used as a criterion in limiting healthcare. Callahan's book has been widely discussed in the America media, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and "just about every relevant professional and scholarly journal and newsletter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_cqOCs1g5UC&amp;dq=Health+Care+Rationing+America&amp;q=rationing#v=snippet&amp;q=rationing&amp;f=false''Growing old in America'']. Beth B. Hess, Elizabeth Warren Markson. 4th Ed. [[Transaction Publishers]], 1991. {{ISBN|0-88738-846-9}}. p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major arguments against such age-based rationing is the fact that chronological age, by itself, is a poor indicator of health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXS8XBwP0coC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=Health+Care+Rationing+America+age#v=onepage&amp;q=Health%20Care%20Rationing%20America%20age&amp;f=false ''Aging: concepts and controversies'']. Harry R. Moody, ''Director of Academic Affairs, [[AARP]]''. 5th Ed. [[Pine Forge Press]], 2006. {{ISBN|1-4129-1520-1}}. p.301.&lt;/ref&gt; Another major argument against Callahan's proposal is that it inverts the Western tradition by making death a possible good and life a possible evil. [[Amherst College]] [[Jurisprudence]] Professor Robert Laurence Barry called Callahan's view "medical totalitarianism."&lt;ref name=setno/&gt;{{pn|date=December 2017}} One book-length rebuttal to Callahan from half-a-dozen professors who held a conference at the [[University of Illinois College of Law]] in October 1989 was in 1991's ''Set No Limits: a Rebuttal to Daniel Callahan's Proposal to Limit Health'', edited by Robert Laurence Barry and Gerard V. Bradley, a visting professor of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref name=setno&gt;

==Arguments in favor==
Australian philosopher [[Peter Singer]] argued for rationing processes:&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

{{quote|"Rationing health care means getting value for the billions we are spending by setting limits on which treatments should be paid for from the public purse. If we ration we won't be writing blank checks to pharmaceutical companies for their patented drugs, nor paying for whatever procedures doctors choose to recommend. When public funds subsidize health care or provide it directly, it is crazy not to try to get value for money. The debate over health care reform in the United States should start from the premise that some form of health care rationing is both inescapable and desirable. Then we can ask, What is the best way to do it?"}}

[[File:Medicare and Medicaid GDP Chart.png|thumb|Medicare and Medicaid Spending as a percentage of GDP]]

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported in June 2008:&lt;ref name="CBO Testimony"/&gt; {{quote|"Future growth in spending per beneficiary for Medicare and Medicaid—the federal government’s major health care programs—will be the most important determinant of long-term trends in federal spending. Changing those programs in ways that reduce the growth of costs—which will be difficult, in part because of the complexity of health policy choices—is ultimately the nation’s central long-term challenge in setting federal fiscal policy... total federal Medicare and Medicaid outlays will rise from 4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 12 percent in 2050 and 19 percent in 2082—which, as a share of the economy, is roughly equivalent to the total amount that the federal government spends today. The bulk of that projected increase in health care spending reflects higher costs per beneficiary rather than an increase in the number of beneficiaries associated with an aging population."}} In other words, all other federal spending categories (such as Social Security, defense, education, and transportation) would require borrowing to be funded, which is not feasible.

President Obama stated in May 2009, "But we know that our families, our economy, and our nation itself will not succeed in the 21st century if we continue to be held down by the weight of rapidly rising health care costs and a broken health care system.... Our businesses will not be able to compete; our families will not be able to save or spend; our budgets will remain unsustainable unless we get health care costs under control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/05/16/two_pillars_of_a_new_foundation_96530.html|first1=Barack|last1=Obama|accessdate=2017-12-17|date=2009-05-16|website=RealClearPolitics.com|title=Two Pillars of a New Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare rationing remained a political topic into 2017, with [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Ted Cruz]] debating on CNN whether a single-payer system would lead to healthcare rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Robert|date=February 7, 2017|title=Cruz, Sanders trade jabs over healthcare rationing|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/cruz-sanders-trade-jabs-over-healthcare-rationing/article/2614212|work=[[Washington Examiner]]|location=United states|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}
'''Human rights in South Africa''' are protected under the [[Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa|constitution]]. The 1998 Human Rights report by Myles Nadioo noted that the government generally respected the rights of the citizens; however, there were concerns over the use of force by law enforcement, legal proceedings and discrimination.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135977.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: South Africa |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South African Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]] is mandated by the [[Constitution of South Africa|South African Constitution]] and the Human Rights Commission Act of 1994, to monitor, both pro-actively and by way of complaints brought before it, violations of [[human rights]] and seeking redress for such violations. It also has an educational role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the SAHRC |url=http://www.sahrc.org.za/home/index.php?ipkContentID=122&amp;ipkMenuID=1 |publisher=sahrc.org.za |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apartheid era ==
{{further information|South Africa under apartheid}}

Apartheid was a system of segregation and discrimination implemented by a White minority onto the Black majority.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, Blacks were not allowed to buy land outside of land reserves despite being the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = South Africa profile - Timeline - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14094918|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of South Africa's anti-apartheid laws have been enacted while keeping in mind that what is seen by the international community, human rights organisations, and the Black majority in the country as the social and legal injustices associated with apartheid, and its anti-apartheid message has been hailed as an exemplary face of a Sub-Saharan nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyzenhaus|first1=David|title=Judging the Judges, Judging Ourselves:|date=1998|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson|first1=Edward|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights|date=1996|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education rights ==
The South African government has legislated for equal education throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This legislation includes the White Paper on Education and Training 1995 and the South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nevertheless, there have been issues in the implementation of these laws.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The South African government tends to focus primarily on the quality of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, only 10% of South African students make it to grade 12 in a reasonable number of years.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Challenges and Issues Facing the Education System in South Africa|last = Legotlo|first = Wilfred|publisher = Africa Institute of South Africa|year = 2014|isbn = |location = South Africa|pages = 2, 3, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is not much racial integration in state schools.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://digital.films.com/PortalViewVideo.aspx?xtid=51887#|title = 7 Up: South Africa|date = 1992|accessdate = 19 November 2015|website = Films on Demand|publisher = Films Media Group|last = Films for the Humanities and Sciences (Firm)|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though laws allow for integration, many schools remain predominantly one race.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Rural schools ===
Most of the [[Education in South Africa]] comes from rural schools. In fact, approximately 79% of Black South Africans live in rural communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the government has neglected the quality of education in these rural areas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Issues with rural schooling include: poor facilities, lack of clean water, lack of resources, and unmotivated teachers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Considering poor facilities, some schools are not structurally stable and are at risk of collapse, with some schools even lacking electricity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Most schools with more than 500 children lack proper sanitation for toilets while some schools don't have toilets at all.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, many rural schools are in remote areas without direct access to clean water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Water is generally kilometers away and unclean because animals bathe and drink in it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This lack of water is a particular issue in the daytime when the temperature is highest.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The remoteness of these rural schools is also a particular problem because they are quite distant from pupils' homes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; And, many schools do not remedy this issue with transport.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, many schools lack the needed books and supplies for learning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In June 2010, the Government Gazette recognised that these unfavorable learning environments increase rates of absenteeism of teachers and dropout rates of students.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Challenges and Issues Facing the Education System in South Africa|last = Legotlo|first = Wilfred|publisher = Africa Institute of South Africa|year = 2014|isbn = |location = South Africa|pages = 15–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students do not have enough food to eat and are hungry during school.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Education in Rural Areas|last = Gardiner|first = Michael|publisher = Centre for Educational Policy Development|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Johannesburg, South Africa|pages = 10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hunger causes a lack on concentration and makes learning environments less favorable.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Rights for disabled children ===
{{See also|Disability in South Africa}}
Though South Africa ratified the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] in 2007, children with disabilities still do not have equal access to education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In many situations, a state school is able to determine which students are able to enroll and the school may simply reject a disabled child without any consequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In cases where the student is able to enroll in a public school, a school may lack the resources necessary to effectively teach children with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, children with disabilities in state schools are forced to pay fees—such as for an assistant—that other students are not required to pay.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = "Complicit in Exclusion": South Africa's failure to guarantee an inclusive education for children with disabilities|last = Martinez|first = Elin|publisher = Human Rights Watch|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa has schools that cater for students with disabilities, but these schools are limited in number and require fees to be paid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The limited number of schools forces children to either board or use costly transport.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2000, the [[UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] was specifically concerned with the lack of implementation of South Africa's agreement to guarantee free primary education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; South Africa still struggles to provide free primary education for all.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, many disabled students are not able to access quality education because they are on waiting lists for schools that cater to students with special needs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, in 2015, there are approximately 5,552 children with disabilities on waiting lists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Political rights==
{{See also|Political repression in post-Apartheid South Africa}}

[[South Africa]] has a liberal constitution that protects all basic political freedoms. However, there have been a number of incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of this constitution leading some analysts and [[civil society]] organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacsis.org.za/site/article/489.1 The Return of State Repression], Professor J. Duncan, ''South African Civil Society Information Services'', 31 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fxi.org.za/content/view/47/51/ Increasing police repression highlighted by recent cases], Freedom of Expression Institute, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or a decline in political tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabarometerblog.wordpress.com/archive/volume-eight-2010/political-tolerance-on-the-wane-in-south-africa/ Political tolerance on the wane in South Africa], Imraan Buccus, SA Reconciliation Barometer, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Political patronage is a significant aspect in South African politics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, this patronage infringes on the rights of the people, especially those in poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 40% of South Africans are dependent on the state to supply necessities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patronage Politics Divides Us|last = Mcebisi|first = Ndletyana|publisher = Real African Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = South Africa|pages = 113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dependence on the state lessens the autonomy of South Africans in need of this assistance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These necessities are supplied in the form of grants, which require governmental documents to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Consequently, bureaucracy plays a major role in an individual's ability to obtain a grant and thus obtain necessities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Politicians gain substituents based on material promises.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the politicians fulfill these promises, often the recipients are only those who supported the politicians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Essentially, voters dependence on the state precludes their ability to vote based on ideological platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This phenomenon does not align with the democratic principles of South Africa.

Twenty-five percent of South Africans receive some form of government [[welfare]] grants, most of whom are female.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Development Dilemmas|last = Freund|first = Bill|publisher = University of KwaZulu-Natal Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = South Africa|pages = 327, 332, 335, 336}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 "White Paper on Social Welfare" outlines South Africa's social welfare policy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The White Paper on Social Welfare focuses on providing South Africans with opportunities for increased autonomy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, White Paper on Social Welfare stipulates the provision of public works projects.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The White Paper also emphasizes the significance of non-state welfare organizations in providing welfare.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Such organizations include non-governmental organizations (NGO's) and religious organizations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, the White Paper focuses on the government providing welfare specifically to families.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; But, the White Paper has relatively fewer provisions for the elderly.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The government expects families to take responsibility for caring their elderly relatives, partly because of cultural values.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The White Paper also covered child support grants and refrained from stereotyping concerning the gender roles in a family. For instance, the White Paper did not specifically refer to the male in a household as the "breadwinner".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Racial disparities in the cities of South Africa still exist, despite the country's having long since ended apartheid. Many black South Africans still struggle to obtain basic needs such as housing, living in under-maintained townships, while many urban white South Africans reside in gated communities with a heavy presence of private security. The Sowetan Live has recently reported that "...indeed the city has contributed to" building "4,000 social homes in 11 districts" with more than 350,000 residents still in need of immediate housing relief.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-06-17-south-africas-black-majority-battles-apartheid-urban-planning/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
{{main|Healthcare in South Africa}}
[[File:The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto.jpg|thumb|The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto]]
South Africa has a plethora of infectious disease cases. Malaria is major cause of death because of a lack of resources to treat patients.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = AIDS and South Africa: the Social Expression of a Pandemic|last = Kauffman|first = Kyle|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Great Britain|pages = 1–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the water is dirty with human and industrial waste which contributes to the spread of disease.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Many deaths are caused by poverty rather than a lack of cures for a disease.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Poverty is a major reason for death because poor families are not able to afford proper health services and hospitals are not able to buy enough supplies.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Additionally, people living in South Africa who are illegal immigrants lack resources for health care that is non-emergency.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Questions Concerning Health|last = Sample|first = Hilary|publisher = Columbia University|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many of the people living in the Hillbrow Health Precinct are not legal and have poor health resources. Specifically, some hospital buildings were built before World War II.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Furthermore, the Hillbrow community has high rates of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
[[File:East Rand Hospital.png|thumb|East Rand Hospital. There are not enough beds for the patients.]]

=== HIV/AIDS ===
{{main|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}
South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It was first detected in 1982.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The disease was first detected in homosexuals, but it rapidly spread to heterosexuals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Because of the rapid spread, the government tried to step in and help.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, South Africa was in the last years of apartheid during the time when HIV/AIDS was becoming an epidemic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Thus, the South African government had great difficulty mitigating the effect of the epidemic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For instance, because of the desegregation of schools and the controversy surrounding that, the government did not focus on providing quality sex education that specifically focused on HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Additionally, the local and federal governments had contention about the allocation of funds for HIV/AIDS prevention, thus causing inefficiency and gridlock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Also, some of the money allocated to HIV/AIDS prevention was misused.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, a musical called ''Serefina II'' was projected to increase awareness about AIDS and AIDS prevention.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, the play was not clear and did not significantly help with sex education.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Much of the HIV/AIDS treatment and progress have been funded by  non profit organizations such as WHO and UNAIDS.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Possible causes ====
There are multiple theories about the causes for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some theorize that migrant workers were a source of the proliferation of the disease.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The migrant workers usually would not see their wives and families for months, so they had extramarital sexual intercourse in the cities.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Then, later during the holidays, husbands would return home and unknowingly infect their wives with the disease.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another theory is that the culture makes South Africa more vulnerable to the epidemic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, male circumcision at birth reduces the risk of the child getting HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, many South Africans do not do this procedure because it is not traditional to do circumcision at birth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Additionally, a lack of quality health care can exacerbate the epidemic.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; There is quite a disparity between public and private healthcare.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Overall, public hospitals provide worse care than private hospitals do.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Public hospitals are generally overcrowded and understaffed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In fact, 82% of South Africans are cared for by 27% of South Africa's general physicians.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The difference in these percentages is caused by general physicians moving to the private healthcare sector and by brain drain.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Brain-drain|Brain drain]] is when professionals emigrate from their home country to work elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Also, the disparity is caused by the fact that private hospitals have more resources and funds than public hospitals do because of the higher fees at private hospitals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Deportation of foreigners==
The South African government has been criticised by [[Human Rights Watch]] for deporting hundreds of thousands of Zimbabwean [[refugee]]s and treating victims of [[political violence]] as [[economic migrant]]s. By sending refugees back to persecution, [[Human Rights Watch]] has asserted that South Africa is violating the [[refugee convention]] and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/06/19/safric19152.htm | title = South Africa: Grant Temporary Status to All Zimbabweans | accessdate =22 June 2008 | date = 19 June 2008 | publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual and LGBT rights==
{{Main|LGBT rights in South Africa|Sexual violence in South Africa}}

=== Sexism ===
South Africa has had some issues concerning gender inequality in court cases.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Development Dilemmas in Post-Apartheid South Africa|last = Freund|first = Bill|publisher = University of KwaZulu-Natal Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = South Africa|page = 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example is that of "Jacob Zuma's Rape Trial  in 2006.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; "Khwezi, a female AIDS activist, brought Zuma to court for raping her.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As his defense, Zuma claimed that he could "have liaisons with women" quite easily, so he asserted that he would not have raped Khwezi.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Zuma also used Zulu culture as support for his defense.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some of Zuma's supporters gathered outside of the courthouse and burned photographs of Khewzi and yelled phrases like "Burn the Bitch.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; " These actions caused gender activists to protest against sexism and to raise concern about the fact that the judge allowed the court to admit evidence about Khwezi's sexual history, but did not admit evidence from Zuma's sexual history.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many people felt that Zuma went against the modern South African liberal democracy because he represented patriarchy at a relative extreme.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Rape ===
It is estimated that 500,000 women are [[sexual violence in South Africa|raped in South Africa]] every year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=84909 |title=SOUTH AFRICA: One in four men rape |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the average woman more likely to be raped than complete secondary school.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057744,00.html |title=South Africa's corrective rape|work=Time |date=8 March 2011|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey found one in four South African men admitted to raping someone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8107039.stm |work=BBC News   | title=South African rape survey shock | date=18 June 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another survey found one in three women out of 4000 surveyed women said they had been raped in the past year.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/258446.stm |title=South Africa's rape shock |publisher=BBC News   |date=19 January 1999 |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapes are also perpetrated by children (some as young as ten).&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/444213 |title=Child rape in South Africa|publisher=Medscape |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child sexual abuse|Child and baby rape]] incidences are some of the highest in the world.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Perry |first=Alex |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1680715,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-full-world |title=Oprah scandal rocks South Africa |work=TIME  |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of high-profile baby rapes that included extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems have appeared.

=== Same-sex marriage ===
The Civil Union Act 17 of 2006 legalized [[same-sex marriage in South Africa]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nwu.ac.za/files/images/Ntlama_APotgieter.pdf|title = A Brief Overview of the Civil Union Act|date = 2010|accessdate = 31 Oct 2015|website = North-West University|publisher = North-West University|last = Ntlama|first = N}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a direct retort to the ''Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie,''  which did not recognize same-sex marriage as legal.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to outlaw discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]]. South Africa was the first country in Africa, and the fifth in the world, to legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parliament ordered to allow gay marriage |date=1 December 2005 |newspaper=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2005-12-01-parliament-ordered-to-allow-gay-marriage |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersex rights ===
{{main|Intersex rights in South Africa}}
[[Intersex]] people in [[South Africa]] have some of the same rights as other people, but with significant gaps in protection from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and protection from discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = SA joins the global fight to stop unnecessary genital surgery on intersex babies | url = http://mg.co.za/article/2016-10-27-00-sa-joins-the-global-fight-to-stop-unnecessary-genital-surgery-on-intersex-babies/ | date = 27 October 2016 | last = Collison | first = Carl | work = [[Mail&amp;Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was the first to explicitly include intersex people in anti-discrimination law.&lt;ref name="zaact"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2000-004.pdf | title = Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act No. 4 of 2000, as amended | date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labour rights ==

=== Legal ===
South Africa has implicit and explicit labour regulations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Its implicit labour regulations are stated in the Constitution and set the boundaries for explicit regulations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Explicit regulations are set by employers and are specific to each job.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the other hand, implicit regulations are the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997, the New Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998, and the Skills Development Act 97 of 1998—each with subsequent amendments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Value of Wellness in the Workplace a Perspective of the Employee-Organisation Relationship in the South African Labour Market|last = Linde|first = Bennie|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = NY|pages = 29–30, 41–42, 44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Relations Act 66 allows workers to create unions and collectively bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_125623.pdf|title = Republic of South Africa No. 66 of 1995: Labour Relations Act|date = 2002|accessdate = 19 October 2015|website = Department of Labour|publisher = Department of Labour|last = Department of Labor|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the number of unions in South Africa have declined.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Also, there are fewer federation-associated trade unions and more independent trade unions in South Africa today.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 has regulations concerning working hours, leave, and termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/legislation/acts/basic-conditions-of-employment/basic-conditions-of-employment-act-and-amendments|title = Basic Conditions of Employment Act 2002|date = 30 September 2014|accessdate = 19 October 2015|website = Department of Labour|publisher = The South African Department of Labour|last = Zopedol|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Employment Equity Act 55 was created to lessen discrimination.

=== Unions ===
South Africa has some labour related issues. One aspect is the formation of unions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In fact, 22% of South African workers are union members.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://rice.kanopystreaming.com/video/south-africa-beyond-apartheid#|title = South Africa Beyond Apartheid|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 Nov 2015|website = Kanopy|publisher = Kanopy|last = Kanopy (Firm)|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Marikana Massacre occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Marikana Massacre was the killing of 44 platinum miners who were on strike to earn increased wages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Poverty Knowledge in South Africa|last = Davie|first = Grace|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 78 people were wounded and 259 were arrested.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One reason for this brutality was that the strike was not protected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, poorly paid farm workers have been striking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example is of the Western Cape Farm worker strike in which the workers were mostly female.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The strike resulted in 3 deaths, but the workers got a 52% increase in pay.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This strike was also unprotected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There was another platinum mining strike in 2014, but it differed from the 2012 platinum mining strike because it was protected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The protection prevented police brutality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In fact, this strike lasted for five months.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Consequently, the world's platinum production decreased by 40% because of the lack of labour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The worker's wages did increase as a result but, the workers also suffered losses because of the "no work, no pay" policy in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Workers who strike are generally strongly motivated, even with protected strikes, because there is much risk of loss.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Foreign ===
The union membership rate in South Africa is one of the highest in the world.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Furthermore, the risk of union conflict is a deterrent for foreign companies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  South Africa is receptive to foreign companies because they create jobs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The unemployment rate in South Africa is approximately 30%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The government encourages foreign and disadvantaged domestic company partnership by giving benefits to foreign companies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Also, the South African government requires that businesses with government contracts donate to social programs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Also, South Africa has high numbers of migrant workers from rural areas throughout Africa, which gives foreign companies a large labor force to choose from.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Historical situation==
The following chart shows South Africa's ratings since 1972 in the [[Freedom in the World]] reports, published annually by [[Freedom House]].

== Notes ==
:1.{{note|a}}Note that the "Year" signifies the "Year covered". Therefore the information for the year marked 2008 is from the report published in 2009, and so on.
:2.{{note|b}}As of 1 January. Until 1994 the Head of Government was the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]]. From 1984 to 1994 it was the [[State President of South Africa|State President]], and since then has been the [[President of South Africa|President]].
:3.{{note|c}}The 1982 report covers the year 1981 and the first half of 1982, and the following 1984 report covers the second half of 1982 and the whole of 1983. In the interest of simplicity, these two aberrant "year and a half" reports have been split into three year-long reports through extrapolation.

[[File:John_MacCormick.jpg|thumb|right|]]
'''John MacDonald MacCormick''' (20 November 1904 – 13 October 1961) was a Scottish lawyer, [[Scottish nationalism|Scottish nationalist]] politician and advocate of [[Home Rule]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SNP page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://remember.snp.org/tributes/view/john_maccormick/|publisher=Scottish National Party|author=|date=|accessdate=9 October 2009|title=Tributes – John MacCormick|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728035703/http://remember.snp.org/tributes/view/john_maccormick/|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
MacCormick was born in [[Pollokshields]], Glasgow, in 1904. His father was Donald MacCormick, a sea captain who was from the [[Isle of Mull]]. His mother was the first [[district nurse]] in the [[Western Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eIVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vKMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4848%2C7030238 |title=Obituary. Dr John M. MacCormack. Champion of Scottish Nationalism |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=8 |date=14 October 1961 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCormick was educated at Woodside School, and studied law at the [[University of Glasgow]] (1923–1928). He became involved in politics while at university, and joined the [[Glasgow University labour club]] and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38773] Richard J. Finlay, 'MacCormick, John MacDonald (1904–1961)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1927 MacCormick left the ILP and formed the [[Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association]] (GUSNA), which was designed to promote [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and [[Scottish nationalism|nationalism]] and self-government. The association was sufficiently neutral to act as the honest broker between the various nationalist organisations which would merge to form the [[National Party of Scotland]] (NPS) in April 1928. MacCormick was a talented speaker and organiser, and served as the national secretary of the NPS.&lt;ref name="SLR"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsnet.scot/nns-archive/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3520:king-john-and-the-headstone-in-the-corner |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302211220/http://www.newsnet.scot/nns-archive/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3520:king-john-and-the-headstone-in-the-corner |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 March 2016 |first=Kenneth |last=Roy |title=King John and the headstone in the corner |journal=Scottish Left Review |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MacCormick was often known by his nickname "King John", which he said came from a heckle during a debate he was participating in when upon a question from the floor whether a devolved Scotland would retain the monarchy, or would be a republic, someone interjected and said: "no, it will be a kingdom and John MacCormick will be our king."&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The failure of the NPS to make an electoral breakthrough led him to question current tactics and he concluded that the party's fundamentalist wing was frightening away potential support because of its support for [[republicanism]] and [[Scottish independence|independence]]. In consequence, MacCormick initiated a campaign to redefine the policy of the NPS, to make it more moderate and to tone down demands for independence. He first stood for [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as an NPS candidate at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]], when he came third in [[Glasgow Camlachie (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Camlachie]], with 1,646 votes.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He also stood at [[Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]].

==SNP==
In 1932, MacCormick began to make overtures to the right-wing [[Scottish Party]], believing that, as the Scottish Party included a number of members of the Scottish '[[The Establishment|establishment]]', their conversion to the cause of home rule would enhance the credibility of the nationalists. To secure an accommodation, MacCormick purged the NPS of radical elements, and moved the policy of the NPS towards that of the Scottish Party. His endeavours paid dividends, and in 1934 the two parties merged to form the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP).&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt; MacCormick himself was not a dogmatic politician, and described himself as a radical, by which he meant a form of [[Centrism|centrist]] liberal. His response to the failure of the SNP to make an electoral impact in the mid-1930s was to search for alternative strategies. He considered the basic problem to be that, although many people in Scotland favoured home rule, they were not, on the whole, willing to put the issue above conventional party loyalties.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; The solution, MacCormick argued, was to make the other parties take home rule seriously, and to demonstrate widespread support for the cause. In 1939 he launched the idea of a Scottish national convention, which would bring together all sections of Scottish society and all shades of Scottish political opinion in favour of home rule. He had made contact with both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, and although the first meeting, scheduled for September 1939, was cancelled because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], MacCormick pushed negotiations throughout the war.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt;

As a leading figure in the SNP, MacCormick came under increasing attack from the rank and file members for his failure to maintain party structure and organisation. He considered that his preferred strategy of co-operation with other organisations meant that there was little need for the SNP to function as a mainstream political party.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; He endeavoured to present an acceptable face of Scottish nationalism, and did much to reverse the party's official anti-conscription policy following the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt; MacCormick stood as an SNP candidate for [[Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]] and at the 1937 Glasgow Hillhead by-election.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

He resigned from the party in 1942 following his failure to persuade the party to adopt a devolutionist stance rather than supporting all out [[Scottish independence]] and due to the victory of [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]] over his favoured candidate, [[William Power (Scottish politician)|William Power]], for the leadership of the SNP.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; Along with a number of dissatisfied delegates to that year's SNP conference, he established the Scottish Convention to campaign for home rule for Scotland and later formed the Scottish Covenant Association.&lt;ref name="SNP page" /&gt;

==Scottish Convention, Scottish Covenant and later years==
MacCormick took the decision to join the [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] as he viewed them as being the party most closely allied to his devolutionist ambitions for [[Scotland]]. He stood as the Liberal candidate for [[Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]].&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt;

The Scottish Convention succeeded in 1947 in setting up an assembly along the lines planned in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GTU1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LaYLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1787%2C403157 |title=Scots Home Rule Plea |work=The Herald |page=3 |date=8 September 1947 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, MacCormick formed the [[Scottish Covenant|Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation which campaigned to secure the establishment of a devolved [[Scottish Assembly]].&lt;ref name="SNP page" /&gt; This covenant was hugely successful in securing support from across the political spectrum, as well as in capturing the Scottish public's imagination (over 2 million signed a petition demanding the convocation of an Assembly. In 1948, he stood as an independent candidate at the [[Paisley by-election, 1948|Paisley by-election]], with what he erroneously believed to be Liberal and Conservative support, and lost.&lt;ref name="SNP page" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; His failure discredited claims as to the popularity of home rule, and further served to reinforce notions that the Scottish Convention was an anti-Labour organisation. MacCormick's failure left the SNP with a monopoly of the cause of home rule.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt;

MacCormick was elected [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Rector]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] in October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jJtAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XJUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3548%2C3627809 |title=Covenant Candidate Wins Rectorship |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=24 October 1950 |page=3 |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Rector until 1953. He was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws|Doctorate of Laws]] by the university in 1951.&lt;ref name="GU people"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0208&amp;type=P |title=University of Glasgow Story: People: John McCormick |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] |website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association with GUSNA also saw the formation of a political friendship with a then young law student at Glasgow University, [[Ian Hamilton QC|Ian Hamilton]], who had run his campaign to be elected rector. MacCormick was involved, along with Hamilton, in the removal of the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] on Christmas Day 1950 and its return to [[Arbroath]] Abbey.  He also mounted a legal challenge, [[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]], over the right of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] using the title ''Queen Elizabeth II'', on grounds that there had been no previous Scottish Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLR"/&gt;

In 1955 MacCormick had a book detailing his activities in the home rule movement published, entitled ''The Flag in the Wind''. His last attempt to enter parliament came at the 1959 General Election, when he stood for the [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] at [[Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (UK Parliament constituency)|Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles]], again finishing second.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

In the film ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]'' MacCormick is played by [[Robert Carlyle]].

==Personal life==
MacCormick married Margaret Isobel Miller in 1939, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, [[Iain MacCormick|Iain]] (1939–2014), served as SNP Member of Parliament for [[Argyllshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll]] from 1974 till 1979 (and was a founder member of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. Their second son, [[Neil MacCormick|Neil]] (1941–2009) was [[regius professor]] of [[Public Law]] and Vice-Principal of the [[University of Edinburgh]], and served as an SNP Member of the [[European Parliament]] from 1999 to 2004. He was also the uncle of the journalist and broadcaster [[Donald MacCormick]].

MacCormick died on 13 October 1961. His funeral was held in the chapel of the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eoVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vKMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3440%2C7385131 |title=Funeral service for Dr John MacCormack |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=17 October 1961 |page=10 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- O LIVRE distingue-se de outros partidos portugueses pela forma de organização interna. Em particular, o método de selecção dos seus candidatos às eleições a que se apresenta, segue o formato de [[Eleição primária|primárias abertas]], que rompe com a tradição de escolha de candidatos por convite de direcções partidárias. Deste modo, todos os cidadãos eleitores podem ser candidatos, desde que se revejam nos princípios fundadores do LIVRE. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22134">'''Lawful interception''' ('''LI''') refers to the facilities in [[telecommunications]] and [[telephone network]]s that allow [[law enforcement agencies]] with court orders or other legal authorization to [[Targeted surveillance|selectively wiretap]] individual subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization organizations. 

With the legacy [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls.  The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch technology, and server-based applications the past two decades fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.

Lawful interception differs from the [[Dragnet (policing)|dragnet]]-type [[mass surveillance]] sometimes done by [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], where all data passing a [[Beam splitter|fiber-optic splice]] or other collection point is extracted for storage or filtering. It is also separate from the [[data retention]] of metadata that has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.

== Terminology ==
{{Off-topic||Old mumbo jumbo that is not really about LI. Disinformation that muddles the distinction between what is legal and what is not.|date=November 2017}}
Lawful interception is obtaining [[communications network]] data pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of [[analysis]] or [[evidence]].  Such data generally consist of [[Signalling (telecommunications)|signalling]] or [[network management]] information or, in fewer instances, the content of the communications.  If the data are not obtained in real-time, the activity is referred to as access to retained data (RD).

There are many bases for this activity that include infrastructure protection and cybersecurity.  In general, the operator of public network infrastructure can undertake LI activities for those purposes.  Operators of private network infrastructures in the United States have an inherent right to maintain LI capabilities within their own networks unless otherwise prohibited.

One of the bases for LI is the interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies (LEAs), regulatory or administrative agencies, and intelligence services, in accordance with local law.  Under some legal systems, implementations—particularly real-time access to content—may require due process and receiving proper authorization from competent authorities—an activity that was formerly known as "wiretapping" and has existed since the inception of electronic communications. The material below primarily treats this narrow segment of LI.

==Technical description==

Almost all countries have lawful interception capability requirements and have implemented them using global LI requirements and standards developed by the [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)]], Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), or CableLabs organisations—for wireline/Internet, wireless, and cable systems, respectively. In the USA, the comparable requirements are enabled by the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA), with the specific capabilities promulgated jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. In the USA, lawful intercept technology is currently patented by a company named Voip-pal.com under the USPTO Publication #: 20100150138.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Governments require [[telephone company|phone service providers]] to install a [[legal interception gateway]] (LIG), along [[legal interception node]]s (LIN), which allow them to intercept in real-time the phone calls, SMS messages, emails and some file transfers or instant messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Interception system and method|url = http://www.google.com/patents/US20020049913|date = Apr 25, 2002|accessdate = 2016-02-13|first = Martti|last = Lumme|first2 = Jaana|last2 = Eloranta|first3 = Hannu|last3 = Jokinen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside North Korea’s cell network: ex-Koryolink technical director reveals all {{!}} NK News - North Korea News|url = https://www.nknews.org/2015/08/inside-north-koreas-cell-network-ex-koryolink-technical-director-reveals-all/|website = NK News - North Korea News|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These LI measures for governmental [[Mass surveillance|surveillance]] have been in place since the beginning of digital telephony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Telecommunications Handbook: Engineering Guidelines for Fixed, Mobile and Satellite Systems|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HRQmBgAAQBAJ|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2015-03-16|isbn = 9781119944881|language = en|first = Jyrki T.

To prevent investigations' being compromised, LI systems may be designed in a manner that hides the interception from the telecommunications operator concerned. This is a requirement in some jurisdictions.

To ensure systematic procedures for carrying out interception, while also lowering the costs of interception solutions, industry groups and government agencies worldwide have attempted to standardize the technical processes behind lawful interception.  One organization, [[ETSI]], has been a major driver in lawful interception standards not only for Europe, but worldwide.

This architecture attempts to define a systematic and extensible means by which network operators and law enforcement agents (LEAs) can interact, especially as networks grow in sophistication and scope of services.  Note this architecture applies to not only “traditional” wireline and wireless voice calls, but to IP-based services such as [[voice over IP]], email, instant messaging, etc.  The architecture is now applied worldwide (in some cases with slight variations in terminology), including in the United States in the context of [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]] conformance.  Three stages are called for in the architecture: 
# collection where target-related “call” data and content are extracted from the network
# mediation where the data is formatted to conform to specific standards
# delivery of the data and content to the law enforcement agency (LEA).
The call data (known as intercept related information (IRI) in Europe and call data (CD) in the US) consists of information about the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), time of the call, duration, etc.  Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call.  Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear-down, scheduling, target identification, etc.  Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the handover interfaces (HI).  Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN.  The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up at the time of the interception.

As stated above, the ETSI architecture is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI/CD is dependent on parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted.  For example, in the case of email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message).  Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address).  Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.

ETSI LI Technical Committee work today is primarily focussed on developing the new Retained Data Handover and [[next-generation network]] specifications, as well as perfecting the innovative TS102232 standards suite that apply to most contemporary network uses.

USA interception standards that help network operators and service providers conform to CALEA are mainly those specified by the Federal Communications Commission (which has both plenary legislative and review authority under CALEA), [[CableLabs]], and the [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS).  ATIS's standards include new standards for broadband Internet access and VoIP services, as well as legacy J-STD-025B, which updates the earlier J-STD-025A to include packetized voice and CDMA wireless interception.

To ensure the quality of evidence, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) has outlined standards for electronic surveillance once a Title III surveillance application is approved:
# Ensure clear access to all data without any loss of information or impact on the network being monitored
# Create a filter to adhere to warrant parameters – time span, types of communications that can be monitored, evidence to be collected, etc.
# Set the lawful intercept device to capture and/or store data according to the warrant parameters.
# Deliver data directly from the source to the mediation device without any human intervention or packet loss
Generic global standards have also been developed by Cisco via the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) that provide a front-end means of supporting most LI real-time handover standards.  All of these standards have been challenged as "deficient" by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] pursuant to CALEA.

==Laws==

The principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to LI (including retained data) is the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001). The secretariat for the Convention is the Council of Europe.  However, the treaty itself has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope.

Individual countries have different legal requirements relating to lawful interception. The Global Lawful Interception Industry Forum lists many of these, as does the Council of Europe secretariat.  For example, in the United Kingdom the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), in the [[United States]] there is an array of federal and state criminal law, in [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] countries as [[SORM]].

===Europe===

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Council]] Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the Lawful Interception of Telecommunications (Official Journal C 329) mandated similar measures to CALEA on a pan-European basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996G1104:EN:HTML EUR-Lex - 31996G1104 - EN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some EU member countries reluctantly accepted this resolution [[Privacy of telecommunications|out of privacy concerns]] (which are more pronounced in Europe than the US{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}), there appears now to be general agreement with the resolution.  Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those of the US; for example, both voice and [[ISP]] public network operators in the [[Netherlands]] have been required to support interception capabilities for years.  In addition, publicly available statistics indicate that the number of interceptions in Europe exceed by many hundreds of times those undertaken in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Europe continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption by the European Parliament and Council in 2006 of the far reaching [[Data Retention Directive]].  The provisions of the Directive apply broadly to almost all public electronic communications and require the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication.  The information must be stored for a period of at least six months, up to two years, and made available to law enforcement upon lawful request. The Directive has been widely emulated in other countries.
On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights.

===United States of America===
{{See also |Mass surveillance in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], three Federal statutes authorize lawful interception.  The 1968 [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968|Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act]], Title III pertains mainly to lawful interception [[criminal investigation]]s.  The second law, the 1978 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], or FISA, as amended by the [[Patriot Act]], governs wiretapping for [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence purposes]] where the subject of the investigation must be a foreign (non-US) national or a person working as an [[intelligence agent|agent]] on behalf of a foreign country.  The Administrator of the U.S. Courts annual reports indicate that the federal cases are related to [[Illegal drug trade|illegal drug distribution]], with [[cell phone]]s as the dominant form of intercepted communication.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

During the 1990s, as in most countries, to help law enforcement and the [[FBI]] more effectively carry out wiretap operations, especially in view of the emerging [[digital voice]] and [[wireless network]]s at the time, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askcalea.com AskCALEA]&lt;/ref&gt; This act provides the Federal statutory framework for [[network operator]] assistance to LEAs in providing evidence and tactical information.  In 2005, CALEA was applied to public [[broadband networks]] Internet access and [[Voice over IP]] services that are interconnected to the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN).

In the 2000s, surveillance focus turned to terrorism.  [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|NSA warrantless surveillance]] outside the supervision of the FISA court caused considerable controversy.  It was revealed in [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] that since 2007, the [[National Security Administration]] has been collecting connection metadata for all calls in the United States under the authority of section 215 PATRIOT Act, with the mandatory cooperation of phone companies and with the approval of the FISA court and briefings to Congress.  The government claims it does not access the information in its own database on contacts between American citizens without a warrant.

Lawful interception can also be authorized under local laws for state and local police investigations.

=== Canada ===

Police ability to lawfully intercept private communications is governed by Part VI of the Criminal Code of Canada (Invasion Of Privacy).&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-89.html#docCont&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Due to [[Yarovaya Law]], law enforcement is entitled to stored private communication data.

===Elsewhere===

Most countries worldwide maintain LI requirements similar to those Europe and the U.S., and have moved to the ETSI handover standards.  The [[Convention on Cybercrime]] requires such capabilities.

==Illegal use==

As with many law enforcement tools, LI systems may be subverted for illicit purposes, producing a violation of human rights, as declared by [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case ''[[Bettino Craxi]] III v. Italy''&lt;ref&gt;The deviant behaviors (...) were ignored as useful to prepare the public to an anticipated judgment incriminating: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Caso Craxi, come l'Italia non difese il suo diritto alla riservatezza|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89371810}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. It occurred also in Greece during the 2004 Olympics: the telephone operator [[Vodafone Greece]] was fined US$100,000,000 in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6182647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Greek scandal sees Vodafone fined | date=15 December 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 76 Million Euro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Timo | last = Poropudas | title = Vodafone fined EUR 76 million in Greece | publisher = Nordic Wireless Watch | date = December 16, 2006 | url = http://nordicwirelesswatch.com/wireless/story.html?story_id=5135 | accessdate = 2007-11-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305022710/http://nordicwirelesswatch.com/wireless/story.html?story_id=5135 | archivedate = March 5, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for failing to secure its systems against unlawful access.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6337">A '''lieutenant governor''', '''lieutenant-governor''', or '''vice governor''' is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction.

* Often a lieutenant governor is the deputy or [[lieutenant]] to or [[Social rank|rank]]ing under a [[governor]] — a "[[second-in-command]]".
* In [[Canadian provinces]] or in the [[Dutch Caribbean]], the lieutenant governor is the representative of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch]] in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staffs writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Mevrouw Evelina Anthony benoemd tot waarnemend gezaghebber Bonaire|url=https://www.rijksdienstcn.com/nieuws/mevrouw-evelina-anthony-benoemd-tot-waarnemend-gezaghebber-bonaire|website=Rijksdienst Caribisch Nederland|publisher=Government Service of the Caribbean Netherlands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206020241/https://www.rijksdienstcn.com/nieuws/mevrouw-evelina-anthony-benoemd-tot-waarnemend-gezaghebber-bonaire|archivedate=6 February 2017|date=30 November 2015|location=Kralendijk, Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands|trans-title=Ms Evelina Anthony appointed acting Lieutenant of Bonaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In many [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states, a lieutenant governor is the representative of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|monarch]] and acts as the nominal chief executive officer of the realm, although by convention the lieutenant governor delegates actual executive power to the premier of a province. The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch political system]] also includes and has included lieutenant governors, who act as executors of overseas possessions. In [[India]], lieutenant governors are in charge of [[union territory|special administrative divisions]] in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lieutenant governor|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/lieutenant-governor|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, lieutenant governors are usually second-in-command to a [[governor (United States)|state governor]], and the actual power held by the lieutenant governor varies greatly from state to state. The lieutenant governor is often first in line of succession to the governorship, and acts as governor when the governor leaves the state or is unable to serve. Also, the Lt. Governor presides over debate in that chamber and oversees the movement of legislation through the chamber. While he cannot vote or sponsor legislation, he works with advocates in the Senate to introduce the legislation for him.

==Lieutenant governors in the Kingdom of the Netherlands==
Lieutenant governors ({{lang-nl|gezaghebber}}) of the former Dutch constituent country of [[Netherlands Antilles]] acted as head of the governing council of the island territories, which formed a level of decentral government until the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] in 2010. Currently the [[Netherlands]] has a lieutenant governor overseeing each of the three [[Special municipality (Netherlands)|special municipalities]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] — [[Saba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Sint Eustatius]] — where their function is similar to a mayor in the European Netherlands.

==History==

===Origins===
The Minnesota Family Council (MFC) was founded in 1983.&lt;ref name="D'Agostino"/&gt;

The Minnesota Family Council has been active in politics, representing religious conservatives since at least 1994.&lt;ref name=Balz&gt;{{cite news|last=Balz|first=Dan|title=Minnesota Race Slows Momentum of Religious Right|newspaper=Washington Post|date=15 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the MFC reacted negatively when glow condoms were sent by Planned Parenthood to men ages 18 to 25, who were living  within four miles of its Minneapolis office.&lt;ref name=Duchschere&gt;{{cite news|last=Duchschere|first=Kevin|title=Home » Publications » U.S. newspapers and newswires » Minnesota newspapers » Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) » January 1996 » Recently viewed: Article: Minnesota Race Slows Momentum of Religious Right » Safe-sex promotion using glow condoms irks Family Council|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=11 January 1996|location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Prichard joined the Minnesota Family Council in 1990.&lt;ref name="D'Agostino"/&gt; MFC describes itself as "a non-partisan, grassroots, Christian organization dedicated to strengthening the family – the bedrock of society – by advancing foundational biblical principles in churches, the media, government, and the public square throughout the state of Minnesota."&lt;ref name=MFCwho&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.mfc.org/about/who-we-are/|publisher=Minnesota Family Foundation|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831122953/http://www.mfc.org/about/who-we-are/|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parents Action League===
Minnesota Family Council (MFC) is the statewide sponsor of the [[Parents Action League]],&lt;ref name=Bazelon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=A Big Win - The landmark settlement in a Minnesota bullying case and how it could help gay students everywhere. A Big Win in the Fight Against Gay Bashing Bullies|journal=Slate|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization formed to oppose proposed changes in the Anoka-Hennepin (Minnesota) School District 11 policy which limited discussions of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) issues in district classrooms. Barb Anderson, a longtime researcher for MFC,&lt;ref name=Birkley110826&gt;{{cite web|last=Birkley|first=Andy|title=Anoka-Hennepin schools' long history in the culture war|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/86141/anoka-hennepin-schools-long-history-in-the-culture-war|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; fought "gay influence" in local schools for two decades.&lt;ref name=Erdely/&gt; When the Anoka-Hennepin, Minnesota district's sex-ed curriculum was due for re-evaluation in 1994, Anderson and four like-minded parents joined the review committee. They argued against teaching gay tolerance in school, suggesting that it would "promote homosexuality", and that discussing it openly might actually "turn straight kids gay".&lt;ref name=Erdely&gt;{{cite news|last=Erdely|first=Sabrina Rubin|title=One Town's War on Gay Teens|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/one-towns-war-on-gay-teens-20120202|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also serves as spokesperson for the Parents Action League.&lt;ref name=Birkey120113&gt;{{cite news|last=Birkey|first=Andy|title=Conservative Christian parents fight for right to discriminate against LGBT students at Anoka Hennepin|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/news/2012/01/13/conservative-christian-parents-fight-right-discriminate-against-lgbt-students-anoka-|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=The Twin Cities Daily Planet|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying===
In 2011, MFC registered as a [[political action committee]] (PAC) in its efforts for lobbying against same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Grovum111108&gt;{{cite news|last=Grovum|first=Jake|title=What's happening at the Minnesota Capitol: Iowa debate tonight: Dayton admin movements|newspaper=St. Paul Legal Ledger Capitol Report|date=11 August 2011|location=Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; MFC's CEO, John Helmberger is a registered lobbyist for the organization.&lt;ref name=Grovum111213&gt;{{cite news|last=Grovum|first=Jake|title=What's happening at Minnesota Capitol: Vekich to work on GOP finances, Sawalich to run for chair|newspaper=St. Paul Legal Ledger Capitol Report|date=13 December 2011|location=Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
The Minnesota Family Council has been an active participant in the social values dialogue in the United States (US). The organization is notable for its conservative positions on prayer in public schools, [[LGBT]] rights, abortion rights and a school voucher system.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Dane|title=GOP conservative McKigney seeks Bertram's Senate seat|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=13 January 1996|location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; MFC's stated mission is "to strengthen the families of Minnesota by advancing biblical principles in the public arena."&lt;ref name=MFCmission/&gt;

===Abortion===
MFC is opposed to [[abortion]], stating that "human life is sacred from conception to natural death and must be protected by government".&lt;ref name=MFCmission&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission |url=http://www.mfc.org/about/our-mission/ |publisher=Minnesota Family Foundation |accessdate=15 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831122659/http://www.mfc.org/about/our-mission/ |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MFC president Tom Prichard, that while the council is pro-life, it generally leaves the abortion issue to other groups.&lt;ref name="D'Agostino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Agostino|first=Joseph A.|title=Conservative spotlight: Minnesota family council: Tom Prichard|journal=Human Events|date=18 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
MFC is opposed to [[same-sex marriage]] and [[domestic partner]] benefits. It spent $349,857.25 on the [[Minnesota Amendment 1|failed 2012 effort]] to amend the Minnesota constitution to ban such unions.&lt;ref name=MinnPost&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is funding the marriage amendment fight|url=http://www.minnpost.com/data/2012/11/who-funding-marriage-amendment-fight|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{cite web|title=ElectionResults2012|url=http://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/ENR/Results/AmendmentResultsLegislative/1?questionid=140|accessdate=20 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110175551/http://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/ENR/Results/AmendmentResultsLegislative/1?questionid=140|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliated organizations==
MFC's educational subsidiary, [[Minnesota Family Institute]] (MFI) provides training, research and non-partisan voter education for their church network and grassroots constituents. MFI in turn operates the Northstar Legal Center, which provides legal education for attorneys and networks oriented toward upholding biblical principles and religious liberty in the courts.&lt;ref name=MFCwhat&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the Difference Between Minnesota Family Council and Minnesota Family Institute?|url=http://www.mfc.org/about/what-is-the-difference-between-mfc-mfi/|publisher=Minnesota Family Foundation|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831122948/http://www.mfc.org/about/what-is-the-difference-between-mfc-mfi/|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], '''name recognition''' is the ability a voter has to identify a candidate's name due to a certain amount of previous exposure through various campaigning methods. It can be described as the awareness voters have about specific candidates resulting from various forms of campaign advertising. Some of the advertising methods used by candidates running for various offices are creating posters, making yard signs, bumper stickers and attempting to get media exposure are a few examples of how they achieve this. Though candidates can achieve high name recognition and exposure, this doesn't necessarily that the average voter has a good understanding of their ideologies, positions and stances of political issues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kam|first=Cindy D.|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Elizabeth J.|date=2013-05-02|title=Name Recognition and Candidate Support|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12034|journal=American Journal of Political Science|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/ajps.12034|issn=0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of Name Recognition ==
The ability of a citizen to recognize a candidates name can impact the effect of their voting behavior and which candidates they select when casting their ballots. Exposure to a candidates name, with or without the conscious awareness of the name recognition, can lead to an increase in the candidates likability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kam|first=Cindy D.|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Elizabeth J.|date=2013|title=Name Recognition and Candidate Support|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23496668|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=57|issue=4|pages=971–986}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for this is the [[recognition heuristic]]'','' when applied to voting behavior, is the ability to recognize a political figures name which leads the individual to believe that they should support that specific candidate. The ability to recognize a candidates name can occur consciously or subconsciously through various forms of subliminal messages and advertising. One of the reasons behind the reoccurring '''incumbency effect''''','' or the constant trend of individuals reelecting politicians who currently hold the position up for election, is due to the effects of name recognition. According to a study performed in ''Name Recognition and Candidate Support'' by Cindy D. Kam  Elizabeth J. Zechmeister&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, they discovered that after a three-day subliminal exposure to a candidates name can lead to an increase in support for this politician. These reasons described are the factors that explain why politicians spend such large amounts of money and work very hard to make their names recognizable to the voting population. There are proven positive effects when name recognition of a candidate is accomplished.

== Effects of Online Political Advertising on Name Recognition ==
[[Online advertising]] is one very extremely popular method used by political campaigns in order to gain exposure and support. The benefits of using this form of advertising are that is a very low-cost method and it has the ability to reach a large amount of people fast. Also, using the current technology available enables these campaigns  with the ability to target specific individuals who have a higher chance of voting for them, by using factors such as race and age. Another advantage of using online political advertisements is that it is a very effective method to achieving a higher likelihood that the candidates name will be recognized by a larger range of individuals. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broockman|first=David E.|last2=Green|first2=Donald P.|date=2013-06-21|title=Do Online Advertisements Increase Political Candidates’ Name Recognition or Favorability? Evidence from Randomized Field Experiments|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=263–289|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9239-z|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online world and social media gives candidates the ability to gain a large amounts of exposure and name recognition, which can increase the chances that they'll win in the upcoming election. Even though using online advertisements is a sufficient method in reaching a large group of individuals, it doesn't guarantee them a win because individuals are constantly exposed to various online advertisements, and often by opposing candidates during election season as well. This popular method of advertising is efficient, but has minimal effects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{reflist}}

== History and work ==
OutRight Action International, formerly known as International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavers|first1=Michael K.|title=EXCLUSIVE: IGLHRC to change its name|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/09/28/exclusive-iglhrc-to-change-its-name/|publisher=Washington Blade|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by [[Julie Dorf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gomag.com/article/100_women_we_love3/30/ Founder of IGLHRC]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990, and incorporated as a non-profit organization on November 7, 1990. Though initially focused on LGBT human rights abuses in [[Russia]], the organization is now active in many parts of the world, including the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]].

{{Politics of Palestine}}

The '''Palestinian Preventive Security''' (PPS) (Arabic: '''الأمن الوقائي'''; Al-'amn al-wiqa'i), also known as '''Preventive Security Force''' (PSF), '''Preventive Security Service''' (PSS) is one of the security apparatus of the [[State of Palestine]]. It was established in 1994 by president [[Yasser Arafat]] in accordance with the [[Oslo Accords]]. 

The Preventive Security is an internal intelligence organization, part of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], and led by the [[Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Minister of the Interior]]. Its main tasks are protecting the internal security of Palestine and the [[Palestinian Authority]], and preventing crimes which target governmental departments and public bodies and institutions. It was the keeper of the Oslo peace process.

==Organization==
The Preventive Security (PPS) is one of several intelligence services of Palestine. According to some sources, 5,000 plain-clothed members served in separate units in the West Bank and Gaza in 2006.&lt;ref name=miftah-2006&gt;[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=10400&amp;CategoryId=21 ''The Palestinian Security Services: Past and Present'']. MIFTAH, 30 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap_security_forces&gt; The Associated Press mentioned the number of 5,000 members, located in Gaza, as of January 2005: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060926030427/http://www.ocregister.com/ocr/2005/01/19/sections/nation_world/world/article_381197.php ''Palestinian security forces'']. Associated Press, 19 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPS has long been one of the most powerful intelligence organizations, mainly to protect the Oslo peace process. In the late 1990s the ''"Security and Protection Department"'' or so-called ''"Death Sqad"'' was established, aimed at activists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In 2007, the estimated strength was 3,500 in the West Bank and 4,500 in Gaza.&lt;ref name=pss_reform_A&gt; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=icV4k__xMmgC&amp;pg=PA158 ''Entry-points to Palestinian Security Sector Reform''], Appendix A, p. 158. Roland Friedrich and Arnold Luethold, DCAF, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 reform ===
In November 2007, President Mahmoud Abba issued ''"Decree Law No. ( ) of 2007 Concerning the Preventive Security"'', which re-defined the Preventive Security. The Law is not approved by the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]].

The Preventive Security is led by the [[Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Minister of the Interior]] and headed by the Director-General of the Directorate-General of the Preventive Security. According to the 2007 Law, the duties of the Preventive Security are:&lt;ref name=dcaf_security&gt;Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold and Firas Milhem, [http://www.dcaf.ch/content/download/35601/526419/file/final_EN.pdf ''The Security Sector Legislation of the Palestinian National Authority''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007001920/http://www.dcaf.ch/content/download/35601/526419/file/final_EN.pdf |date=2016-10-07 }}, pp. 261-264 (3,2 MB).

=== Leadership ===

[[Jibril Rajoub]] headed the West Bank Force until July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigelparry.com/diary/pa/pss2.html ''Preventive Security Service Graduation Ceremony, 19 May 1996'']. Nigel Parry, accessed December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/07/04/mideast/index.html ''Report: Palestinian police chief to run against Arafat'']. CNN, 4 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammed Dahlan]], was the first chief of the Palestinian Security Force in Gaza from 1994 to 2002. Dahlan was replaced by [[Rashid Abu Shbak]]. In April 2005, Rashid Abu Shbak became head of the PSF in both West Bank and Gaza. In February 2006, he was appointed head of the new [[Palestinian Security Services]], which included the PSF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Drik3kXVTasC&amp;pg=PT722&amp;lpg=PT722&amp;dq=rashid+shbak#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Hamas: From Resistance to Government'']. Paola Caridi, Seven Stories Press, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;[Rashid Abu Shbak] "returned in 1994, upon installment of the PNA and became Mohammed Dahlan's deputy in the Gaza Preventative &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Security Force, of which he took charge in 2002. In April 2005, he began his rise to the very top of the security services when Abu Mazen appointed him head of the Preventative &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Security Force in the West Bank and Gaza. On February, 20, 2006, he was appointed head of the security services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Majid Faraj ====

[[Majid Faraj]] joined the PSF from 1994, when the Preventive Force was established, and headed by Jibril Rajoub. In 2000, he was in charge of the Bethlehem district. In 2006, Faraj was promoted to the head of military intelligence in the West Bank. Abbas appointed him chief of the General Intelligence Service in 2009.&lt;ref name=haaretz_boasts_of_efforts&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.700418 ''Palestinian Intel Chief - and Abbas' Potential Successor - Boasts of Efforts to Foil Attacks Against Israel''] (premium article). Jack Khoury, Haaretz, 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==

===Second Intifada===
The PPS was accused by [[Israel]] of playing a covert role in the [[Second Intifada]] that erupted in September 2000 after [[Ariel Sharon]]'s visit to the [[Temple Mount]]. In 2001, it shelled the house of General [[Jibril Rajoub]], then colonel, who at the time was the PPS director. A number of PPS officers were also assassinated, injured and arrested. In April 2002, Sharon ordered the [[Operation Defensive Shield]], the largest Israeli military campaign in the [[West Bank]] since its occupation in 1967. The headquarters of PPS in [[Beitunia]] was placed under a military siege, with intensive shelling by tanks and Apaches, reducing the headquarters to rubble, and injuring dozens of officers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===2007===
On 14 June 2007, Hamas militants took over the Preventive Security building in Gaza City and the intelligence service headquarters in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6751079.stm ''Hamas hails 'liberation' of Gaza'']. BBC, 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4367">'''Privatization in criminal justice''' refers to a shift to private ownership and control of criminal justice services. 

The term is often used to refer simply to contracting out services, which takes place extensively in many countries today; for instance, in the form of various prison services provided piecemeal by private vendors. Taken to its fullest extreme, however, privatization entails private-sector control over all the decisions regarding the use of resources devoted to the protection of persons and property.

Many criminal justice services are privatized because the government lacks the means to carry them out. For example, private [[bail bondsmen]] help enforce the laws requiring those released on bail to appear for trial. If the defendant disappears, the bondsman may hire a [[bounty hunter]] to find them and bring them back. 

The bondsman also has a monetary incentive to make an accurate assessment as to the defendant's likelihood of jumping bail; if he declines to grant a bond to an individual who would have shown up to trial, then he loses business, but if he grants bail to a person who jumps bail, then he suffers a financial loss. The government does not have such incentives built into its decisionmaking mechanisms for [[pretrial release]].

In the mid-1960s, Florida Governor [[Claude Kirk]] commissioned [[Wackenhut Services]] for a $500,000 "war on organized crime"{{cn|date=October 2018}} contract that led to more than 80 criminal indictments, including many local politicians and government employees.{{cn|date=October 2018}} [[Multi-State]], a firm established by a former Columbus, Ohio police chief and employed thirteen former police officers with narcotics experience in 1973 "rented" skilled narcotics agents to small-town police forces in Ohio and West Virginia; more than 150 arrests and seizures of $200,000 in drugs took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1973|publisher=Newsweek|date=August 27, 25|title=Rent-a-Narc}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1993, the [[Kentwood, Michigan]] police department signed a three-year contract with a private firm to investigate and recover bad checks. The contractor handles all merchant contacts, telephone calls regarding bad checks, and investigations, in an effort to recover the face value of the check as well as the expenses for both the merchant and the police department. 

According to Wyoming Detective James Maguffee, ""They've got a great track record...It's just been a phenomenal success."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mlive.com/advancenewspapers_news/2007/10/rise_in_check_fraud_leads_to_n_2.html Rise in check fraud leads to new investigative team - Advance Newspapers - MLive.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, [[Securitas AG|Securitas]] provides police services for more than 30 Swiss villages and townships. [[Paradise Island]] also has a [[private police]] force. 

In 1975, [[Oro Valley, Arizona]] contracted for police services with [[Rural/Metro Fire Department]] but the arrangement was challenged by the Arizona Law Enforcement Officers Advisory Council. Rural/Metro could not pay the legal fees needed to fight the challenge and the arrangement was ended in 1977. 

In some cases, private police are deputized in order to ensure compliance with the law, but continue to be paid by the hour so that money can be saved by releasing them during slow times; as when [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] contracted for street patrol and traffic control with [[Charles Services]]. Other jurisdictions that have had contracts for police services with private firms include [[Indian Springs, Florida]], [[Buffalo Creek, West Virginia]] (which was served by [[Guardsmark]]) and [[Reminderville, Ohio]] which contracted with Corporate Security in 1981; as well as [[Sussex, New Jersey]], which contracted for police services with [[Executive Security and Investigations Services]] after the town's entire four-officer police force was dismissed in 1993 because of a drug scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Privatization of Police In America: An Analysis and Case Study|author=Pastor, James F.|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7864-1574-8|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] of [[Argentina]] introduced a bill on April 16, 2012 for the partial [[renationalization]] of [[YPF]], the nation's largest energy firm. The state would purchase a 51% share, with the national government controlling 51% of this package and ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy crisis provokes Argentine YPF expropriation|url=https://news.yahoo.com/energy-crisis-provokes-argentine-ypf-expropriation-155636784.html|newspaper=Yahoo! News|date=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of [[Argentine Congress|Congress]], and was signed by the president on May 5.&lt;ref name=ips&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=107671|title=Renationalised YPF Aims to Bring Self-Sufficiency in Oil and Gas|work=IPS News|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Argentina eventually agreed to pay $5&amp;nbsp;billion in compensation to Repsol, which had previously owned YPF.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Background==
[[YPF]] was founded in 1922 as the first oil company in the world to be established as a [[state enterprise]].&lt;ref name=expansion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expansion.com/2012/04/13/empresas/energia/1334350727.html?a=3b0ec98442bd89b11495f60da8e9f5f2&amp;t=1334354767|title=Repsol necesita que Kirchner valore YPF en 8.200 millones para evitar minusvalías|date=April 13, 2012|work=Expansión}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company grew to become largest in its sector in Argentina, and despite the divestiture of a sizable percentage of its extractive, refining, logistic, and retail infrastructure during its 1993 privatization, YPF in 2012 operated 52% of the nation's refinery capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peru21.pe/2012/04/15/economia/argentina-frena-expropiacion-ypf-2020198|title=Argentina frena expropiación de YPF|work=Perú 21|date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounted for 57% of the national market in gasoline and other motor fuels.&lt;ref name=ypfy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estaticos.elmundo.es/documentos/2012/04/17/repsol_ypf.pdf|title=YPF y Argentina|publisher=Repsol YPF|date=April 17, 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its share of petroleum and natural gas production nationally was 34% and 23%, respectively, in 2011;&lt;ref name=mundo/&gt; company revenues that year were US$13.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=contables&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypf.com/InversoresAccionistas/InfoEconomicoFinanciera/YPF%20Estados%20Contables/Estados%20Contables%20al%2031%20de%20Diciembre%20de%202011.pdf|title=Estados Contables al 31 de Diciembre de 2011|language=Spanish|publisher=YPF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620133744/http://www.ypf.com/InversoresAccionistas/InfoEconomicoFinanciera/YPF%20Estados%20Contables/Estados%20Contables%20al%2031%20de%20Diciembre%20de%202011.pdf|archivedate=June 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm was privatized in 1993 on the initiative of President [[Carlos Menem]] and Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]] pursuant to the State Reform Law of 1989, which authorized the president to present bills to Congress for the [[privatization]] of any of the numerous state enterprises in operation at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgp.gov.ar/contenidos/inap/publicaciones/docs/modernizacion/ref97.pdf|title=Reseña del Proceso de Reforma del Estado en a Argentina (1989–1996)|publisher=INAP|author1=Zeller, Norberto |author2=Impala, Darío |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1997|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madrid]]-based [[Repsol]] acquired a majority stake in 1999. Oil and gas production subsequently weakened while demand increased, and in 2011 Argentina recorded the first energy trade deficit since 1987.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

==Renationalization==
Investment in [[oil exploration|exploration]] at YPF as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries,&lt;ref name=cash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/cash/17-5831-2012-03-04.html|title=Cash|work=Página/12|date=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fell from 30 new wells in 1998 to eight in 2010 (French energy firm [[Total S.A.]] overtook YPF as the leading oil driller in Argentina).&lt;ref name=cifra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrocifra.org.ar/docs/CIFRA%20-%20DT11%20-%20Subexploracion%20y%20sobreexplotacion.pdf|title=Subexploración y Sobreexplotación|work=Centro de Investigación y Formación de la República Argentina|date=March 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reserves of crude and natural gas fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011,&lt;ref name=ypfy/&gt;&lt;ref name=mepriv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mepriv.mecon.gov.ar/YPF/Repsol/produccion.htm|title=Producción y reservas de petróleo y gas|publisher=Economy Ministry|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas.&lt;ref name=mundo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2012/04/16/argentina/1334600261.html|title=El proyecto para nacionalizar YPF|work=El Mundo|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repsol and some market analysts blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and [[mineral exploration|prospecting lease]]s, and [[price control]]s on domestic oil and gas.&lt;ref name=deal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeal.com/content/energy/ypf-expropriation-endorsed-by-argentine-senate.php#ixzz1tY5a5QSr|title=YPF expropriation endorsed by Argentine Senate|work=The Deal Pipeline|date=April 26, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427020042/http://www.thedeal.com/content/energy/ypf-expropriation-endorsed-by-argentine-senate.php#ixzz1tY5a5QSr|archivedate=April 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentine lower house starts YPF takeover debate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/02/us-argentina-ypf-idUSBRE8411D620120502|newspaper=Reuters|date=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2012/04/argentinas-oil-industry|title=Argentina's oil industry: Feed me, Seymour |work=[[The Economist]]|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; YPF, however, remained profitable throughout Repsol's tenure even as output fell, and net income from 1999 to 2011 at YPF totaled nearly US$16.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/04/16/politica-18075-cristina-presento-un-proyecto-para-la-expropiacion-de-las-acciones-de-ypf.php|title=Cristina presentó un proyecto para la "expropiación" de las acciones de YPF|work=Info News|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kirchner administration in turn pointed to high [[dividend yield]]s and low investment levels at YPF in relation to profits.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt;&lt;ref name=info/&gt; Argentine Economy Minister [[Hernán Lorenzino]] claimed that [[asset stripping]] at YPF had financed Repsol's expansion in other parts of the world,&lt;ref name=af&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=633578|title=Repsol vació YPF para su expansión en otros países|work=Ámbito Financiero|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Repsol officials denied charges of underinvestment in its YPF operations and instead cited the Vaca Muerta discovery as a motivation for the takeover.&lt;ref name=debate/&gt;&lt;ref name=20m/&gt;

''[[Vaca Muerta oil field|Vaca Muerta]]'', a 30,000&amp;nbsp;km² (11,600&amp;nbsp;mi²) [[unconventional oil]] field with proven recoverable reserves of up to 927 million barrels, had been discovered by RepsolYPF in November 2011.&lt;ref name=20m&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1374482/0/vaca-muerta/argentina/ypf/|title=Vaca Muerta, un tesoro energético escondido bajo el conflicto por YPF|publisher=20 minutos|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repsol executives declared however that government policies would have to change in order to allow investment in new production.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Following bills signed by governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces during March and April 2012 revoking YPF leases accounting for over a fifth of its production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-191710-2012-04-12.html|title=Poco a poco, YPF se va quedando sin pozos|work=Página/12|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the president announced on April 16 that the Argentine Government would acquire a majority stake in YPF.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; Repsol YPF Gas, a [[liquefied natural gas]] subsidiary in which Repsol had an 85% stake, was concurrently nationalized on April 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/subnotas/20-58710-2012-04-19.html|title=El Gobierno amplió la expropiación a YPF Gas|work=Página 12|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese state oil concern, [[Sinopec]], was reported to have been in talks to buy out Repsol's share in YPF – a potential deal scuttled by the Argentine announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/18/us-sinopec-repsol-idUSBRE83H0AA20120418|title=Argentine move to seize YPF spoils Sinopec deal|work=Reuters|date=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resulting dispute==
Repsol officials maintained that, per company statutes, the acquisition by any one party of stock held by Repsol equaling a 15% stake or more would trigger a mandatory purchase of Repsol's entire 57% stake (rather than the 51% sought). Repsol officials calculated compensation by multiplying the highest [[price earnings ratio]] reached by YPF in the prior two years by its [[earnings per share]] in 2011, and arrived at US$10.5&amp;nbsp;billion for a 57% stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20120417/54284554401/repsol-ypf-expropiacion-ypf.html|title=Repsol califica de "ilegítima" la expropiación de YPF y la justifica para desplomar el precio de la venta|work=La Vanguardia|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine Deputy Economy Minister [[Axel Kicillof]] rejected these demands, however, citing debts of nearly US$9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Kicillof-directivos-Repsol-ocultaban-petrolera_0_683931808.html|title=Kicillof advirtió: No vamos a pagar lo que Repsol quiera|work=Clarín|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[book value]] of YPF was US$4.4&amp;nbsp;billion at the end of 2011;&lt;ref name=contables/&gt; its total [[market capitalization]] on the day of the announcement was US$10.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=incensed&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/spain-argentina-ypf-idUSL2E8FHD9420120417|title=Incensed Spain threatens Argentina after YPF seizure|publisher=Reuters|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repsol claimed that the Argentine Government drove down YPF shares ahead of the announcement (market price of the shares declined by over half from February to April),&lt;ref name=af/&gt; and chairman Antoni Brufau estimated the company's potential loss at €5.7&amp;nbsp;billion (US$7.5&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref name=bloombiz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-19/repsol-required-to-buy-back-eskenazi-family-s-25-percent-ypf-stake|title=Repsol Must Buy Eskenazi YPF Stake in '08 Deal|publisher=''Bloomberg Business Week''|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Repsol retaliated by canceling nine shipments of [[liquefied natural gas]] to Argentine state energy distributor [[Enarsa]], claiming the government breached contracts following the seizure of YPF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-18/repsol-cancels-lng-shipments-to-argentina-on-ypf-seizure.html|title=Repsol Cancels LNG Shipments to Argentina on YPF Seizure|work=Bloomberg|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repsol filed a lawsuit at the [[World Bank]]’s [[International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/spains-repsol-formally-begins-legal-action-against-argentina-over-ypf-nationalization/2012/05/15/gIQAw1yrRU_story.html|title=Spain's Repsol formally begins legal action against Argentina over YPF nationalization|work=Associated Press|date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Spain]] petitioned the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] for [[trade sanction|sanctions]] against Argentine exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/es/news/spanish-news/eu-respects--argentina-s-repsol-decision-envoy_228344.html|title=EU 'respects' Argentina's Repsol decision: envoy|work=Expatica|date=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Government did unilaterally curtail [[biodiesel]] purchases from Argentina (its main provider), as well as from [[Indonesia]]. Following a complaint filed at the [[World Trade Organization]] by the Argentine Government as well as higher costs for biodiesel distributors in Spain itself however, boycotts of both Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel were lifted by January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/07/biodiesel-makers-cheer-lifting-spain-s-export-restriction.html|title=Biodiesel makers cheer lifting of Spain's export restriction|date=January 7, 2013|work=Jakarta Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An audit of Repsol documents conducted by Kicillof and Planning Minister [[Julio de Vido]] in May uncovered what Kicillof described as a "debasement of the company and a policy of creating shortages that would raise domestic prices to those prevailing internationally;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arribaeleste.com/nota/104676-ypf-de-vido-y-kicillof-anunciaron-el-fin-de-la-intervencion-y-presentaron-el-informe-mosconi|title=El lunes termina la intervención en YPF: Kicillof y de Vido cargaron duro contra Repsol|work=Arriba el Este|date=June 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117115251/http://www.arribaeleste.com/nota/104676-ypf-de-vido-y-kicillof-anunciaron-el-fin-de-la-intervencion-y-presentaron-el-informe-mosconi|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these findings were published on June 1 in the Mosconi Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minplan.gob.ar//adjuntos/128/documentos/000/043/0000043395.pdf|title=Informe Mosconi|publisher=Ministerio de Planificación Federal; Ministerio de Economía|author1=de Vido, Julio |author2=Kicillof, Axel |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of the [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Province of Santa Cruz]] published the results of an investigation of 13,000 inactive YPF oil wells on May 14, finding that 8,000 of these leaked and that at least US$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion of [[environmental damage]] had been caused by these; an environmental law enacted by the province in 2010 mandated the inventory and maintenance of all such wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariobae.com/diario/2012/05/14/12045-el-pasivo-ambiental-que-dejo-repsol-en-santa-cruz-ascenderia-a-los-u$s3.500-millones.html|title=El pasivo ambiental que dejó Repsol en Santa Cruz ascendería a los u$s3.500 millones|work=BAE|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other claims, including environmental damage in five other provinces, a tax debt in [[Chubut Province]], and a judicial injunction issued against Repsol over their illegal sale in 2011 of 45 million shares belonging to an employees' severance fund, raised their potential liability to US$15&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.infonews.com/sw_contenido_infonews_preview.php?id=77535&amp;preview=1&amp;id_portal=1|title=Otro revés en la justicia para Repsol: no podrá recibir la indemnización|work=Tiempo Argentino|date=June 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126101638/http://tiempo.infonews.com/sw_contenido_infonews_preview.php?id=77535&amp;preview=1&amp;id_portal=1|archivedate=January 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached with Repsol on November 27, 2013, whereby the latter would be compensated for a 51% stake in YPF with approximately US$5&amp;nbsp;billion in 10-year corporate bonds.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-27/who-won-repsol-s-war-with-argentina-.html|title=Who Won Repsol's War With Argentina?|work=Bloomberg News|date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repsol sold its remaining 12% stake to [[Morgan Stanley]] the following May.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/39272b52-d5c1-11e3-83b2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3CYP7qy4p|title=Repsol's $1.26bn YPF stake sale ends Argentine entanglement|work=Financial Times|date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rotten''' or '''pocket borough''', more formally known as a '''nomination borough''' or '''proprietorial borough''', was a [[parliamentary borough]] or [[Electoral district|constituency]] in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], or the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] before the [[Reform Act 1832]], which had a very small electorate and could be used by a patron to gain unrepresentative influence within the [[unreformed House of Commons]]. The same terms were used for similar boroughs represented in the 18th-century [[Parliament of Ireland]].

[[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] in Wiltshire (pictured) was the most notorious pocket borough. It was a possession of the Pitt family from the mid-17th century until 1802, and one of its Members of Parliament was [[Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]]. In 1802 the Pitt family sold it for £60,000, even though the land and [[manor]]ial rights were worth £700 a year (which would be equivalent to a capital sum of around £20,000 at most).

==Background==
A [[parliamentary borough]] was a town which was incorporated under a [[royal charter]], giving it the right to send two elected [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] as [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the House of Commons. It was not unusual for the physical boundary of the settlement to change as the town developed or contracted over time, for example due to changes in its trade and industry, so that the boundaries of the parliamentary borough and of the physical settlement were no longer the same.

For centuries, constituencies electing members to the House of Commons did not change to reflect population shifts, and in some places the number of electors became so few that they could be bribed by a single wealthy patron. In the 19th century, proponents of reform gave these boroughs the derogatory appellations "rotten boroughs" or "pocket boroughs", or more formally "nomination boroughs", because their democratic processes were rotten and their parliamentary member(s) were elected by the whim of the patron, thus "in his pocket"; the actual votes of the electors were a mere formality, all or a majority being willing to vote as the patron instructed them, with or without bribery. As voting was by show of hands at a single polling station at a single time, none dared to vote contrary to the instructions of the patron. Often only one candidate would be nominated (or two for a two-seat constituency), so that the election was uncontested.

Thus an MP might represent only a few constituents, while at the same time many new towns, which had grown due to increased trade and industry, were entirely unrepresented, or inadequately represented. For example, before 1832 the town of [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]], which expanded rapidly during the [[Industrial Revolution]] from a small settlement into a large city, was merely part of the larger county constituency of [[Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancashire]] and did not elect its own MPs.

Many of these ancient boroughs elected two MPs. By the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1831|1831 general election]], out of 406 elected members, 152 were chosen by fewer than 100 voters each, and 88 by fewer than fifty voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Carpenter |title=The People's Book; Comprising their Chartered Rights and Practical Wrongs |location=London |publisher=W. Strange |date=1831 |page=406|authorlink=William Carpenter (1797–1874)|url=https://archive.org/stream/peoplesbookcompr00carp#page/406/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 19th century moves were made towards reform, with eventual success, when the [[Reform Act 1832]] disenfranchised the rotten boroughs and redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres. The [[Ballot Act 1872]] introduced the [[secret ballot]], which greatly hindered patrons from controlling elections by preventing them from knowing how an elector had voted. At the same time, the practice of paying or entertaining voters ("[[treating]]") was outlawed, and election expenses fell dramatically.

==Rotten boroughs==
The term ''rotten borough'' came into use in the 18th century; it meant a parliamentary borough with a tiny electorate, so small that voters were susceptible to control in a variety of ways, as it had declined in population and importance since its early days. The word "rotten" had the connotation of corruption as well as long-term decline. In such boroughs most or all of the few electors could not vote as they pleased, due to the lack of a secret ballot and their dependency on the "owner" of the borough. Only rarely were the views or personal character of a candidate taken into consideration, except by the minority of voters who were not beholden to a particular interest.

Typically, rotten boroughs had gained their representation in Parliament when they were more flourishing centres, but the borough's boundaries had never been updated, or else they had become depopulated or even deserted over the centuries. Some had once been important places or had played a major role in England's history, but had fallen into insignificance as for example industry moved away.

For example, in the 12th century [[Old Sarum]] had been a busy [[cathedral city]], reliant on the wealth expended by its own [[Old Sarum Cathedral|Sarum Cathedral]] within its city precincts, but it was abandoned when the present [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (also called "New Sarum") was founded nearby on a new site, which immediately attracted merchants and workers who built up a new town around it. Despite this dramatic loss of population, the borough of Old Sarum retained its right to elect two MPs.

Many such rotten boroughs were controlled by [[Landed gentry|landowners]] and [[peerage|peers]] who might give the seats in Parliament to their like-minded friends or relations, or who went to parliament themselves, if they were not already members of the House of Lords. Commonly also they sold them for money or other favours; the peers who controlled such boroughs had a double influence in Parliament as they themselves held seats in the [[House of Lords]]. This patronage was based on property rights which could be inherited and passed on to heirs, or else sold, like any other form of property.

==Pocket boroughs==
Pocket boroughs were boroughs which could effectively be controlled by a single person who owned at least half of the "[[Burgage|burgage tenements]]", the occupants of which had the right to vote in the borough's parliamentary elections. A wealthy patron therefore had merely to buy up these specially qualified houses and install in them his own tenants, selected for their willingness to do their landlord's bidding, or given such precarious forms of tenure that they dared not displease him. As there was no [[secret ballot]] until 1872, the landowner could evict electors who did not vote for the man he wanted. A common expression referring to such a situation was that "Mr A had been elected on Lord B's interest".

There were also boroughs which were controlled not by a particular patron but rather by the Crown, specifically by the departments of state of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] or [[Admiralty]], and which thus returned the candidates nominated by the ministers in charge of those departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lewis |last=Namier |authorlink=Lewis Namier|title=The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rich individuals controlled several boroughs; for example, the [[Duke of Newcastle]] is said to have had seven boroughs "in his pocket". The representative of a pocket borough was often the man who owned the land, and for this reason they were also referred to as '''proprietarial boroughs'''.&lt;ref name="pearce"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearce|first1=Robert D.|last2=Stearn|first2=Roger|title=Government and Reform: Britain, 1815-1918|date=2000|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|isbn=9780340789476|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

Pocket boroughs were seen by their 19th-century owners as a valuable method of ensuring the representation of the landed interest in the House of Commons.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

Significantly diminished by the Reform Act of 1832, pocket boroughs were finally abolished by the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]]. This considerably extended the borough franchise and established the principle that each parliamentary constituency should hold roughly the same number of electors. [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary commissions]] were set up by subsequent Acts of Parliament to maintain this principle as population movements continued.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

==Reform==
In the late 18th century, many political societies, like the [[London Corresponding Society]] and the [[Society of the Friends of the People]], called for Parliamentary reform.&lt;ref name=hampshermonk&gt;{{cite journal |first=Iain |last=Hampsher-Monk |title=Civic Humanism and Parliamentary Reform: The Case of the Society of the Friends of the People |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=70-89 |journal=Journal of British Studies |date=1979 |jstor=175513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they thought that the rotten borough system was unfair, and they called for a more equal distribution of representatives that reflected the population of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The State of the Representation of England and Wales, Delivered to the Society, the Friends of the People ... on ... the 9th of February, 1793|location=London |date=1793 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_State_of_the_Representation_of_Engla.html?id=gC5UnQEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislative reign of terror of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] caused these societies to disband by enacting legislation that made it illegal for these societies to meet or publish information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Clive |last=Emsley |title=Repression, 'Terror' and the Rule of Law in England During the Decade of the French Revolution |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=397 |pages=801-825 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=985 |jstor=572566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, there were moves towards "Reform", which broadly meant ending the over-representation of boroughs with few electors. The issue which finally brought the Reform issue to a head was the arrival of [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, and the Reform movement had a major success in the [[Reform Act 1832]], which disfranchised the 57 rotten boroughs listed below, most of them in the south and west of England, and redistributed representation in Parliament to new major population centres and to places with significant industries, which tended to be farther north.

==Contemporary defences==
A substantial number of [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] constituencies lay in rotten and pocket boroughs, and their right to representation was defended by the successive Tory governments in office between 1807 and 1830. During this period they came under criticism from prominent figures such as [[Tom Paine]] and [[William Cobbett]].&lt;ref name=pearce/&gt;

It was argued in defence of such boroughs that they provided stability and were also a means for promising young politicians to enter parliament, with [[William Pitt the Elder]] being cited as a key example.{{r|pearce|page1=22}} Some Members of Parliament who were generally in favour of the boroughs claimed they should be kept, as Britain had undergone periods of prosperity while they were part of the constitution of parliament.

Because British colonists in the [[West Indies]] and [[British North America]], and those in the [[Indian subcontinent]], had no representation of their own at Westminster, representatives of these groups often claimed that rotten boroughs provided opportunities for [[virtual representation]] in parliament for colonial interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Miles |date=2003 |chapter=Empire and Parliamentary Reform: The 1832 Reform Act Revisited |title=Rethinking the Age of Reform: Britain 1780-1850 |editor1-first=Arthur |editor1-last=Burns |editor2-first=Joanna |editor2-last=Innes |pages=295-312 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTmVgdHczd0C&amp;pg=PA295|isbn=9780521823944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tory politician [[Spencer Perceval]] asked the nation to look at the system as a whole, saying that if pocket boroughs were disfranchised, the whole system was liable to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric J. Evans|title=Liberal Democracies |page=104|publisher=Joint Matriculation Board|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==

The magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' has a column entitled 'Rotten Boroughs', which lists stories of municipal wrongdoing; ''borough'' is used here in its usual sense of a local district rather than a parliamentary constituency.

In his book ''The Age of Consent'', [[George Monbiot]] compared small island states with one vote in the U.N. General Assembly to "rotten boroughs".

The term ''rotten borough'' is sometimes used as a pejorative epithet for electorates used to gain political leverage. In Hong Kong and Macau, [[functional constituencies]] (with small voter bases attached to special interests) are often referred to as 'rotten boroughs' by long-time columnist Jake van der Kamp. In [[New Zealand]], the term has been used to refer to electorates which – by dint of an agreement for a larger party – have been won by a minor party, enabling that party to gain more seats under the country's proportional representation system.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J. "[https://www.newshub.co.nz/general/banksys-brew-not-so-bewitching-this-time-round-2011111115 Banksy's brew not so bewitching this time round]", ''3 News'', 11 November 2011. Retrieved 1 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] has also been referred to as a ''rotten borough'' owing to the electoral process receiving interference from [[Tower Hamlets First]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2014/05/tower-hamlets-londons-rotten-borough/ |title=Tower Hamlets — London’s rotten borough &amp;#124; Coffee House |publisher=Blogs.spectator.co.uk |date=2014-05-26 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiction ===
In the satirical novel ''[[Melincourt (novel)|Melincourt]], or Sir Oran Haut-Ton'' (1817) by [[Thomas Love Peacock]], an [[orang-utan]] named Sir Oran Haut-ton is elected to parliament by the "ancient and honourable borough of Onevote". The election of Sir Oran forms part of the hero's plan to persuade civilisation to share his belief that orang-utans are a race of human beings who merely lack the power of speech. "The borough of Onevote stood in the middle of a heath, and consisted of a solitary farm, of which the land was so poor and intractable, that it would not have been worth the while of any human being to cultivate it, had not the Duke of Rottenburgh found it very well worth his while to pay his tenant for living there, to keep the honourable borough in existence." The single voter of the borough is Mr Christopher Corporate, who elects two MPs, each of whom "can only be considered as the representative of half of him".

In the [[Palliser novels|parliamentary novels]] of [[Anthony Trollope]] rotten boroughs are a recurring theme. John Grey, [[Phineas Finn]], and [[Plantagenet Palliser|Lord Silverbridge]] are all elected by rotten boroughs.

In Chapter 7 of the novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', author [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] introduces the fictitious borough of "Queen's Crawley," so named in honor of a stopover in the small Hampshire town of Crawley by [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who being delighted by the quality of the local beer instantly raised the small town of Crawley into a borough, giving it two members in Parliament. At the time of the story, in the early 19th century, the place had lost population, so that it was "come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten."

In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864-1865), Mr. Veneering is elected MP to a borough called "Pocket-Breaches".

''[[Rotten Borough (novel)|Rotten Borough]]'' was a controversial story published by [[Oliver Anderson (author)|Oliver Anderson]] under the pen name [[Julian Pine]] in 1937, republished in 1989.

In Diana Wynne Jones' 2003 book ''[[The Merlin Conspiracy]]'', Old Sarum features as a character, with one line being "I'm a rotten borough, I am."

In the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of seafaring tales, the pocket borough of Milport (also known as Milford) is initially held by General Aubrey, the father of protagonist Jack Aubrey. In the twelfth novel in the series, ''The Letter of Marque'', Jack's father dies and the seat is offered to Jack himself by his cousin Edward Norton, the "owner" of the borough. The borough has just seventeen electors, all of whom are tenants of Mr Norton.

In the first novel of [[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' series, the eponymous antihero, [[Harry Flashman]], mentions that his father, Sir Buckley Flashman, had been in Parliament, but "they did for him at Reform," implying that the elder Flashman's seat was in a rotten or pocket borough.

In the episode ''[[Dish and Dishonesty (Blackadder)|Dish and Dishonesty]]'' of the [[BBC]] television comedy ''[[Blackadder|Blackadder the Third]]'', [[Mr. E. Blackadder|Edmund Blackadder]] attempts to bolster the support of the [[Prince Regent]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by getting the incompetent [[Baldrick]] elected to the fictional rotten borough of "[[Dunny]]-on-the-Wold". This was easily accomplished with a result of 16,472 to nil, even though the constituency had only one voter (Blackadder himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/epguide/three_dish.shtml |title=Black Adder - Episode Guide: Dish and Dishonesty |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game, [[Assassin's Creed III]] pocket and rotten boroughs are briefly mentioned in a database entry entitled "''Pocket Boroughs''", and Old Sarum is mentioned as one of the worst examples of a pocket borough. In the game, shortly before the Boston Massacre an NPC can be heard speaking to a group of people on the colonies lack of representation in Parliament and lists several rotten boroughs including Old Sarum.

== Quotations ==
* "[Borough representation is] the rotten part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]]." — [[William Pitt the Elder]]
* "The county of Yorkshire, which contains near a million souls, sends two county members; and so does the county of Rutland which contains not a hundredth part of that number. The town of Old Sarum, which contains not three houses, sends two members; and the town of Manchester, which contains upwards of sixty thousand souls, is not admitted to send any. Is there any principle in these things?" [[Tom Paine]], from ''Rights of Man'', 1791
* From ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]:
:Sir Joseph Porter: I grew so rich that I was sent
::By a pocket borough into Parliament.
::I always voted at my party's call,
::And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.
:Chorus: And he never thought of thinking for himself at all.
:Sir Joseph: I thought so little, they rewarded me
::By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

* From ''[[Iolanthe]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]:
::Fairy Queen: Let me see. I've a borough or two at my disposal. Would you like to go into Parliament?

* From ''The Letter of Marque'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]]
:: 'Could you not spend an afternoon at Milport, to meet the electors? There are not many of them, and those few are all my tenants, so it is no more than a formality; but there is a certain decency to be kept up. The writ will be issued very soon.'

* The Borough of Queen's Crawley in [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' is a rotten borough eliminated by the Reform Act of 1832:

::When Colonel Dobbin quitted the service, which he did immediately after his marriage, he rented a pretty country place in Hampshire, not far from Queen's Crawley, where, after the passing of the Reform Bill, Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now. All idea of a peerage was out of the question, the baronet's two seats in Parliament being lost. He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe, failed in his health, and prophesied the speedy ruin of the Empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6590">A '''silence procedure''' or '''tacit acceptance procedure'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/about/conventions/Pages/Home.aspx |title=Conventions |publisher=IMO |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (French: ''procédure d'approbation tacite''; Latin: ''[[Qui tacet consentire videtur#qui tacet consentire videtur|qui tacet consentire videtur]]'', "he who is silent is taken to agree", "silence implies/means consent") is a way of formally adopting texts, often, but not exclusively in international political context. 

==Overview==
A [[Wikt:Draft|draft]] version of the text is circulated among participants who have a last opportunity to propose changes or [[wiktionary:Amendment|amendment]]s to the text. If no amendments are proposed  (if no one 'breaks the silence') before the deadline of the procedure, the text is considered adopted by all participants. Often this procedure is the last step in adopting the text, after the basic premises of the text have been agreed upon in previous negotiations. 'Breaking the silence' is only a last resort in case a participant still has fundamental problems with parts of the text and is therefore the exception rather than the rule.

In the context of [[international organisations]], the subject of the procedure is often a joint statement or a procedural document, a formal vote on which with the members meeting in person is deemed unnecessary. Indeed, it is often impractical to try to stage a meeting between representatives of all [[member state]]s either due to the limited importance of the text to be agreed upon or due to time constraints in the case of a joint declaration prompted by recent events. Organisations making extensive use of the procedure are, among others, the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).

A textbook on [[diplomacy]] describes the silence procedure thus:
{{quote|... a proposal with strong support is deemed to have been agreed unless any member raises an objection to it before a precise deadline: silence signifies assent &amp;ndash; or, at least, [[wiktionary:acquiescence|acquiescence]]. This procedure relies on a member in a minority fearing that raising an objection will expose it to the charge of obstructiveness and, thereby, the perils of isolation. Silence procedure is employed by NATO, the OSCE, in the framework of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] of the European Union (EU) and, no doubt, in numerous other international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Berridge (2010) ''Diplomacy: Theory and Practice'' (Fourth Edition). Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-230-22960-0}}. Page&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Council of the European Union==
Article 12(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the [[Council of the European Union]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:285:0047:0048:EN:PDF|title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On the initiative of the Presidency, the Council may act by means of a simplified written procedure called “silence procedure”:

(a) for the purpose of adopting the text of a reply to a written question or, as appropriate, to an oral question submitted to the Council by a Member of the [[European Parliament]], after the draft reply has been examined by [[Coreper]];

(b) for the purpose of appointing Members of the European [[Economic and Social Committee]] and Members, and their alternates, of the [[Committee of the Regions]], after the draft decision has been examined by Coreper;

(c) for the purpose of deciding to consult other institutions or bodies wherever such consultation is required by the Treaties;

(d) for the purpose of implementing the common foreign and security policy through the “[[COREU]]” network (COREU silence procedure).

In that case, the relevant text shall be deemed to be adopted at the end of the period laid down by the
Presidency depending on the urgency of the matter, except where a member of the Council objects.}}

==Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe==
An expression of the silence procedure is contained in Annex&amp;nbsp;1(A) "Application of a silence procedure in the Permanent Council and the [[Forum for Security Co-operation]]" of the Rules of Procedure of the OSCE (2006):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delvie.ec.europa.eu/en/eu_osce/Rules%20of%20procedure.pdf |title=vienna |publisher=Delvie.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
1. The Chairperson may suggest the adoption of a decision through a silence procedure. Such a suggestion shall be made during a meeting, with an indication of the exact time for the expiration of the period of silence. If there is no objection expressed by a Representative at that meeting, the decision shall be regarded as placed under a silence procedure. 

2. Immediately after that meeting, the Secretariat shall issue an interim text of the decision without a number and with a temporary title reflecting the fact that the decision is subject to a silence procedure. The interim text shall be appended to the journal of that meeting. 

3. The silence shall be regarded as broken if an objection or an amendment has been communicated by a participating State to the Chairperson in writing before the expiration of the silence period. In this case, the Chairperson shall immediately inform the participating States in writing that the decision in question has not been adopted. 

4. If the silence has not been broken, the Chairperson, immediately after the expiration of the silence period, shall inform the participating States in writing that the decision in question has been adopted. The text of the decision shall not be issued until the next meeting. If urgent administrative actions are to be taken on the basis of that decision, the Chairperson may send the text of the decision to a relevant executive structure strictly for internal use. 

5. At the first meeting following the adoption of the decision, the Chairperson shall make an announcement concerning the adoption of the decision. 

6. Immediately after that meeting, the decision, with interpretative statements and formal reservations attached, if any, shall be issued by the Secretariat in a standard OSCE format and appended to the journal of that meeting. The date of the expiration of the silence period shall be regarded as the date of adoption of the decision.}}

The '''Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act''' ({{USBill|113|s|23}}) is a bill that would designate as wilderness about 32,500 acres of the [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] in the state of [[Michigan]]. The newly designated lands and inland waterways would comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]].&lt;ref name="cbos23"/&gt;

It was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=WildnessSoc1&gt;{{cite news|title=Bills re-introduced for wilderness in Washington and Michigan|url=http://wilderness.org/blog/bills-re-introduced-wilderness-washington-and-michigan|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2014, it was signed into law as {{USPL|113|87}} by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="s23allactions"/&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore}}
[[File:Sleeping Bear Dunes.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south from Sleeping Bear Dunes toward Empire Bluffs and the southern portion of the National Lakeshore in Benzie County]]

The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a [[United States National Lakeshore]] located along the northwest coast of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] of Michigan in [[Leelanau County, Michigan|Leelanau County]] and [[Benzie County, Michigan|Benzie County]]. The park covers a 35-mile (60-km) stretch of [[Lake Michigan]]'s eastern coastline, as well as [[North Manitou Island|North]] and [[South Manitou Island]]s. This [[northern Michigan]] park was established primarily because of its outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena. The Lakeshore also contains many cultural features including the 1871 [[South Manitou Island Lighthouse]], three former Life-Saving Service/[[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Stations and an extensive rural historic farm district. In 2011 the area won the title of "The Most Beautiful Place in America" from [[Good Morning America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ALBERTO ORSO and SABRINA PARISE via Good Morning America |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/best_places_USA/sleeping-bear-dunes-michigan-voted-good-morning-americas/story?id=14319616 |title=Sleeping Bear Dunes, Michigan Voted Good Morning America's 'Most Beautiful Place' - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=23sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 23 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/23|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act would designate specified land and inland water within the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan, to be known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, as wilderness and as a component of the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]].&lt;ref name="23sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the boundary of the Wilderness to be: (1) 100 feet from the centerline of adjacent county roads, and (2) 300 feet from the centerline of adjacent state highways.&lt;ref name="23sum"/&gt;

The bill would specify this Act's effect on: (1) the maintenance and improvement of roads located outside the boundary of the Wilderness; (2) Michigan's jurisdiction with respect to the management of fish and wildlife, including hunting and fishing, within the National Lakeshore; and (3) any treaty rights or any existing valid private property rights.&lt;ref name="23sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 14, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbos23&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - S. 23|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/44025|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 23 would designate as wilderness about 32,500 acres of the [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] in the state of Michigan. The newly designated lands and inland waterways would comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.&lt;ref name="cbos23"/&gt;

Based on information from the [[United States National Park Service]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. More than 30,000 of the affected acres have been managed as wilderness since 1981, and CBO estimates that the potential impact of the designation on public use would be minor. Enacting S. 23 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbos23"/&gt;

S. 23 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbos23"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] on January 22, 2013 by [[Carl Levin|Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI)]].&lt;ref name=s23allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 23 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/23/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]]. It was reported by the committee alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113srpt14/pdf/CRPT-113srpt14.pdf Senate Report 113-14]. On June 19, 2013, it passed the Senate by [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref name="s23allactions"/&gt; It was received in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on June 20, 2013 and referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]].&lt;ref name="s23allactions"/&gt; On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that S. 23 would be considered under a [[suspension of the rules]] on March 3, 2014.&lt;ref name=leaderssched&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - Week of March 3, 2014|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/3-3-14%20WEEKLY.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=2 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304204634/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/3-3-14%20WEEKLY.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration was delayed until March 4, 2014 due to a snowstorm in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=PeteTuesday&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Tuesday: Israel, energy, flood in the House|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/199781-tuesday-israel-energy-flood-in-the-house|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House voted on March 3, 2014 to pass the bill by a [[voice vote]]. On March 13, 2014, it was signed into law as {{USPL|113|87}} by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="s23allactions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
[[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]] called the dunes "a slice of tranquility along the coast of Lake Michigan" that "is known for the gorgeous sunsets over towering dunes."&lt;ref name="WildnessSoc1"/&gt;

Representative [[Dan Benishek]], who supported the bill, expressed his pleasure that the bill "was developed locally," describing it as "the ideal way federal land management should occur, with input from the local communities."&lt;ref name=Thompson1&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Carol|title=Sleeping Bear Dunes legislation moves forward|url=http://www.record-eagle.com/local/x1196465244/Sleeping-Bear-Dunes-legislation-moves-forward|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=Traverse City Record-Eagle|date=1 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140304170722/http://www.record-eagle.com/local/x1196465244/Sleeping-Bear-Dunes-legislation-moves-forward|archivedate=4 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was supported locally by the group [[Citizens for Access to the Lakeshore]].&lt;ref name="Thompson1"/&gt; The president of that organization, Jeannette Feeheley, said that the bill would take care of "the problems we had tried to resolve back in 2002."&lt;ref name="Thompson1"/&gt;

However, some opponents objected to the length of the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail and to the locations that it would stop at.&lt;ref name=Brandt1&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Patti|title=Wilderness move stirs Trail opposition|url=http://www.leelanaunews.com/news/2013-01-09/Front_Page/Wilderness_move_stirs_Trail_opposition.html|accessdate=4 March 2014|newspaper=Leelanau Enterprise News|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{American socialism}}
The [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] conducted a series of prosecutions from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) were accused of violating the [[Smith Act]], a statute which imposed penalties on those who advocated violent overthrow of the government. The prosecution argued that the CPUSA's policies promoted violent revolution; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of [[freedom of speech]] and of [[Freedom of association|association]] protected their membership of a political party. The trials led to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decisions ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' (1951) and ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957).

The first trial, held in New York in 1949, was one of the lengthiest trials in American history.  Large numbers of supporters of the defendants protested outside the courthouse on a daily basis. The trial featured twice on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.  The defense frequently antagonized the judge and prosecution, and five defendants were jailed for [[contempt of court]] because they disrupted the proceedings. The prosecution's case relied on undercover informants who described the goals of the CPUSA, interpreted communist texts, and testified of their own knowledge that the CPUSA advocated the violent overthrow of the US&amp;nbsp;government.

While the first trial was under way, events outside the courtroom influenced public perception of communism: the [[Soviet Union]] tested its first [[nuclear weapon]], and communists prevailed in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of up to five years in federal prison, further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently [[Disbarment|disbarred]].

After the first trial, the prosecutors{{spaced ndash}}encouraged by their success{{spaced ndash}} prosecuted over 100 further CPUSA officers for violating the Smith Act.  Some were tried solely because they were members of the Party. Many of these defendants had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them. The trials decimated the leadership of the CPUSA. In 1957, eight years after the first trial, the US Supreme Court's ''Yates'' decision brought an end to similar prosecutions, holding that defendants could be prosecuted only for their actions, not for their beliefs.

== Background ==
[[File:Step by step greene.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A political cartoon showing a person walking down steps from "strikes" to "chaos"|This 1919 political cartoon reflects American fears about [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]] during the [[First Red Scare]].]]
{{main|Communist Party USA#History}}
After the [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the [[First Red Scare]] of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]] would lead to disruption within the US.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Robert K. (1955), ''Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920'', University of Minnesota Press, pp 82&amp;ndash;104, 150&amp;ndash;169, {{ISBN|978-0-313-22673-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 128–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Congressional investigation of left-wing and right-wing extremist political groups in the mid-1930s, support grew for a statutory prohibition of their activities. The alliance of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the August 1939 [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and their invasion of Poland in September gave the movement added impetus. In 1940 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Alien Registration Act of 1940 (known as the [[Smith Act]]) which required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government, and made it a crime "to knowingly or willfully advocate ... the duty, necessity, desirability, ... of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence ... with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States...."&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, p 1488, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&amp;pg=PA1488&amp; available online], accessed June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithActText"&gt;The Smith Act was officially called the Alien Registration Act of 1940. [http://www.citizensource.com/History/20thCen/Smith.htm Text of 1940 version]. The Act has been amended since then: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2385 Text of 2012 version]. The portion of the 1940 Act that was relevant to the CPUSA trials was: &lt;span style="font-size:87%"&gt;"Sec. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person—
(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such government;
(2) with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence.
(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof...."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Five million non-citizens were fingerprinted and registered following passage of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, David M., ''The Library of Congress World War II Companion'', Simon and Schuster, 2007, p 86, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5219-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smith Act#Minneapolis 1941|first persons convicted]] under the Smith Act were members of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) in [[Minneapolis]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 179. President Roosevelt insisted on the prosecution because the SWP had challenged a Roosevelt ally.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the CPUSA, bitter rivals of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] SWP, supported the Smith Act prosecution of the SWP{{spaced ndash}}a decision they would later regret.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael Steven, "Smith Act Trials, 1949", in ''Encyclopedia of the American Left'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p 756.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the government used the Smith Act [[Smith Act#Great Sedition Trial of 1944|to prosecute American Nazis]]; that case ended in a [[Trial#Mistrials|mistrial]] when the judge died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 196, 207. &lt;br /&gt; See also: Ribuffo, Leo, "United States v. McWilliams: The Roosevelt Administration and the Far Right", in Belknap (1994), pp 179–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious to avoid alienating the Soviet Union, then an ally, the government did not prosecute any communists under the law during {{nowrap|[[World War II]]}}.&lt;ref name="Belknap_a" /&gt;

The CPUSA's membership peaked at around 80,000 members during World War&amp;nbsp;II under the leadership of [[Earl Browder]], who was not a strict [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and cooperated with the US government during the war.&lt;ref name="Belknap_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, J. Edgar, ''Masters of Deceit: the Story of Communism in America and How to Fight It'', Pocket Books, 1958, p 5 (80,000 peak in 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945, [[hardline]]r [[William Z. Foster]] took over leadership of the CPUSA, and steered it on a course adhering to Stalin's policies.&lt;ref name="Belknap_a" /&gt; The CPUSA was not very influential in American politics, and by 1948 its membership had declined to 60,000 members.&lt;ref name="Belknap_b" /&gt; Truman did not feel that the CPUSA was a threat (he dismissed it as a "non problem") yet he made the specter of communism a campaign issue during the 1948 election.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 210. Truman quoted by Belknap. Belknap writes that Truman considered the CPUSA to be "a contemptible minority in a land of freedom".&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of communism in the US was shaped by the [[Cold War]], which began after World War&amp;nbsp;II when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the [[Yalta Conference]]. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern European countries]], leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949); the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]]; and the 1948 [[Berlin Blockade|blockade of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Belknap_b"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of communism was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by agents of the USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, [[Elizabeth Bentley]], repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis, Atahn, ''The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p 27, {{ISBN|978-0-89774-991-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the [[Venona project|Venona]] decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US.&lt;ref name="Belknap_b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, pp 8–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing influence of communism around the world and the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justice{{spaced ndash}}spearheaded by the FBI{{spaced ndash}}to initiate an investigation of communists within the US.&lt;ref name="Belknap_a"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1949 trial ==
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A portrait of a man, standing, holding papers|[[J. Edgar Hoover]] initiated the case.]]
In July 1945, FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] instructed his agents to begin gathering information on CPUSA members to support an analysis of the Party's subversive goals, leading to a 1,850-page report published in 1946 which outlined a case for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Redish, pp 81–82, 248. Redish cites Schrecker and Belknap. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 210. &lt;br /&gt; Powers, p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Cold War continued to intensify in 1947, [[United States Congress|Congress]] held a hearing at which the [[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|Hollywood Ten]] refused to testify about alleged involvement with the CPUSA, leading to their convictions for [[contempt of Congress]] in early 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, G. L., "House Un-American Activities Committee", in Finkelman, p 780.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Hoover instructed the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to bring charges against the CPUSA leaders with the intention of rendering the Party ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 210. &lt;br /&gt; Redish, pp 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John F. X. McGohey|John McGohey]], a federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, was given the lead role in prosecuting the case and charged twelve leaders of the CPUSA with violations of the Smith Act. The specific charges against the defendants were first, that they conspired to overthrow the US government by violent means, and second, that they belonged to an organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government.&lt;ref name="SmithActText" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Redishpp" /&gt; The [[indictment]], issued on June&amp;nbsp;29, 1948, asserted that the CPUSA had been in violation of the Smith Act since July&amp;nbsp;1945.&lt;ref name="Belknap_c"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 211.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The Department of Justice was worried that publicizing the indictments might cause liberal voters to shift their support from Truman to the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], so the prosecutors kept the indictments secret until after the [[Democratic National Convention]] concluded on July 14, 1948.&lt;ref name="Belknap_c" /&gt; --&gt; The twelve defendants, arrested in late July 1948, were all members of the National Board of the CPUSA:&lt;ref name="Belknap_c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1977), p 51. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 207. &lt;br /&gt; Lannon, p 122. &lt;br /&gt; Morgan, p 314. &lt;br /&gt; Powers, p 215.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

Hoover hoped that all 55 members of the CPUSA's National Committee would be indicted and was disappointed that the prosecutors chose to pursue only twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, p 215.&lt;/ref&gt; A week before the arrests, Hoover complained to the Justice Department{{spaced ndash}}recalling the [[Industrial Workers of the World#Government suppression|arrests]] and [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis#Wartime cases (1917–1919)|convictions]] of over one hundred leaders of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in 1917{{spaced ndash}}"the IWW was crushed and never revived, similar action at this time would have been as effective against the Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p 314. Hoover quoted by Morgan. &lt;br /&gt; Powers, p 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Start of the trial ===
[[File:WTM sheila 0036.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large, stately building|The 1949 trial was held in the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square federal courthouse]] in Manhattan.]]
The 1949 trial was held in New York City at the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse|Foley Square federal courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. Judge [[Harold Medina]], a former [[Columbia University]] professor who had been on the bench for 18 months when the hearing began, presided.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;Morgan, p 314. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, p 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming a judge, Medina successfully argued the case of ''[[Cramer v. United States]]'' before the Supreme Court, defending a German-American charged with treason.&lt;ref&gt;''Cramer v. United States'', 325 U.S. 1, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;

The trial opened on November&amp;nbsp;1, 1948, and preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January&amp;nbsp;17, 1949; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7, and the case concluded on October 14, 1949.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan_a"&gt;Morgan, p 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Although later trials surpassed it, in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longer trials have been held since then, for example a 20-month trial in 1988 ([http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/news/mn-888_1_mob-trial Longest Mob Trial Ends], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 1988. Retrieved June 10, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was one of the country's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a "circus-like atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Walker p 185"&gt;Walker, p 185. &lt;br /&gt; Morgan, p 315. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, pp 44–45. "Circus-like" are Sabin's words.&lt;/ref&gt; Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt; Magazines, newspapers, and radio reported on the case heavily; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled "Communists: The Presence of Evil" and "Communists: The Little Commissar" (referring to Eugene Dennis).&lt;ref name="Communists: The Little Commissar"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19490425,00.html "Communists: The Little Commissar"], ''Time'', April 25, 1949 (Cover photo: Eugene Dennis). &lt;br /&gt; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,805104,00.html "Communists: The Presence of Evil"], ''Time'': October 24, 1949.

=== Public opinion ===
The opinion of the American public and the news media was overwhelming in favor of conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 217. Belknap quotes an editorial from the left-leaning ''[[The New Republic]]'', written after the prosecution rested on May&amp;nbsp;19, 1949: "[the prosecution] failed to make out the overwhelming case that many people anticipated before the trial began".&lt;/ref&gt;
Magazines, newspapers, and radio reported on the case heavily; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine featured the trial on its cover twice with stories titled "Communists: The Presence of Evil" and "Communists: The Little Commissar" (referring to Eugene Dennis).&lt;ref name="Communists: The Little Commissar"/&gt;
Most American newspapers supported the prosecution, such as the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' which reported that the Communist Party would soon be punished.&lt;ref name="M76"&gt;Martelle, p 76. Martelle states that Shirer's statement was published in the ''New York Star''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', in an editorial, felt that the trial was warranted and denied assertions of the Party that the trial was a provocation comparable to the [[Reichstag fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/22/96429560.pdf |author= |title=The Communist Indictments |date=July 22, 1948 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' took a more detached view in an editorial: "The outcome of the case will be watched by government and political parties around the world as to how the United States, as an outstanding exponent of democratic government, intends to share the benefits of its civil liberties and yet protect them if and when they appear to be abused by enemies from within".&lt;ref name="M76" /&gt;

Support for the prosecutions was not universal, however.
During the proceedings, there were days when several thousand picketers protested in [[Foley Square]] outside the courthouse, chanting slogans like "Adolf Hitler never died&amp;nbsp;/ He's sitting at Medina's side".&lt;ref name="Morgan_a" /&gt; In response, the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses, but the [[United States Senate|Senate]] did not vote on it before the end of the trial.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker, p 186"&gt;Walker, p 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
Journalist [[William L. Shirer]] was skeptical of the trial, writing "no overt act of trying to forcibly overthrow our government is charged&amp;nbsp;... The government's case is simply that by being members and leaders of the Communist Party, its doctrines and tactics being what they are, the accused are guilty of conspiracy".&lt;ref name="M76" /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the purpose of the government's legal attack on the CPUSA was "not so much the protection and security of the state as the exploitation of justice for the purpose of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 214. ''Washington Post'' quoted by Belknap.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Third party (United States)|Third-party]] presidential candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] claimed that the trial was an effort by the Truman administration to create an atmosphere of fear, writing "we Americans have far more to fear from those actions which are intended to suppress political freedom than from the teaching of ideas with which we are in disagreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/22/96429391.pdf |author= |title=Indicted Reds Get Wallace Support |date=July 22, 1948 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farrell Dobbs]] of the SWP wrote{{spaced ndash}}despite the fact that the CPUSA had supported Dobbs' prosecution under the Smith Act in 1941{{spaced ndash}}"I want to state in no uncertain terms that I as well as the Socialist Workers Party support their struggle against the obnoxious Smith Act, as well as against the indictments under that act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |author=Farrell Dobbs |title=Letters to the Times: Indictment of Communists |date=July 24, 1948|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E0DE1E3DE13BBC4C51DFB1668383659EDE |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}; letter dated July 22, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the trial began, supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.&lt;ref name="Belknap 1994, p 212"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges.&lt;ref name="Redish"&gt;Redish, p 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense was not optimistic about the probability of success. After the trial was over, defendant Gates wrote: "The anti-communist hysteria was so intense, and most Americans were so frightened by the Communist issue, that we were convicted before our trial even started".&lt;ref name="Belknap_k"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosecution ===
Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments.&lt;ref name="Belknap_d" /&gt; The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as [[Angela Calomiris]] and [[Herbert Philbrick]], or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as [[Louis F. Budenz|Louis Budenz]].&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'') and works by such authors as [[Karl Marx]] and Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 214. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.&lt;ref name="Belknap_a" /&gt;

Calomiris was recruited by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA, gaining access to a membership roster.&lt;ref name="Mah"&gt;Mahoney, M.H., ''Women in Espionage: A Biographical Dictionary'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 1993, pp 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant.&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; Calomiris identified four of the defendants as members of the CPUSA and provided information about its organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Girl Official of Party Stuns Reds at Trial", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', April 27, 1949, p 21.&lt;/ref&gt; She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government, and that the CPUSA{{spaced ndash}}acting on instructions from Moscow{{spaced ndash}}had attempted to recruit members working in key war industries.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle, pp.148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Budenz, a former communist, was another important witness for the prosecution who testified that the CPUSA subscribed to a philosophy of violent overthrow of the government.&lt;ref name="Belknap_d" /&gt; He also testified that the clauses of the constitution of the CPUSA that disavowed violence were decoys written in "[[Aesopian language]]" which were put in place specifically to protect the CPUSA from prosecution.&lt;ref name="Belknap_d" /&gt;

=== Defense ===
[[File:FoleyTrialAttorneys.tiff|thumb|right|alt=Five well-dressed men standing and conversing.|The five defense attorneys were sent to jail for contempt of court: Abraham Isserman, [[George W. Crockett, Jr.|George W. Crockett Jr.]], Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe.]]

The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and supported the defendants' rights to espouse socialist viewpoints. They were Abraham Isserman, [[George W. Crockett, Jr.|George W. Crockett Jr.]], Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe.&lt;ref name="11Guilty"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=F1IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31 Communist Trial Ends with 11 Guilty]", ''Life'', October 24, 1949, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, p 42. &lt;br /&gt; Attorney [[Maurice Sugar]] participated in an advisory role.&lt;/ref&gt; Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act; but it did submit an [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] endorsing a motion for dismissal of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 185–187. Many local affiliates of the ACLU supported second-tier communist defendants in the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, they sought to portray the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, they attacked the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome for proletarian defendants; and third, they used the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 185. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 217. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, pp 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense made pre-trial [[Motion (legal)|motions]] arguing that the defendants' right to trial by a jury of their peers had been denied because, at that time, a potential [[grand jury|grand juror]] had to meet a minimum property requirement, effectively eliminating the less affluent from service.&lt;ref name="83 F.Supp. 197 1949"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 213. &lt;br /&gt; Walker, p 185. &lt;br /&gt; Starobin, p 206. &lt;br /&gt; Medina's ruling on the jury selection issue is [http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=194928083FSupp197_1238.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985 83 F.Supp. 197 (1949)]. The issue was addressed by the appeals court in [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/183/201/266559/ 183 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1950)].&lt;/ref&gt; The defense also argued that the jury selection process for the trial was similarly flawed.&lt;ref name="Belknap 1994, p 213"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objections to the jury selection process were not successful and jurors included four African Americans and consisted primarily of working-class citizens.&lt;ref name="Belknap_d"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary theme of the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to socialism by education, not by force.&lt;ref name="Belknap_e"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense claimed that most of the prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the [[Comintern]], after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 219–220. &lt;br /&gt; Starobin, p 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence.&lt;ref name="Belknap_e" /&gt; Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.&lt;ref name="Belknap_g"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense attorneys developed a "labor defense" strategy, by which they attacked the entire trial process, including the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury selection process.&lt;ref name="Redishpp"&gt;Redish, pp 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors, and may have been an attempt to provoke a mistrial.&lt;ref name="Sabin"&gt;Sabin, p 46. "Mutual hostility" is Sabin's characterization.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants, in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals.&lt;ref name="Redish" /&gt; Throughout the course of the trial, thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests, and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square. The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs, so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism, rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution's evidence.&lt;ref name="Belknap_f"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could, in his role as attorney, directly address the jury and explain communist principles.&lt;ref name="Belknap_f" /&gt;

=== Courtroom atmosphere ===
The trial was one of the country's most contentious legal proceedings and sometimes had a "circus-like atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Walker p 185"/&gt; Four hundred police officers were assigned to the site on the opening day of the trial.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt;
The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions,&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Redish, p 82. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, p 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter-writing campaign directed at Medina, he stated "I will not be intimidated".&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 218. Medina quoted by Belknap.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of "mutual hostility" arose between the judge and attorneys.&lt;ref name="Sabin" /&gt; &lt;!--Medina came to believe that the defense attorneys were using the trial as an opportunity to publicize communist propaganda, and that they deliberately were attempting to disrupt the trial using any means they could.&lt;ref name="Redish" /&gt; --&gt; Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts, including Hall because he shouted "I've heard more law in a [[kangaroo court]]", and Winston{{spaced ndash}}an African American{{spaced ndash}}for shouting "more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, pp 46–47. Sabin writes that only four defendants were cited. &lt;br /&gt; Morgan, p 315 (Morgan erroneously quotes Winston as saying 500{{spaced ndash}}the correct quote is 5,000). &lt;br /&gt; Martelle, p 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle, p 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow judge [[James L. Oakes]] described Medina as a fair and reasonable judge, and wrote that "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave them a little bit of their own medicine, too."&lt;ref name="Oakes"&gt;Oakes, p 1460.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was "unfriendly" to the defense, and that "there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: "If we let them do that sort of thing [postpone the trial start], they'll destroy the government".&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 212, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had died of a heart attack during [[Smith Act#Washington 1944|the 1943 trial]] involving the Smith Act.&lt;ref name="Redish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Belknap"&gt;Belknap (2001), p 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Belknap_g" /&gt;
&lt;!--Belknap asserts that the defendants could "insist with complete justification that they were the targets of a political prosecution", and that "rather than attempting to prove eleven individuals guilty of criminal conduct, the prosecution mounted an attack on the CPUSA."&lt;ref name="Belknap_d" /&gt; Legal scholar Arthur Sabin writes that one of the jurors stated that "we must fight communism to the death" and spoke of his desire to "hang those Commies".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p 185. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, pp 44–45. Juror quoted by Sabin is novelist Russell Janney. See also Martelle, pp 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Events outside the courtroom ===
[[File:Paul Robeson 1942 crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A portrait of a well-dressed man.|[[Paul Robeson]] gave a concert to raise defense funds.&lt;ref name="Martelle, p 193"&gt;Martelle, p 193.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the ten-month trial, several events occurred in America that intensified the nation's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment: The [[Judith Coplon]] Soviet espionage case was in progress; &lt;!-- the [[University of California]] required all faculty members to take an oath asserting that they were not communists; --&gt; former government employee [[Alger Hiss]] was tried for [[perjury]] stemming from accusations that he was a communist (a trial also held at the Foley Square courthouse); labor leader [[Harry Bridges]] was accused of perjury when he denied being a communist; and the ACLU passed an anti-communist resolution.&lt;ref name="Sabin_a"&gt;Sabin, p 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, John W., "Icons of the Cold War: The Hiss–Chambers Case", in ''Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia (Vol 1)'', (John W. Johnson, Ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, p 79, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93019-2}} (Hiss in same building).&lt;/ref&gt; Two events during the final month of the trial may have been particularly influential: On September&amp;nbsp;23, 1949, Truman announced that the Soviet Union detonated [[RDS-1|its first nuclear bomb]]; and on October&amp;nbsp;1, 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] prevailed in the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Sabin_a" /&gt;

Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis were among the audience members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by [[Paul Robeson]] in [[Peekskill, New York]]. It was given to benefit the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses.&lt;ref name="Martelle, p 193"/&gt; Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and [[Peekskill Riots|threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles]] without interference by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle, pp 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1977), p 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle, pp 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convictions and sentencing ===
[[File:FoleyTrialCrowd.tiff|thumb|right|alt=Several police officers on horses watch a large crowd standing in a public park.|Defendants' supporters, onlookers, and police outside the Foley Square courthouse during the 1949 trial:.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle, p 217.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On October&amp;nbsp;14, 1949, after the defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury [[Jury instructions|instructions to guide them]] in reaching a verdict. He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove that the danger of violence was "clear and present"; instead, the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a "rule or principle of action" with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence "as speedily as circumstances would permit".&lt;ref name="JuryInstr" /&gt; This instruction was in response to the defendants, who endorsed the "[[clear and present danger]]" test, yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The judge's instructions included the phrase "I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil&amp;nbsp;..." which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals.&lt;ref name="JuryInstr"&gt;Sabin, p 45. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 221. &lt;br /&gt; Redish, p 87. &lt;br /&gt; One instruction from Medina to the jury was "I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress had a right to prevent, to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberating for seven and one-half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants.&lt;ref name="Belknap_h"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $10,000 fine each (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1949}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). The eleventh defendant, [[Robert G. Thompson]]{{spaced ndash}}a veteran of World War&amp;nbsp;II{{spaced ndash}}was sentenced to three years in consideration of his wartime service.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson said that he took "no pleasure that this Wall Street judicial flunky has seen fit to equate my possession of the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] to two years in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 221. &lt;br /&gt; Morgan, p 317. Thompson quoted by Morgan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict, Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some "unfinished business" and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced all of them to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months; Dennis, acting as his own attorney, was also cited.&lt;ref name="11Guilty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attorney [[Maurice Sugar]], who participated in an advisory role, was not cited for contempt.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge, no hearings were required for the contempt charges, and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail.&lt;ref name="Sabin_b"&gt;Sabin, p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The regulation governing the contempt sentences was Rule 42(a) of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]]. &lt;br /&gt; Some of the contempt sentences were postponed pending appeal; for instance, Crockett served four months in an Ashland, Kentucky, Federal prison in 1952. See Smith, Jessie Carney, ''Notable Black American Men, Volume 1'', Gale, 1998, p 236, {{ISBN|978-0-7876-0763-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public reaction ===
The vast majority of the public, and most news media, endorsed the verdict.&lt;ref name="Belknap_h" /&gt; Typical was a letter to the ''New York Times'': "The Communist Party may prove to be a hydra-headed monster unless we can discover how to kill the body as well as how to cut off its heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/19/84226378.pdf|author=George D. Wilkinson|title=Letters to the Times: Communism Threat Not Ended|date=October 19, 1949|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}; letter dated October 16, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the convictions, New York Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and Senator [[John Foster Dulles]] praised the verdicts.&lt;ref name="NYTV"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times|title=Vigorous and Varied Reactions Mark Result of Communist Trial|date=October 15, 1949|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03EEDB113DE03ABC4D52DFB6678382659EDE|accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
An editorial from the ''New York Times'' looked forward to a Supreme Court decision to resolve the legal issues: "A good many thoughtful people who have no interest whatever in saving the individual necks of the eleven Communists defendants are concerned nevertheless that what we have forged is a two-edged sword; that if it can be used to cut down subversive enemies, it can also be used against persistent but non-violent dissidents.... On the other hand, it is pointed out, without some such tough statues as this the country remains helpless against what has proved to be its deadliest peacetime enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60B14FE3E5E107A93C4A8178BD95F4D8485F9|author=Cabell Phillips|title=Communist Case to Provide Test of Smith Act|date=October 16, 1949|accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

Some vocal supporters of the defendants spoke out in their defense. A New York resident wrote: "I am not afraid of communism&amp;nbsp;... I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/19/84226189.pdf|author=Mrs. D. Brouwer|title=Letters to the Times: Trend Away from Democracy|date=October 19, 1949|accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}; letter written October 14, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote: "the trial was a political trial&amp;nbsp;... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear in the world at large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?&amp;nbsp;... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the&amp;nbsp;... Smith bill unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/19/84226376.pdf|author=David D. Driscoll|title=Letters to the Times: Political Statutes Queried|date=October 19, 1949|accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}; letter written October 16, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Z. Foster]] wrote: "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict&amp;nbsp;... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people."&lt;ref name="NYTV" /&gt; [[Vito Marcantonio]] of the [[American Labor Party]] wrote that the verdict was "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American."&lt;ref name="NYTV" /&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy.&lt;ref name="NYTV" /&gt;

Abroad, the trial received little mention in mainstream press, but Communist newspapers were unanimous in their condemnation.&lt;ref name="VAA"&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=http://query.ntimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F3091FFA3A59157A93C7A8178BD95F4D8485F9|title=Verdict Assailed Abroad|date=October 16, 1949|accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moscow press wrote that Medina showed "extraordinary prejudice"; the London communist newspaper wrote that the defendants had been convicted only of "being communists"; and in France, a paper decried the convictions as "a step on the road that leads to war."&lt;ref name="VAA" /&gt;

On October 21, President Truman appointed prosecutor John McGohey to serve as a US District Court judge.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1553 McGohey, John F. X.]", ''Biographical Directory of Federal Judges'', Federal Judicial Center. Retrieved February&amp;nbsp;20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Medina was hailed as a national hero and received 50,000 letters congratulating him on the trial outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994) p 221 (50,000 letters). &lt;br /&gt; Oakes, p 1460 ("national hero").&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine featured Medina on its cover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19491024,00.html ''Time'', October 24, 1949]. Retrieved January 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon thereafter he was asked to consider running for governor of New York.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p 1460. Medina chose to not run for governor.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 1951, Truman nominated Medina to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], where he served until 1980.&lt;ref name="MedObit" /&gt;

=== Bail and prison ===
After sentencing, the defendants posted [[bail]], enabling them to remain free during the appeal process. The $260,000 bail (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260000|1949}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) was provided by [[Civil Rights Congress]], a non-profit trust fund which was created to assist CPUSA members with legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1977), p 123.&lt;/ref&gt; While out on bail, Hall was appointed to a position in the secretariat within the CPUSA. Eugene Dennis was{{spaced ndash}}in addition to his Smith Act charges{{spaced ndash}}fighting [[contempt of Congress]] charges stemming from an incident in 1947 when he refused to appear before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He appealed the contempt charge, but the Supreme Court upheld his conviction for contempt in March&amp;nbsp;1950, and he began to serve a one-year term at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Justices Uphold Red Conviction", ''Spokesman-Review'', March&amp;nbsp;28, 1950. &lt;br /&gt; The conviction was upheld in [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/339/162/ ''Dennis v. United States'', 339 U.S. 162 (1950)].&lt;/ref&gt;

While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard, the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers. To ensure continuity of their leadership, they decided that four of the defendants should go into hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison.&lt;ref name="Belknap_j"&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July&amp;nbsp;2, 1951, after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted.&lt;ref name="Belknap_j" /&gt; When July arrived, only seven defendants reported to prison, and four (Winston, Green, Thompson, and Hall) went into hiding, forfeiting $80,000 bail (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1949}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name="Belknap_j" /&gt; Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951, trying to flee to the Soviet Union. Thompson was captured in California in 1952. Both had three years added to their five-year sentences.&lt;ref name="Belknap_j" /&gt; Winston and Green surrendered voluntarily in 1956 after they felt that anti-communist hysteria had diminished.&lt;ref name="Belknap_j" /&gt; Some of the defendants did not fare well in prison: Thompson was attacked by an anti-communist inmate; Winston became blind because a brain tumor was not treated promptly; Gates was put into solitary confinement because he refused to lock the cells of fellow inmates; and Davis was ordered to mop floors because he protested against racial segregation in prison.&lt;ref name="Belknap_j" /&gt;&lt;ref name="m2567"&gt;Martelle, pp 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception of communism after the trial ===
[[File:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Portrait of a man in a suit.|Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was a prominent anti-communist.]]
After the convictions, the Cold War continued in the international arena. In December 1950, Truman declared a [[State of emergency|national emergency]] in response to the Korean War.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt; The [[First Indochina War]] continued in [[Vietnam]], in which communist forces in the north fought against [[French Union]] forces in the south.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt; The US expanded the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] broadcasting system in an effort to promote Western political ideals in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt; In March&amp;nbsp;1951, American communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt; In 1952, the US exploded its first [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and the Soviet Union followed suit in 1953.&lt;ref name="ColdWar"&gt;Gregory, Ross, ''Cold War America, 1946 to 1990'', Infobase Publishing, 2003, pp 48–53, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-0798-1}}. &lt;br /&gt; Kort, Michael, ''The Columbia Guide to the Cold War'', Columbia University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-231-10773-0}}. &lt;br /&gt; Walker, Martin, ''The Cold War: a History'', Macmillan, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-3454-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the Cold War was in the forefront of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed "I have here in my hand a list" of over 200 communists who were employed in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communists in Government Service, McCarthy Says|publisher=United States Senate History Website|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Communists_In_Government_Service.htm|accessdate=March 9, 2007}} &lt;br /&gt; McCarthy made the claim in [[Joseph McCarthy#Wheeling speech|The Wheeling speech]].&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1950, the US&amp;nbsp;Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]].&lt;ref name="Belknap_k" /&gt;

The convictions in the 1949 trial encouraged the Department of Justice to prepare for additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January&amp;nbsp;1950, a representative of the Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions.&lt;ref name="FBItestify"&gt;Sabin, p 56. &lt;br /&gt; See also Fast, Howard, "The Big Finger", ''Masses &amp; Mainstream'', March, 1950, pp 62–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional.&lt;ref name="FBItestify" /&gt; The FBI had compiled a list of 200,000 persons in its [[FBI Index|Communist Index]]; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, p 56 (200,000 figure). &lt;br /&gt; Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure).&lt;/ref&gt; Seven months after the convictions, in May&amp;nbsp;1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared "communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America.... Wherever they may be, they have in common one diabolic ambition: to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning."&lt;ref&gt;Heale, M. J., ''American Anticommunism: Combating the Enemy Within, 1830–1970'', JHU Press, 1990, p 162, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4051-7}}. Hoover quoted by Heale. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other federal government agencies also worked to undermine organizations, such as the CPUSA, they considered subversive: The [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigated 81&amp;nbsp;organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining [[National Housing Act of 1934|federal housing benefits]]; and attempts were made to deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal appeals of 1949 trial ==
The 1949 trial defendants appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258–259" /&gt; In the appeal they raised issues about the use of informant witnesses, the impartiality of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]].&lt;ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258–259"&gt;Belknap (2005), pp 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.

=== Free speech law ===
{{see also|First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Speech critical of the government}}
One of the major issues raised on appeal was that the defendants' political advocacy was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.&lt;ref name="Sabin" /&gt;

In the early twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the [[bad tendency]] test.&lt;ref name="RCL"&gt;Rabban, pp 132–134, 190–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooted in English [[common law]], the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.&lt;ref name="RCL" /&gt; One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'' (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.&lt;ref name="RCL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. Colorado'', 205 U.S. 454 (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-war protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence. In the 1919 case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court held that an anti-war activist did not have a First Amendment right to speak out against the draft.&lt;ref name="Killian p1093"&gt;Killian, p 1093.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schenck v. United States'', 249 U.S. 47 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; In his majority opinion, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]] introduced the [[clear and present danger]] test, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law; but the ''Schenck'' decision did not formally adopt the test.&lt;ref name="Killian p1093" /&gt; Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabban, pp 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.&lt;ref name="K60"&gt;Killian, pp 1096, 1100.&lt;br /&gt;Currie, David P., ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888–1986, Volume 2'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, p 269, {{ISBN|978-0-226-13112-2}}.&lt;br /&gt;Konvitz, Milton Ridvad, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly'', Transaction Publishers, 2003, p 304, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0954-4}}. &lt;br /&gt; Eastland, p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court would adopt the [[imminent lawless action]] test in 1969's [[Brandenburg v. Ohio]], 395 U.S. 444 (1969), which some commentators view as a modified version of the clear and present danger test.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early twentieth century in cases such as 1919's ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' which upheld the conviction of anti-war activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919). &lt;br /&gt; The bad tendency test was also used in ''Frohwerk v. United States'', 249 U.S. 204 (1919); ''Debs v. United States'', 249 U.S. 211 (1919); and ''Schaefer v. United States'', 251 U.S. 466 (1920). &lt;br /&gt; See Rabban, David, "Clear and Present Danger Test", in ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'', p 183, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517661-2}} .&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Abrams'', Holmes and [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p. 1094. &lt;br /&gt; Rabban, p 346.&lt;br /&gt;Redish, p 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925's ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', the Court extended the First Amendment to the states, and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the "[[Left Wing Manifesto#"Left Wing Manifesto" issued by the Left Wing National Council|Left Wing Manifesto]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Gitlow v. New York'', 268 U.S. 652 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gitlow'' was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to Schenck-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish, p 102. &lt;br /&gt; Kemper, p 653.&lt;/ref&gt; Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927's ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' decision.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;Dunlap, William V., "National Security and Freedom of Speech", in Finkelman (vol 1), pp 1072–1074.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Whitney v. California'' 274 U.S. 357 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test, but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it suggested that "imminent danger"{{spaced ndash}}a more restrictive wording than "present danger"{{spaced ndash}}should be required before speech can be outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 102–104. &lt;br /&gt; Killian, p 1095.&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Whitney'', bad tendency tests continued to be used by the Court in cases such 1931's ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931). &lt;br /&gt; Killian, p 1096. &lt;br /&gt; Another case from that era that used the bad tendency test was ''Fiske v. Kansas'', 274 U.S. 380 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' decision in which a state anti-picketing law was invalidated.&lt;ref name="K60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thornhill v. Alabama'', 310 U.S. 88 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following ''Thornhill'',&lt;ref&gt;Including ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'', 310 U.S. 296 (1940): &lt;span style="font-size:87%"&gt;"When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious.… we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And ''[[Bridges v. California]]'', 314 U.S. 252 (1941): &lt;span style="font-size:87%"&gt;"And, very recently [in ''Thornhill''] we have also suggested that 'clear and present danger' is an appropriate guide in determining the constitutionality of restrictions upon expression … What finally emerges from the 'clear and present danger' cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled,&lt;ref name="K60" /&gt; and the clear and present danger test was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitment to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Antieu, Chester James, ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'', Wm. S. Hein Publishing, 1998, p 219, {{ISBN|978-1-57588-443-1}}. Antieu names ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', 340 U.S. 315 (1951); ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' 315 U.S. 568 (1942); and ''[[Kovacs v. Cooper]]'', 335 U.S. 77 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal to the federal Court of Appeals ===
In May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in the CPUSA case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]''. In that case the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a [[balancing test]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastland, p 47. &lt;br /&gt; Killian, p 1101. &lt;br /&gt; ''American Communications Association v. Douds'' 339 U.S. 382 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June&amp;nbsp;21–23, 1950. Two days later, on June&amp;nbsp;25, [[South Korea]] was invaded by forces from communist [[North Korea]], marking the start of the [[Korean War]]; during the two months that the appeals court judges were forging their opinions, the Korean War dominated the headlines.&lt;ref name="Belknap_i"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 222.&lt;/ref&gt; On August&amp;nbsp;1, 1950, the appeals court unanimously upheld the convictions in an opinion written by Judge [[Learned Hand]]. Judge Hand considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in ''American Communications Association v. Douds''.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258–259" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eastland, pp 96, 112–113. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, p 79. &lt;br /&gt; O'Brien, pp 7–8. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994), p 222. &lt;br /&gt; Walker, p 187. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap, Michal, ''The Vinson Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, p 109, {{ISBN|978-1-57607-201-1}}. &lt;br /&gt; Kemper, p 655.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, Hand wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In each case they [the courts] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.... The American Communist Party, of which the defendants are the controlling spirits, is a highly articulated, well contrived, far spread organization, numbering thousands of adherents, rigidly and ruthlessly disciplined, many of whom are infused with a passionate Utopian faith that is to redeem mankind.... The violent capture of all existing governments is one article of the creed of that faith [communism], which abjures the possibility of success by lawful means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/183/201/266559/ ''United States v. Dennis et al'' (183 F.2d 201)] Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Appeal to the Supreme Court ===
{{main|Dennis v. United States}}
[[File:FredVinsonReadingBook.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A formal portrait of an older man, sitting, in judicial robes|Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] wrote the opinion in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''.]]
The defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''. During the Supreme Court appeal, the defendants were assisted by the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the ACLU.&lt;ref name="Belknap_i" /&gt; The Supreme Court limited its consideration to the questions of the constitutionality of the Smith Act and the jury instructions, and did not rule on the issues of impartiality, jury composition, or informant witnesses.&lt;ref name="Belknap 2005, pp 258–259" /&gt; The 6–2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision. Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Fred Vinson's]] opinion stated that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] does not require that the government must wait "until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited" before it interrupts seditious plots.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 223. Vinson quoted by Belknap.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/494/case.html ''Dennis v. United States''&amp;nbsp;– 341 U.S. 494 (1951)] Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p 1100. &lt;br /&gt; Kemper, pp 654–655.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Chief Judge Learned Hand ... interpreted the [clear and present danger] phrase as follows: 'In each case, [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the "evil", discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.' We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.}}

Vinson's opinion also addressed the contention that Medina's jury instructions were faulty. The defendants claimed that Medina's statement that "as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has a right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution" was erroneous, but Vinson concluded that the instructions were an appropriate interpretation of the Smith Act.&lt;ref name="Dennis" /&gt;

The Supreme Court was, in one historian's words, "bitterly divided" on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues presented by ''Dennis''.&lt;ref name="OB78"&gt;O'Brien, pp 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O. Douglas]] dissented from the majority opinion. In his dissent, Black wrote "public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that, in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society."&lt;ref name="Dennis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, p 84. Black quoted by Sabin. &lt;br /&gt; Morgan, pp 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ''Dennis'' decision, the Court utilized balancing tests for free speech cases, and rarely invoked the clear and present danger test.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p 1103. &lt;br /&gt; Eastland, p 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense attorneys appealed their contempt sentences, which were handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;Rule 42(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; The attorneys raised a variety of issues on appeal, including the purported misconduct of the judge, and the claim that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge. They argued that the contempt charges would prevent future CPUSA defendants from obtaining counsel, because attorneys would be afraid of judicial retaliation.&lt;ref name="Sacher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From ''Sacher's'' majority opinion: "We are urged that these sentences will have an intimidating effect on the legal profession, whose members hereafter will decline to appear in trials where 'defendants are objects of hostility of those in power,' or will do so under a 'cloud of fear' which "threatens the right of the American people to be represented fearlessly and vigorously by counsel'."&lt;/ref&gt; The initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful: The court reviewed Medina's actions, and reversed some specifications of contempt, but affirmed the convictions.&lt;ref name="Sacher"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/1#fn2_ref ''Sacher v.

The attorneys then appealed to the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition, but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;The initial appeal was 341 U.S. 952, 71 S.Ct. 1010, 95 L.Ed. 1374.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court limited their review to the question, "was the charge of contempt, as and when certified, one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42(a) to determine and punish himself; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42(b) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice, hearing, and opportunity to defend?".&lt;ref name="Sacher" /&gt; The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by [[Robert H.

But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also are the reasons which account for it being made summary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/1/case.html ''Sacher v.

== Trials of "second-tier" officials ==
[[File:Elizabeth G. Flynn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Image of a formally dressed woman, seated, around 1930.|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] was one of the second-tier defendants.]]
After the 1949 convictions, prosecutors waited until the constitutional issues were settled by the Supreme Court before they tried additional leaders of the CPUSA.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; When the 1951 ''Dennis'' decision upholding the convictions was announced, prosecutors initiated indictments of 132 additional CPUSA leaders, called "second string" or "second-tier" defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin p 59 (the 132 were in addition to the twelve from 1949). Belknap (1994) p 226 (126 of the 132 were conspiracy charges, 6 or 7 were membership clause charges).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belknap_l"&gt;Belknap (1994), p 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt; The second-tier defendants were prosecuted in three waves: 1951, 1954, and 1956.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; Their trials were held in over a dozen cities, including Los Angeles (15 CPUSA defendants, including [[Dorothy Ray Healey|Dorothy Healey]], leader of the California branch of the CPUSA), New York (21 defendants, including National Committee members [[Claudia Jones]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]]), Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, Seattle, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, Boston, Puerto Rico, and New Haven.&lt;ref&gt;Edson, Peter, "New Anti-Red Laws Requested", ''Lawrence Journal-World'', July 15, 1954, p 4. &lt;br /&gt; Navasky, p 33. &lt;br /&gt; Belknap (1994) p 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other CPUSA members indicted included: [[Robert Klonsky]] (Philadelphia); [[Alexander Bittelman]], [[Alexander Trachtenberg]], [[V. J. Jerome]], and [[Betty Garrett]] (New York).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-tier defendants had a difficult time finding lawyers to represent them. The five defense attorneys at the 1949 trial had been jailed for contempt of court,&lt;ref name="Sabin_b" /&gt; and two of them, [[Abraham J. Isserman]] and Harry Sacher, were [[Disbarment|disbar]]red.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, pp 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Attorneys for other Smith Act defendants routinely found themselves attacked by courts, attorneys' groups, and licensing boards, leading many defense attorneys to shun Smith Act cases.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, p 48. &lt;br /&gt; Auerbach , p 245–248. &lt;br /&gt; Rabinowitz, Victor, ''A History of the National Lawyers Guild: 1937–1987'', National Lawyers Guild Foundation, 1987, p 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some defendants were forced to contact over one hundred attorneys before finding one that would accept;&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, p 248.&lt;/ref&gt; defendant [[Steve Nelson (activist)|Steve Nelson]] could not find a lawyer in Pennsylvania who would represent him in his Smith Act trial, so he was compelled to represent himself;&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, p 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and judges sometimes had to appoint unwilling counsel for defendants who could not find a lawyer to take the case.&lt;ref&gt;Navasky, p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Lawyers Guild]] provided some lawyers to the defendants, but in 1953 Attorney General [[Herbert Brownell Jr.]] threatened to list the Guild as a subversive organization, causing half its members to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Sarah Hart, ''Standing Against Dragons: Three Southern Lawyers in an Era of Fear'', LSU Press, 2000, pp 21–22, {{ISBN|978-0-8071-2575-5}}. &lt;br /&gt; Navasky, p 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some second-tier defendants were unable to post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding.&lt;ref name="S49"&gt;Sabin, pp 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The California defendants challenged their $50,000 bail (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars&lt;!--{{inflation-fn|US}}--&gt;) as excessively high, and won in the ''[[Stack v. Boyle]]'' 342 U.S. 1 (1951) Supreme Court case.&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants [[Jump bail|skipped bail]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="S49" /&gt; Leaders of the CRC were called before a grand jury and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund.&lt;ref name="S49" /&gt; Novelist [[Dashiell Hammett]], a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.&lt;ref name="S49" /&gt;

To supply witnesses for the second-tier trials, the Justice Department relied on a dozen informants, who traveled full-time from trial to trial, testifying about communism and the CPUSA. The informants were paid for their time; for example, Budenz earned $70,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from his activities as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, David M., ''A Conspiracy So Immense: the World of Joe McCarthy'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p 149, {{ISBN|978-0-02-923490-7}} (discusses Budenz's income, which includes revenue from lectures and books, as well as compensation from the government for testifying). &lt;br /&gt; Navasky, pp 33, 38. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, pp 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earl Warren.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A formal portrait of a judge, in his robes, sitting.|[[Earl Warren]], Chief Justice when ''[[Yates v. United States|Yates]]'' was decided in 1957.]]
The federal appeals courts upheld all convictions of second-tier officials, and the Supreme Court refused to hear their appeals until 1956, when it agreed to hear the appeal of the California defendants; this led to the landmark ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' decision.&lt;ref name="Belknap_l" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starobin, p 208. &lt;br /&gt; Levin, p 1488.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen second-tier CPUSA officials from California who had been convicted of Smith Act violations appealed and on June&amp;nbsp;17, 1957, "Red Monday", the Supreme Court reversed their convictions. By the time the Court ruled 6–1 in ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', four of the Supreme Court Justices that supported the 1951 ''Dennis'' decision had been replaced, including Chief Justice Vinson, who was replaced by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]].&lt;ref name="OB78" /&gt;

The decision in ''Yates'' undermined the 1951 ''Dennis'' decision by holding that contemplation of abstract, future violence may not be prohibited by law, but that urging others to act in violent ways may be outlawed.&lt;ref name="RedMonday"&gt;Belknap (2001), p 869 (defines the term "Red Monday"; on that day, a companion case, ''[[Watkins v.

''Yates'' did not rule the Smith Act unconstitutional or even overrule the ''Dennis'' decision, but ''Yates'' limited the application of the Act to such a degree that it became nearly unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p 1100.&lt;br /&gt;Redish pp 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, John J.; Pious, Richard M., ''The Oxford Guide to the United States Government'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp 722–723, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514273-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yates'' decision outraged some conservative members of Congress, who introduced legislation to limit judicial review of certain sentences related to sedition and treason, which did not pass.&lt;ref name="BCCW"&gt;Belknap, Michal, "Communism and Cold War", in ''Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p 199, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517661-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership clause ===
{{main|Noto v. United States}}
Four years after the ''Yates'' decision, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of another second-tier CPUSA leader, John Francis Noto of New York, in the 1961 ''[[Noto v. United States]]'' case.&lt;ref name="NOTO"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/367/290/case.html ''Noto v. United States'' 367 U.S. 290 (1961)] Justia.

John Francis Noto'', 262 F.2d 501 (2d Cir. 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Noto was convicted under the membership clause of the Smith Act, and he challenged the constitutionality of that clause on appeal.&lt;ref name="MRK" /&gt; The membership clause was in the portion of the Smith Act that made it a crime "to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof ...".&lt;ref name="SmithActText" /&gt; In a unanimous decision, the court reversed the conviction because the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to demonstrate that the Party was advocating action (as opposed to mere doctrine) of forcible overthrow of the government.&lt;ref name="MRK"&gt;Konvitz, "Noto v. United States", p 697: "There must be substantial evidence, direct or circumstantial, of a call to violence 'now or in the future' that is both 'sufficiently strong and sufficiently persuasive' to lend color to the 'ambiguous theoretical material' regarding Communist party teaching ... and also substantial evidence to justify the reasonable inference that the call to violence may fairly be imputed to the party as a whole and not merely to a narrow segment of it."&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the majority, Justice Harlan wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/367/290/case.html ''Noto v.

{{quote|The evidence was insufficient to prove that the Communist Party presently advocated forcible overthrow of the Government not as an abstract doctrine, but by the use of language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to action, immediately or in the future.... In order to support a conviction under the membership clause of the Smith Act, there must be some substantial direct or circumstantial evidence of a call to violence now or in the future which is both sufficiently strong and sufficiently pervasive to lend color to the otherwise ambiguous theoretical material regarding Communist Party teaching and to justify the inference that such a call to violence may fairly be imputed to the Party as a whole, and not merely to some narrow segment of it.}}

The decision did not rule the membership clause unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="MRK" /&gt; In their concurring opinions, Justices Black and Douglas argued that the membership clause of the Smith Act was unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First Amendment, with Douglas writing that "the utterances, attitudes, and associations in this case&amp;nbsp;... are, in my view, wholly protected by the First Amendment, and not subject to inquiry, examination, or prosecution by the Federal Government."&lt;ref name="NOTO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRK" /&gt;

=== Final conviction ===
{{main|Scales v. United States}}
In 1958, the leader of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, [[Junius Scales]], became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the ''Yates'' decision.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales was initially convicted in 1955, but the sentence was overturned on appeal due to procedural mistakes by the prosecution; and he was retried in 1958.

Other CPUSA leaders, such as Noto, were convicted under the membership clause, but Scales was the only one whose conviction was not overturned on appeal.&lt;/ref&gt; In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a ''[[Illegal per se|per se]]'' violation of any criminal statute.&lt;ref name="Scales"&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1950-1959/1958/1958_1_2 Scales v.

Even though the evidence disclosed no advocacy for immediate overthrow of the government, the Court held that present advocacy of future action satisfied statutory and constitutional requirements no less than advocacy of immediate action."&lt;/ref&gt; Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the ''Yates'' decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.&lt;ref name="BCCW" /&gt;

The ''Yates'' and ''Noto'' decisions undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of CPUSA membership inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp 240–242.&lt;/ref&gt; When the trials came to an end in 1958, 144 people had been indicted, resulting in 105 convictions, with cumulative sentences totaling 418 years and $435,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|435500|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in fines.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), pp 225–226. &lt;br /&gt; Sabin, p 60. &lt;br /&gt; Not all indictments led to convictions: ten were acquitted, one died, three did not go to trial due to ill health, and one had a hung jury (Belknap (1994) p 225).&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than half the convicted communists served jail time.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; The Smith Act, {{usc|18|2385}}, though amended several times, has not been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Adam B., "Anti-Anarchy and Anti-Syndicalism Statutes", in Finkelman (vol 1), p 68. &lt;br /&gt; The provision requiring registration was revoked in 1982.

For two decades after the ''Dennis'' decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in ''Dennis''.&lt;ref&gt;Including cases such as ''Konigsberg v. State Bar of California'', 366 U.S. 36 (1961). &lt;br /&gt; Killian, pp 1101–1103.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' which held that "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action".&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 104–106. &lt;br /&gt; Killian, pp 1109–1110.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brandenburg'' is now the standard applied by the Court to free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in cases such as ''Hess v.

{{Socialism sidebar}}
"'''Socialism with no doctrine'''" ('''''Socialisme sans doctrine''''') is a phrase coined by [[Albert Métin]] based on his observation of the experiments in labour and economic regulation by the nonsocialist governments of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] that Métin described as effectively being a form of [[state socialism]] though these policies did not contain any reference recognizing socialist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lamb, J. C. Docherty. ''Historical dictionary of socialism''. Lanham, Maryland, UK; Oxford, England, UK: Scarecrow Press, Inc, 2006. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Métin wrote the book ''Socialisme sans doctrine'' (1901) that described this phenomenon and described these experiments undertaken in Australia and New Zealand to an audience in Paris that included future [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Alexandre Millerand]] in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lamb, J. C. Docherty. ''Historical dictionary of socialism''. Lanham, Maryland, UK; Oxford, England, UK: Scarecrow Press, Inc, 2006. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64791">'''Term limits in the United States''' apply to many offices at both the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state]] level, and date back to the [[American Revolution]].

[[Term limit]]s, also referred to as ''rotation in office'', restrict the number of [[Term of office|terms of office]] an [[Incumbent|officeholder]] may hold. For example, according to the [[22nd Amendment]], the [[President of the United States]] can serve two four-year terms and serve no more than 10 years. 
{{Politics of the United States}}

== Historical background ==

=== The Constitution ===
Term limits date back to the American Revolution, and prior to that to the democracies and republics of antiquity. The [[Boule (ancient Greece)|council of 500]] in [[ancient Athens]] rotated its entire membership annually, as did the [[ephor]]ate in ancient [[Sparta]]. The ancient [[Roman Republic]] featured a system of elected magistrates—tribunes of the [[plebs]], [[aediles]], [[quaestors]], [[praetors]], and [[consuls]] —who served a single term of one year, with re-election to the same magistracy forbidden for ten years ''(see [[cursus honorum]])''.&lt;ref name=twsOctW122&gt;{{cite news |author= Professor Garrett G. Fagan, Penn State University |title= The History of Ancient Rome
|publisher= ''The Teaching Company'' |quote= ...Office-holding at Rome was based on two important concepts: collegiality and limited tenure of office... (see page 19 of the Guidebook, Part 2) |year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[historian]] Garrett Fagan, office holding in the Roman Republic was based on "limited tenure of office" which ensured that "authority circulated frequently", helping to prevent [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name=twsOctW122 /&gt; An additional benefit of the ''cursus honorum'' or ''Run of Offices'' was to bring the "most experienced" politicians to the upper echelons of power-holding in the ancient republic.&lt;ref name=twsOctW122 /&gt; Many of the founders of the [[United States]] were educated in the classics, and quite familiar with rotation in office during antiquity. The debates of that day reveal a desire to study and profit from the object lessons offered by ancient democracy.

Prior to independence, several colonies had already experimented with term limits. The [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] of 1639, for example, prohibited the colonial governor from serving consecutive terms, setting terms at one year's length, and holding "that no person be chosen Governor above once in two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/order.asp|website=The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|publisher=Yale Law School Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after independence, the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]] set maximum service in the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] at "four years in seven".&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s influence is seen not only in that he chaired the constitutional convention which drafted the Pennsylvania constitution, but also because it included, virtually unchanged, Franklin's earlier proposals on executive rotation. Pennsylvania's plural executive was composed of twelve citizens elected for the term of three years, followed by a mandatory vacation of four years.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, section 19. On Franklin's plan of 1775 see, Benjamin Franklin, The Writings of Benjamin Franklin, ed., Albert Henry Smyth, 10 vols. (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1907), 6:423, article 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Articles of Confederation]], adopted in 1781, established term limits for the delegates to the [[Continental Congress]], mandating in Article V that "no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Confederation: March 1, 1781|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp|website=The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|publisher=Yale Law School Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 1789, the Continental Congress appointed a committee of thirteen to examine forms of government for the impending union of the states. Among the proposals was that from the State of [[Virginia]], written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], urging a limitation of tenure, "to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom by continuing too long in office the members of the Continental Congress".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''The Papers of Thomas Jefferson'', ed. Julian F. Boyd, et al., (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1950–), 1:411.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee made recommendations, which as regards congressional term limits were incorporated unchanged into the [[Articles of Confederation]] (1781–89). The fifth Article stated that "no person shall be capable of being a delegate [to the continental congress] for more than three years in any term of six years".&lt;ref&gt;Also, article IX, paragraph 5, of the Articles of Confederation provided that, "no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of four years."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Term limits in the Constitution ===
In contrast to the Articles of Confederation, the [[Philadelphia Convention|federal constitution convention]] at [[Philadelphia]] omitted mandatory term limits from the [[U.S. Constitution]] of 1789.  At the convention,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PJtRgu3wWWkC&amp;pg=PA62 The Politics and Law of Term Limits]&lt;/ref&gt; some delegates spoke passionately against term limits such as [[Rufus King]], who said "that he who has proved himself to be most fit for an Office, ought not to be excluded by the constitution from holding it."  The [[Electoral College]], it was believed by some delegates at the convention, could have a role to play in limiting unfit officers from continuing.

When the states ratified the Constitution (1787–88), several leading statesmen regarded the lack of mandatory limits to tenure as a dangerous defect, especially, they thought, as regards the presidency and the Senate. [[Richard Henry Lee]] viewed the absence of legal limits to tenure, together with certain other features of the Constitution, as "most highly and dangerously oligarchic".&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Lee, Letter to Edmund Randolph dated 16 October 1787, in Richard Henry Lee, ''The Letters of Richard Henry Lee'', ed. James C. Ballagh, 2 vols. (New York: Macmillan Co., 1911), 2:450, 455. See also 1:191, letter to Edmund Pendleton dated 12 May 1776, and ''Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican'', ed. Walter H. Bennett (University, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1978), pp. 72–75, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Jefferson&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Papers, Boyd, ed., 12:440, 13:490. See also 15:25 for Jefferson's definition of rotation in office.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Mason]]&lt;ref&gt;Mason in Jonathan Eliot, ed., ''The Debates in the Several State Conventions on Adoption of the Federal Constitution'', 5 vols. (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1836), 3:485.&lt;/ref&gt; advised limits on reelection to the Senate and to the Presidency, because said Mason, "nothing is so essential to the preservation of a Republican government as a periodic rotation". The historian [[Mercy Otis Warren]], warned that "there is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well-timed bribery, will probably be done".&lt;ref&gt;Mercy Otis Warren, Observations on the new Constitution, and on the Federal and State Conventions 9, in Herbert J. Staring, ed., The Complete Anti-Federalist, 6 vols. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981) 4:270, 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1789 ===
Michael Korzi says [[George Washington]] did not set the informal precedent for a two-term limit for the Presidency.  He only meant he was too worn out to personally continue in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Korzi|title=Presidential Term Limits in American History: Power, Principles, and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tH_mYP6NuIkC&amp;pg=PA43|date= 2013|publisher=Texas A&amp;M UP|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Thomas Jefferson who made it a principle in 1808. He made many statements calling for term limits in one form or another.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://famguardian.org/Subjects/Politics/ThomasJefferson/jeff1230.htm "Thomas Jefferson on Politics &amp; Government".&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was challenged by Ulysses Grant in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Stein, ''The Third-Term Tradition: Its Rise and Collapse in American Politics'' (1943) pp 71-116.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''The Third-Term Tradition''  pp 144-222.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise no major effort to avoid it took place until 1940 when [[Franklin Roosevelt]] explicitly broke it.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''The Third-Term Tradition''  pp 317-340.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[22nd Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1951 formally establishing in law the two-term limit—although it did not apply to the incumbent Harry Truman.

The fact that "perpetuity in office" was not approached until the 20th century is due in part to the influence of rotation in office as a popular 19th-century concept. "Ideas are, in truth, forces", and rotation in office enjoyed such normative support, especially at the local level, that it altered political reality.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Struble, Jr., "[http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/13-publications_files/PSQ_House_Turnover_1979.pdf House Turnover and the Principle of Rotation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082927/http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/13-publications_files/PSQ_House_Turnover_1979.pdf |date=2010-10-11 }}," ''Political Science Quarterly'' 94 (Winter 1979–80): p. 650, and fn. 6. in the question, The quotation is from Henry James, the biographer.&lt;/ref&gt; For a detailed study of the 19th-century concepts of rotation, consult ''Political Science Quarterly'', vol. 94, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082927/http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/13-publications_files/PSQ_House_Turnover_1979.pdf "House Turnover and the Principle of Rotation"], by [[Robert Struble, Jr.]] See also his ''Treatise on Twelve Lights'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Struble, Jr.]], ''Treatise on Twelve Lights'', chapter six, [http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/06-Rotation%20&amp;%20other%20reforms.htm#Part_2 Rotation in Office, and other democratic reforms..."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411104723/http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/06-Rotation%20%26%20other%20reforms.htm#Part_2 |date=2016-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; chapter six, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160411104723/http://www.tell-usa.org/totl/06-Rotation%20%26%20other%20reforms.htm#Part_2 "Rotation in History"]. Consult also, James Young's ''The Washington Community, 1800–1828''.

According to Young, the tendency to look with mistrust upon political power was so ingrained into American culture that even the officeholders themselves perceived their occupations in a disparaging light.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Young, ''The Washington Community, 1800–1828'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1966), pp. 51–52, 55–57, 59–61, 64, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Fenimore Cooper]] described the common view that "contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed".&lt;ref&gt;James Fenimore Cooper, The American Democrat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1931), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the ''Richmond Enquirer'' (1822) noted that the "long cherished" principle of rotation in office had been impressed on the republican mind "by a kind of intuitive impulse, unassailable to argument or authority".&lt;ref&gt;''Richmond Enquirer'', 8 November 1822, p. 3; Struble, ''supra''., p. 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning about the 1830s, [[Jacksonian democracy]] introduced a less idealistic twist to the practice of limiting terms. Rotation in office came to mean taking turns in the distribution of political prizes.&lt;ref&gt;One can still detect the idealism of the Revolutionary period echoed by President [[Andrew Jackson]] in his address to Congress, December 8, 1829: "There are, perhaps, few men who can for any great length of time enjoy office and power without being more or less under the influence of feelings unfavorable to the faithful discharge of their public duties. Their integrity may be proof against improper considerations immediately addressed to themselves, but they are apt to acquire a habit of looking with indifference upon the public interests and of tolerating conduct from which an unpracticed man would revolt. Office is considered as a species of property, and government rather as a means of promoting individual interests than as an instrument created solely for the service of the people. Corruption in some and in others a perversion of correct feelings and principles divert government from its legitimate ends and make it an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many."... &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[James D. Richardson]], ed., ''[[A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents]]'', 10 vols. (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1896–99), 2:448–49].&lt;/ref&gt; Rotation of nominations to the U.S. House of Representatives—the prizes—became a key element of payoffs to the party faithful. The leading lights in the local party machinery came to regard a nomination for the House as "salary" for political services rendered. A new code of political ethics evolved, based on the proposition that "turnabout is fair play".&lt;ref&gt;Struble, ''supra'', pp. 661–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, rotation of nominations was intertwined with the [[spoils system]].

In district nominating conventions local leaders could negotiate and enforce agreements to pass the nominations around among themselves. [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1846 under such a bargain, and he returned home to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] after a single congressional term because, he wrote, "to enter myself as a competitor of another, or to authorize anyone so to enter me, is what my word and honor forbid".&lt;ref&gt;Struble, ''ibid'', pp. 659–60; Lincoln's letter to William Herndon, 8 January 1848, in Abraham Lincoln, ''The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'', ed. Roy P. Basler, 10 vols. (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1:430–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Confederate States Constitution]] limited its president to a single six-year term.

=== Era of incumbency ===

The practice of nomination rotation for the House of Representatives began to decline after the Civil War. It took a generation or so before the direct primary system, civil service reforms, and the ethic of professionalism worked to eliminate rotation in office as a common political practice. By the turn of the 20th century the era of incumbency was coming into full swing.

A total of 8 presidents served two full terms and declined a third and three presidents served one full term and refused a second. After [[World War II]], however, an officeholder class had developed to the point that congressional tenure rivaled that of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], where tenure is for life.

=== Term limits movement ===

"Homesteading," or securing a lifelong career in Congress, was made possible by reelection rates that approached 100% by the end of the 20th century. The concept of homesteading brought about a popular movement known as the "term-limits movement". The elections of 1990–94 saw the adoption of term limits for state legislatures in almost every state where citizens had the power of the initiative. In addition, 23 states limited service in their delegation to Congress. As they pertain to Congress, these laws are no longer enforceable, however, as in 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned congressional term limits in ''[[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]]'', ruling that state governments cannot limit the terms of members of the national government.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]]. The decision was 5–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where rotation in the legislative branch has withstood court challenges, term limits continue to garner popular support. As of 2002, the advocacy group "[[U.S. Term Limits]]" found that in the 17 states where state legislators served in rotation, public support for term limits ranged from 60 to 78 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Stacie Rumenap, "Career Politicians Never Did Like Term Limits," ''No Uncertain Terms'', August 2002, vol. 10, #7, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, term limits at the federal level are restricted to the executive branch and some agencies. Judicial appointments at the federal level are made for life, and are not subject to election or to term limits. The U.S. Congress remains (since the [[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton|Thornton decision]] of 1995) without electoral limits.

=== President ===
The third president, [[Thomas Jefferson]], started the tradition of presidential term limits by refusing to run for a third term in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Korzi notes it is a mistake to credit George Washington. Michael J. Korzi, ''Presidential Term Limits in American History: Power, Principles, and Politics'' (2011) p 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything the first president did obviously set a precedent, but did not necessarily set a new policy. However George Washington's decision in 1796 not to run for a third term has sometimes been given credit as the start of a "tradition" of the strong policy that no president should ever run for a third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Dunn|title=1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election amid the Storm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZUniR1uQcUC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2013|publisher=Yale UP|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington wanted to retire when his first term ended in 1792 but all his advisors begged him to stand for reelection. By 1796 he insisted on retiring, for he felt worn out, and was disgusted with the virulent personal attacks on his integrity.  His [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] very briefly mentioned why he would not run for a third term, and goes on to give a great deal of political advice. But he does not mention of term limits .  After his death his refusal to run was explained in terms of a "no-third-tradition". Historian David Crocket argues, "The argument for term limits has a solid and respectable pedigree. Contrary to popular belief, however, that pedigree does not begin with George Washington."&lt;ref&gt;David A Crockett, "'An Excess of Refinement]: Lame Duck Presidents in Constitutional and Historical Context " Presidential Studies Quarterly 38 no4 707-21, quoting p. 710&lt;/ref&gt; 

Politically Washington felt the stability of the republic required a contested presidential election with a choice of candidates, which would not happen if he ran again. If he won and then died a vice president would take over who was not elected and his goal would fail.  (He in fact did die in 1799 two years into the new term). The election went forward and he was absolutely neutral between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. He personally did not feel bound by a two-term limit.  In the 1780s, about half the states provided term limits for governors. &lt;ref&gt; Michael J.  Korzi, "Changing Views of Executive Tenure in Early American History," ''White House Studies'' 8#3 (2009) pp 357-379 at p 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitutional convention of 1787 discussed the issue and decided not to do so.  "The matter was fairly discussed in the Convention," Washington wrote in 1788, "and to my full convictions ... I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the services of any man, who on some great emergency shall be deemed universally, most capable of serving the Public" even after serving two terms.   The Constitution, Washington explained, retained sufficient checks against political corruption and stagnant leadership without a presidential term limits provision. &lt;ref&gt; Bruce G. Peabody, "George Washington, Presidential Term Limits, and the Problem of Reluctant Political Leadership,"  ''Presidential Studies Quarterly''  31.3 (2001): 439-453, at p 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, however, strongly endorsed a policy of term limits. He rejected calls from supporters that he run for a third term in 1808, telling several state legislatures in 1807-1808 that he needed to support "the sound precedent set by [his] illustrious predecessor."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author=Jeremy D. Bailey|title=Thomas Jefferson and Executive Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWu7GGgkDJUC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2007|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Thomas Jefferson mentioned that Washington retired after serving only two terms, without mentioning that Washington opposed the policy Jefferson was proposing.  Crockett argues that Washington, "did not intentionally establish the so-called two-term tradition; his departure was motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the country could function without him and to retire to Mount Vernon. He made no principled argument for limiting presidents to two terms, and in fact disagreed with Thomas Jefferson on this point." &lt;ref&gt; Crockett, "'An Excess of Refinement]: Lame Duck Presidents in Constitutional and Historical Context " ''Presidential Studies Quarterly '' (2008) 38#4 pp 707-21 at p. 710&lt;/ref&gt;  The "two term tradition" was created in  1807-1808 and it mistakenly suggested Washington had launched the policy.  &lt;ref&gt; Peabody 2001. p 446-48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Theodore Roosevelt's third term political cartoon.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon showing Washington rejecting Theodore Roosevelt's highly controversial run for a third term in 1912]]

In 1861 the [[Confederate States of America]] adopted a six-year term for their president and vice-president and barred the president from seeking re-election. That innovation was endorsed by many American politicians after the  Civil War, most notably by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in his inaugural address.   Ulysses Grant was urged to run for a third term in 1876, but he refused. He did try for the 1880 nomination but was defeated in part because of anti-third-term sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy S. Truesdale, "Rochester Views the Third Term 1880." Rochester History 2.4 (1940): pp 1-20 [http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v2_1940/v2i4.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had already served over 7 years and in 1912, after a four-year hiatus, ran for a third term. He was violently criticized--indeed almost killed by [[John Flammang Schrank]], who was obsessed with stopping a third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim McNeese|title=The Progressive Movement: Advocating Social Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ4MHJohpOUC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (president, 1933–1945) in 1940 was the only president to break the tradition, winning a third term in 1940 and a fourth term in 1944.  This gave rise to a successful move to formalize the traditional two-term limit by amending the [[U.S. Constitution]]. As ratified in 1951, the [[Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-Second Amendment]] provides that "no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice".  The new Amendment explicitly did not apply to the incumbent, President [[Harry S. Truman]].  However all his close advisors, pointing to his age, his failing abilities, and his poor showing in the polls, talked him out of it. &lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby. ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995) pp 602-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congress ===
[[File:Letter from Senator Hatch regarding Congressional Term Limits.png|thumb|Letter from [[Orrin Hatch|Senator Orrin Hatch]], first elected in 1976, expressing reservations regarding term limits (dated February 10, 2011)]]
Reformers during the early 1990s used the initiative and referendum to put congressional term limits on the ballot in 24 states. Voters in eight of these states approved the congressional term limits by an average electoral margin of two to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Dana Priest |author2=William Claiborne |date=November 9, 1994 |title=Voters in Several States, D.C. Adopt Limits For Legislators |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/termlimits/stories/110994.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an open question whether states had the constitutional authority to enact these limits. In May 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in ''[[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]]'', {{Ussc|514|779|1995}}, that states cannot impose term limits upon their [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representatives]] or [[United States Senate|Senators]].

In the 1994 elections, part of the [[Contract With America|Republican platform]] included legislation for term limits in Congress. After winning the majority, a Republican congressman brought a constitutional amendment to the House floor that proposed limiting members of the Senate to two six-year terms and members of the House to six two-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|104|HJRES|73}}, 104th Congress&lt;/ref&gt; However, this rate of rotation was so slow (the life-tenured Supreme Court averages in the vicinity of twelve years) that the congressional version of term-limits garnered little support among the populist backers of term limits, including [[U.S. Term Limits]], the largest private organization pushing for congressional term limits.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Term Limits wanted House members to be limited to ''three'' two-year terms.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The bill got only a bare majority (227–204), falling short of the two-thirds majority (290) needed for constitutional amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/104-1995/h277 |title=H.J.Res. 73 (104th): Contract with America bill (On Passage of the Bill), House Vote #277 |date=March 29, 1995 |publisher=GovTrack.us |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other term limit amendment bills failed to get more than 200 votes.&lt;ref&gt;The four constitutional amendments on term limits which the House rejected 29 March 1995 were sponsored by: Democrat [[John Dingell]] [12/12 retroactive], rejected 135–297; Republican [[Bob Inglis]] [6/12, not retroactive], rejected 114–316; Republican [[Van Hilleary]] [12/12, unretroactive, but defers to more stringent state imposed limits], rejected 164–265; Republican [[Bill McCollum]] [12/12 not retroactive and would override more stringent state limits]; approved by less than the requisite 2/3, 227–204; on February 12, 1997 Congress did likewise by a margin of 217–211 [50.7%].&lt;/ref&gt;

Defeated in Congress and overridden by the Supreme Court, the federal term limit movement was brought to a halt. The term limits intended simultaneously to reform state legislatures (as distinguished from the federal congressional delegations) remain in force, however, in fifteen states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://termlimits.org/term-limits/state-term-limits/state-legislative-term-limits/ |title=State Legislative Term Limits |publisher=US Term Limits |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Pinney, George Serra, and Dalene Sprick, "The costs of reform: consequences of limiting legislative terms of service," ''Party Politics'', [http://ppq.sagepub.com/content/10/1/69.abstract  10:69–84]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[Larry J. Sabato]] revived the debate over term limits by arguing in ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'' that the success and popularity of term limits at the state level suggests that they should be adopted at the federal level as well. He specifically put forth the idea of congressional term limits and suggested a national [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] be used to accomplish the amendment, since the Congress would be unlikely to propose and adopt any amendment that limits its own power.

Some state legislators have also expressed their opinions on term limits. It is confirmed that in the following five states—and there may be others—state lawmakers approved resolutions asking Congress to propose a federal constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms which members of Congress may serve:

{{Citation style|section|date=February 2017}}
# [[South Dakota Legislature]] (designated as POM-42 in the U.S. Senate) approved in 1989, South Dakota House Joint Resolution No. 1001 (see ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of April 4, 1989, at pages 5395 and 5396, with verbatim text provided);
# [[Hawaii Senate]] (designated as Memorial 400 in the U.S. House of Representatives) approved in 1990, Hawaii Senate Resolution No. 41—unicameral only (see ''Congressional Record'' of September 28, 1998, at page 22655) it took 8 years for this resolution to find its way into the ''Congressional Record'' and to be ''correctly'' referred to the Committee on the Judiciary—and even then, its text was not provided in the ''Congressional Record''); back in 1990, Hawaii's S.R. No. 41 was indeed received by the U.S. House of Representatives, and was designated as Memorial 416, (''Congressional Record'' of June 6, 1990, at pages 13262 and 13263) but the resolution was ''erroneously'' referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce—and its text is NOT provided in the ''Congressional Record'';

# [[Idaho Legislature]] (designated as Memorial 401 in the U.S. House of Representatives) approved in 1992, Idaho Senate Joint Memorial No. 116 (see ''Congressional Record'' of April 29, 1992, at page 9804—text NOT provided in the ''Congressional Record''); and
# [[Florida Legislature]] (designated as POM-122 in the U.S. Senate) approved in 2012, Florida House Memorial No. 83 (see ''Congressional Record'' of July 25, 2012, at page S5378, with verbatim text provided).  Taking matters a bit further, on February 10, 2016, Florida lawmakers approved House Memorial No. 417 calling upon Congress, pursuant to Article V of the Federal Constitution, to assemble a Convention to prepare a constitutional amendment that would establish term limits upon members of Congress.

=== Supreme Court ===

Legal scholars have discussed whether or not to impose term limits on the Supreme Court of the United States. Currently, Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life "during good behavior". A sentiment has developed, among certain scholars, that the Supreme Court may not be accountable in a way that is most in line with the spirit of [[checks and balances]].&lt;ref name=Calebresi&gt;Steven G. Calebresi &amp; James Lindgren, "Term Limits for the Supreme Court: Life Tenure Reconsidered," Harvard Journal of Public Policy, Vol 29 no. 3 (2006) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=701121 "Social Science Research Network].&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, scholars have argued that life tenure has taken on a new meaning in a modern context.&lt;ref name="court2.0"&gt;Richard Brust, [http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/supreme_court_20/ "Supreme Court 2.0], ABA Connection, (October 1, 2008). Article provides an overview of proposed reforms to the Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in medical care have markedly raised life expectancy and therefore has allowed Justices to serve for longer than ever before.&lt;ref name="Calebresi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=court2.0 /&gt; Steven G. Calebresi and James Lindgren, professors of law at Northwestern University, argued that, because vacancies in the court are occurring with less frequency and justices served on average, between 1971 and 2006, for 26.1 years, the "efficacy of the democratic check that the appointment process provides on the Court's membership" is reduced.&lt;ref name="Calebresi" /&gt; There have been several similar proposals to implement term limits for the nation's highest court, including Professor of Law at [[Duke University]], Paul Carrington's 2005 "The Supreme Court Renewal Act of 2005".&lt;ref name=Carrington&gt;Julie Geng, [http://cornellsun.com/node/22645 "Law Prof Proposes Supreme Court Term Limits"], Cornell Sun Online (February 11, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the proposals center around a term limit for Justices that would be 18 years (Larry Sabato, Professor of Political Science at University of Virginia, suggested between 15 and 18 years).&lt;ref name="Calebresi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=court2.0 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrington" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sabato&gt;Larry J. Sabato, [http://cornellsun.com/node/22645 "Reforming the Least Democratic Branch"] (April 15, 1010).&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed staggered term limits of 18 years would, according to Calebresi, Lindgren (2006), and Carrington (2005), allow for a new appointment to the Court every two years, which in effect would allow every president at least two appointments.&lt;ref name=court2.0 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrington" /&gt; Professor Carrington has argued that such a measure would not require a constitutional amendment as the "Constitution doesn’t even mention life tenure; it merely requires that justices serve during ‘good behaviour’ ".&lt;ref name=court2.0 /&gt; The idea was not without support among Judges, as [[John Roberts]] supported term limits before he was appointed to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. Calebresi, Lingren, and Carrington have also proposed that when justices have served out their proposed 18-year term they should be able to sit on other Federal Courts until retirement, death, or removal.&lt;ref name="Calebresi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="court2.0" /&gt;

[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll measured American voters’ attitudes towards various proposed Supreme Court reforms, including implementing term limits. The 2010 poll found that a majority of Americans were largely unaware of a proposal to impose a term limit of 18 years, as 82% reported they had heard little or nothing at all.&lt;ref name="fdu"&gt;[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll, [http://www.publicmind.fdu.edu/courttv/final.pdf "Public Says Televising Court is Good for Democracy"] press release (March 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding a lack of awareness, 52% of Americans approved of limiting terms to 18 years, while 35% disapproved.&lt;ref name="fdu" /&gt; When asked how old is too old for a Supreme Court judge to serve if he or she seems healthy, 48% said "no limit as long as he or she is healthy", while 31% agreed that anyone over the age of 70 is too old.&lt;ref name="fdu" /&gt;

Some state lawmakers have officially expressed to Congress a desire for a federal constitutional amendment to limit terms of Supreme Court justices as well as of judges of federal courts below the Supreme Court level. While there might be others, below are three known examples:
# In 1957, the [[Alabama Legislature]] adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 47 on the subject (appearing in the U.S. Senate's portion of the ''Congressional Record'' on July 3, 1957, at page 10863, with full text provided);
# In 1978, the Tennessee General Assembly adopted House Joint Resolution No. 21 on the subject (designated as POM-612 by the U.S. Senate and quoted in full in the ''Congressional Record'' of April 25, 1978, at page 11437); and
# In 1998, the Louisiana House of Representatives adopted House Resolution No. 120 on the subject (designated as POM-511 by the U.S. Senate and quoted in full in the ''Congressional Record'' of July 17, 1998, at page 16076).

== State term limits ==
{{See also|Comparison of U.S. state governments}}
Term limits for state officials have existed since colonial times. The Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties of 1682, and the colonial frame of government of the same year, both authored by [[William Penn]], provided for triennial rotation of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Council|provincial council]]—the upper house of the colonial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Francis N. Thorpe, ed., ''The Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters, and other Organic Laws''..., 7 vols. (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1909) 5:3048, 3055–56, 3065.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Delaware Constitution of 1776]] limited the [[Governor of Delaware|governor]] to a single three-year term; currently, the governor of Delaware can serve two four-year terms.

At present, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023725/http://www.nga.org/files/pdf/BOS4-9.pdf 36 states] have term limits of various types for their governors. To circumvent the term limit in [[Alabama]] incumbent governor [[George Wallace]] pushed through the nomination of his wife [[Lurleen Wallace|Lurleen]], in the 1966 Democratic primary, which was, in those days, the real contest in Alabama. It was generally understood that Mrs. Wallace would only be a [[Titular ruler|titular]] governor while her husband continued to hold the real power. She won the election, but only served 16 months before dying in 1968.

As indicated above, in fifteen state legislatures the members serve in rotation, i.e., under term limits enacted during the reforms of the early 1990s. In another six states, however, state legislatures have either overturned their own limits or [[state supreme court]]s have ruled such limits unconstitutional. In 2002 the [[Idaho Legislature]] became the first legislature of its kind to repeal its own term limits, enacted by a public vote in 1994, ostensibly because it applied to local officials along with the legislature.

Governors of 36 states and four territories are subject to various term limits, while the governors of 14 states, [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.]], may serve an unlimited number of terms. Each state's gubernatorial term limits are prescribed by its [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]], with the exception of [[term limits in Wyoming|Wyoming]], whose limits are found in its statutes. Territorial term limits are prescribed by its constitution in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the [[Organic Act]]s in [[Guam]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and by statute in [[American Samoa]].

Unique in its restriction, Virginia prohibits its [[Governor of Virginia|governors]] from serving ''consecutive'' terms, although former governors are reeligible after four years out of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article5/section1/ |title=Constitution of Virginia |website=Virginia Constitution |pages=Article V, §&amp;nbsp;1 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other states formerly had this prohibition, but all had eliminated it by 2000.

The governors of [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] may serve unlimited two-year terms. The governors (or equivalent) in the following states, district, and territory may serve unlimited four-year terms: [[Governor of Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Governor of Idaho|Idaho]], [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois]], [[Governor of Iowa|Iowa]], [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Governor of New York|New York]], [[Governor of North Dakota|North Dakota]], [[Governor of Texas|Texas]], [[Governor of Utah|Utah]], [[Governor of Washington|Washington]], [[Governor of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]. The Governor of Utah was previously limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws have since been repealed by the legislature.

=== State legislatures with term limits ===
The following 15 legislatures have term limits:
* [[Arizona Legislature]]: four consecutive two-year terms for both houses (eight years). No limit on total number of terms.
* [[Arkansas General Assembly]]: sixteen years total in either the [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House]] or the [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]].

* [[California State Legislature]]: twelve years total in either [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] or [[California State Senate|Senate]]. (For legislators first elected on or before June 5, 2012, the previous limits (enacted in 1990) of either three two-year terms for [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] members (six years) and two four-year terms for [[California State Senate|Senate]] members (eight years) apply).

* [[Washington State Legislature]]: the [[Washington Supreme Court]] voided term limits in 1998.
* [[Wyoming Legislature]]: the [[Wyoming Supreme Court]] ruled term limits unconstitutional in 2004. ''See [[term limits in Wyoming]].''

== Municipal term limits ==
Some [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] have term limits. In [[Philadelphia]], the mayor cannot be elected three consecutive times, but there is no limit on how long any individual can serve as mayor. [[Frank Rizzo]] was elected mayor in 1971 and 1975; he attempted to repeal the term limit, but failed and could not run in 1979. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1983 but he lost to [[Wilson Goode]]. In 1986, he switched to the Republican Party, and ran as a Republican in the mayoral elections of 1987 and 1991.

Limits vary from city to city even within the same state. For example, [[Houston]], [[Texas]], has a limit of 2 four-year terms (prior to November 3, 2015, 3 two-year terms dating back to 1991), while [[San Antonio]], Texas, has a limit of 4 two-year terms. Both Houston and San Antonio's term limits are absolute; elected officeholders are ineligible to run for the same position where seeking higher office is common.

A two-term limit was imposed on [[New York City Council]] members and citywide elected officials (except for [[district attorney]]s) in [[New York City]] after a 1993 [[referendum]] (see the Charter of the City of New York, §&amp;nbsp;1138). On November 3, 2008, however, when [[Michael Bloomberg]] was in his second term of [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]], the City Council approved the extension of the two-term limit to a three-term limit; one year later, he was elected to a third term. The two-term limit was reinstated after a referendum in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/term_limits_will_land_on_city_ballot_678DP9Lc8B4gbfNFbXTKMN | work=New York Post | title=Term limits will land on city ballot in Nov | date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/nyregion/03limits.html | work=The New York Times | first=Javier C. | last=Hernandez | title=Term Limits in New York City Are Approved Again | date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Los Angeles]] the mayor serves up to two four-year terms since 1993, while the City Council serve up to three four-year terms.

In [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], the term limit for mayor is two successive four-year terms. Council members are limited to two successive four-year terms. There is no limit to total terms that may be served, just a limit on successive terms.

In [[New Orleans]], City Council members are limited to two four-year terms. However, a council member representing one of the five council districts may run for one of the two at-large seats on the council once they reach the two-term limit, and vice versa. There is no limit on the number of terms a council member may serve in a lifetime. Since 1954, the mayor of New Orleans has been limited to two consecutive four-year elected terms, but he or she may be elected again after sitting out one four-year term. When the new city plan of government was adopted, the mayor at the time, [[DeLesseps Story Morrison]], was exempt from term limits due to a grandfather clause.  

Under the original [[Consolidated city-county|Metropolitan Charter]] adopted in 1962, the mayor of Nashville was limited to three consecutive four-year terms, which was subsequently reduced to two consecutive four-year terms in 1991.  Councilors were likewise limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but subsequent court rulings have determined the offices of district councilor and at-large councilor to be separate offices even though all councilors serve together in one unicameral body, which has meant that at large councilors have continued in office as district members, and (more frequently) district councilors have been elected to subsequent terms as at large councilors.

'''The Nobel Peace Prize for Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution''' (憲法9条にノーベル平和賞を) is a social movement whose aim is to push for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to be awarded to the citizens of Japan for maintaining the country's post-war [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]], especially [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]].

==History==
The movement began with an undertaken by a member of the group's Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;「憲法9条にノーベル平和賞を　署名100万人を目指して「祈りの力」を結集」『Christian Today』2014.07.08 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 supporters again recommended for Nobel Peace Prize ''ASAHI'' Feb. 01 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Japan's Article 9 was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ''The Japan Times'' Oct 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Committee received endorsements from influential Japanese and gathered signatures from across the world. On April 9, 2014, they received a report from the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] that the committee had received the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;「「憲法9条をノーベル平和賞に」推薦受理　実行委に連絡」『朝日新聞』2014.04.11 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Article 9: will it be revised or get the Nobel Peace Prize? By Linus Hagström, ''Swedish Institute of International Affairs'' Jun 18 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2014, Hiroyuki Konishi, Yoshiko Kira and other Members of the Parliament ([[National Diet|Diet]]) of Japan announced that they had submitted the recommendation via the Norwegian Embassy. The supportive 60 Diet lawmakers came from 7 ruling parties, as well as opposition parties, indicating its cross-bench appeal.&lt;ref&gt;「憲法9条にノーベル平和賞を」『時事ドットコム』5th May 2014. {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2015, the Kobe branch's Executive Committee announced that they had submitted a similar recommendation, selecting political groups concerned with protecting the Peace Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;「憲法９条に平和賞を ノーベル委へ推薦状提出 神戸の団体」『神戸新聞』 February 21, 2015 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014–15==
[[Peace Research Institute Oslo|PRIO]] listed the movement as one of the leading candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;「ノーベル平和賞予測、「憲法９条保持する日本国民浮上」. 『朝日新聞』 (2014年10月4日) {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Research Institute misconstrued the {{nihongo|Japanese nation|日本国民||}} as a corporate name. The Nobel committee spokesperson said that it was not possible for the citizens of an entire nation to be awarded the prize. Therefore, the application was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;「"勘違いだった？「日本国民」にノーベル平和賞"」 『読売新聞』 (2014.12.16) {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo was concerned that [[Shinzō Abe]], Prime Minister of Japan, was trying to reinterpret Article 9 and that this could be a  precursor of armed confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Pacifist Constitution ''The New York Times'' May 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He nominated [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], a former Nobel laureate in literature, and the {{Nihongo|Nihon Hidankyo|[[:ja:日本原水爆被害者団体協議会|日本被団協]]||}}, the [[Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations]] for the Nobel Peace Prize list.&lt;ref&gt;「９条の平和賞、今年は４番手　ノーベル賞予想」『中日新聞』(2015.02.03) {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prio.org/About/PeacePrize/PRIO-Directors-Speculations-2015/ Nobel Peace Prize 2015: PRIO Director's Speculations. ''PRIO'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==
In response, on January 15, 2015, the group's Korean branch (일본 평화헌법9조 노벨평화상 추천 한국위원회) nominated the {{nihongo|Kyūjyō no kai|Article 9 Association|九条の会|}} and {{nihongo|Naomi Takasu|鷹巣直美||}} for the prize and dispatched testimonial letters and signatures of Korean citizens to the Norwegian Embassy in Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;「『日本の平和憲法９条ノーベル賞推薦委』ノルウェー大使館に署名渡す」『中央日報』(2015.1.15) {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Essay), the Peace Constitution Article 9 reasons to recommend the Nobel Peace Prize. ''JoongAng Ilbo'' 29.12.2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] included ''Kyūjyō no kai'' as one of the leading candidates (fourth place) for 2015 prize.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel Peace Prize watcher bets on Japan's war-renouncing Constitution. ''Kyodo News International'' October 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, many people engaged in supportive activities and collected signatures.&lt;ref&gt;「憲法9条にノーベル平和賞を　韓国でも署名運動開始」『朝日新聞』2014.12.18 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;日 헌법 9조에 평화상을" 한국에서도 서명운동 아사히 신문 December 19, 2014{{Ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 142 lawmakers, former Presidents and intellectuals supported the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/01/116_172262.html Lawmakers also backed the idea of having Japan's Article 9 Committee named as the Nobel Peace Prize nominee. ''The Korea Times'' 22 Jan. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea itself, there is fierce competition for the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;山本峯章2014『韓国人は、なぜノーベル賞を獲れないのか?―和の日本 恨の韓国』(ベストブック) {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed it is rare for Koreans to support the candidacy of foreigners, especially Japanese, for the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref&gt;「9条にノーベル賞を」署名活動の韓国人識者　暗殺者安重根の思想を受け継ぐ、とサイトで言明」『JCAST』2014.12.19 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi Buyoung (이부영 李富榮), who is promoting the signature campaign in Korea and also a past chairman of Yeolin [[Uri Party]] (열린우리당), said that this movement was triggered by the example of Japanese opposition party legislators going against the ruling party of Japan, e.g., [[Ichirō Ozawa]], the leader of {{Nihongo|[[Liberal Party (Japan, 2016)|People's Life Party, Yamamoto Tarō]]|[[:ja:生活の党と山本太郎となかまたち|生活の党と山本太郎となかまたち]]|Seikatsu no Tō to Yamamoto Tarō}} of Japan, and former Japanese Prime Minister {{Nihongo|[[Tomiichi Murayama]]'s|村山富一||}} attempt to get South Koreans to participate in signature-collecting drives in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese.joins.com/article/258/194258.html 韓国の各界５０人「日本の平和憲法、ノーベル平和賞候補に推薦」『中央日報』2014.12.19] {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2014, [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] (강원도, 江原道), a local government of South Korea, decided to award the "Korean DMZ Peace Prize" to the group.&lt;ref&gt;「「９条にノーベル賞」活動が　韓国の平和賞受賞へ」『東京新聞』2014-12-6 ３１面 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncc-j.org/uploads/photos/185.pdf Article 9 and Global Peace Transcending nationalism The 4th Global Inter-religious Conference on Article 9 of the Japanese Peace Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Conservatives, including {{nihongo|Miki Otaka|[[:ja:大高未貴|大高未貴]]||}}, a Japanese journalist, claimed that a hidden motive behind the movement is to prevent amendments to the Japanese Constitution by anti-Japanese foreign powers as well as domestic anti-government forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8emFFsmN8sE&amp;spfreload=10 大高未貴【魔都見聞録】左翼のダブスタ、韓国の言論弾圧と憲法九条のノーベル賞工作（チャンネル桜H26/10/13）]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey of 188 constitutions across the world made by {{nihongo|Osamu Nishi|[[:ja:西修|西修]]||}}, an emeritus professor at [[Komazawa University]], 158 (84%) of these constitutions also contain a peace clause (平和条項). For this reason, according to him, the statement that the Japanese Constitution is the world's only pacifist constitution is incorrect. He also claims that articles that renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation as means of settling international disputes are explicitly stated in the constitutions of [[Italy]] and [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;「ノーベル平和賞　「９条」推薦は"護憲派"の企み」『産経新聞』2014.10.27 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;西修2002「日本国憲法は世界で唯一の平和主義憲法ではない--平和主義条項の国際比較」『祖国と青年』 284:31-8 {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1785">'''The Study of Administration''' is an 1887 article by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[Political Science Quarterly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Woodrow |year=1887 |title=The Study of Administration |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=197–222 |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=465 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is widely considered a foundational article in the field of [[public administration]], making Wilson one of the field's founding fathers, along with [[Max Weber]] and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Hood2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hood|title=The Art of the State: Culture, Rhetoric, and Public Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns7wTyXuw5sC|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=30 March 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-829765-9|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although colleges were already teaching [[Public administration|administration]] in the 1880s, it was considered a sub-field of [[political science]].  Wilson argued that it should be treated as its own field of study, with public administrators being directly responsible to political leaders.  He believed that politicians should be accountable to the people and that political administration should be treated as a science, and its practitioners given authority to address issues in their respective fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woodrow Wilson on Administration | url = http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration | accessdate = 2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">The '''Treaty on Political Asylum and Refuge''' is a [[multilateral treaty|multi-party treaty]] regarding [[political asylum]] and [[refugee law]].  It was signed in [[Montevideo]] on 4 August 1939 and entered into force on 29 December 1954.

The treaty builds upon the [[Treaty on International Penal Law]], adopted by the [[First South American Congress on Private International Law]] in Montevideo on 23 January 1889, incorporating doctrines already accepted due to situations which had occurred since between 1889 and 1939.

==Military precedents==
===1804: Haitian Revolution===
Black Haitian slaves expelled by force the [[French people|French]] from French Saint Domingue.

''For more information see: [[Haitian Revolution]]''

===1804: Haiti massacre of white Haitians===
Self-declared [[First_Empire_of_Haiti|Emperor]] [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] decrees that all Haitian whites (women and children included) should be eliminated without exceptions. This was a separate action from French military whites (which were already expelled) and was specifically aimed at the remaining local white civilian population. The act was carried out between February and April 1804. Fears of a genocide similar to the Haitian Massacre of 1804 were explicitly referred in the Confederate discourse during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin C Julius, ''The Abolitionist Decade, 1829-1838: A Year-by-Year History of Early Events in the Antislavery Movement''; MacFarland and Company; 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===1805: Siege on the city Santo Domingo===
In February 1805, Haitian forces, under [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], invaded from the southern route in opposition of French-led approved [[slave raiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Lester D. |title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution, 1750-1850 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdonn8ck3nwC|year=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300077262|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to overpower the Spanish-French defense, and intimidated by the arrival of a French fleet in support of Borgella in Santo Domingo, the army of Dessalines along with [[Henri Christophe]] raided through the interior Dominican towns [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Moca, Espaillat|Moca]], while [[Alexandre Pétion]] invaded [[Azua (city)|Azua]].&lt;ref name="Ricourt2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ricourt|first=Milagros |title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzJ9DQAAQBAJ|date=2016-11-18|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813584507|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Domínguez2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.diariolibre.com/opinion/el-degello-de-moca-CIDL552671 |title=Opinión: El Degüello de Moca |work=Diario Libre |date=2014-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220160528/http://www.diariolibre.com/opinion/2014/04/03/i552671_degello-moca.html |archive-date=2014-12-20 |dead-url=no |last=Domínguez |first=Ángel |language=es |location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his retreat from Santo Domingo, Dessalines arrived in Santiago on 12 April 1805.

===1806: Struggle to unite the South and North of Haiti===
Dessalines was assassinated, an act which was instigated by his own generals Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. Afterward, both Christophe and Pétion failed to agree to on who was going to be the next [[President_for_Life#List_of_leaders_who_became_President_for_Life|leader-for-life]] (a title created by Dessalines himself), so they went separate ways: Christophe took the North of Haiti (which he named "Kingdome of Haiti"), while Pétion got for himself the South part of Haiti (the newly created "Republic of Haiti"); and immediately they started a series of wars to overtake the other's side. The internal military conflicts lasted until 1820 when Haitian president [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] finally unified both the South and North of Haiti. After this, Boyer aimed his sights on the struggling Spanish-side of the island.

''For further reading see: [[History_of_Haiti#The_struggle_for_unity_(1806–20)|The struggle for unity (1806–20)]]''

Upon unification of both French-side (Haitï) and Spanish-side (Dominican Republic) nations under the Haitian flag, Boyer divided the island into six departments, that were subdivided into ''arrondissements'' (administrative districts) and communes. The departments established in the west were, Nord, Ouest, Sud, and Artibonite, while the east was divided into Ozama and Cibao.&lt;ref name="Coupeau"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tA-XfYZFNvkC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ozama+and+Cibao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0tOq_qebTAhWJ2YMKHZD1D1wQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Ozama%20and%20Cibao&amp;f=false |title=The History of Haiti |editor=Coupeau, Steeve |year=2008 |pages=51–52 |isbn=9780313340895 |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and suppress traditional customs. There was also a resurgence of the decades-old rivalries between the governing Haitian elite ([[mulatto Haitians|mulattoes]]) and the masses of the black population, most notably throughout the western end.

==Background==
By the late 18th century, the island of [[Hispaniola]] had been divided into two European colonies: [[Saint-Domingue]], in the west, governed by [[France]]; and [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], governed by [[Spain]], occupying the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola.

===First unification under the French===
{{main|Era de Francia}}
During the second half of the eighteenth century the French side of the island quickly developed into the most prosperous plantation colony of the New World. French Saint-Domingue was dubbed the ''Pearl of the Antilles'', as a result of the sugar plantations worked by [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]]; sugar had become an indispensable commodity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/45.htm |title=Haiti: Growth and Structure of the Economy |editor=Haggerty, Richard A. |year=1989 |edition=Haiti: A Country Study |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Peace of Basel]] of 22 July 1795, Spain ceded its two-third of the island to France in exchange for the return of the province of [[Guipuzcoa]] occupied by the French since 1793. Although Hispaniola was now unified under a single administration, it proved difficult for the French to consolidate their rule since their part of the island had been experiencing uprisings by [[Free people of color|elite mulattos]] and [[Freedman|black freedman]]  since 1791, and in 1804 the leader of the Haitian revolution, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], [[Haitian Revolution|declared Haiti's independence]]. Independence did not come easily, given the fact that Haiti had been France's most profitable colony.

By 1795, the eastern side, what was once the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|headquarters]] of Spanish colonial power in the [[New World]] had long fallen into decline. The economy was stalled, the land largely unexploited and used for [[Subsistence agriculture|sustenance farming]] and [[cattle ranching]], and the population was much lower than in Haiti. The accounts by the Dominican essayist and politician [[José Núñez de Cáceres]] cite the Spanish colony's population at around 80,000, mainly composed of [[White Dominicans|European]] descendants, mulattos, freedmen, and a few black slaves. Haiti, on the other hand, was nearing a million former slaves.

While the French had lost their former colony of Saint-Dominque by 1804, the French commander of the former Spanish side had been able to repulse the attacks of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, but in 1808 the people revolted and the following year, with the help of a British squadron, ended French control of the city of Santo Domingo. Spanish rule was [[España Boba|reestablished]]. However, this short period under which the whole of Hispaniola was ''de jure'' under French rule was to be the chief justification of the freed Haitians in their quest to reunite the island under their rule.

===Independence from Spain===
On 9 November 1821 the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was toppled by a group led by [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], the colony's former administrator,&lt;ref name="allempires"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lancer | first=Jalisco | title=The Conflict Between Haiti and the Dominican Republic  | publisher=All Empires Online History Community | url=http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=conflict_haiti_dominican | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043043/http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=conflict_haiti_dominican | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2018-04-13 | accessdate = 2007-12-24 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flag"&gt;{{cite web | title=Haiti - Historical Flags | work=Flags of the World | url=https://flagspot.net/flags/ht-hist.html | accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rebels proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on 1 December 1821.&lt;ref name="africana"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gates | first=Henry Louis |author2=Appiah, Anthony  | title=Dominican-Haitian Relations | work=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience | year=1999 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE-N8hh-VNQC&amp;pg=PA617&amp;lpg=PA617&amp;dq=spanish+haiti&amp;source=web&amp;ots=K8EfPYcsI4&amp;sig=iMgEI31tSdkdtfcURxRZKAaYyh0#PPA617,M1  | accessdate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new nation was known as '''Republic of Spanish Haiti''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República del Haití Español''), as ''Haiti'' had been the indigenous name of the island.&lt;ref name="flag" /&gt; On 1 December 1821 a constitutive act was ordered to petition the union of Spanish Haiti with [[Gran Colombia]].

===Prelude to the unification===
[[File:Traité France Haïti 1825.jpg|thumb|right| [[Épinal print]] showing [[Ange René Armand, baron de Mackau|Mackau]] forcing [[Jean-Pierre Boyer|Boyer]] to agree to pay 150 million francs to compensate French planters.]]
A group of Dominican politicians and military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], and were attracted to Haiti's perceived wealth and power at the time. A large faction based in the northern [[Cibao]] region were opposed to the union with Gran Colombia and also sided with Haiti. Boyer, on the other hand, had several objectives in the island that he proclaimed to be "one and indivisible": to maintain Haitian independence against potential French or Spanish attack or reconquest and to maintain the freedom of its former slaves.&lt;ref name="africana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Counterpoint"&gt;{{cite book | last=Matibag | first=Eugenio | title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola | year=2003 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EswJ7t1B0XgC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=spanish+haiti&amp;source=web&amp;ots=E2d1AIn61c&amp;sig=C5SCyMsNCv85VwcU9Jekcvr94cY#PPA96,M1  | accessdate = 2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite web | last=Corbett | first=Bob | title=1818-1843 The rule of Jean-Pierre Boyer | work=The History of Haiti | url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/108.html | accessdate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franco/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

While appeasing the Dominican frontier officers, Jean-Pierre Boyer was already in negotiations with France to prevent an attack by fourteen French warships stationed near [[Port-au-Prince]], the Haitian capital. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession to the French, and agreed to pay France 150 million gold francs destined to compensated the former French slave owners. Thus, Haiti would essentially be forced into paying reparations for its freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/13/does-france-owe-haiti-reparations/ |title=Is it time for France to pay its real debt to Haiti? |editor=Tharoor, Ishaan |date=11 May 2015 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominican nationalists who were against the unification of the island were at a serious disadvantage if they were to maintain their nation's sovereignty. At the time, they had an untrained infantry force. The population was eight to ten times less than Haiti's, and the economy was stalled. Haiti, on the other hand, had formidable armed forces, both in skill and sheer size, which had been hardened in nearly ten years of repelling French [[Grande Armée|Napoleonic soldiers]], and British soldiers, along with the local colonialists, and military insurgents within the country. The racial massacres perpetrated in the later days of the French–Haitian conflict only added to the determination of Haitians to never lose a battle.

==Invasion of Dominican Republic==
After promising his full support to several Dominican frontier governors and securing their allegiance{{citation_needed|date=July 2018}}, Boyer ceremoniously [[Invasion|marched into the country]] with 12,000 soldiers in February 1822, against a significantly smaller, untrained army serving some 70,000 Dominican souls (Haiti had a population around 600,000 people), encountering little to no opposition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.diariolibre.com/especiales/dia-independencia/para-saber-mas-BJ9092399&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February  1822, Boyer formally entered the capital city, Santo Domingo after its ephemeral independence, where he was received by president [[José Núñez de Cáceres]] who offered to him the keys of the Palace; Boyer decorously declined the offer by quoting: ''"I have not come into this city as a conqueror but by the will of its inhabitants"''.&lt;ref name=Franco&gt;{{cite book |last=Franco Pichardo|first=Franklin J.|title=Historia del Pueblo Dominicano |edition=8th |year=2009 |publisher=Ediciones Taller |authorlink=Franklin Franco |pages=175–178 |location=Santo Domingo |accessdate=31 May 2014 |language=Spanish |chapter='''Capítulo XVIII:''' Período de Integración con Haití |quote=La actividad de los agentes haitianos, más los pronunciamentos de los pueblos de la zona Norte y de otras en la zona fronteriza, en favor de la unidad con Haití, y los constantes rumores sobre la entrada a la colonia del ejército de Boyer,...  (...) El 15 de diciembre, Andrés Amarante, comandante de Dajabón, comunicó al presidente Boyer que la bandera de Haití había sido enarbolada en aquella ciudad y cinco días después, una junta popular organizada en Santiago denunció la obra de Núñez de Cáceres como "antisocial", llamando en su auxilio a Boyer. (...) En Haití, donde el movimiento unionista de los pueblos del Cibao Central y fronterizos había sido recibido calurosamente, el movimiento independentista de Núñez de Cáceres no encontró simpatía. Por ello, el periódico La Concordia "gazeta del gobierno de Haití" (...) censura la proclamación de la independencia de Núñez de Cáceres, cuestionando la confederación del nuevo Estado con Colombia. El periódico resaltaba que la confederación debió hacerse con Haití pues a su entender era "la confederación legítima preparada por la naturaleza"... (...) Boyer salió de Puerto Príncipe a finales de enero con su ejército que se dividió en dos partes: una que cruzó la frontera por el Norte y otra por el Sur, y el día 9 de febrero de 1822 hizo su entrada a la ciudad de Santo Domingo, donde luego de los actos de recibimiento oficiales de rigor que encabezó el Dr.&amp;nbsp;Núñez de Cáceres, que envolvieron un tedéum en la Catedral y la entrega de la llave de la ciudad, que no quiso aceptar expresando «que no había entrado en ella como conquistador sino por la voluntad de sus habitantes»; poco después, en acto público solemne efectuado en la plaza principal, tomó su primera ejecutoria como Gobernador del territorio antiguamente español, proclamando la abolición de la esclavitud.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was thus united from "Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana in possession of one government."&lt;ref name="africana" /&gt;

==Occupation==
[[File:Map of Hayti Island (1839).jpg|thumb|right|Map of the island of Haiti (1839)]]
In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of “scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.” (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.

Haiti's constitution also forbade white elites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (these two being [[Spanish Empire|Spanish possessions]] at the time) or [[Gran Colombia]], usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. [[Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo's university]], the oldest in the [[Western Hemisphere]], lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of [[human capital flight]].

Although the occupation instated a constitution modeled after the [[United States Constitution]] throughout the island, and led to the abolition of slavery as an institution in what became known as the [[Dominican Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xd1WCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=haiti+boyer+ends+slavery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIxYWzoqS8yAIViVg-Ch1v5gEK#v=onepage&amp;q=haiti%20boyer%20ends%20slavery&amp;f=false |title=Haiti: State Against Nation |page=48 |author=Trouillot, Michel-Rolph |year=1990 |isbn=9780853457558 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9owdkOc0wgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=haiti+boyer+ends+slavery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIxYWzoqS8yAIViVg-Ch1v5gEK#v=onepage&amp;q=haiti%20boyer%20ends%20slavery&amp;f=false |title=The Haitian Revolution and Its Effects |page=43 |author=Bryan, Patrick E. |year=1984 |isbn=0435983016 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in Haiti|forms of slavery]] persisted in Haitian society.&lt;ref name="Coupeau"/&gt; Several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens as [[Jean-Pierre Boyer|Boyer]] had done with the Haitian peasantry under the aforementioned ''Code Rural'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbFhCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;dq=code+rural+haiti+restriction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pQt6Dwhf5E&amp;sig=0JztX-MAYm76SGbizJH9I0w5A7Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCGoVChMI4YWQ2fC8yAIVSDU-Ch0vlw3l#v=onepage&amp;q=code%20rural%20haiti%20restriction&amp;f=false |title=Peasants and Poverty (Routledge Revivals): A Study of Haiti |page=350 |editor=Lundahl, Mats |year=2015 |isbn=9781317593911}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises.

===Resistance===
[[File:Trinitarios.jpeg|thumb|right|La Trinitaria meeting.]]
In 1838 a group of educated nationalists, among them, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], [[Matías Ramón Mella]], and [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] founded a secret society called ''[[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]]'' to gain independence from Haiti. The ''Trinitarios'' took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. The ''Trinitarios'' won the loyalty of two Haitian regiments made up of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo. They rose up on 27 January 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivière-Hérard|Charles Hérard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. Known as "The Reform" (''La Reforma''), the rebellious Dominicans seized the capital, Santo Domingo, on 24 March in the name of Hérard. The movement soon discarded its pretext of support for Hérard and now championed Dominican independence. In the meantime, Hérard overthrew Boyer and marched against Santo Domingo in order to resubjugate the Dominicans. Hérard entered the capital on 12 July executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped.

Upon returning to Haiti, Hérard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in the continuing racial strife between those two elements within Haiti. The two regiments of Dominicans were among those used by Hérard to suppress the uprising. Their loyal participation convinced Hérard that the Dominican troublemakers had been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving members of the ''La Trinitaria'', now led by [[Tomás Bobadilla]], planned another uprising. Once again, the conspirators persuaded the two Dominican-manned regiments to participate. On 27 February 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle-rancher from [[El Seibo]] who commanded a private army of [[peon]]s who worked on his estates. Over the next decade, the Haitians conducted military campaigns against the newly formed Dominican Republic.

The Haitian military campaigns involved more than 40,000 Haitian soldiers against 15,000 Dominicans.&lt;ref name=Figueredo&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of the Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their numerical superiority, the Haitian forces were not supported by their compatriots, who feared that the cost of the conflict would drain the national economy. Furthermore, internal divisions prevented a succession of Haiti's presidents from forming a united front against the rebellious Dominicans.&lt;ref name=Figueredo/&gt;

==Dominican Fight for Independence (1844)==

''For further reading: [[Dominican_War_of_Independence|Dominican War of Independence]]''

In February 1844 a group of Dominican independence fighters moved to restore their freedom from military-enforced Haitian rule in the Spanish-speaking two-thirds of the island. Called the [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|''La Trinitaria'']] ("The Trinity"), this organization was composed of Spanish Creoles, mulattoes, and blacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led by [[Juan_Pablo_Duarte|Juan Pablo Duarte]], [[Francisco_del_Rosario_Sánchez|Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Matías_Ramón_Mella|Matías Ramón Mella]].&lt;ref name=Rout&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rout|first1=Leslie B.|title=The African Experience in Spanish America|date=July 30, 1976|publisher=CUP Archive|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence was proclaimed in the city of [[Santo Domingo]] on 27 February 1844, but on the following day a group of ex-slaves led by Santiago Basora, announced its opposition to the independentists.&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; These men suspected that the rebels intended to reintroduce slavery; if this was true, the blacks were ready to fight alongside the Haitians.&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; ''Trinitaria'' leaders realized the explosive nature of this situation and moved rapidly to defuse it. The very next day, 28 February provisional President [[Tomás Bobadilla]] and Vice-President [[Manuel Jimenes]] conferred with Basora and his supporters, and on the following day slavery was again declared abolished.&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; The war to expel Haiti from Dominican soil was a great success: This was the last time ever Haiti would dominate the Dominican nation.

==Aftermath==
For the next ten years, Dominican [[Caudillo|military strongmen]] fought to preserve their country's independence from their Haitian neighbors. In March 1844, a 30,000-strong two-pronged attack was successfully repelled in both north and south. Four years later, it took a Dominican flotilla harassing Haitian coastal villages, land reinforcements in the south, and a British and French naval blockade to force the determined [[Faustin Soulouque|Haitian Emperor]] into a one-year truce. In the most thorough and intense encounter of all, Dominican irregulars armed with [[machete]]s sent Haitian troops into flight on all three fronts in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Knight|editor1-first=Franklin W.|editor2-last=Palmer|editor2-first=Colin A.|title=The Modern Caribbean|date=2014|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century later, the Dominican despot Rafael Trujillo revived the old hatreds between the Hispaniolan neighbors by a sudden [[Parsley massacre|ruthless massacre]] of up to 40,000 Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |title=Louder Than Bombs: Interviews from the Progressive Magazine |date=2004 |publisher=South End Press |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWQkIPrIAAsC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant military internal power struggles (constantly warring for over 50 years) would deteriorate Haiti's mighty military forces of 1805 to crippling levels, transforming itself into a local repression force at the service of a series of dictators and military warlords well into the 20th century.

In 1995 democratically-elected President [[Jean Bertrand Aristide]] disbanded the military forces, after he was overthrown by force in 1991. The local security was eventually handed over to [[United_Nations|United Nations']] [[United_Nations_Stabilisation_Mission_in_Haiti|UNSTAMIH]] (French: ''MIUSTAH''), from 2004 to 2017.

In 2017, president [[Jovenel Moïse]] proposed restoring their military forces that have been disbanded for over 22 years.

{{Distinguish|text=the FDA [[Adverse Event Reporting System]] or [[MedWatch]]}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2013}}
The '''Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System''' ('''VAERS''') is a United States program for [[vaccine]] safety, co-managed by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). VAERS is a [[postmarketing surveillance]] program, collecting information about [[adverse event]]s (possible harmful [[side effect]]s) that occur after administration of vaccines to ascertain whether the [[risk–benefit ratio]] is high enough to justify continued use of any particular vaccine.

VAERS, the [[Vaccine Safety Datalink]], and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA [[measurement|measure]] vaccine safety&lt;ref name="CDC_Vaccine_Safety"&gt;{{Citation |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Vaccine Safety Monitoring at CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html |accessdate=2015-03-11 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fulfill their duty as [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] charged with protecting the public. Some scientists would like to do a more scientifically rigorous job of this, noting that VAERS has several limitations, including [[wikt:verify#Verb|unverified]] reports, [[underreporting]], inconsistent [[data quality]], and absence of an unvaccinated [[treatment and control groups|control group]].&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt;

==Origins==
The program is an outgrowth of the 1986 [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] (NCVIA), which requires health care providers to report: 
*Any event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine. 
*Any event listed in the Reportable Events Table that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. The data are stored electronically by the CDC in the [[Vaccine Safety Datalink]] (VSD).

VAERS was established in 1990, and is managed jointly by the FDA and the CDC.&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt; It is meant to act as a sort of "early warning system"—a way for physicians and researchers to identify possible unforeseen reactions or side effects of vaccination for further study.

==Operation==
Each year the VAERS receives 10,000–20,000 reports of adverse events following immunization by more than 10 million vaccines.&lt;ref name="VAERS Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=VAERS Data|url=https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index|publisher=VAERS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Higher-priority uses of the data include reports of death and other serious adverse events, recognizing and detecting adverse effects, and finding unexpected adverse events involving new vaccines. The VAERS data are also used to monitor known reactions to vaccines and for vaccine lot surveillance. [[Data mining]] techniques such as [[empirical Bayes]] methods can be used to improve the quality of data analysis.&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woo EJ, Ball R, Burwen DR, Braun MM |title= Effects of stratification on data mining in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) |journal= Drug Saf |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=667–74 |year=2008 |pmid=18636785 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200831080-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Like other spontaneous reporting systems, VAERS has several limitations, including underreporting, unverified reports, inconsistent data quality, absence of a control group that is not vaccinated, and inadequate data about the number of people vaccinated. Indeed, an autism activist named [[Jim Laidler]] once reported to VAERS that a vaccine had turned him into [[The Incredible Hulk]]. The report was accepted and entered into the database, but the dubious nature thereof prompted a VAERS representative to contact Mr. Laidler, who then gave his consent to delete the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism | title=Chelation and Autism | work=Neurodiversity Blog | date=July 27, 2005 | accessdate=October 8, 2013 | author=Laidler, James R.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419004549/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism|archivedate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI_42_6_Hall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet |authorlink1=Harriet Hall |title=Diving into the VAERS Dumpster: Fake News about Vaccine Injuries |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=28-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in research and litigation==
Many medical researchers make use of VAERS to study the effects of vaccination. VAERS warns researchers using its database that the data should not be used in isolation to draw conclusions about cause and effect.&lt;ref name="VAERS Data"/&gt; Nonetheless, data from VAERS has been used in vaccine litigation to support the claim that vaccines cause autism.

Litigation related to vaccines and autism has led to an increase in VAERS reports filed by plaintiff's attorneys. A 2006 article in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' found that most VAERS reports related to [[thimerosal]], and many related to [[autism]], were filed in connection with litigation, leading the authors to caution that inappropriate reliance on VAERS data may be a source of bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2006 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=387–90 |title= Vaccine adverse event reporting system reporting source: a possible source of bias in longitudinal studies |vauthors=Goodman MJ, Nordin J |pmid=16452357 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/2/387 |doi= 10.1542/peds.2004-2687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study's lead author stated: "Lawyers are manipulating this system to show increases [in vaccine-related adverse events] that are based on litigation, not health research."&lt;ref name="offit"&gt;{{cite book| author= Offit PA | title = [[Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure]] | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-231-14636-4 | location = New York | authorlink = Paul Offit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Offit]], chief of infectious disease at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Public health officials were disappointed to learn that reports of autism to VAERS weren't coming from parents, doctors, nurses, or nurse practitioners; they were coming from personal-injury lawyers... For the lawyers, VAERS reports hadn't been a self-fulfilling prophecy; they'd been a self-generated prophecy.&lt;ref name="offit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Standard Chinese]] word '''''xuanchuan''''' "dissemination; propaganda; publicity" originally meant "to announce or convey information" during the 3rd-century [[Three Kingdoms]] period, and was chosen to translate Russian ''propagánda'' {{linktext|пропаганда}} in the 20th-century [[People's Republic of China]], adopting the [[Marxist-Leninist]] concept of a "[[transmission belt]]" for indoctrination and mass mobilization (Shambaugh 2007: 26). ''Xuanchuan'' is the keyword for [[propaganda in the People's Republic of China]] and [[propaganda in the Republic of China]].

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''xuanchuan'' compounds ''xuan'' {{linktext|宣}} "declare; proclaim; announce" and ''chuan'' {{linktext|傳}} or {{linktext|传}} "pass (on); hand down; impart; teach; spread; infect; be contagious" (DeFrancis 2003: 1087, 124).

Numerous common Chinese words are based upon ''xuanchuan'', such as: ''xuānchuánpǐn'' 宣傳品 "propaganda/publicity material", ''xuānchuánduì'' 宣傳隊 "propaganda team", ''xuānchuánhuà'' 宣傳畫 "[[Poster#Propaganda and political posters|propaganda poster]]", ''xuānchuándān'' 宣傳單 "propaganda slips/sheets", ''xuānchuángǔdòng'' 宣傳鼓動 "[[agitprop]]", and ''xuānchuán diànyǐng'' 宣傳電影 "[[propaganda film]]".

In [[lexicographic]] terminology, a [[bilingual dictionary]] provides "[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|translation equivalents]]" (rather than "definitions") between the [[Source language (translation)|source]] and [[Target language (translation)|target languages]]. Sometimes words have complete equivalents, such as translating French ''[[wikt:chien|chien]]'' as English ''[[wikt:dog|dog]]''; but other times have partial or alternative equivalents, such as translating French ''[[wikt:veau|veau]]'' as either the animal ''[[wikt:calf|calf]]'' or the meat ''[[wikt:veal|veal]]'' (Svensén 1993: 143-157). English ''propaganda'' and ''publicity'' are alternative equivalents for Chinese ''xuanchuan''. The [[classical Chinese]] word ''qing'' [[wikt:青|青]] "green; blue; black", representing the [[distinction of blue and green in various languages]], is a better known example of Chinese-English alternative translations. Compare the color range across collocations like ''qīngcài'' 青菜 "green vegetables; greens", ''qīngjīn'' 青筋 "blue veins", ''qīngtiān'' 青天 "azure sky", ''qīngbù'' 青布 "black cloth", or ''qīngkèmǎ'' 青騍馬 "gray mare".

Translation equivalents of ''xuanchuan'' in major [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese.E2.80.93English dictionaries|Chinese-English dictionaries]] include:
*"to declare; propaganda" (Mathews 1943: 431)
*"propaganda; to carry on propaganda (for)" (Chao and Yang 1947: 61)
*"propagate; propagandize; publicize; propaganda (work, bureau, etc.)" (Lin 1972: 687)
*"conduct propaganda; propagate; disseminate; give publicity to" (Wu 1979: 782)
*"propagate; disseminate; propagandize; give publicity to; publicize" (Ding 1985: 1162)
*"to publicize; to promote; propaganda; promotion" (Liang and Chang 1992: 322)
*"publicize; propagate; advocated; advertise; preach; blaze sth. abroad [about]; whoop" (Wu 1993: 2886)
*"propagate; disseminate; give publicity to" (DeFrancis 2003: 1087)
Thus, the most frequent English lexicographical translations of ''xuanchuan'' are {{linktext|propaganda}}, {{linktext|propagate}}, {{linktext|publicize}}, {{linktext|disseminate}}, {{linktext|give publicity}}, and {{linktext|propagandize}}.

Many languages besides English have different words to distinguish "propaganda" and "publicity", for instance, German ''[[wikt:Propaganda|Propaganda]]'' and ''[[wikt:Werbung|Werbung]]'', or Russian ''propagánda'' ''[[wikt:пропага́нда|пропага́нда]]'' and ''rekláma'' ''[[wikt:рекла́ма|рекла́ма]]''. Few languages besides Chinese have one [[polysemous]] word; excluding [[Sinoxenic]] loanwords from Chinese such as Japanese ''senden'' [[wikt:宣伝|宣伝]] "propaganda; advertisement; publicity", one example is Irish ''[[wikt:bolscaireacht|bolscaireacht]]'' "publicity; propaganda; claptrap''.

==Historical usages==
The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' is a historical dictionary that gives chronologically arranged usage examples, comparable with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The ''xuanchuan'' entry gives three meanings (tr. Edney 2014: 22): ''xuānbù chuándá'' 宣布传达 "to announce or convey information", ''xiàng rén jiạ̌ngjiě shuōmíng'' 向人讲解说明, 进行教育, ''jìnxíng jiàoyù'' 进行教育 " to explain something to someone, or to conduct education", and ''chuánbō'' 传播, ''xuānyáng'' 宣扬 "to disseminate or publicize".

First, the meaning of "to announce or convey information" was originally recorded in the historian [[Chen Shou]]'s (3rd century) ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in contexts of transmitting (esp. military) orders. For example, the biography of [[Shu Han]] dynasty General [[Ma Zhong (Shu Han)]] (d. 249) records that after defeating rebels in [[Nanyue]], he was appointed General Who Pacifies the South and ordered back to the capital in [[Chengdu]]. "In 242, when [Ma Zhong] was returning to court, upon reaching [[Hanzhong]], he went to see Grand Marshall [[Jiang Wan]], who conveyed an imperial decree that he was also appointed General in Chief of Zhennan Circuit [in modern [[Nanchang]], [[Jiangxi]]]." Later usage examples are cited from historian [[Li Baiyao]] (564–647), poet Cao Tang 曹唐 (fl. 860-874), and scholar Wang Mingqing 王明清 (1163-1224).

Second, the ''xuanchuan'' meaning of "to explain something to someone, or to conduct education" first appeared in [[Ge Hong]]'s (c. 320) ''[[Baopuzi]]'' criticism of effete scholars who [[Emperor Zhang of Han]] (r. 75-88) extravagantly rewarded.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These various gentlemen were heaped with honors, but not because they could breach walls or fight in the fields, break through an enemy's lines and extend frontiers, fall ill and resign office, pray for a plan of confederation and give the credit to others, or possess a zeal transcending all bounds. Merely because they expounded an interpretation [''xuanchuan''] of one solitary classic, such were the honors lavished upon them. And they were only lecturing upon words bequeathed by the dead. Despite their own high positions, emperors and kings deigned to serve these teachers. (tr. Ware 1966: 231) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Subsequent usages are quotes from monk-translator Pukong 不空 or [[Amoghavajra]]  (705–774), poet [[Wang Yucheng]] (954–1001), novelist [[Ba Jin]] (1904-2005), and [[Mao Zedong]] (1893-1976). Mao's (1957) "The speech for the Chinese Communist party National Propaganda Work Meeting" (tr. Leung 1992: 379) says, "Our comrades who are engaged in propaganda work have the task of disseminating Marxism. This is a gradual [task of] propaganda and should be done well, so that people are willing to accept it."

Third, the modern ''xuanchuan'' meaning of "to disseminate or publicize" occurred in [[Lao She]]'s (1937) ''Camel Xiangzi'' or ''[[Rickshaw Boy]]'' (tr. Goldblatt 2010: 48), "As promised, Old Man Liu told no one of Xiangzi’s experiences [selling stolen wartime camels for 30 ''[[Chinese yuan|yuan]]''], but the camel story quickly spread from Haidian into the city." The ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' gives two other usage examples from novels by [[Zhao Shuli]] (1906-1970).

The ''[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]'' (2001) entry for the Japanese word ''senden'' 宣伝 differentiates three meanings and notes their earliest recorded usages: "Convey a statement, transmit widely" (述べ伝えること. ひろく伝えること.; c. 758-797 ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]''); "Explain to people the existence or effect of a thing, principle, policy, etc., seeking their understanding. Or such movement or activity. Propaganda" (ある物の存在や効能または主義主張などを人々に説明し, 理解を求めること. また, その運動や活動. プロパガンダ.; 1924, [[Kanson Arahata]]'s ''Entering Russia''); and "Spread a rumor that is unrealistic or exaggerated" (事実以上に大げさに言いふらすこと.; 1930 [[Riichi Yokomitsu]]'s ''[[Machine (novel)|Machine]]'').

==Propaganda and publicity==
Whether ''xuanchuan'' is translated as either ''propaganda'' or ''propagandize'' versus  ''publicity'' or  ''publicize'' depends upon the Chinese collocation and context, and the English [[Connotation (semiotics)|semiotic connotations]]. For English and Chinese translation equivalent examples, ''political propaganda'' and ''zhèngzhì xuānchuán'' 政治宣传 are usually pejorative, but ''public health propaganda'' and ''gōnggòng wèishēng xuānchuán'' 公共卫生宣传 are not.

Some ''xuanchuan'' collocations customarily refer to "propaganda" (e.g., ''xuānchuánzhàn'' 宣传战 "propaganda war"), others to "publicity" (''chǎnpǐn xuānchuán'' 產品宣传 "product promotion"), and still others can ambiguously refer to either (''xuānchuányuán'' 宣传员 "propagandist; publicist").

''Xuanchuan'' contexts can vary from covert [[black propaganda]] (such as [[astroturfing]]) that misrepresents its source to overt [[white propaganda]] (such as a [[public service announcement]]) that truthfully states its source. Chinese contexts determine the word's semantic connotations. For instance, the term ''Gòngchạ̌ndǎng de xuānchuán'' 共产党的宣传 "[[Communist propaganda]]" generally has positive connotations in [[Chinese Communist Party]] usage but negative ones in [[Kuomintang]] usage. In official CCP discourse, ''xuanchuan'' "propaganda" has a neutral or positive connotation, but in informal usage, the word often has a pejorative connotation (Edney 2014: 22, 195). For instance, in 2009 a group of Chinese academics and lawyers called for a boycott of the major [[China Central Television]] network and sarcastically said the program ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' "Network News" should be called ''Xuanchuan Lianbo'' "Propaganda News" (Edney 2014: 195, Chen 2009).

[[David Shambaugh]] (2007: 29), the scholar of Chinese politics and foreign policy, describes "proactive propaganda" in which the Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Department writes and disseminates information that it believes "''should'' be used in educating and shaping society". In this particular context, ''xuanchuan'' "does ''not'' carry negative connotations for the CCP, nor, for that matter, for most Chinese citizens." The sinologist and anthropologist Andrew B. Kipnis (1995: 119) says unlike English ''propaganda'', Chinese ''xuanchuan'' is officially represented as language that is good for the nation as a whole. "Although no American government would describe its own declarations as propaganda, the CCP is proud of its ''xuanchuan''."

''Propaganda'' and ''publicity'' have undergone considerable diachronic change in meaning. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''propaganda'' was first recorded in 1718, referring to the Latin title ''Congregatio de Propaganda Fide'' "[[Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]]" "a committee of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church having the care and oversight of foreign missions". The religious meaning was extended to "any association, systematic scheme, or concerted movement for the propagation of a particular doctrine or practice" in 1790, and specialized to "the systematic propagation of information or ideas by an interested party, esp. in a tendentious way in order to encourage or instill a particular attitude or response" in 1908. The linguist [[Adrian Room]] (1991: 216) suggests that the "bad" sense of ''propaganda'' emerged on the political scene in the United States. ''Publicity'' was first used to mean "the quality of being public; the condition or fact of being open to public observation or knowledge" in 1791, and subsequently specified to "public notice; the action or fact of making someone or something publicly known; the business of promotion or advertising; an action or object intended to attract public notice; material issued to publicize".

Most standard English dictionary definitions of ''propaganda'' note the word's negative connotations; either through explanation "ideas or statements that are often false or exaggerated and that are spread in order to help a cause, a political leader, a government, etc." ([[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] 1993), or through a usage note "The systematic dissemination of doctrine, rumour, or selected information to propagate or promote a particular doctrine, view, practice, etc.; ideas, information, etc. disseminated thus (frequently ''derogatory'')" ([[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] 1993).

In contrast, standard Chinese-Chinese dictionary definitions of ''xuanchuan'' (see the ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' above) neither mention that the term can have a pejorative connotation nor highlight any connection between the act of propagandizing and the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the information that is being disseminated (Edney 2014: 22).

As China’s involvement in world affairs grew in the late 20th century, the CCP became sensitive to the negative connotations of the English word ''propaganda'', and the commonly used Chinese term ''xuanchuan'' acquired pejorative connotations (MacKinnon 1997: 4). In 1992, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] asked one of the CCP's most senior translators to come up with a better English alternative to ''propaganda'' as the translation of ''xuanchuan'' for propaganda targeting foreign audiences (Schoenhals 2008: 125). Replacement English translations include ''publicity'', ''information'', and ''political communication'' domestically (Brady 2009: 73), or ''media diplomacy'' and ''cultural exchange'' internationally (Edney 2014: 24).

CCPPD officials left the ''xuanchuan'' in official Chinese names the same but changed the English translations from "Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China" to "Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China" (Shambaugh 2007: 47), and changed "Central Propaganda Department" to "Central Publicity Department" (Hassid 2007: 415). English-languages sources rarely use either "Publicity Department" translation. The ''Zhōngyāng Xuānchuán Sīxiǎng Lǐngdǎo Xiǎozǔ'', which oversees the CCPPD, continues to be translated as the "[[Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideological Work]]".

When [[Ding Guan'gen]], director of the CCP Central Propaganda Department from 1992 to 2002, traveled abroad on official visits, he was known as the [[Minister of Information]] (Chen et al. 2002: 287).

==Slezkine's theory of ethnic identity==
{{Main|Middleman minority}}
Slezkine characterizes the [[Jew]]s  (alongside other groups  such as the [[Armenia]]ns and [[Overseas Chinese]]) as a [[Mercury (mythology)|''Mercurian'']] people  "specializ[ing] exclusively in providing services to the surrounding food-producing societies," which he characterizes as "[[Apollo (mythology)|Apollonians]]". This division is, according to him, recurring in pre-20th century societies. With the exception of the Gypsies, these "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurian]] peoples" have all enjoyed great socioeconomic success relative to the average among their hosts, and have all, without exception, attracted hostility and resentment. A recurring pattern of the relationship between Apollonians and Mercurian people is that the social representation of each group by the other is symmetrical, for instance Mercurians see Apollonians  as brutes while Apollonians  see Mercurians as effeminate. Mercurians develop a culture of "purity" and "national myths" to cultivate their separation from the Apollonians, which allows them to provide international services (intermediaries, diplomacy) or services that are taboo for the local Apollonian culture (linked to death, magic, sexuality or banking). Slezkine develops this thesis by arguing that the Jews, the most successful of these Mercurian peoples, have increasingly influenced the course and nature of Western societies, particularly during the early and middle periods of Soviet [[Communism]], and that modernity can be seen as a transformation of Apollonians into Mercurians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n06/sheila-fitzpatrick/i-sailed-away-with-a-mighty-push-never-to-return|title=I sailed away with a mighty push, never to return|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Sheila|date=2005-03-17|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2018-06-04|pages=3–7|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/chosen-people/|title=The Chosen People|last=Lazare|first=Daniel|date=2005-11-30|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
