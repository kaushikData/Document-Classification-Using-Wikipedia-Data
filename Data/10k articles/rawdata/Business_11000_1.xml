[[File:63 Nassau Street from south.jpg|thumb|right|200px|(2013)]]

'''63 Nassau Street''' is a landmark building located on [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] between [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton]] and [[John Street (Manhattan)|John Street]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was built in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] c.1844, and had its [[cast-iron architecture|cast-iron]] facade, attributed to [[James Bogardus]], added in 1857-59, making it one of the first cast-iron buildings in the city.  The attribution to Bogardus, a pioneer in the architectural use of cast iron, comes because of medallions of [[Benjamin Franklin]] identical to those on four other Bogardus projects, all now demolished. George Washington was also once represented with medallions.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is an extremely rare extant example of the work of Bogardus, one of only five known Bogardus buildings in the United States. The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] on May 15, 2007.
 
==Structural detail==
The 5-story, 3-bay Italianate style cast-iron front facade was originally composed of superimposed arcades, with a 2-story arcade capped by an intermediate modillioned foliate cornice, surmounted by a 3-story arcade. The arcades are formed by elongated fluted [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[column]]s (most of the capitals’ leaves are now missing); rope moldings, which also surround the spandrel panels; molded arches with faceted keystones and molded paneled reveals; and foliate spandrels. The ground floor was first altered in 1919.

Between the second and third floors the building featured a series of wreath-encircled portraits of [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] cast, like the rest of the facade, in iron.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gayle, Margot. ''Cast Iron Architecture in America''. New York: Dover Books, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The two portraits of Washington are missing from the facade as of 2008.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Christopher Grey|Grey, Christopher]] "Cast-iron builder, Iron-clad renown" ''[[The New York Times]]'' (September 21, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar portraits once appeared on two other Bogardus buildings, the [[Baltimore Sun]] building in Baltimore, Maryland, and the New York building of [[Harper &amp; Brothers]]. Both of those buildings have been torn down.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The facade is terminated by a widely projecting, modillioned foliate cornice supported by a corbel table. Windows were originally two-over-two double-hung wood sash. These were replaced by wood casement windows with transoms prior to 1928 on the upper three stories, and by single-pane windows on the second story during the 1980s. The northern storefront consists of a deeply recessed entrance with glass door and transom, flanking show windows set above recessed bases, and a mosaic tile floor. A metallic signage band extends partially into the second story. The southern metal-and-glass storefront is non-historic, with a fixed awning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/63nassaustreet.pdf "NYCLPC Designation Report"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avo Uvezian''' (March 22, 1926 in [[Beirut]], [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Lebanon]] – March 24, 2017) was an [[Armenian-American]] [[jazz]] pianist and [[cigar]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/avo-uvezian-91-dies-19311|title=Avo Uvezian, 91, Dies|last=Mottola|first=Gregory|date= 24 March 2017| work=Cigar Aficionado|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://armenianweekly.com/2017/03/24/avo-uvezian-legendary-armenian-american-jazz-pianist-and-cigar-manufacturer-dies-at-91/ |title=Avo Uvezian, Legendary Armenian-American Jazz Pianist and Cigar Manufacturer, Dies at 91 |date=24 March 2017 |work=The Armenian Weekly |access-date=12 July 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Avo Uvezian was born to a family of musicians. His mother was a singer,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} while his father was a composer and conductor for a symphony orchestra. His parents' experience with music allowed him to develop his talents as a young man. 

==Career==

Uvezian joined a jazz trio called the Lebanon Boys. They received a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Baghdad]] where they stayed for one year. After this, they signed a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Iran]]. While there, Avo received an invitation from [[Shah Reza Pahlavi]] to perform at his palace. In an interview with [[Cigar Aficionado]], Avo described this point in his career:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/avo-uvezian-the-man-in-the-white-suit-7486 |title=Avo Uvezian: The Man in the White Suit |last=Suckling |first=James |website=Cigar Aficionado |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I spoke [[Persian language|Farsi]], so it sort of broke the ice with the Shah. I remember they were trying to dance the jitterbug and I said, 'You don't know how to dance that right. Let me show you.' We were invited back for two or three more events and finally, I became the Shah's pianist. The hotel didn't care since the Shah owned it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a year of performing in Iran, the Shah arranged for Avo to travel to the [[United States of America]] in 1947. While living in New York, Avo played for multiple bands while studying classical piano and composition at the [[Juilliard School]].

Uvezian was drafted during the [[Korean War]] and sent to Fort Dix in New Jersey where he was put through infantry training. After impressing his officers with his musical talents, Uvezian was taken out of the Infantry and put into band training. When he arrived in Korea, the band would play at an Officers Club where they got paid twenty dollars a night. Uvezian was honorably discharged in 1952.

After being discharged, Uvezian spent the next few years working with his father-in-law designing jewelry. This eventually brought him to Puerto Rico where he was paid to perform at the Palmas Del Mar resort.

===Songwriting===

Uvezian claimed to have written the music for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song ''[[Strangers in the Night]]'', even though the song is credited to [[Bert Kaempfert]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/nyregion/a-manhattan-theft-rooted-in-a-tale-of-songwriting-sinatra-and-cigars.html |title=A Manhattan Theft Rooted in a Tale of Songwriting, Sinatra and Cigars |last=Wilson |first=Michael |date=27 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was living in New York, a friend who knew Frank Sintatra set up a meeting to discuss one of his melodies. Somebody else had lyrics to it under the name "Broken Guitar". While Sinatra liked the melody, he asked for the lyrics to be altered. Sinatra recorded the song in 1966.  However, before Sinatra heard the music, Uvezian had sent it to Kaempfert, for it to be published in Germany. While he is not officially credited for the song, Uvezian stated that Kaempfert himself had given him credit for its creation, including in a written letter.

===Cigars===
In 1983, when Avo's daughter Karyn was born, he went to [[Switzerland]] for her christening. Avo had a [[Cuban cigar]] after the meal and was not happy with the price.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; His friend mentioned that they should make their own. Uvezian traveled to the Dominican Republic, where he searched for two years for a satisfactory production facility. Avo finally met Hendrik Kelner, and after smoking samples, Avo offered Kelner twenty-five percent more than he had originally offered. His presumption was that paying Kelner more would ensure that Avo cigars would receive the best tobacco. [[Michael Roux]] advised Avo to use attractive packaging. In the first year, 120,000 Avo cigars were sold. By the third year, Avo sold over 750,000 cigars. In 1995, [[Davidoff]] paid Avo Uvezian an estimated $10 million for the rights to distribute his cigars. In 1996, more than two million Avo cigars were sold.

==Personal life== 

Avo met his wife, Marie Sahakian, while performing at a New York resort in the Catskill Mountains in 1951. They had three children: Jeffrey, Robert, and Ronny.

{{Economic anthropology}}

In [[trade]], '''barter''' (derived from ''baretor''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=119|year=1855|issue=8|pages=109-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a system of [[Exchange (economics) | exchange]] where participants in a [[financial transaction | transaction]] directly exchange [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = O'Sullivan |first = Arthur |author2= Steven M. Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year= 2003 |page= 243 |isbn= 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economist]]s distinguish barter from [[Gift economy|gift economies]] in many ways; barter, for example, features immediate [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocal exchange]], not delayed in time. Barter usually takes place on a [[Bilateral trade|bilateral]] basis, but may be [[Multilateral exchange|multilateral]] (i.e., mediated through a [[trade exchange]]). In most [[developed countries]], barter usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Market actors use barter as a replacement for money as the method of exchange in times of [[monetary crisis]], such as when [[currency]] becomes unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or a [[Deflation#Deflationary spiral|deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting [[commerce]].

Economists since the times of [[Adam Smith]] (1723-1790), looking at non-specific [[pre-modern societies]] as examples, have used the [[inefficiency]] of barter to explain the emergence of money, of "the" [[economy]], and hence of the discipline of [[economics]] itself.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41"&gt;{{cite book|author= [[David Graeber]]|title= Debt: the first 5,000 years|year= 2011|publisher= Melville House|location= New York|pages= 21–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[ethnographic]] studies have shown that no present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, nor have anthropologists found evidence that money emerged from barter, instead finding that gift-giving (credit extended on a personal basis with an inter-personal balance maintained over the long term) was the most usual means of exchange of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;

==Economic theory==
{{Economic systems sidebar}}

===Adam Smith on the origin of money===
[[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economics, sought to demonstrate that [[Market (economics)|markets]] (and economies) pre-existed the state, and hence should be free of government regulation{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the "double coincidence of wants" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41" /&gt;

Barter is characterized in Adam Smith's "''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''" by a disparaging vocabulary: "higgling, haggling, swapping, dickering." It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or "selfish profiteering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have argued, in contrast, "that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit.&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=48|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Mauss, author of '[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]', argued that the first economic contracts were to ''not'' act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of reciprocity and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], not barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday exchange relations  in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5,000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Since direct barter does not require payment in money, it can be utilized when money is in short supply, when there is little information about the credit worthiness of trade partners, or when there is a lack of trust between those trading.

Barter is an option to those who cannot afford to store their small supply of wealth in money, especially in [[hyperinflation]] situations where money devalues quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|pages=66–7|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===

The limitations of barter are often explained in terms of its inefficiencies in facilitating exchange in comparison to money.

It is said that barter is 'inefficient' because:

;There needs to be a 'double coincidence of wants'
: For barter to occur between two parties, both parties need to have what the other wants.
;There is no common measure of value
: In a monetary economy, money plays the role of a measure of value of all goods, so their values can be assessed against each other; this role may be absent in a barter economy.
;Indivisibility of certain goods
: If a person wants to buy a certain amount of another's goods, but only has for payment one indivisible unit of another good which is worth more than what the person wants to obtain, a barter transaction cannot occur.
;Lack of standards for deferred payments
: This is related to the absence of a common measure of value, although if the debt is denominated in units of the good that will eventually be used in payment, it is not a problem.
;Difficulty in storing wealth
: If a society relies exclusively on perishable goods, storing wealth for the future may be impractical.  However, some barter economies rely on durable goods like sheep or cattle for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright and Vincenzo Quadrini. Money and Banking.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON302-1.3.pdf Chapter 3, Section 1: Of Love, Money, and Transactional Efficiency] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Silent trade===
{{Main article|Silent trade}}
[[File:Olaus Magnus - On Trade Without Using Money.jpg|thumb|Scandinavian and Russian traders bartering their wares. [[Olaus Magnus]], 1555]]
Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "silent trade". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter ("dumb" here used in its old meaning of "mute"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the [[Trobriand Islands]], Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is "an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Bloch|first=J. Parry|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Times of monetary crisis===

As Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this would be during the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], when Venezuelans resorted to bartering as a result of hyperinflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-barter/fish-for-flour-barter-is-the-new-currency-in-collapsing-venezuela-idUSKBN1JT1UM?il=0|title=Fish for flour?

[[File:Trade with indians 1820.jpg|thumb|White traders bartering with the Indians c. 1820]]
Economic historian Karl Polanyi has argued that where barter is widespread, and cash supplies limited, barter is aided by the use of credit, brokerage, and money as a unit of account (i.e. used to price items). All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and Market in Early Empires|year=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, Illinois|page=14|author=Polanyi, Karl|authorlink=Marketless Trading in Hammurabi's Time|editor=Polanyi, Karl|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.

Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.

Throughout the 18th century, retailers began to abandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures, for both the aristocracy and the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Utopian socialism ====
{{Main article|Utopian socialism}}
[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]]. Scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' by [[Josiah Warren]] (1846)]]

The Owenite socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a "theory of equitable exchange" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed "schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an [[I.O.U.|IOU]] circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.

An alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an "exchange bazaar" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note. The British Association for Promoting Cooperative Knowledge established an "equitable labour exchange" in 1830. This was expanded as the National Equitable Labour Exchange in 1832 on Grays Inn Road in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|pages=202–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts became the basis of the British cooperative movement of the 1840s. In 1848, the [[socialist]] and first self-designated [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] postulated a system of ''time chits''.  In 1875, [[Karl Marx]] wrote of "Labor Certificates" (''Arbeitszertifikaten'') in his [[Critique of the Gotha Program]] of a "certificate from society that [the labourer] has furnished such and such an amount of labour", which can be used to draw "from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/subject/japan/tsushima/labor-certificates.htm Tadayuki Tsushima, Understanding “Labor Certificates” on the Basis of the Theory of Value, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twentieth century experiments====
{{main article|Time banking}}
The first exchange system was the Swiss [[WIR Bank]]. It was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929. "WIR" is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring (economic circle) and the word for "we" in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community.&lt;ref name="reinventingmoney.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=60 Years WIR Business Circle Cooperative -Origins and Ideology | work=WIR Magazine (September 1994) | url=http://www.reinventingmoney.com/wirbusiness.php | accessdate=9 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017101214/http://www.reinventingmoney.com/wirbusiness.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain (particularly the [[Catalonia]] region) there is a growing number of exchange markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These barter markets or swap meets work without money. Participants bring things they do not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of another participant. Swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/barcelonas-barter-markets-an-antidote-to-overconsumption/ Barcelona's barter markets] (from faircompanies.com. Accessed 2009-06-29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Linton originated the term "local exchange trading system" ([[LETS]]) in 1983 and for a time ran the [[Comox Valley, British Columbia|Comox Valley]] LETSystems in [[Courtenay, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ashevillelets.org/wiki/What_is_LETS%3F "What is LETS?". AshevilleLETS. Retrieved December 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; LETS networks use [[interest]]-free [[community-based economics|local]] [[credit (accounting)|credit]] so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.

====Modern developments====
According to the [[International Reciprocal Trade Association]], the industry trade body, more than 450,000 businesses transacted $10 billion globally in 2008 – and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1931665,00.html?xid=rss-topstories TIMES], nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that over 450,000 businesses in the United States were involved in barter exchange activities in 2010. There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local [[barter exchange]]. There are two industry groups in the United States, the [http://www.natebarter.com National Association of Trade Exchanges] (NATE) and the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade. NATE's currency is the known as the BANC and IRTA's currency is called Universal Currency (UC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Central Barter|url=http://www.grandcentralbarter.com|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, barter continues to thrive. The largest b2b barter exchange is [[Tradebank]], founded in 1987. P2P bartering has seen a renaissance in major Canadian cities through Bunz - built as a network of Facebook groups that went on to become a stand-alone bartering based app in January 2016. Within the first year, Bunz accumulated over 75,000 users&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-24/maybe-mark-zuckerberg-should-listen-to-these-canadian-hipsters|title=Facebook Is Trying To Build a Successful Online Marketplace. Here’s How One Group Did.|date=2016-10-24|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 200 cities worldwide.

In the United States, the largest barter exchange and corporate trade group is [[International Monetary Systems]], founded in 1985, now with representation in various countries.

In Australia and New Zealand the largest barter exchange is [[Bartercard]], founded in 1991, with offices in the United Kingdom, United States, Cyprus, UAE and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bartercard International|url=http://www.bartercard.com.au/bartercard_international.html|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corporation|Corporate]] barter focuses on larger transactions, which is different from a traditional, retail oriented barter exchange.  Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a "trade-credit".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the "client" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Soviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called "barter trade", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international [[clearing account]], avoiding the use of hard cash.

==Tax implications==
In the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]]. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an [[op-ed]] for ''The New York Times'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=437–440}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]]. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, "The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, though, do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.

==Recent developments==

Since the 1830s, barter in some [[western world | western]] [[market economies]] has been aided by exchanges which use alternative currencies based on the [[labour theory of value]], and which are intended to prevent [[profit taking | profit-taking]] by [[intermediary | intermediaries]]. Examples include the [[Owenite]] socialists, the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Cincinnati Time store]], and more recently{{when?|date=June 2018}} [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] ([[time banking]]) and the [[Local exchange trading system | LETS system]].

'''''Capitalism II''''' ({{zh|s=金融帝国II|t=金融帝國II|p=Jīn Róng Dì Guó II}}) is the [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] sequel to the original ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]''. It was created by [[Enlight Software|Enlight]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] in 2001.

[[File:Capitalism 2.PNG|thumb|left|''Capitalism II'' in-game.]]
The player creates and controls a business empire. This in-depth strategy game covers almost every aspect of business that could be encountered in the real world, including marketing, manufacturing, purchasing, importing and retailing. It has two new campaigns (Capitalist Campaign and Entrepreneur Campaign) plus an in-depth tutorial.

The gameplay is very similar to the original version. One noticeable difference from ''Capitalism'' I is that there are fewer products derived from agricultural resources.

''Capitalism II'' will run on modern versions of Microsoft Windows whereas the previous versions would not.

''Capitalism II'' has also been ported to Mac OS X by [[Virtual Programming]].

A new expanded version of ''Capitalism II'', called ''Capitalism Lab'', was released on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1144#p5117&lt;/ref&gt; ''Capitalism Lab'' has many new features, improvements and a new concept of challenge games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''contractual term''' is "Any provision forming part of a contract".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Martin, E |editor2=Law, J |title=Oxford Dictionary of Law |edition=6th |year=2006 |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each term gives rise to a [[contract]]ual [[Law of obligations|obligation]], [[Breach of contract|breach]] of which can give rise to [[lawsuit|litigation]]. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.

==Classification of term==

===Condition or Warranty===
Conditions are terms that go to the very root of a contract. Breach of a condition will entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd |year=1938 |court=HCA |num=66 |parallelcite=(1938) 61 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 286 |courtname=auto}}; see also {{cite AustLII |litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |year=1951 |court=HCA |num=24 |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A warranty&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with a product warranty, which is always referred to as a 'guarantee' in [[law]].&lt;/ref&gt; is less imperative than a condition, so the contract will survive a breach. Breach of either a condition or a warranty will give rise to [[damages]].

It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract. By way of illustration, an actress's obligation to perform the opening night of a [[theatre|theatrical]] production is a condition,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Poussard v Spiers and Pond]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 410.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a singer's obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876) 1 QBD 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statute]] may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty. For example, the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979|''Sale of Goods Act'' 1979]] (UK) s15A&lt;ref&gt;As added by the ''Sale of Goods Act'' 1994 (UK) s4(1).&lt;/ref&gt; provides that terms as to title, description, quality, and sample (as described in the [[Act of Parliament|Act]]) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances.

===Innominate term===
[[Lord Diplock]], in ''[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] |year=1961 |court=EWCA |num=7 |parallelcite=[1962] 1 All ER 474 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the concept of an innominate term, breach of which may or may not go to the root of the contract depending upon the nature of the breach. Breach of these terms, as with all terms, will give rise to damages. Whether or not it repudiates the contract depends upon whether [[legal benefit]] of the contract has been removed from the innocent party. Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorizing into condition or warranty due to [[legal certainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]], [[The Mihalis Angelos]] |year=1970 |court=EWCA |num=4 |parallelcite=[1970] 3 All ER 125 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in ''[[Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v Hansen-Tangen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v Hansen-Tangen'' [1976] 3 All ER 570&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforceability ==
In general, parties can only sue for enforcement of valid contractual terms as opposed to representations or mere puffs.

===Statements===
Only certain statements create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types:
* '''Puff (sales talk):''' If no [[reasonable person]] hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in contract is available if the statement proves to be wrong. It may also be referred to as "puffery". This is common in [[television commercial]]s.
* '''Representation:''' A representation is a statement of fact which does not amount to a term of the contract but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee the truth of. This gives rise to no contractual obligation but may amount to a [[tort]], for example [[misrepresentation]].
* '''Term:''' A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement therefore giving rise to a contractual obligation. For the purposes of Breach of Contract, a term may further be categorized as a condition, warranty or innominate term.

===Determination of nature of a statement===
There are various factors that a [[court]] may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include:
* '''Timing''': If the contract was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the contract. Lapse of a week within the negotiations of a [[car]] sale was held to amount only to a representation in ''Routledge v McKay''&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=Routledge v McKay |year=1954 |court=EWCA |num=8 |parallelcite=[1954] 1 All ER 855 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Content of statement''': It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement.
* '''Knowledge and expertise''': In ''[[Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |num=5 |parallelcite=[1957] 1 WLR 370 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a person selling a [[car]] to a [[second-hand]] [[car]] dealer stated, as per a document received when he bought it, that it was a 1948 [[Morris Motors|Morris]], when it transpired it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement. In ''[[Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd]]'' a dealer sold a car stating it had done 20,000 miles since an engine refit; the true figure was about 100,000. It was held this was a term. The dealer "was in a position to know, or at least to find out, the history of the car. He could get it by writing to the makers. He did not do so. Indeed it was done later. When the history of this car was examined, his statement turned out to be quite wrong. He ought to have known better. There was no reasonable foundation for it."
* '''Reduction into Writing''': Where the contract is consolidated into writing, previous spoken terms, omitted from the consolidation, will probably be relegated to representations.&lt;ref name=Routledge /&gt; The case of ''Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd.'' (1956) &lt;ref&gt;''Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd'' (1956) 16 EG 396&lt;/ref&gt; provided that a very important spoken term may persist even if omitted from the written consolidation; this case concerned the quality of workmanship in the construction of a house.

The [[parol evidence rule]] limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract. This rule has practically ceased operation under [[UK]] law,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but remains functional in Australian Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd |year=2004 |court=HCA |num=55 |parallelcite=(2005) 218 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 471 |pinpoint=[33] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implied terms==
{{See also|Implied terms in English law}}
A term may either be expressed or implied. An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.

===Terms implied in fact===
The [[Privy Council]] established a five-stage test in ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]] |year=1977 |court=UKPC |num=13 |format=1 |parallelcite=(1977) 180 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 266 |courtname=auto |juris=Victoria}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the English Court of Appeal sounded a note of caution with regard to the ''BP'' case in ''Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd'' in which the Master of the Rolls described the test as "almost misleading" in its simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;''Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd'' [1995] EMLR 472 at 481.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Reasonableness and equitableness:''' The implied term must be reasonable and equitable. In ''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'',&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=(1988)%2015%20NSWLR%20130 (1988) 15 NSWLR 130] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; it was held a term that imposes a significant detriment or burden on the other party is unlikely to be equitable.
# '''Business efficacy:''' The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the contract to operate better, that does not fit this criterion. This is the principle laid out in ''[[The Moorcock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding [[judge]] created a quaint concept of an ''officious bystander''; if the ''officious bystander'' were to propose a term and both the parties would be likely to reply with a testy "oh, of course", the term is implied.
# '''Obviousness:''' The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in ''[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1982|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken. In [[English law]], this principle was established in the case of ''Spring v NASDS'',&lt;ref&gt;''Spring v NASDS'' [1956] 1 WLR 585.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a [[trade union]] membership contract.
# '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required.
# '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term.

The [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that the test in ''BP'' applies only to [[formal contract]]s.  In the case of an [[informal contract]], where the parties have not attempted to stipulate the full terms, the courts should imply a term upon referring to the imputed intention of the parties, provided that the particular term is necessary for the effective operation of the contract.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Hawkins v Clayton |year=1988 |court=HCA |num=15 |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 539 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd |year=1995 |court=HCA |num=24 |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 410 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In implying terms in an informal contract, the High Court has suggested that a flexible approach is required.&lt;ref name=Hawkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne /&gt; In a case where it is apparent that the parties have not attempted to spell out the full terms of their contract, the court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intentions of the parties if, but only if, it can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case.&lt;ref name=Hawkins /&gt; Obviousness also remains an important element in implying a term in an informal contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd |year=1995 |court=HCA |num=24 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 410 at p. 446 per McHugh &amp; Gummow JJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms implied in law===
These are terms that have been implied into standardized relationships.

====Common law====

*''Liverpool City Council v Irwin''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Liverpool City Council v Irwin]] |year=1976 |court=UKHL |num=1 |parallelcite=[1976] 2 WLR 562 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established a term to be implied into all contracts between tenant and landlord that the landlord is obliged to keep the common areas in a reasonable state of repair.
*''Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd |year=1995 |court=UKPC |num=42 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1995] 4 All ER 745 |pinpoint= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established that when a tour operator contracts to provide services, a term is implied that those services will be performed with reasonable duty and care.

====Statutory====

The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects. Most [[Country|countries]], for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each [[U.S. state|American state]] except [[Louisiana]] has adopted Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.&lt;ref&gt;For links and comparison among states on the adoption of the UCC, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/ucc.html Cornell Law Uniform Laws].&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[legislation]] implying terms under [[United Kingdom]] law are the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]] and the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]] which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided.

===Terms implied by custom or trade===
One is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable.&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frigaliment Importing Co., Ltd., v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp.'', 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by "chicken") and U.C.C. § 1-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course of dealing===
If two parties have regularly conducted business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each contract made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In ''Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd]] |year=1971 |court=EWCA |num=12 |parallelcite=[1972] QB 71 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balmain New Ferry"&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|83|1906|litigants=[[Balmain New Ferry Co Ltd v Robertson]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/83.pdf (1906) 4 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 379] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=18 December 1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt; four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In ''[[British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd]] |year=1973 |court=EWCA |num=6 |parallelcite= [1975] QB 303 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; written terms were held to have been implied into an oral contract in which there was no mention of written terms.

===Good faith===
{{Main|Good faith}}
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document (sometimes unsigned, and sometimes labelled 'subject to contract') that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, [[Australian]] [[court]]s will imply an obligation to negotiate in [[good faith]] provided that certain conditions are satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=24+NSWLR+1 (1991) 24 NSWLR 1] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Negotiations were well-advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and
* There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down.

The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonableness. There is no such implied term under [[UK]] [[common law]]: an attempt was made by [[Lord Denning]] in a series of case during the 1970s and 1980s but they are no longer considered 'good law'.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]]&lt;ref&gt;Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UK) [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2083/contents/made SI 1999/2083]&lt;/ref&gt; reg 8 renders ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.&lt;ref&gt;For definitions, see reg 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulation 5 of the statutory instrument further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to English law. 'Unfair' is a term in [[standard form contract|standard form]] (specifically that was not individually negotiated) that "causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer".&lt;ref&gt;[[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] reg 5(1)&lt;/ref&gt; It must also be shown the term lacks 'good faith'; the claim failed in ''[[Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII |litigants=[[Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc]] |year=2001 |court=UKHL |num=52 |parallelcite=[2001] 3 WLR 1297 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as striking down a relatively high [[interest]] rate (falling short of [[extortion]]ary rates) would mean borrower could have safely ignored the interest rates in its loan agreements (see UK requirements for consumer financial advice/advice waivers in major consumer loan agreements) and that high-rate lenders would receive no interest.

=="Subject to" contracts==

=== Four Categories ===
If a contract specifies "subject to contract", it may fall into one of three categories as identified in ''Masters v Cameron'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Masters v Cameron |year=1954 |court=HCA |num=72 |parallelcite=(1954) 91 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a more formalized contract that will not have a different effect; or
# The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formal contract; or
# It is merely an agreement to agree lacking the requisite ''intention'' to create legal relations, and the deal will only be binding unless and until the formalized contract has been drawn up. 
Subsequent authorities have been willing to recognize a fourth category in addition to those stated in ''Masters v Cameron''.&lt;ref&gt;''Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=(1986)%2040%20NSWLR%20622(1986) 40 NSWLR 622] [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
#&lt;li value="4"&gt;The parties intend to immediately bound by the terms agreed upon and expect to create a further contract as a replacement for the initial contract which will contain additional terms (if agreed upon).&lt;/li&gt;

=== Contingent Condition ===
If a contract specifies "subject to finance", it may impose certain obligations on the purchaser:&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=Meehan v Jones |year=1982 |court=HCA |num=52 |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 571 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the contract is silent on the level of effort required by the finance seeker (usually purchaser) to obtain finance, the finance seeker may come under an implied duty to cooperate. Furthermore, whether the finance seeker may validly claim non-fulfillment of a contingent condition, despite being genuinely satisfied with finance he or she obtained before the expiration of the contingent condition, was not decided in ''Meehan v Jones''.&lt;ref name=Meehan /&gt;

"Subject to finance" provisions may be also referred to as contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract is required by both parties
With conditions subsequent, parties do not need to perform the contract if a condition is not yet (such as official certification to practice in a particular course of business). The non-fulfillment of a contingent condition means that the parties are not required to perform their side of the respective bargain.

Common departments include [[Marketing]], [[Finance]], [[Operations management|Operations]]{{dn||date=April 2018}}, [[Human resource management|Human Resource]], and [[Information technology|IT]]. These five divisions represent the major departments within a publicly traded company, though there are often smaller departments within autonomous firms. 
There is typically a [[CEO]], and [[Board of Directors]] composed of the directors of each department. There are also company presidents, vice presidents, and [[CFO]]s.
There is a great diversity in corporate forms as enterprises may range from single company to multi-corporate [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].&lt;ref name="McQueen"&gt;Roman Tomasic, Stephen Bottomley, Rob McQueen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zFSgs52KSmoC&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=Corporate%20structure&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Corporation Law in Australia]'', Federation Press, 2002, pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The four main corporate structures are [[Functional organization|Functional]], Divisional, Geographic, and the [[Matrix management|Matrix]].
Realistically, most corporations tend to have a “[[Hybrid organization|hybrid” structure]], which is a combination of different 
models with one dominant strategy. &lt;ref http://www.bridgespan.org/getmedia/b1139597-adfe-4dd7-bbb2-ac8c67883020/Effective-Organizations_-Structural-Design.pdf.aspx&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designing an Effective  Organization Structure|url=http://www.bridgespan.org/getmedia/b1139597-adfe-4dd7-bbb2-ac8c67883020/Effective-Organizations_-Structural-Design.pdf.aspx|publisher=Bain &amp; Company organizational toolkit and Bridgespan analysis|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
The kind of differentiation and diversity among corporations is of importance to [[corporate law]] (for example such difference in corporation type that has impact on corporate structure is the difference between public owned and proprietary companies).&lt;ref name="McQueen"/&gt;
Choosing a structure for a company is an important decision and must be strategically thought out because it could either aid or harm the making of business. The structure must also be a good fit for the type of activities, goals, and vision of the company. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Structure: An Overview|url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/structure/organizational-structure/overview/main|publisher=Community Tool Box|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational structure is a reflection of how convenient business is conducted.

== Models ==

=== Functional structure ===
This model is commonly used in single-program organizations. It is basically the standard structure mentioned earlier, which is organized around departments. This structure is most appropriate for all small organizations.

=== Divisional structure ===
Divisional structures are also called ''''product structures'''' because they are based on a certain product or project. This structure is most common in multi-service organizations. Normally, it's based on the departments divided in the firm.

=== Geographic structure ===
Geographic structures are used in multi-site organizations and are frequently used by networks across different geographic areas.

=== Matrix structure ===
The Matrix structure is probably the most complicated model of them all because it is organised around multiple dimensions (e.g. geography and product), typically with more than one supervisor. This structure is commonly used in  very large organisations because a greater volume requires greater co-ordination. However, this structure is very difficult to manage so it is usually better to reconsider its use and replace it with a different type of structure, then compensate for the tradeoffs.

== Classifications ==
In addition to those models, there are other factors that make up the structure of an organization. Depending on the chain of command, a company's structure could be classified as either vertical or horizontal, as well as centralized or decentralized. A vertically structured organization or a "tall" company describes a chain of management, usually with a CEO at the top delegating authority to lower-level managers through mid-level managers. Horizontal or "flat" companies, however, have almost no middle-managers, which implies that high-level managers get involved in daily tasks and interact with customers and front-line personnel. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huebsch|first=Russell|title=The Vertical Structure Vs. the Horizontal Structure in an Organization|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/vertical-structure-vs-horizontal-structure-organization-4904.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A centralized organizational structure describes how a company's direction and decisions are set by one individual only. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitez|first=Osmond|title=Organizational Structure|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/centralized-vs-decentralized-organizational-structure-2785.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centralization compliments companies with "tall" structures to create [[Bureaucratic]]  organizations. Decentralized organizational structures allow individuals some autonomy at each level of the business, because they join the decision-making process. Evidently, classifying organizations as centralized or decentralized is linked to them being "tall" or "flat".

== Technology ==
There is an emerging trend in the way companies shape their organizational structures. More businesses are moving towards a much flatter, decentralized organizational structure. 
Technological developments accelerate these organizational changes as they improve the efficiency of business, causing it to restructure departments, modify position requirements, or add and remove jobs. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer|first=Clare|title=Technology's Impact on Organizational Changes|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/technologys-impact-organizational-changes-20377.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Councils of Trust''' (''{{lang-de|Vertrauensräte}}'') were established in businesses and companies with more than 20 employees in [[Nazi Germany]] following the introduction of the [[Labour organization law]] of 20 January 1934. They served as the only representation of employees to the “[[factory leader]]” (i.e. entrepreneur) (''{{lang|de|Betriebsführer}}'') in order ''to increase mutual trust within the factory community''.&lt;ref&gt;Labour organization law, cited in: Tim Mason (1993): ''Social Policy in the Third Reich. The Working Class and the ‘national community’.'' Translated by John Broadwin, Berg: Oxford, New York, {{ISBN|0-85496-410-X}}, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;
Councillors were elected by secret ballots, but the list of candidates was prepared by the factory leader and the [[German Labour Front]] overseer (''{{lang|de|Betriebsobmann}}''). The councils did not play an active role in [[industrial relations]], except to serve as a platform for discussing working conditions regulated in the “factory code of rules” (''{{lang|de|Betriebsordnung}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Labour organization law, cited in: Tim Mason (1993): ''Social Policy in the Third Reich. The Working Class and the ‘national community’.'' Translated by John Broadwin, Berg: Oxford, New York, {{ISBN|0-85496-410-X}}, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

While in 1934 only 2 per cent of businesses and companies were required to establish a council of trust, this affected 46.2 per cent of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://library.fes.de/gmh/main/pdf-files/gmh/1992/1992-04-a-281.pdf |title=Matthias Frese (1992): ''Nationalsozialistische Vertrauensräte.

'''DIRKS''', an acronym for '''Designing and Implementing Recordkeeping Systems''', is a [https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/17383 comprehensive manual] outlining the process for creating [[records management]] systems including various business information records and transactions as outlined in the [[Australian Standard]] for Records Management - AS ISO 15489.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macintosh|first1=Stephen|last2=Real|first2=Lynne|title=DIRKS: Putting ISO 15489 to Work|journal=The Information Management Journal|date=April 2007|pages=50–56|url=http://www.arma.org/bookstore/files/Macintosh_Real.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIRKS was developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]] in collaboration with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]].

The manual consists of two parts, part one is the user's guide and part two is the set of steps themselves. DIRKS is an eight-step process in which all aspects, or as many as possible, of a business are studied in order to achieve a complete [[records management]] practice. In addition to these eight steps DIRKS includes several templates and questionnaires to guide one through the DIRKS methodology.

DIRKS was replaced in 2007 at the Australian Commonwealth level, but continues to be in use at state level in New South Wales as a non-tool to assist the public sector in complying with the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] State Records Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DIRKS and the State Records Act |url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |website=NSW Government State Records |publisher=The State Records Authority of New South Wales, Australia |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916165532/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/recordkeeping/advice/designing-implementing-and-managing-systems/dirks-manual/dirks-and-the-state-records-act |archivedate=16 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps of the DIRKS methodology==

* '''Step A: Preliminary investigation;'''
Before a preliminary investigation occurs DIRKS suggests a pre-preliminary investigation is performed where it is established if there is a need for a [[records management]] program at the organization and is there support for a record keeping system to be put in place. If so the preliminary investigation can take place. There are four components to the DIRKS preliminary investigation.
# Determine the scope of the preliminary investigation
# Collect Information
# Document the research of the investigation
# Report to Senior Management

* '''Step B: Analysis of business activity;'''
The purpose of Step B is to create a set of advisory statements from which an analysis of the organization's business activities can be determined. DIRKS suggests a set of systematic approaches to analyze an organization in a systematic way in order to reveal various business activities, how they are completed and who completes them.

* '''Step C: Identification of recordkeeping requirements;'''
Step C has two main objectives. The first is to determine an organization's requirements in creation and retention of records of its business activities. The second objective is to document the determined requirements in a clear manner that can be used as a reference in the future.

* '''Step D: Assessment of existing systems;'''
The main objective of Step D is to assess the existing recordkeeping systems and any other related information management systems that have the capacity to capture and maintain records. This assessment is to identify weaknesses and strengths within the existing system.

* '''Step E: Identification of strategies for recordkeeping;'''
The main objective of Step E is to determine which policies, procedures, standards and various other tools will help the organization achieve its recordkeeping goals. With these strategies established a model for both record management and recordkeeping can be created.

* '''Step F: Design of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective in Step F is to use the information gained in steps A through E a plan can be developed that fulfills the requirements set out in Step C. The design should repair any faults found in Step D and include a full plan for integrating the new recordkeeping system

* '''Step G: Implementation of a recordkeeping system;'''
The objective of Step G is put the recordkeeping system that was designed in Step F in place.

* '''Step H: Post-implementation review.'''
The objective of Step H is to measure the effectiveness of the installed system and to make sure that in practice in fulfills all requirements as established and documented throughout the DIRKS manual.

{{nihongo|'''Daisuke Enomoto'''|榎本 大輔|Enomoto Daisuke|extra=born April 22, 1971, nicknamed ''Dice-K''}} is a Japanese businessman and former [[livedoor]] executive who hoped to become the fourth [[space tourism|space tourist]]. He had trained at [[Star City, Moscow]] in Russia to fly with two members of [[Expedition 14]] on board [[Soyuz TMA-9]], which was launched on September 18, 2006.

However, on August 21, 2006, a Russian Federal Space Agency spokesman announced that Enomoto was "deemed not ready to fly for exclusively medical reasons", although he hinted that Enomoto might recover and join a later mission. His replacement on this particular flight was [[Iranian-American]] businesswoman [[Anousheh Ansari]]. Enomoto was involved in a [[lawsuit]] against Virginia-based [[Space Adventures]] in which he hoped to reclaim the $21 million he paid the company over a two-year span.&lt;ref name="Klotz"&gt;{{cite web |first=Irene |last=Klotz |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080925/sc_nm/us_space_touristscience |title=Grounded space tourist wants $21 million refund |date=2008-11-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5b7JP4I6O?url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080925/sc_nm/us_space_touristscience |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lawsuit, it was revealed that the "medical reason" was chronic [[kidney stones]].&lt;ref name="BARAKAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081121/ap_on_re_us/space_tourism_lawsuit |title=Would-be Japanese space tourist wants $21M back |first=Matthew |last=Barakat |date=2008-09-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5dF129PAb?url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081121/ap_on_re_us/space_tourism_lawsuit |archivedate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Space Adventures claims it advised Enomoto to treat the kidney stones aggressively and when he did not, they had to disqualify him from spaceflight. Enomoto claims the real reason for his disqualification was his refusal to provide additional funds to Space Adventures.&lt;ref name="BARAKAT" /&gt;

Enomoto would have been the first ''self-funded'' [[space tourist]] from Japan and Asia (journalist [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] flew on [[Soyuz TM-11]] in 1990, and could be regarded as the first space business traveller). Enomoto's flight would have taken him to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) after lifting off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan, the world's oldest [[spaceport]].

Enomoto made international news when it was revealed that he intended to go into space wearing a [[cosplay|costume]] akin to that of [[Char Aznable]], a character from the [[anime]] series ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kravets |first=David |title=Wannabe Space Tourist Wants $21 Million Back Over Scuttled Mission |work=[[Wired News]] |date=2008-09-24 |url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/09/enomoto_lawsuit |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021104401/http://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/09/enomoto_lawsuit |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Spencer |last=Reiss |title=Space Get Up |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 2006 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/start.html?pg=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His planned experiment was to put together one or more [[Gundam model]]s in [[zero gravity]].&lt;ref name="wired1" /&gt;

'''Ecological Counseling''' offers an approach to the conceptualization of human issues that integrates personal and environmental factors through focusing on their interaction.  By doing so, the widely divergent forces that converge through the development of a human life may be organized into a logical and coherent narrative.  This process attempts to assist people in the recreation of their lives, as is the case with the various forms of counseling.

The theoretical structure of this approach emerges from the integration of [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]].  In 1935, [[Kurt Lewin]], a German Gestalt psychologist, articulated that human behavior is a product of personal and environmental factors and formulated the equation B=(PxE).  [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] expanded Lewin's work in 1979 into [[Ecological Systems Theory]].  Ecological Counseling posits that the person is inextricably situated within radically specific and interdependent ecological systems.  Additionally, the individual carries particular capacities, limitations, temperaments, preferences, symbolic representation systems and personal historicity through the varying environmental settings in which the person lives.  The interactions between the person and environment result in the construction of the individual ecological niches.  These niches are what we experience as our world.

Ecological counseling seeks to understand people's ecological niches and assist them to live a satisfying life.  This is accomplished by improving one's interactional quality, or concordance, through counseling intervention at both the personal and environmental levels.

Ecological Counseling has implications for clinical counseling practice, counselor training, group work, career counseling, social service delivery, research, social justice initiatives, community intervention, consultation, supervision, and human growth &amp; development.

'''Educational equity''', also referred to as '''equity in education''', is a measure of achievement, fairness, and opportunity in education. The study of education equity is often linked with the study of [[excellence and equity]].

Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is [[Distributive justice|fairness]], which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]], which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/school/39989494.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ten Steps to Equity in Education|publisher=Oecd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual’s level of education directly correlates to future [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, [[Educational inequality|inequity in education]] is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savage Inequalities|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1991|isbn=0770435688|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Equity vs. equality==
Often, the terms "equity" and "equality" are interchanged when referring to educational equity. Although similar, there can be important distinctions between the two.

=== Equity ===
Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle. Examples of this are: “When libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/equalityequity|title=Equality and Equity of Access: What's the Difference?|publisher=Ala.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. [[social justice educational leadership|Social justice leaders]] in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.

=== Equality ===
The [[American Library Association]] defines equality as: “access to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.

==Socio-economic equity in education==
[[File:Education Equality.png|thumb|700px|center|Education equality on countries that are members of the OECD. The numbers correspond to the average difference of points in the results of the PISA test of a student from a high socio-economic level and a student from a low socio-economic level in their respective country. A higher number represents a more unequal education system whilst a smaller number indicates a more equal education system]]

===Income and class===
Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous [[SAT]]/[[ACT (test)|ACT]] prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.

===Costs of education===
The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a "level playing field" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend [[selective schools]] that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally [[Residential segregation|segregated]] by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/education/poor-students-struggle-as-class-plays-a-greater-role-in-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Poor Students Struggle as Class Plays a Greater Role in Success|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Another contributor to the inequality in the education system is [[tracking (education)|tracking]]. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108013/chapters/What-Tracking-Is-and-How-to-Start-Dismantling-It.aspx|title=Chapter 2. What Tracking Is and How to Start Dismantling It|publisher=Ascd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life. Students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.

==Racial equity in education==
From a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Race%20equality%20and%20education.pdf|format=PDF|title=Race equality and education : A practical resource for the school workforce : A resource written by Robin Richardson for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to [[State school|public schools]] and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educationnorthwest.org/equity-program/educational|title=Region X Equity Assistance Center - Education Northwest|publisher=Educationnorthwest.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education. 
* US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues a seminal report in 2013. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/eec/equity-excellence-commission-report.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Equity and Excellence Commission For Each and Every Child|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/educationalequity/home|title=Equity In Elementary and Secondary Education: Race, Gender, and National Origin Issues: Home|publisher=Sitemaker.umich.edu|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, [[Korea]], Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education/learning-world/equity-and-quality-education|title=Equity and Quality in Education|work=Asia Society|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED493386.pdf|format=PDF|title=Racial Equality in Education : How Far Has South Africa Come?|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
Higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students. Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/raceequalitytoolkit/|title=Race Equality Toolkit|publisher=Universities-scotland.ac.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equity in education==
Gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in [[Developing country|developing countries]] where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. [[Global Campaign for Education]] (GCE) followed a survey called "Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acei.org/global-news/gender-discrimination-in-education.html|title=Gender Discrimination in Education|author=Anne|publisher=Acei.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) understands Education as a " fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/right-to-education/|title=The Right to Education - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. 
Figure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Afghanistan]] face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womanstats.org/substatics/Discrepancy%20in%20Secondary%20Education_2010tif_wmlogo3.png|format=PDF|title=Discrepancy in Secondary Education|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. A ''[[New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/magazine/02sex3-t.html?_r=0 |title=Teaching boys and girls separately|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights how education systems, especially public school systems, tend to segregate. Boys and girls are often taught with different approaches, which programs children to think they are different and deserve different treatment. However, studies show that boys and girls learn differently, and therefore should be taught differently. Boys learn better when they keep moving, while girls learn better sitting in one place with silence. Therefore—in this reasoning—segregating the genders ''promotes'' gender equity in education, as both boys and girls have optimized learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/03/04/segregating-the-sexes/|title=Gender Differences: The Impact of Gender Stereotyping on School Environment - The Art of Manliness|work=The Art of Manliness|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of gender discrimination in education===
[[Voluntary Service Overseas|VSO]] is a leading independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty and one of the problems they tackle is gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222023026/http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VSO published a paper that categorizes the obstacles (or causes) into:
* Community Level Obstacles: This category primarily relates to the bias displayed for education external to the school environment. This includes restraints due to poverty and child labour, socio-economic constraints, lack of parental involvement and community participation. Harmful practices like child marriage and predetermined gender roles are cultural hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development/gender-equality|title=Gender Equality - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* School and Education System Level Obstacles: Lack of investment in quality education, inappropriate attitudes and behaviors, lack of female teachers as role models and lack of gender-friendly school environment are all factors that promote gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsointernational.org/Images/VSO%20gender%20equality%20and%20education%20paper_tcm76-32443.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Equality  and Education|publisher=Vsointernational.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of gender discrimination on the economy===
Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country. Equity in education increases the work force of the nation, therefore increasing [[national income]], [[economic productivity]], and [gross domestic product]. It reduces fertility and [[infant mortality]], improves child health, increases life expectancy and increases standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp6532.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Effects of Education on Economic Development in Turkey|publisher=Ftp.iza.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are factors that allow [[economic stability]] and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development. Equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/Education_from_a_Gender_Equality_Perspective.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDUCATION FROM A GENDER  EQUALITY PERSPECTIVE |publisher=Ungei.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality|title=Gender inequality|work=The Economist|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an article published by ''The Economist'', which says:

"Looking at recently-published UN statistics on gender inequality in education, one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade, but progress has not been even (see chart). Although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the UN’s gender-inequality target, many parts of Africa are lagging behind. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels."

== Notable publications and reports ==
Providing opportunities for students to consider racial equality as well as matters of racism as part of their study will help them to develop confidence to engage with these concepts as part of future practice, thinking, and life skills. Race, social class, and gender as issues related to schooling have received major attention from educators and social scientists over the last two decades.

=== Race equality in education - a survey report by England ===
The local authorities in England gave a survey report '''Race equality in education''' in November 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/race-equality-education|title=Ofsted - Race equality in education|publisher=Ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report is based on visits by Her Majesty.s Inspectors (HMIs) and additional inspectors to 12 LEAs and 50 schools in England between summer term 2003 to spring term 2005. This report illustrates good practice on race equality in education in a sample of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed between the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005. The survey focused on schools and LEAs that were involved effectively in race equality in education. Four areas were examined by inspectors: improving standards and achievement amongst groups of pupils, with reference to the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA); the incorporation of race equality concepts into the curriculum in schools; the handling and reporting of race-related incidents in schools; the work of schools and LEAs in improving links with local minority ethnic communities.

=== Race equality and education – by UK educational system ===
The [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] (ATL) (ATL promotes and protects the interests of its members – teachers, lecturers, support staff and other education professionals) introduced a practical resource for the school workforce '''Race equality and education''' in the UK educational system. The publication sets out to examine the racial, religious or cultural terminology regularly used in today's society, in an attempt to combat prejudice based on colour, ethnicity, religion or culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

=== The equity and excellence commission - US education ===
At this decisive moment, the Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues this seminal report. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American [[State school|public schools]] once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Carol D. Lee described the rationale for a special theme issue, "Reconceptualizing Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research." The rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edr.sagepub.com/content/32/5/3.short|title=Why We Need to Re-Think Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research|publisher=Edr.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial equity in education: how far has South Africa come? ===
A major task of South Africa’s new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. This paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts: equal treatment, equal educational opportunity, and educational adequacy. The authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment, primarily through race-blind policies for allocating state funds for schools. Progress measured by the other two criteria, however, has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid, including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students, and by policies such as school fees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Race in education: an argument for integrative analysis ===
Education literature tends to treat race, social class, and gender as separate issues. A review of a sample of education literature from four academic journals, spanning ten years, sought to determine how much these status groups were integrated. The study found little integration. The study then provided a research example on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school. From findings of studies integrating race and class, and race and gender, the study argues that attending only to race, in this example, oversimplifies behavior analysis and may help perpetuate gender and class biases. To determine to what extent race, social class, and gender are integrated in the education literature, the study examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race, or on school issues related directly to race, such as desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/56/2/195.full.pdf+html|title=Sign In|publisher=Rer.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and quality in education: supporting disadvantaged students and schools–from OECD ===
The report is by the [[OECD]] Education Directorate with support from the Asia Society as a background report for the first [[Asia Society]] Global Cities Network Symposium, Hong Kong, May 10–12, 2012. Asia Society is grateful for OECD's leadership in international [[benchmarking]] and for our ongoing partnership. Asia Society organized the Global Cities Education Network, a network of urban school systems in North America and Asia to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement common to them, and to virtually all city education systems. This report presents the key recommendations of the OECD publication Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools (2012a), which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems, with a particular focus on North American and Asia-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/files/oecd-0512report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Equity and Quality in Education :  Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools|publisher=Asiasociety.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in educational equity==
The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|healthcare]], [[income support]], [[child welfare]] and [[social security]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Societal structure and costs===
While both [[basic education]] and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the [[feminist movement]] has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, [[social mobility]] has not increased, while [[economic inequality]] has.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.

===Increase migration and diversity===
As increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor [[social cohesion]] in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating [[minorities]]. Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower [[socio-economic status]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Librairie Droz.jpg|right|thumb|305px|This cartoon of Bigoudi, the dachshund of Eugénie Droz, featured on publicity for  [[:fr:Librairie Droz|her business]] around 1955.]] 
Laure Eugénie Zahn was born at [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] in the francophone northwest of [[Switzerland]].   Her father, Frédéric Zahn, was a well known member of the business community in the town, where he worked as an editor.&lt;ref name=EDsegunMA/&gt;   In 1900 the family relocated to nearby [[Neuchâtel]].   Here she completed her secondary education and obtained a teaching diploma.   Between 1910 and 1913 she taught [[French language|French]] at the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Institute]] of [[:fr:Allemands de Géorgie|Gnadenberg]] in [[Silesia]], taking the opportunity at the same time to perfect her [[German language|German]].   Returning to [[Neuchâtel]] in 1913, she was admitted to the [[Université de Neuchâtel]] where during the next three years she studied successfully for her degree.   She was a pupil of [[Arthur Piaget]], who also became a good friend.   He encouraged her to study the history of ancient poetry and [[renaissance literature]].&lt;ref name=LEZselonJDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugénie Droz se retire|url=http://www.letempsarchives.ch/page/JDG_1963_02_02/8/article/735126|author=Jean-Daniel Candaux|page=8|date=3 February 1963|publisher=Journal; de Genève|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is apparent that the second volume of Piaget's work "Jardin de Plaisance et Fleur de rhétorique, d'[[Antoine Vérard]] (vers 1501)", which was published only in 1925, subtitled "Introduction and notes" and signed off by E.Droz and Arthur Piaget, was largely the work of Piaget's erudite pupil.   The compilation of 672 verses, ballads, sounds, rondeaux etc., many of them anonymous, was described in an obituary of Eugénie Droz as an "inestimable contribution to mid-century French literature" (''"contribution inestimable aux lettres françaises du milieu du siècle"'').&lt;ref name=EDselonHM/&gt;

In 1916 her parents divorced.   Three years later she sought and received permission to use her mother's pre-marriage name in place of her father's name.  Eugénie Zahn became Eugénie Droz.&lt;ref name=EDlautHLS/&gt;   Sources covering this period may identify her under either name.

She moved to [[Paris]] in 1916 and enrolled, at this stage as Eugénie Zahn, at the prestigious [[École pratique des hautes études]] (Section IV - Sciences historiques et philologiques (''loosely, History and Philology'').   Her teachers included [[Alfred Jeanroy]], [[Abel Lefranc]] and [[:fr:Georges Doutrepont|Georges Doutrepont]].   She received exceptionally positive reports from the outset&lt;ref name=EDselonHM/&gt; and completed her degree in 1923.&lt;ref name=EDlautHLS/&gt;   In 1924 she opened the [[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]], initially at [[:fr:Rue Serpente|34 rue Serpente]], moving within a year to [[:fr:Rue de Tournon|25 Rue de Tournon]], both addresses located appropriately in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name=EDsegunMA/&gt;   Her business was in essence a specialist bookshop and publisher.   The core product would be her own academic output as an editor-publisher with a particular interest in sixteenth century texts and the history and social impact of books through history more generally.   The business continues to focus on medieval and humanist titles and on literary criticism and art history.  &lt;ref name=LibDrozselonLibDroz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.droz.org/world/fr/|title=Librairie Droz|publisher=Librairie Droz, Genève |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

She described the Paris premises proudly in her first catalogue:  "Accommodated in the House of the Bronze Horse, given by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to [the renaissance poet] [[:fr:Clément Marot|Clément Marot]] in 1539, the 'Librairie Droz' [book business] has been established by  Eugénie Droz, graduate of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and Doctor of Letters (''"Installée dans la maison du Cheval d'airain, donnée par François Ier a Clément Marot en 1539, la librairie Droz a été fondée par Eugénie Droz, élève diplômée de l'École des Hautes Études et docteur des lettres."'').   Her doctorate came from the [[Université de Neuchâtel]].   Her work for it consisted of 35 ancient texts accompanied by translations into contemporary French, a piece of work currently conserved in the rare books collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]].&lt;ref name=RecueilselonARLIMA&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.arlima.net/qt/recueil_trepperel.html|title=Le Recueil Trepperel|publisher=Les Archives de littérature du Moyen Âge (ARLIMA)|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]] having been established in Paris, the printed device appearing as a form of trade mark on publications acknowledged the Swiss provenance of the proprietress.   She copied the design used by Jean de Stalle who operated a printing house in Geneva between 1487 and 1493.   The only change involved removing the initials "IdeS", incorporated in the centre of the device, and replacing them with her own initials, "ED".&lt;ref name=HistoriqueLD&gt;{{cite web|title=Historique |url=https://www.droz.org/world/fr/content/4-pr%C3%A9sentation| publisher=Librairie Droz, Genève |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Shortly after opening the Librairie Droz, still aged only 32, she found time to take on a position as assistant treasurer of the [[Société des anciens textes français]], a learned society founded in [[Paris]] in 1875 with the purpose of publishing all kinds of medieval documents written either in [[langue d'oïl]] or [[occitan|langue d'oc]].   (The society's treasurer was [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond de Rothschild]].)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|language = français|author1 = Robert Marichal|title = Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, Travaux et Documents -Tome LV- |date=1993 |volume=3|pages=645-652|work= Chronique, Centenaire d'Eugénie Droz, Les souvenirs de Robert Marichal||publisher = Librairie Droz S.A., Geneva|year = 1993||isbn = |lire en ligne = |passage = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 she founded "Humanisme et Renaissance",&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; an academic journal which in effect replaced "Revue du seizième siècle".   Most prominent among the many erudite collaborators on it were her old tutor, [[Abel Lefranc]] and [[Robert Marichal]].    She also created the [[:fr:Association loi de 1901|non-profit association]] "Humanisme et Renaissance".   During the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation]] she changed the name of the (much diminished) review, which became the "Bibliothèque d'humanisme et Renaissance".&lt;ref name=EDselonHM/&gt;

In 1945, while still based in Paris, she created the series "Textes littéraires français".   This was an early series of paperback books, with the focus as before on her own areas of academic expertise.   In 1950, by which time she had moved to [[Geneva]], she launched the series "les Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance" which became and remains an important body of reference for renaissance scholarship.&lt;ref name=EDlautHLS/&gt;   

On November 1944 she found herself mandated by the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic |Provisional Government]] to study the files of political deportees at [[Geneva]].   The later 1940s were a period of acute austerity and political uncertainty in France.   It was probably around this time that she decided to relocate permanently from Paris to Geneva.   She sold the premises at [[:fr:Rue de Tournon|25 Rue de Tournon]] in 1947 and moved the business permanently to 8 rue Verdaine in Geneva.   In 1963, the year of her seventieth birthday, she sold the business, which passed to the control of Alain Dufour and Giovanni Busino, two young historians with complementary skills whom she had personally selected.&lt;ref name=LEZselonJDC/&gt;

'''Finance capitalism''' or '''financial capitalism''' is the subordination of processes of [[Production (economics)|production]] to the accumulation of [[money]] profits in a [[financial system]].&lt;ref&gt;"Capitalism" by John Scott and [[Gordon Marshall (sociologist)|Gordon Marshall]] in ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial capitalism is thus a form of [[capitalism]] where the intermediation of saving to investment becomes a dominant function in the economy, with wider implications for the political process and social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200905/imf-advice  Simon Johnson, "The Quiet Coup", May 2009, The Atlantic.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century it has become the predominant force in the global economy,&lt;ref&gt;R. Munck, ''Globalization and Labour'' (2011) p. 77–8&lt;/ref&gt; whether in [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] or other form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles R. Morris]], ''The Trillion Dollar Meltdown'' (2008) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Finance capitalism is characterized by a predominance of the pursuit of profit from the purchase and sale of, or [[investment]] in, [[currency|currencies]] and financial products such as [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s, [[stock]]s, [[Futures contract|futures]] and other [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. It also includes [[usury|the lending of money at interest]]; and is seen by [[Marxism|Marxist analysts]] (from whom the term finance capitalism originally derived) as being exploitative by supplying income to non-laborers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634101 "The Contradiction of Capitalism in the Search for Democracy"], ''Latin American Perspectives'', Vol. 24, No. 3, Ecuador, Part 1: Politics and Rural Issues (May, 1997), pp. 116–122&lt;/ref&gt; Academic defenders of the economic concept of capitalism, such as [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], see such profits as part of the [[roundaboutness|roundabout]] process by which it grows and [[hedge (finance)|hedge]]s against inevitable risks.&lt;ref&gt;F. Boldizzoni, ''Means and Ends: The Idea of Capital in the West 1500–1970'', Palgrave Macmillan 2008, pp. 128–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In financial capitalism, financial intermediaries become large concerns, ranging from banks to investment firms. Where deposit banks attract savings and lend out money, while investment banks obtain funds on the [[interbank market]] to re-lend for investment purposes, investment firms, by comparison, act on behalf of other concerns, by selling their equities or securities to investors, for investment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Americas_Steps.pdf  J. Bradford De Long &amp; Carlos D. Ramirez, "Understanding America’s Hesitant Steps Toward Financial Capitalism", 1996, UC Berkeley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313191856/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Americas_Steps.pdf |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social implications===
The meaning of the term financial capitalism goes beyond the importance of financial intermediation in the modern capitalist economy. It also encompasses the significant influence of the wealth holders on the political process and the aims of economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levy.org/pubs/wp275.pdf  Dimitri B. Papadimitriou &amp; L. Randall Wray, "Minsky's Analysis of Financial Capitalism, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Palley]] has argued that the 21st century predominance of finance capital has led to a preference for speculation—[[Casino Capitalism]]—over investment for entrepreneurial growth in the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Palley, ''From Financial Crisis to Stagnation'' (2012) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical developments==

[[Rudolf Hilferding]] is credited with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence, with his (1910) study of the links between German trusts, banks, and monopolies before [[World War I]]—a study subsumed by [[Lenin]] into his wartime analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Jameson, 'Culture and Finance Capital', in ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin concluded of the banks at that time that they were “the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy”:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. H. Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 2'' (1971) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Comintern]], the phrase "dictatorship of finance capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in F. A Voight, ''Unto Caesar'' (1938) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; became a regular one.

In such a traditional Marxist perspective, finance capitalism is seen as a dialectical outgrowth of [[industrial capitalism]], and part of the process by which the whole capitalist phase of history comes to an end. In a fashion similar to the views of [[Thorstein Veblen]], finance capitalism is contrasted with industrial capitalism, where profit is made from the manufacture of goods.

[[Fernand Braudel]] would later point to two earlier periods when finance capitalism had emerged in human history—with the Genoese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries—although at those points it was from commercial capitalism that it developed.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Calhoun/G. Derluguian, ''Business as Usual'' (2011) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Arrighi]] extended Braudel's analysis to suggest that a predominance of finance capitalism is a recurring, long-term phenomenon, whenever a previous phase of commercial/industrial capitalist expansion reaches a plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas by mid-century the industrial corporation had displaced the banking system as the prime economic symbol of success,&lt;ref&gt;A. Sampson, ''Anatomy of Britain Today'' (1969) p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; the late twentieth-century growth of derivatives and of a novel banking model&lt;ref&gt;P.Auger, ''Chasing Alpha'' (2009) p. 122 and p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; ushered in a new (and historically fourth) period of finance capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 256-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] has seen the [[Globalization|globalised]] abstractions of this current phase of financial capitalism as underpinning the cultural manifestations of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 268-273&lt;/ref&gt;

Fouad Makhzoumi was born in [[Beirut]], Lebanon in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://fouadmakhzoumi.com/index.php |title=Fouad Makhzoumi |publisher=Fouad Makhzoumi |date= |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has bachelor's and master's degrees in [[chemical engineering]] from [[Michigan Technological University]].&lt;ref name="futurepipe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurepipe.com/about-us/directors/fouad-makhzoumi |title=Mr Fouad Makhzoumi |website=Futurepipe.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
In 1984, Makhzoumi co-founded [[Future Pipe Industries]], and was CEO from 1986 to 2003, when his son, Rami Makhzoumi, took over as CEO, with Makhzoumi as chairman until 2011, when he resumed the CEO role.&lt;ref name="futurepipe1"/&gt;

In the 1980s, Makhzoumi recruited the "disgraced Conservative politician" [[Jonathan Aitken]] as a board director of one of his companies, Aitken failed to declare this, and as the government minister in charge of arms sales, promoted a military equipment deal involving Makhzoumi in the 1990s, all of which played a part in Aitken's being jailed for libel in 1999.&lt;ref name="Guardian_2013" /&gt;

==Political donations==
In 2010, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] received a donation of £300,000 from his wife, May Makhzoumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nigel Morris |author2=Oliver Wright |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/wife-of-lebanese-businessman-involved-in-1995-military-equipment-deal-donated-30000-to-conservative-2223982.html |title=Wife of Lebanese businessman involved in 1995 military equipment deal donated £30,000 to Conservative Party |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was reported that May Makhzoumi had given the Conservative Party another £500,000 earlier that year, bringing her total donations since 2010 to over £1 million.&lt;ref name="Guardian_2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Wife of businessman involved in Aitken scandal gives Tories £1m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/15/wife-businessman-makhzoumi-aitken-donates-tory|accessdate=22 March 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' that [[François Fillon]], the French presidential candidate had allegedly been paid $50,000 to arrange a meeting between Makhzoumi, the Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], and Patrick Pouyane, the chief executive of the French energy multinational [[Total S.A.|Total]].&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Makhzoumi and his wife May have three children, Rami (died 2011, brain aneurysm), Tamara, and Camellia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramimakhzoumi.com/biography/obituary |title=Obituary |publisher=Rami Makhzoumi |date=31 October 1977 |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in a small farming community outside Gardena, he was the only child of Japanese immigrants Setsuo and Yoshiko Aratani (although his mother had two children from a previous marriage). The family later moved to the [[San Fernando Valley]], and again to [[Guadalupe, California|Guadalupe]], where Aratani attended school while his father established several highly successful farming, manufacturing and international trade companies. While in high school, Aratani was scouted by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and briefly considered a career as a professional athlete, but had to change his plans after a football injury soured his prospects.&lt;ref name=Hirahara&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirahara |first=Naomi |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/George%20Aratani/ |title=George Aratani |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, Aratani relocated to [[Tokyo]], following his parents' wishes that he pursue a college education in their home country of Japan. Living with his grandmother in Japan, he spent ten months studying the language before enrolling at [[Keio University]]. In December 1935, his mother, who was also staying in Japan at the time, became ill and died. His father remarried Yoshiko's niece, Masuko, and returned to the United States to manage his businesses. Aratani remained in Tokyo and continued his studies at Keio's law school, but he came back to Guadalupe when his father contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1940. Unable to finish his degree at Keio, he enrolled at [[Stanford University]], but after Setsuo's death in April, Aratani, then 22, dropped out to help his stepmother run the Guadalupe Produce Company.&lt;ref name=trounson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;

==[[World War II]] incarceration==
In the wake of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the tide of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese sentiment]] that followed it, Aratani transferred the company's assets from its [[Issei]] leaders to its [[Nisei]] executives, hoping to avoid losing the business. The  move only postponed what would soon prove to be inevitable; after learning he and his stepmother would be [[Internment of Japanese Americans|"evacuated" with 120,000 other Japanese Americans]], Aratani was forced to leave the Guadalupe Produce Company in the hands of trustees from a separate business.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;

Under the directive of [[Executive Order 9066]], Aratani was removed to the [[Tulare, California|Tulare]] Assembly Center before being transferred to the [[War Relocation Authority]] camp at [[Gila River War Relocation Center|Gila River]], Arizona. Shortly after arriving in camp, the office of the Superintendent of Banks, which had taken over the frozen assets of Japanese banks operating in the U.S. before the war, began to pursue Aratani in order to collect on a loan issued to his father by [[Sumitomo Bank]]. With little access to alternatives from within camp, Aratani and the Guadalupe board sold the company to the trustees, barely covering the taxes due to the government.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt; Aratani's biography, "An American Son: The Story of George Aratani," details the losses his family endured during the 1940s.&lt;ref name=fukuzaki&gt;{{cite web | last = Fukuzaki | first = Rob | title=Funeral held for George Aratani, Japanese-American businessman and philanthropist|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=9013643| publisher=ABC7 | date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Aratani was bilingual, he was allowed to leave the camp in 1944 to serve at the [[Military Intelligence Service Language School]], where he taught Japanese to American soldiers, including many Nisei.&lt;ref name=trounson/&gt; Before arriving at the [[Camp Savage]] school, he married Sakaye Inouye, who had been interned at the nearby [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]] camp. The couple would have two daughters, Donna and Linda.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;

==Post-war business and philanthropy==
After the war, the Aratanis returned to California, settling in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=trounson/&gt; Aratani established an international trading company in 1946, working with former Guadalupe Produce Company employees and using the name of one of his father's prewar businesses, All Star Trading. The company changed its name to American Commercial, Inc., and tried importing various products before finding a profitable market in Japanese-made chinaware. The Mikasa brand was founded in December 1957 and quickly became popular in the United States, eventually going public in 1994. Aratani continued to expand, creating a medical equipment exporting business in 1951 and establishing Kenwood Electronics in 1961, again employing friends from Guadalupe or the Military Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;

Much of Aratani's philanthropy focused on the Japanese American community. He helped found the Keiro Nursing Home in 1961, putting his home up for collateral on the initial loan.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keiro Senior HealthCare, "[http://www.keiro.org/history History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111235419/http://www.keiro.org/history |date=2014-11-11 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance and through his contributions, Aratani helped with the restoration of numerous historical buildings in Los Angeles' [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] and was key to the creation of its Japanese American Cultural and Community Center.&lt;ref name=fukuzaki/&gt; The JACCC's Aratani Japan America Theatre, the [[Japanese American National Museum]]'s George and Sakaye Aratani Central Hall, and the Union Center for the Arts' Aratani Courtyard (all located within Little Tokyo) are named after Aratani and his wife.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt; In 2004, at [[UCLA]], he and Sakaye endowed the United States' first academic chair to study the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans and their efforts to gain redress.&lt;ref name=trounson/&gt;

Aratani spent his later years in the couple's Hollywood Hills home (built by Sakaye's brother-in-law in 1958). He died February 19, 2013, at age 95.&lt;ref name=Hirahara/&gt;

In 1977, Wyss founded and became president of Synthes USA,&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harbus15/&gt; the U.S. division of Switzerland-based [[Synthes]] medical device manufacturer making internal screws and plates for broken bones.&lt;ref name=Hill09/&gt; In an early initiative, Wyss opened a Synthes USA manufacturing plant in Colorado.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Prior to that, another Switzerland company manufactured Synthes' devices and exported them to the U.S.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Under Wyss' control, the U.S. division expanded its sales team and trained surgeons how to use its products.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; Wyss served as Synthes' worldwide CEO and chairman until his resignation as CEO in 2007.&lt;ref name=Connolly11/&gt; He maintained his post as company chairman until [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] acquired Synthes in 2012.&lt;ref name=Herper11&gt;{{cite news|title=Synthes Sale Creates $8.7 Billion Man|author=Matthew Herper|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/04/27/synthes-sale-creates-8-7-billion-man|work=[[Forbes]]|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=George12&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson completes $20B takeover of Synthes|author=John George|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2012/06/14/johnson-johnson-completes-20b.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Philadelphia Business Journal]]|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Wyss said discussions of new products made up one-third of board meetings.&lt;ref name=Harvard07/&gt; A manager assigned to the Norian project testified before a grand jury that "for somebody who is at his level and his level of success, I would say he [Wyss] has a surprising amount of contact with what's going on." Staff recalled meetings in which he intensively probed their projects.&lt;ref name="badtothebone"/&gt;

In 2009, top executives at Synthes were indicted by U.S. Attorneys for Eastern Pennsylvania for using an untested calcium-phosphate-based bone cement on human patients without the authorization from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], which resulted in the deaths of three people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/three-people-died-in-illegal-human-experiments-carried-out-by-john-podesta-backers-firm/article/2551139 "Three people died in illegal human experiments carried out by John Podesta backer's firm"], washingtonexaminer.com; accessed 21 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyss was not indicted but four of Synthes' top executives were convicted and sentenced to prison terms.&lt;ref name="badtothebone"&gt;[http://fortune.com/2012/09/18/bad-to-the-bone-a-medical-horror-story "Bad to the Bone - a Medical Horror Story"], fortune.com, 18 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
According to ''[[Forbes]]'', Wyss is "among the most [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] people in the world".&lt;ref name="Forbes1215"/&gt; Between 2004 and 2008, ''[[Businessweek]]'' estimated that Wyss personally donated nearly USD$277 million.&lt;ref name=Hill09/&gt; His giving has increased since the sale of Synthes in 2012 and in 2013 he signed [[The Giving Pledge]], agreeing to give away the majority of his fortune.&lt;ref name=Forbes1215/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams14&gt;{{cite news|title=Wyss, Yet Another Big Philanthropist, Turns to the Oceans|author=Tate Williams|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/11/4/wyss-yet-another-big-philanthropist-turns-to-the-oceans.html|work=Inside Philanthropy|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of his charitable foundations equal nearly $2 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes1215/&gt;

In 2015, Wyss publicly declared himself to be in favour of higher inheritance taxes (estate/death duty taxes) for the wealthy in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blick: Hansjörg Wyss, der Freund der Erbschaftssteuer|url=http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/hansjoerg-wyss-der-freund-der-erbschaftssteuer-keiner-weiss-wo-er-steuern-zahlt-id3825709.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long-lasting rivalry between billionaire Wyss, who supports left-wing politics, and billionaire conservative [[Christoph Blocher]]. Both entered into public debates about the bilateral contracts between [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Union]] as well as the limitation of immigrants into Switzerland. Wyss, on the one hand, attempted to outline and foster the advantages of openness towards the EU and immigrants while Blocher, on the other hand, sought to highlight and emphasize the independence of Switzerland in those matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blick: Hansjörg Wyss und Christoph Blocher - Die Schlacht der alten Milliardäre|url=http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/wahlen2015/hansjoerg-wyss-und-christoph-blocher-die-schlacht-der-alten-milliardaere-id4095937.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Ford''' (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American [[captain of industry]] and a [[business magnate]], the founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]], and the sponsor of the development of the [[assembly line]] technique of [[mass production]].

Although Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of Henry Ford |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005164558/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle-class Americans could afford. In doing so, Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. His introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] automobile revolutionized transportation and American [[industry]]. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with "[[Fordism]]": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.

Ford was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of [[World War I]], and for promoting [[antisemitic]] content, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' through his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' and the book ''[[The International Jew]]'', having an influence on the development of [[Nazism]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Early life==
Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223215/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp |date=October 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[William Ford (businessman)|William Ford]] (1826–1905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, to a family that was originally from [[Somerset]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Ford in Ireland Family Crest and Name History|url=http://www.ford.ie/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/HistoryOfFord}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Mary Ford (née Litogot; 1839–1876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867–1938); Jane Ford (c. 1868–1945); William Ford (1871–1917) and Robert Ford (1873–1934).

His father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22–24; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Harold "They Made America" Little, Brown and Company. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was devastated when his mother died in 1876. His father expected him to eventually take over the family farm, but he despised farm work. He later wrote, "I never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm I loved."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 24; Edward A. Guest "Henry Ford Talks About His Mother," ''American Magazine'', July 1923, 11–15, 116–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ford left home to work as an apprentice [[machinist]] in Detroit, first with James F. Flower &amp; Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the [[Westinghouse Farm Engine|Westinghouse portable steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant &amp; Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Watts |title=The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century |publisher=Random House, Inc. |year=2006 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LIDyU91YMHAC|isbn=978-0307558978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1891, Ford became an engineer with the [[Edison Illuminating Company]]. After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615125140/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html |date=June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [[Thomas Edison]]. Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;Ford R. Bryan, [http://hfha.org/HenryFord.htm "The Birth of Ford Motor Company"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829193220/http://hfha.org/HenryFord.htm |date=August 29, 2012 }}, Henry Ford Heritage Association, retrieved August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by the capital of Detroit [[lumber baron]] William H. Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] on August 5, 1899.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

With the help of [[C. Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M. Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

Teaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer "999" which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; They formed a partnership, "Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd." to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by [[John F. Dodge|John]] and [[Horace E. Dodge]] to supply over $160,000 in parts.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment.

===Ford Motor Company===
[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Firestone]]. [[Fort Myers, Florida]], February 11, 1929.]]

In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Ford &amp; Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], Malcolmson's secretary [[James Couzens]], and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]]. Ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], driving {{convert|1|mi|km}} in 39.4 seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at {{convert|91.3|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}. Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model "[[Ford 999|999]]" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].

====Model T====
The [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp. 54–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed—several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1954) 1:387–415&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])

[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]

Sales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1976, pp. 41–59&lt;/ref&gt; (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,828.08 in 2015 dollars.)
[[File:1924-1925 Ford - T Roadster, Coimbatore (1).jpg|thumb|A 1926 Ford T Roadster on display in India]]
By 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black".&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, pp. 243–48&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].

Henry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s, sales of the Model T began to decline due to rising competition. Other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T. Despite urgings from Edsel, Henry refused to incorporate new features into the Model T or to form a customer credit plan.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409–36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Model A and Ford's later career====
By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Ford to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p223"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&amp;nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration.

====Labor philosophy====

=====The five-dollar wage=====
[[File:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]
Ford was a pioneer of "[[welfare capitalism]]", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cleveland, Ohio]], newspaper editorialized that the announcement "shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image'' p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.

Detroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy. He viewed the increased wages as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage pp. 126–30].&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5-day wage.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Real profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's "Social Department" approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this "profit-sharing."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Ford's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that "paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment."&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage p. 130].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The five-day workweek=====
In addition to raising the wages of his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week,&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p126"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Crowther [http://geowords.com/e_/e_readings/ford2.htm Henry Ford: "Why I Favor Five Days' Work With Six Days' Pay"], ''World's Work,'' October 1926 pp. 613–16&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325165437/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford had made the decision to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time, and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business, since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods. However, altruistic concerns also played a role, with Ford explaining "It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege."&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

=====Labor unions=====
Ford was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage pp. 253–66].&lt;/ref&gt; He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist.

He believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.

To forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pp. 91–92. Moffa Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs members of the [[United Automobile Workers]], including [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bennett's men were beating the UAW representatives, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Bennett's Service Department, and [Brooks] "did not give orders to intervene."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|2003|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day photographs of the injured UAW members appeared in newspapers, later becoming known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was president of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.

The Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the UAW. A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp266-272"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp266-272"/&gt; About a year later, Ford told Walter Reuther, "It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant." Reuther inquired, "What do you mean?" Ford replied, "Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior|last=Reuther.|first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth|date=2004|publisher=LivingForce Pub|isbn=978-0975379219|location=Lake Orion, Mich.|page=63|oclc=57172289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Airplane Company===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Ford, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines. After the war, it returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the [[Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company|Stout Metal Airplane Company]].

[[File:Ford 4ATF.jpg|thumb|left|Ford 4-AT-F (EC-RRA) of the Spanish Republican Airline, [[L.A.P.E.]]]]
Ford's most successful aircraft was the [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4AT Trimotor]], often called the "Tin Goose" because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].

===Peace and war===

====World War I era====
Ford opposed war, which he viewed as a terrible waste,&lt;ref name="Ford-Bio-A&amp;E"&gt;Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999). ''A&amp;E Television''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michigan History, January/February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and supported causes that opposed [[military intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i | title=Examining the American peace movement prior to World War I| date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war, and he tried to stop them. In 1915, the pacifist [[Rosika Schwimmer]] gained favor with Ford, who agreed to fund a [[Peace Ship]] to Europe, where World War I was raging. He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists. A target of much ridicule, Ford left the ship as soon as it reached Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Watts|title=''The People's Tycoon''|year=2005|pages=225–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford plants in the United Kingdom produced tractors to increase the British food supply, as well as trucks and aircraft engines. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917 the company became a major supplier of weapons, especially the Liberty engine for airplanes, and anti-submarine boats.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins and Frank Ernest Hill, ''Ford: Expansion and Challenge, 1915–1933'' (1957) pp. 55–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, with the war on and the [[League of Nations]] a growing issue in global politics, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a Democrat, encouraged Ford to run for a Michigan seat in the U.S. Senate. Wilson believed that Ford could tip the scales in Congress in favor of Wilson's proposed [[League of Nations|League]]. "You are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire," the president wrote Ford. Ford wrote back: "If they want to elect me let them do so, but I won't make a penny's investment." Ford did run, however, and came within 4,500 votes of winning, out of more than 400,000 cast statewide.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Russ. (2002) ''The Ford Century.'' Tehabi Books. {{ISBN|188765688X}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford remained a staunch Wilsonian and supporter of the League. When Wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to promote the League, Ford helped fund the attendant publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Watts|title=''The People's Tycoon''|year=2005|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper Jr, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (2009) p. 521&lt;/ref&gt;

====The coming of World War II and Ford's mental collapse====

New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars. Ford "insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction"; in 1939 he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier war-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; The financiers to whom he was referring was Ford's code for Jews; he had also accused Jews of fomenting the First World War.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to World War II and when the war erupted in 1939, he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents. Like many other businessmen of the Great Depression era, he never liked or entirely trusted the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, and thought Roosevelt was inching the U.S. closer to war. However, Ford continued to do business with [[Nazi Germany]], including the manufacture of war [[materiel]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

Beginning in 1940, with the requisitioning of between 100 and 200 French [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to work as slave laborers, ''[[Ford Germany|Ford-Werke]]'' contravened Article 31 of the 1929 [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; At that time, which was before the U.S. entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany, ''Ford-Werke'' was under the control of the Ford Motor Company. The number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although [[Max Wallace|Wallace]] makes it clear that companies in Germany were not required by the Nazi authorities to use slave laborers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

When [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] sought a U.S. manufacturer as an additional source for the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine (as fitted to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] fighters), Ford first agreed to do so and then [[Rolls-Royce Merlin#Packard V-1650|reneged]]. He "lined up behind the war effort" when the U.S. entered in late 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; His support of the American war effort, however, was problematic.

Once the U.S. entered the war, Ford directed the [[Ford Motor Company]] to construct a vast new purpose-built factory at [[Willow Run]] near Detroit, Michigan. Ford broke ground on Willow Run in the spring of 1942, and the first [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] came off the line in October 1942. At {{convert|3,500,000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}}, it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time. At its peak in 1944, the Willow Run plant produced 650 B-24s per month, and by 1945 Ford was completing each B-24 in eighteen hours, with one rolling off the assembly line every 58 minutes.&lt;ref name=Willowrun&gt;Nolan, Jenny.

When Edsel Ford died prematurely in 1943, Henry Ford nominally resumed control of the company, but a series of strokes in the late 1930s had left him increasingly debilitated, and his mental ability was fading. Ford was increasingly sidelined, and others made decisions in his name.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; The company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by [[Charles Sorensen]], an important engineer and production executive at Ford; and [[Harry Bennett]], the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied on, and enforced discipline upon, Ford employees. Ford grew jealous of the publicity Sorensen received and forced Sorensen out in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) pp. 522–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's incompetence led to discussions in Washington about how to restore the company, whether by wartime government fiat, or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp324–333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=324–333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing happened until 1945 when, with bankruptcy a serious risk, Edsel's widow led an ouster and installed her son, [[Henry Ford II]], as president.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Brock.

[[File:1920 International Jew reprint from Dearborn Independent.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ford publication ''[[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]''. Articles from ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', 1920]]

In the early 1920s, Ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views. At the same time, Ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers, and was not accused of discrimination against Jewish workers or suppliers. He also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Howard P. Segal |title=Recasting the Machine Age: Henry Ford's Village Industries |year=2008 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Ford's closest aide and private secretary, [[Ernest G. Liebold]], purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for Ford, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. The ''Independent'' ran for eight years, from 1920 until 1927, with Liebold as editor. Every Ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers.

During this period, Ford emerged as "a respected spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice", reaching around 700,000 readers through his newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Glock, Charles Y. and Quinley, Harold E. (1983). ''Anti-Semitism in America''. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|087855940X}}, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 documentary film ''[[Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story]]'' (written by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Ira Berkow]]) states that Ford wrote on May 22, 1920: "If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew."&lt;ref name="nyblueprint1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id=824 |title=Jews and Baseball Is a Film You Should Catch |first=Alan|last=Zeitlin|publisher=The New York Blueprint |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210065732/http://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id=824|archivedate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Ford's antisemitic articles from ''The Dearborn Independent'' were issued in four volumes, cumulatively titled ''[[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]'' published by [[Theodor Fritsch]], founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In a letter written in 1924, [[Heinrich Himmler]] described Ford as "one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen|first1=Michael Thad|title=The Business of Genocide: The SS, Slave Labor, and the Concentration Camps |date=2002 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=978-0807826775|pages=14, 290}}  See also, {{cite book |last=Pfal-Traughber|first=Armin|title=Der antisemitisch-antifreimaurerische Verschwörungsmythos in der Weimarer Republik und im NS-Staat|year=1993|publisher=Braumüller|location=Vienna|page=39}}.

[from] the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions."

[[File:Service Cross of the German Eagle.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], an award bestowed on Ford by Nazi Germany]]

On February 1, 1924, Ford received [[Kurt Ludecke]], a representative of Hitler, at home. Ludecke was introduced to Ford by [[Siegfried Wagner]] (son of the composer [[Richard Wagner]]) and his wife [[Winifred Wagner|Winifred]], both [[Nazi]] sympathizers and antisemites. Ludecke asked Ford for a contribution to the Nazi cause, but was apparently refused.&lt;ref&gt;Max Wallace. ''The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich'', (Macmillan, 2004), pp. 50–54, {{ISBN|0312335318}}. Years later, in 1977, Winifred claimed that Ford had told her that he had helped finance Hitler. This anecdote is the suggestion that Ford made a contribution. The company has always denied that any contribution was made, and no documentary evidence has ever been found. ''ibid'' p. 54. See also [[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Neil Baldwin]], ''Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate'' (Public Affairs, 2002), pp. 185–89, {{ISBN|1586481630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ford's articles were denounced by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned [[Pogram|pogroms]] and violence against Jews, but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Henry (2003). ''The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|0766178293}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; None of this work was written by Ford, but he allowed his name to be used as author. According to trial testimony, he wrote almost nothing. Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the ''Independent'' and that he probably never read the articles (he claimed he only read the headlines).&lt;ref&gt;Watts pp. x, 376–87; Lewis (1976) pp. 135–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Court testimony in a [[libel]] suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the ''Independent'' in advance of publication.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

A libel lawsuit was brought by San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer [[Aaron Sapiro]] in response to the antisemitic remarks, and led Ford to close the ''Independent'' in December 1927. News reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature. During the trial, the editor of Ford's "Own Page", William Cameron, testified that Ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to Ford for his approval.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, (1976) pp. 140–56; Baldwin pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Max Wallace]] noted that "whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when James M. Miller, a former ''Dearborn Independent'' employee, swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American Axis: Ford, Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] observed:

{{quote|That Cameron would have continued to publish such anti-Semitic material without Ford's explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men. Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, remarked that "I don't think Mr. Cameron ever wrote anything for publication without Mr. Ford's approval."&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael (1996). ''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement''. UNC Press. {{ISBN|0807846384}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Spencer Blakeslee:

{{quote|The ADL mobilized prominent Jews and non-Jews to publicly oppose Ford's message. They formed a coalition of Jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the Detroit press. Before leaving his presidency early in 1921, [[Woodrow Wilson]] joined other leading Americans in a statement that rebuked Ford and others for their antisemitic campaign. A boycott against Ford products by Jews and liberal Christians also had an impact, and Ford shut down the paper in 1927, recanting his views in a public letter to [[Sigmund Livingston]], ADL.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Spencer (2000). ''The Death of American Antisemitism''. Praeger/Greenwood. {{ISBN|0275965082}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wallace also found that Ford's apology was likely, at least partly, motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of Ford cars.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; Up until the apology, a considerable number of dealers, who had been required to make sure that buyers of Ford cars received the ''Independent'', bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

Ford's 1927 apology was well received. "Four-Fifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 were from Jews, and almost without exception they praised the industrialist."&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{Cite book|first=David I. |last=Lewis |title=The Public Image of Henry Ford: An American Folk Hero and His Company |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1976|isbn=978-0814315538}}, pp. 146–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1937, a Ford statement to the ''Detroit Jewish Chronicle'' disavowed "any connection whatsoever with the publication in Germany of a book known as the ''International Jew''."&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

According to Pool and Pool (1978),&lt;ref name="Pool_and_Pool_1978"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pool|Pool|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's retraction and apology (which were written by others) were not even truly signed by him (rather, his signature was forged by [[Harry Bennett]]), and Ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views, stating in 1940: "I hope to republish ''The International Jew'' again some time."

In July 1938, before the outbreak of war, the German consul at Cleveland gave Ford, on his 75th birthday, the award of the [[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner.&lt;ref name='WP'&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration|date=November 30, 1998 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James D. Mooney]], vice president of overseas operations for [[General Motors]], received a similar medal, the Merit Cross of the German Eagle, First Class.&lt;ref name='WP'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, David R. (2002). ''Sloan Rules: Alfred P. Sloan and the Triumph of General Motors''. University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0226238040}}, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1942, Ford wrote a letter to [[Sigmund Livingston]] as the Founder and National Chairman of the [[Anti-Defamation League]].  The purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly, "any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my Jewish fellow citizens." He concluded the letter with "My sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished, hatred of the Jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time."&lt;ref name=Arnstein&gt;"Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years" (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution of ''The International Jew'' was halted in 1942 through legal action by Ford, despite complications from a lack of copyright.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; It is still banned in Germany. Extremist groups often recycle the material; it still appears on [[antisemitic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] websites.

Testifying at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]], convicted [[Hitler Youth]] leader [[Baldur von Schirach]] who, in his role as military governor of [[Vienna]], deported 65,000 Jews to camps in Poland, stated:

{{quote|The decisive anti-Semitic book I was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was ... that book by Henry Ford, ''[[The International Jew]]''. I read it and became anti-Semitic. The book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in Henry Ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baldur von Schirach before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg |date=May 23, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Der internationale Jude]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Lacey wrote in ''Ford: The Men and the Machines'' that a close Willow Run associate of Ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the [[Nazi concentration camps]], he "was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed, he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious."&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 1986, pp. 218–19; which in turn cites:
* [[Bentley Historical Library]], Josephine Fellows Gomon papers, Box 10, draft manuscript, ''The Poor Mr Ford''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1947 at age 83.&lt;ref name="AP-1947.04.08" /&gt;

==International business==
Ford's philosophy was one of [[Economic nationalism|economic independence]] for the United States. His [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge Plant]] became the world's largest industrial complex, pursuing [[vertical integration]] to such an extent that it could produce its own steel. Ford's goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade. He believed in the global expansion of his company. He believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace, and he used the assembly line process and production of the Model T to demonstrate it.&lt;ref&gt;Watts 236–40&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened Ford assembly plants in Britain and Canada in 1911, and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries. In 1912, Ford cooperated with [[Giovanni Agnelli]] of [[Fiat]] to launch the first Italian automotive assembly plants. The first plants in Germany were built in the 1920s with the encouragement of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Commerce Department, which agreed with Ford's theory that international trade was essential to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents. Ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] jungle called [[Fordlândia]]; it was one of his few failures.

&lt;/ref&gt; The contract involved the purchase of $30,000,000 worth of knocked-down Ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant's operation, after which the plant would gradually switch to Soviet-made components. Ford sent his engineers and technicians to the Soviet Union to help install the equipment and train the working force, while over a hundred Soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at Ford's plants in Detroit and Dearborn "for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the Company's plants."&lt;ref&gt;

Ford's image transfixed Europeans, especially the Germans, arousing the "fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all".&lt;ref&gt;Nolan p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Germans who discussed "Fordism" often believed that it represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service—an "American thing" that represented the [[culture of the United States]]. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, "Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.

In ''My Life and Work'', Ford predicted that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] models and would truly benefit all peoples.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_pp242-244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage pp. 242–44].&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.

==Racing==
[[File:Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield with Old 999, 1902.jpg|thumb|Ford (standing) launched [[Barney Oldfield]]'s career in 1902]]

Ford maintained an interest in auto racing from 1901 to 1913 and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver, later turning the wheel over to hired drivers. He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an "ocean-to-ocean" (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.

In ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.&lt;ref name="Ford_Crowther_1922_p50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage p. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.

Nevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9KOHEPbBBbIC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=henry+ford+Motorsports+Hall+of+Fame+of+America+in+1996#v=snippet&amp;q=Hall%20of%20fame%20henry%20ford|title=The Intellectual Devotional Modern Culture: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Converse Confidently with the Culturati|last=Kidder|first=David S.|last2=Oppenheim|first2=Noah D.|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1605297934|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency. By this point in his life, he had had several cardiovascular events (variously cited as heart attacks or strokes) and was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp100_266_et_al"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=100, 266, 271–72, 310–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the directors did not want to see him as President. But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had ''de facto'' control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp325–326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=325–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he served until the end of the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10&amp;nbsp;million a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1943|r=-4}}}} today). The administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp324–333" /&gt; but the idea never progressed.

[[File:Henry Ford grave Ford Cemetery Detroit.JPG|thumb|right|Ford grave, Ford Cemetery]]
His health failing, Ford ceded the company Presidency to his grandson, [[Henry Ford II]], in September 1945 and went into retirement. He died on April 7, 1947, of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at [[Fair Lane]], his estate in Dearborn, at the age of 83. A public viewing was held at Greenfield Village where up to 5,000 people per hour filed past the casket. Funeral services were held in Detroit's [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] and he was buried in the Ford Cemetery in Detroit.&lt;ref name="AP-1947.04.08"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader in Production Founded Vast Empire in Motors in 1903.

&lt;!--On the night of his death, the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] had flooded the local power station and had left Ford's house without electricity. Before going to sleep, Henry and his wife lit candles and oil lamps to light the house. Later that evening, just before dawn, he died.--&gt;

==Personal interests==
A compendium of short biographies of famous [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], published by a Freemason lodge, lists Ford as a member.&lt;ref name="Denslow2004p62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Denslow|2004|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Lodge of New York]] confirms that Ford was a Freemason, and was raised in Palestine Lodge No. 357, Detroit, in 1894. When he received the 33rd degree of the [[Scottish Rite]] in 1940, he said, "Masonry is the best balance wheel the United States has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |publisher=MWGLNY |title=Famous Masons |date=January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Ford's pastor, and head of his sociology department, Episcopal minister Samuel S. Marquis, claimed that Ford believed, or "once believed," in [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, Samuel S. ([1923]/2007). Henry Ford: An Interpretation. ''Wayne State University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford published an anti-smoking book, circulated to youth in 1914, called ''The Case Against the Little White Slaver'', which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicolegal.tripod.com/ford1914.htm The Case Against the Little White Slaver]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment, so Ford's opposition to cigarettes was unusual.

===Interest in materials science and engineering===
Henry Ford long had an interest in [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]]. He enthusiastically described his company's adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic R&amp;D work.&lt;ref name="Ford1922pp18_65-67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage 18],[https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage 65–67].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products, especially [[soybean]]s. He cultivated a relationship with [[George Washington Carver]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/stories-of-innovation/visionaries/george-washington-carver/|title=George Washington Carver – Visionaries on Innovation |website=www.thehenryford.org|language=en|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/george-washington-carver-begins-experimental-project-with-henry-ford|title=George Washington Carver begins experimental project with Henry Ford – Jul 19, 1942 |work=HISTORY.com|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/197274/|title=George Washington Carver Examining Soy Fiber, Soybean Laboratory at Greenfield Village, 1939 |website=www.thehenryford.org|language=en|access-date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soybean-based plastics were used in Ford automobiles throughout the 1930s in plastic parts such as car horns, in paint, etc. This project culminated in 1942, when Ford [[Soybean Car|patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic]], attached to a tubular welded frame. It weighed 30% less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel. Furthermore, it ran on grain alcohol ([[ethanol]]) instead of gasoline. The design never caught on.&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was interested in [[engineered wood]]s ("Better wood can be made than is grown"&lt;ref name="Ford1922p281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage p. 281].&lt;/ref&gt;) (at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas); [[Biofuel|corn as a fuel source]], via both corn oil and ethanol;&lt;ref name="Ford1922pp275-276"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage pp. 275–276].&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential uses of cotton.&lt;ref name="Ford1922p281" /&gt; Ford was instrumental in developing charcoal [[Briquette|briquets]], under the brand name "[[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]]". His brother in law, [[E.G. Kingsford]], used wood scraps from the Ford factory to make the briquets.

In 1927 Ford partnered with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in Fort Myers, Florida, to look for a native source of rubber.

Ford was a [[List of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]] and was awarded 161 U.S. patents.

===Florida and Georgia residences and community===
Ford had a vacation residence in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] next to that of [[Thomas Edison]], which he bought in 1915 and used until approximately 1930. It is still in existence today and is open as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org | title=Fort Myers Museums, Attractions, Things to do &amp;#124; Edison Ford Winter Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also had a vacation home (known today as the "Ford Plantation") in [[Richmond Hill, Georgia|Richmond Hill]], Georgia which is still in existence today as a private community. Ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned 70,000 acres (110 square miles) there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seibert |first1=David |title=Henry Ford at Richmond Hill |url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bryan/henry-ford-at-richmond-hill|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Ford broke ground for a beautiful [[Greek revival]] style mansion on the banks of the [[Ogeechee River]] on the site of a 1730s plantation. The grand house, made of Savannah-gray brick, had marble steps, air conditioning, and an [[elevator]]. It sat on 55 acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens. The house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and the DuPonts. It remains the centerpiece of The Ford Plantation today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordplantation.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ford converted the 1870s-era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home, providing it with steam. He contributed substantially to the community, building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents.

===Preserving Americana===
Ford had an interest in "[[Americana]]". In the 1920s, Ford began work to turn [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], Massachusetts, into a themed historical village. He moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme, "[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]", from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], Massachusetts, and purchased the historic [[Wayside Inn]]. This plan never saw fruition. Ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan. It may have inspired the creation of [[Old Sturbridge Village]] as well. About the same time, he began collecting materials for [[The Henry Ford|his museum]], which had a theme of practical technology. It was opened in 1929 as the Edison Institute. Although greatly modernized, the museum continues today.

The '''IT interaction model''' is a [[holistic]] view of [[Management Information Systems]] in the context of the organization. According to [[Mark S. Silver]], the model addresses the interaction of an information system's features with five elements of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | last2 = Markus
  | first2 = ML

#Its external environment
#Its strategy
#Its structure and culture
#Its business processes
#Its IT infrastructure.

The model considers the consequences of this interaction for system use, for organizational performance, for the organization's personnel, and for the firm's future flexibility. Moreover, the model relates various aspects of the interaction process to the phases of the development and implementation lifecycles.

Tools such as [[Porter's five forces]], value chain analysis and [[SWOT analysis]] can be used to analyze a company's strategy. Information flow diagrams can be used to analyze a company's business processes.

In [[New Zealand]] an '''incorporated society''' is a group of at least 15 people who have applied for registration under the ''Incorporated Societies Act 1908''.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|last1=New Zealand Companies Office|website=Societies and Trusts online|title=An overview|url=http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies/starting-an-incorporated-society/an-overview|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|last1=New Zealand Companies Office|website=Societies and Trusts online|title=Rules of incorporated societies|url=http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies/rules-of-incorporated-societies|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once registered the [[Society]] constitutes a distinct [[Legal person|legal entity]] which provides protection to members from debts, contracts etc.  In return, members do not have a personal [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules|financial interest]] in the property or assets (if any) owned by the society.

To maintain registration, annual returns must be made to the Registrar of Incorporated Societies [http://www.societies.govt.nz/pls/web/dbssiten.main].  At any stage the Society may be wound up by members' resolution, creditors or the Registrar (if compliance is not maintained).

An international colour day (ICD) has been considered as appropriate since [[colour]] is, thanks to [[visual perception]], one of the most influential phenomena in people’s lives and also one of the channels that contributes most greatly to the perception of reality. All around the world memorable colour activities are increasingly being developed during the International Colour Day.

==Background==
The adoption of an international day of colour was proposed in 2008 by the Portuguese Color Association, whose president, [http://www.fa.ulisboa.pt/docentes/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1398%3Amaria-joao-de-carvalho-durao-dos-santos&amp;catid=78%3Adefault-registration&amp;lang=pt Maria Joao Durao], presented the idea to the [[International Colour Association]]. The proposal was agreed in 2009 among the members of this society, which is composed of national associations and members representing more than 30 countries.

==Why March 21st / The Equinox==
The choice of the date comprised a good deal of discussion. Among all suggestions, the idea exposed by Leonhard Oberascher (from Austria) prevailed: every year, March 21 is the “[[equinox]]” – aequus (equal) and nox (night). Around the equinox, the night and day are approximately equally long, symbolically relating to the complementary nature of [[light]] and darkness, light and shadow expressed in all human cultures.

==Logo==
There was an international competition for the design of the logo, and the winner was announced at the 2012 meeting of the [[International Colour Association]], AIC 2012 held in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. As expressed by designer Hosanna Yau, from Hong Kong, "two circles form an eye, with an equal half of rainbow color and black representing light and darkness, day and night, everyone feast one's eye on the international color day."

==Activities==
Some of the activities and events that are unfolded on the International Colour Day: 
* Arts exhibitions, architectural projects, design, decoration, fashion....
* Meetings, debates, scientific events...
* Workshops on the use of [[colour]] and [[light]] for both adults and children.
* Contests on colour and light design.
* Wearing national or regional identity colours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15021">'''Job sharing''' or '''work sharing''' is an [[employment]] arrangement where typically two people are retained on a [[part-time]] or reduced-time basis to perform a job normally fulfilled by one person working [[full-time]]. Since all positions are shared thus leads to a net reduction in per-employee income. The people sharing the job work as a team to complete the job task and are equally responsible for the job workload. [[Remuneration|Compensation]] is apportioned between the workers. Working hours, pay and holidays are divided equally. The [[Pay-as-you-earn tax|''pay as you go'']] system helps make deductions for national insurance and [[Superannuation Act 2010|superannuations]] are made as a straightforward percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1792857|year=1991|author1=Baildam|first1=E. M.|title=Job sharing|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=66|issue=3|pages=282–283|last2=Ewing|first2=C. I.|last3=Jones|first3=R|last4=Cummins|first4=M|pmid=2025001|doi=10.1136/adc.66.3.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the United States==
The news media began reporting in earnest on job sharing in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careerplanning.about.com/od/jobsharing/a/job_sharing.htm|title=Job Sharing - An Interview|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice was most often described as a solution tailored for women, as one Associated Press article summarized, "a compromise between fulltime housework and [[full-time]] employment".&lt;ref name=boston_ap&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bRgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wzUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=job-sharing&amp;pg=7290%2C2397709|title=Rome News-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In 1972 the New Ways to Work Foundation was funded, it is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in the San Francisco Bay area. Its main focus was to help "establish a work world that responds to the changing needs of individuals and organizations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Olmsted, Barney: And Others Job Sharing in the Public Sector. New Ways to Work, Palo Alto, Calif.; Women's Bureau Washington, D. C.  Retrieved 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 the International Personnel Management Association and the Institute of [[Local government|Local Self Government]] joined with New Ways to Work to sponsor a conference on job sharing in the public sector. More than 80 public agencies sent representatives who were to learn about the experiences in  increasing the number of job sharing projects.  The Part Time Career Employment Act pl 95-437 was passed in 1978 as well. It narrowed the definition of part-time career employment from scheduled work of less than 40 hours a week to scheduled work between 16–32 hours per week.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===2000s===
Job sharing became even more prevalent during the 2000s, as women have succeeded professionally in greater numbers and proportionally seek out alternative work arrangements.&lt;ref name="mckay" /&gt; in the early 2000s, two important factors began to push the job sharing movement. The access to information became increasingly easy to access and the demographics in the workforce began to change. The birth of the World Wide Web made it easier for companies and job share participants to share information through web tools like email, instant messaging, web portals, online databases and multi-user domains, these web tools allowed employees to share work in a more collaborative environment and in an [[asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]] manner. The ever-changing [[demographics]] in the United States also drove the job sharing arrangement. With most of the [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]] generation leaving the United States workforce and retiring, generation X and Y transitioned their lifestyles to an even better balance between family and work. Gender has also impacted the work force demographics: in 2004, women made up 59% of the workforce, with 50% of them in management professional positions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;7.Crampton, Suzanne; Douglas, Ceasar; Hodge, John; and Mishra, Jitendra (2003) "Job Sharing: Challenges and Opportunities," Seidman Business Review: Vol. 9: Iss. 1, Article 11.Available at: h p://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/sbr/vol9/iss1/11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], [[teacher|teaching]] and [[library]] professions are cited as more commonly using job sharing. Some companies that use job sharing include [[New York Life Insurance Company]], [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]], and [[Walgreens]] drugstores.&lt;ref name="lussier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/121136-1.html|title=Should your organization use job sharing? - Labor &amp; Employment &gt; Working Hours &amp; Patterns from AllBusiness.com|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern implementation in pharmacy academia====
In pharmacy academia, job-sharing has been seen as a tool to help encourage and increase female employment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Kelly C.|last2=Finks|first2=Shannon W.|date=2009-11-12|title=Job Sharing for Women Pharmacists in Academia|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=73|issue=7|pages=135|issn=0002-9459|pmc=2779650|pmid=19960092|doi=10.5688/aj7307135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female [[pharmacist]]s, compared to males, desire to work part-time earlier on in their careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a shortage in the pharmacy field of women due to some employers not providing flexible enough schedules to match the desires of female employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In academia a similar problem exists, only  20% of full professors were women in 2007 even though 66% of students enrolled in pharmacy schools are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to retain and increase female employment in the educational field, the [[University of Tennessee]] College of Pharmacy implemented job-sharing in 2007 and has observed a noticeable improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In other countries and areas==
===South Africa===
In South Africa, job sharing has been implemented into the work force. CEO of ''[http://www.kelly.co.za/job-opportunities Kelly]'', South Africa's first job recruitment agency, Kayee Vittee, believes "The more pressure exists in the workplace, the more severe the impact on quality and productivity.  Subsequently, this also has a detrimental effect on employees' wellbeing in general".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnews.co.za/article/11555/job-sharing-the-answer-to-work-life-balance|title=Job sharing, the answer to work-life balance?|website=www.rnews.co.za|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]]'', a South African trade union that also protects and negotiates workers rights recently developed a social plan that encourages job share as an optimum alternative to full-time jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; South Africa's current economy, as of April, 2016, is erratic and unemployment rate is high, so South African citizens unfortunately do not see job share as a solution though it is a beneficial resolution for the current economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Jeremy Hayman, a senior lecturer at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]] of Technology in [[New Zealand]] specializing in Human Resource Management and Employee Relations collected data and completed a questionnaire from office employees in a large Western Australia university.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/1869_HAYMANJEREMY_104.PDF|title="Flexible Work Arrangements: Exploring the Linkages between Perceived Usability of Flexible Work Schedules and Work/life Balance."|last=Hayman|first=Jeremy|date=October 28, 2016|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the study was limited to University employees, the primary and recognized finding is that the flexibility provided by job sharing can benefit the integration of work, family and personal life, ultimately providing a better work experience for the employee and a better work environment especially in women aged 30–39.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Though the literature on job share in Australia is largely under represented compared to other developed countries, Hayman's research was more responsive then other preexisting Australian surveys regarding job share. The findings for this study is a great foundation for the future of  job share  in Australia and transforming management practice and work and social life balance.

===Europe===
The United Kingdom has implemented job sharing for a while. In many European countries, the  job sharing arrangement is already a common practice in the workforce. Companies in countries like the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]] have just recently supported job sharing on widespread scale without contractual restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other European countries like [[Slovenia]] and [[Slovakia]] have enforced legitimate job share governing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A European union agency, ''[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|Eurofound]]'', was created by the European council in May 1975 to create better working and living environments for Europeans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/job-sharing-0|title=Job Sharing|last=|first=|date=June 15, 2015|website=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/|publisher=|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|Eurofound]]'' meets annually to decide new policies and adapt to changing times and in 2015, ''Eurofound'' formally defined job sharing as a new form of employment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Caribbean===
Caribbean countries like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Haiti]] have also begun to practice job sharing. A few of the Caribbean islands in the Western hemisphere that have yet to adapt to the growth in the economy can possibly benefit most from job share. Many of these Caribbean countries and islands have experienced a large number of  their qualified human capital who have moved towards the United States mainland, making the job supply and demand market more inconsistent and the economy more unstable.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=ec1fcb57-ab5b-4e4a-b95c-3c43fa5ea619%40sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4105|title="Job-Sharing Is Worth Exploring."|last=MONCLOVA,|first=HÉCTOR|date=January 31, 2013|work=|access-date=October 28, 2016|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job share program proves to be a very cost conscious from economic and business prospects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
Employees who switch to job share from a full-time job often feel less stressed because they have more time for social and family personal activities. The millennial generation and its ever-changing demographics with more women in the work force has made accomplishing the balance of career and personal life a little harder, hence making job sharing a viable and even preferred solution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Job share has proven to be extremely convenient to expecting mothers, mothers and caretakers by providing them with a more flexible and less demanding job schedule and load and allowing them to take care of their dependents. Job share employees who don’t have a constant workload and do not need to constantly commute to a job on a daily basis, lowers their stress levels, resulting in healthier lives and work-life balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2013/07/30/job-sharing-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/|title=Job Sharing—The Advantages and Disadvantages|date=30 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For employees seeking more free time for themselves, job sharing may be a way to take back more control of their personal lives.&lt;ref name="javitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/humanresources/employeemanagementcolumnistdavidjavitch/article170244.html#ixzz0JPCmZEYt&amp;C|title=The Pros and Cons of Job Sharing - Entrepreneur.com|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Employees who job share frequently attribute their decision to an improvement in "[[quality of life]]".&lt;ref name="javitch" /&gt;

For an employer, job sharing is a benefit because it keeps two valuable employers, thereby increasing intellectual capital and experience.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED504841.pdf|title=Integration Of Learning And Practice For Job Sharing Partnerships|last=Dixon-Krausse|first=Pamela Marie|date=2007|website=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED504841.pdf|publisher=ERIC|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Job sharing can also prevent future employee burnouts from high stress careers while also making the work atmosphere more enjoyable for all. Successful job share pairing creates a mutual relationship and feel accountable for one another, consequently increasing the accomplishments they achieve together. Studies have shown that net productivity increases when two people share the same 40-hour job, making for a more effective and more than likely profitable workplace for the employer.

===Disadvantages===
Job share can be conflicting if the job share participants/employees are not open to a mutual agreement to distribute everything from salary, workload and time off. Job sharing can also be a disadvantage if the employee cannot afford the part-time wages or benefits. It is also possible that job sharing can make an employee feel less adequate over time and cause less productivity over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the job share arrangement is not effective, the transition period to finding another partner could be disruptive and detrimental to the remaining employee. If proper communication and effort does not happen between the job share participants, job share can be a negative experience because the coworkers can not be held accountable to the same expectations, shifting the delicate balance of the job share arrangement.

The disadvantages for employers can start immediately if the employer is not able to successfully match two people to the job share arrangement.This can negatively effect management because of the extra effort and time could take to produce a harmonious job share arrangement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Though job share arrangements generally split the salary in half, training two employees for a job that can be satisfied by one employee could increase administrative costs. Employers may also experience a more difficult time finding prospective employees who genuinely want to participate in job share.&lt;ref name="boston_ap" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Jon Barela was born and raised in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], and attended Las Cruces High School.  He earned a bachelor's degree in History and Diplomacy from the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.)  in 1984.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;[http://sfs.georgetown.edu/ Georgetown]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from [[Georgetown University]] School of Foreign Service,&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Barela joined the staff of New Mexico Congressman [[Joe Skeen]].  As a senior aide to the Congressman, he focused on the House appropriations and legislative process. While working for Congressman Skeen, Barela earned his law degree from [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonbarela.com/Bio.aspx|title=About Jon|publisher=Jon Barela campaign website|year=2009|accessdate=2010-10-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008021136/http://jonbarela.com/Bio.aspx|archivedate=2010-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Barela returned to New Mexico in 1987 and joined the Modrall law firm in Albuquerque. Four years later, he became New Mexico's Assistant Attorney General and Director of the Civil Division under then Attorney General [[Hal Stratton]].

In 1993, Barela joined [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] as its community and government relations manager. He set company benchmarks for outreach into underrepresented communities and was awarded the Intel Achievement Award, the company's highest and most selective honor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Barela left Intel in 2005.

;Cerelink
After spending most of his career as an attorney and as a state and federal lobbyist, in 2002 Barela decided to become a business owner and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Economic Development Web Site http://www.gonm.biz/About_NMEDD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded Cerelink, a technology start-up firm that specialized in complex computer rendering for visual effects in Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;"Luring Hollywood to Cloud Computing," Michael White, RREDC, Bloomberg News, Cerelink News Release, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to founding Cerelink, Barela had no prior experience in technology development for the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;NMEDD Web Site http://www.gonm.biz/About_NMEDD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 2010 congressional campaign, Barela frequently cited his work at Cerelink when described himself as a successful entrepreneur. In 2011, he was questioned by media outlets on whether Cerelink was the beneficiary of tax credits from state government.&lt;ref name="Ducks"&gt;"Barela Ducks Questions About State Film Rebate Program, New Mexico Independent, October 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, Barela told KKOB-AM that those reports were "erroneous."&lt;ref name="Ducks"/&gt; He told the Albuquerque Journal that his company "never received any tax credits, period. That is just flatly inaccurate it is just wrong."&lt;ref&gt;"Barela Touts His NM Roots, DC Experience," Michael Coleman, ABQ Journal. October 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Albuquerque Journal reported that Cerelink had stopped operations and was bankrupt, leaving the New Mexico Computer Application Center with an outstanding bill of $934,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Hollywood Flop," Kevin Robinson-Avila, "Albuquerque Journal," July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Barela maintains that he had no involvement with Cerelink since 2009, when he resigned from the board and reduced his stake in the company to less than 1 percent of shares.

== Community affairs ==
Barela has made competitiveness and improving education central themes in his chairmanship of several significant organizations, including the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce (one of the country's largest Hispanic chambers), New Mexico First (the state's leading nonpartisan public policy group),
New Mexico's Work Force Development Board, and the [[Albuquerque Public Schools]] Foundation.
He most recently served on the [[Albuquerque Public Schools]] [[Board of Education]], helping oversee operations of one of the country's largest school districts.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela bio" /&gt; The school board passed a policy that replaced a hot lunch with a meal that included a cheese sandwich, milk or juice, and carrot sticks when the children' parents fell behind with their lunch payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/upfront/0110322upfront02-01-09.htm |title=Cheese Sandwich Debate Borders on the Ridiculous |publisher=Albuquerque Journal |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barela supported the policy, "We don't want to be bailing people out of their responsibility because they know the community is going to step up and pay this bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/2411406metro01-24-09.htm |title=APS Seeks Sandwich Alternative  |publisher=Albuquerque Journal |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 U.S. Congressional campaign ==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New Mexico, 2010#District 1}}
Barela challenged Democratic incumbent [[Martin Heinrich]] for {{ushr|NM|1}}, but was ultimately defeated in a 51%-49% race on election night. After the election, he was appointed by Governor [[Susana Martinez]] to serve as secretary of New Mexico's Economic Development Department.

Barela ran unopposed in the primary for [[New Mexico's 1st congressional district]] Republican nomination.&lt;ref name="NM House Candidates" /&gt;

=== Political positions ===
Barela has signed the [[Americans for Tax Reform]] "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", a written promise by legislators and candidates for office that commits them to oppose tax increases.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela Issues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonbarela.com/ISSUES.aspx |title=Issues |publisher=Jon Barela campaign website |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008021234/http://jonbarela.com/ISSUES.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He supports programs to encourage parents' involvement in their children's education, and successful programs which show parents and children the connection between education and future success, such as the [[Young Enterprise#Learn To Earn|"Learn and Earn"]] program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} He cites his experience in the community working on behalf of educational programs as indication that he knows what works and what does not. In regard to the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], Barela prefers removing legislative and regulatory barriers to providing insurance, such as allowing interstate pooling for insurance purchase, rather than further government intervention in the health care system.&lt;ref name="Jon Barela Issues" /&gt;

Barela has received the highest rating from the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrapvf.org/upcoming-elections/New-Mexico.aspx |title=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund: New Mexico |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009093508/http://www.nrapvf.org/upcoming-elections/New-Mexico.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gun Owners of America]] also gave him their highest rating and their endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031142902/http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knight Michiel Reiniersz Pauw''' (29 March 1590 in [[Amsterdam]]&lt;ref&gt;Baptized 8 April 1590 in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], Mijchgiel, son of Reijier Pau and Cornelisgen Mijchgiels {{cite web |url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/doopregisters/zoek/index.nl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722201159/https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/doopregisters/zoek/index.nl.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 20 March 1640 in [[Ghent]]) was a [[burgomaster|burgemeester]] of [[Amsterdam]] and a director of the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/Our_Country_Vol_1/newnether_eg.html|title=New Netherland Colony|website=www.publicbookshelf.com|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Amsterdam]] in a rich merchant family - his father, Reinier Pauw (1564–1636) wasn't only a merchant, but also a [[Mayor of Amsterdam]]  - and studied law in [[Leiden]].
His brother [[Adriaan Pauw]]
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herenvanholland.nl/eigenaar.cfm?eigenaarnummer=472{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1581 - February 21, 1653 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060208112405/http://home.zonnet.nl/d.van.duijvenbode/geschmin.htm]) was [[Grand Pensionary]] of [[Holland]] from 1631 to 1636 and from 1651 to 1653, and signatory of the [[Peace of Münster]] (1648) for which he was instrumental as ambassador for Holland.

The WIC was founded in 1621 to exploit trade in the [[Western Hemisphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/westind.htm|title=The Avalon Project : Charter of the Dutch West India Company : 1621|publisher=|accessdate=24 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014040932/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/westind.htm|archivedate=14 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1625 had established a colony at [[Fort Amsterdam]] ([[Lower Manhattan]]) and [[Fort Orange]]. In the hope of encouraging settlement the company, in 1629, started to offer vast land grants and the feudal title of [[patroon]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Johan van Hartskamp, De Westindische Compangnie en haar Belangen in Niuew-Nederland, een overzicht (1621-1664)http://stuyvesant.library.uu.nl {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206205901/http://stuyvesant.library.uu.nl/ |date=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the [[Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions]]. In 1630, Pauw purchased two tracts from the [[Lenape]] at Hopoghan Hackingh ([[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]) and at Ashasimus ([[Harsimus]]), covering the entire peninsula between the [[Hudson River]] and [[Hackensack River]] now known as [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], as well as a third purchase of Staten Eylandt ([[Staten Island]]), now part of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/historyofcountyo01winfWinfiled, CHarles (1874) History of the county of Hudson, New Jersey : from its earliest settlement to the present time pp.13-25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[patroon]]ship was given the [[Latin]]ized form of his surname (which means "peacock"), [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]. It is said it was sold to him by the Manhattans after they had retreated there after the sale of their home island to [[Peter Minuit]] some years before. Initially, a small hut and ferry landing were built at Arresick, called Powles Hoek ([[Paulus Hook]]), but Pauw failed to fulfill the other conditions set forth by the company (which included populating the area with at least fifty adults),&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and was later required to sell his interests back to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellscraft.com/DutchEnglishOnHudson/DutchEnglishOnHudsonCh03.html|title=The Dutch and English on the Hudson: Chapter 3|website=www.kellscraft.com|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1634 he collaborated with [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]] and [[Wouter van Twiller]] in sending cattle (horses and cows) in the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;NA 373, f. 129-130, Not. W. Cluijt, 13 April 1634&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Pavonia remains as an avenue and library branch in contemporary Jersey City. There is also a Pavonia Court in Bayonne and Pavonia Avenue in Kearny. [[Erie Railroad]]'s Hudson waterfront terminus was called [[Pavonia Terminal]] located nearby [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] rapid transit system's station once called [[Newport (PATH station)|Pavonia]]. [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)|Saint Peter's College]], located on land that was part of the patroonship, has as its mascot a peacock.

Pavonia was not the only American territory that would bear his name.
First described by [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]], who traveled with a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition of [[Gonçalo Coelho]] to [[Brazil]] in the year 1503, the [[Fernando de Noronha]] Archipelago was invaded by the [[England|English]], and from 1556 until 1612, was held by the [[France|French]]. In 1628, it was occupied by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who were displaced two years later by a [[Spain|Spanish]]-Portuguese military expedition led by [[Rui Calaza Borges]]. The Dutch occupied the island once again in 1635, making it a hospital for their troops who occupied Northeastern Brazil (the Brazilian coast between Rio São Francisco and Maranhão). The island became known as ''[[Fernando de Noronha|Pavonia]]'', in honor of Pauw. It would remain under Dutch control for nearly twenty years, when it was reconquered by Portugal.

Pauw was apparently very successful, and was able to commission one of the most popular architects of the period to build a ''grachtenpand'', or canal house, in Amsterdam. It may be seen in the two lead images for this article. Clad in white sandstone imported from Germany it, was the first in the city to have a ''neck'' [[gable]].

A formal investigation has been opened in July 2017 into "possible favouritism" in the organisation of a Las Vegas technology event by Business France under the tenure of Penicaud.  The French daily ''Libération'' recently underlined that she was suspected of having provided a "truncated overview of the audit" to Business France's board of directors.

As a human resources director at Danone in the 1990s, Muriel Pénicaud made $1.4&amp;nbsp;million from stock options while cutting 900 jobs, according to Bloomberg.

'''''Muro-Ami''''' (''Reef Hunters'') is a  1999 [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino film]] that depicts one of the worst forms of [[child labor]] in the illegal fishing system. The film follows the story of Fredo, a ruthless captain of 150 [[muro-ami]] divers, who employ illegal fishing practices, such as pounding and crushing corals to scare fish, driving them towards the nets. With a high quota to meet, Fredo forces the divers, who consist mostly of children, to accomplish at least eight dives a day to meet their goal before the millennium. Tired and harassed after the burdensome task being given to them, the children have to make do in subhuman conditions in the Muro Ami boat, ''The Aurora''. They sleep in rat-infested bunks and are fed only twice a day. Life above the water in the boat is much worse than the suffering the children encounter beneath the sea. For every dive, a child's life is perilously in danger.

On January 22, 2008, [[filmmaker]] Nick Deocampo, [[Executive director|Director]] of the [[Movie Workers Welfare Foundation]] (Mowelfund) announced the holding of a Ricardo Lee Film Festival from February 4 to 10, 2008 – the World Arts Festival under Mayor Tito Sarion, in [[Daet]] city, [[Camarines Norte]]. Lee's scripts became Philippine [[Film|cinema]] [[classics]] of Philippine cinema, which made the 2nd golden age of 1980 Filipino [[movies]]. 5 [[films]] will be shown in the festival: [[Gina Alajar]]'s "[[Salome]]," "[[Anak]]," "Muro Ami," "Gumapang Ka sa Lusak", and "Memories of Old Manila".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106550 Abs-Cbn Interactive, Ricky Lee to be honored in Daet arts festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Fredo ([[Cesar Montano]]) is a fisherman who has endured more than his share of hardship in life; his wife and child both perished in a boating accident, and today Fredo approaches each trip to the sea with the angry determination of a man out for revenge. Fredo commands a crew of young people from poor families as he takes his rattletrap ship into the ocean in search of fish that live along the reefs, snaring catch with an illegal netting system. Not all of Fredo's youthful sailors are willing to put up with his abusive arrogance, however, and even his father Dado ([[Pen Medina]]) and close friend Botong ([[Jhong Hilario]]) have grown weary of Fredo's tirades. Fredo's body is beginning to betray him as well, and as he and his crew damage the sea's reef beds in search of fish, no one is certain how much longer he will be able to continue.

Maestro Fredo, a tyrant captain, fixates to claim the treasures of the sea—no matter what, in whatever diabolical technique for as long as he profits. He employs dozens of men, mostly children, in his dangerous expeditions. Conditions aboard the ships are oppressive. Children are often overworked and his crew is furious with the way they are living. He blames the sea for claiming the lives of his family and he exacts revenge by plundering its depths.

'''Norges Elektriske Materiellkontroll''' ('''NEMKO''') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] private organization that supervises safety testing for electrical equipment manufacturing.

The Nemko Group offers testing, inspection and [[product certification|certification]] services concerning products, machinery, installations and systems worldwide.

==History==

The original NEMKO was established in 1933 as an institution for mandatory safety testing and national approval of electrical equipment marketed and sold in [[Norway]] for connection to the [[public utility]] network.

Later, testing of [[Electromagnetic interference|radio interference]] requirements became another part of the approval regime.

In 1990, as Norway entered into the [[European Economic Area]] agreement, [[European Union directive|European Community Directives]] for product safety were adopted, and the traditional mandatory approval scheme was abandoned. As this stage, NEMKO was transformed into an independent, self-owned foundation, having a council of representatives from different interest groups ([[industry]] and [[trade]] organizations, [[consumer]] associations, utility companies etc.) as the highest level of supervision. At the same time, the foundation established and became the sole owner of Nemko AS, which constitutes the central operating company and is responsible for what is today denoted the Nemko Group.

Since 1992, both the scope of [[Service (economics)|service]]s and the global presence of Nemko have been greatly expanded.

A '''royalty''' is a payment made by one party, the licensee or franchisee to another that owns a particular asset, the licensor or franchisor for the right to ongoing use of that asset. Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.com.au/pubs/tax/fotaxapr04.htm|title=Focus: Tax and Intellectual Property – April 2004|publisher=Allens Arthur Robinson|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1870&amp;bold=|publisher=law.com|title=Royalty (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation|year=1996|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|location=Vienna|isbn=92-1-106302-7|author=United Nations Industrial Development Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Guidelines for Evaluation of Transfer of Technology Agreements, United Nations, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=Licensing Guide for Developing Countries: A Guide on the Legal Aspects of the Negotiation and Preparation of Industrial Property Licenses and Technology Transfer Agreements Appropriate to the Needs of Developing Countries|year=1977|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-805-0395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNIDO International Workshop on Technology Transfer Negotiation and Plant Level Technology Needs Assessment, 7–8 December 1999, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vertexips.com/information/articles/licensing.html | author=Dave Tyrrell | title=Intellectual Property &amp; Licensing | publisher=Vertex|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''royalty interest''' is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=royalty%20interest | publisher=Schlumberger|title=Royalty interest (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[license agreement]] defines the terms under which a resource or property are [[license]]d by one party to another, either without restriction or subject to a limitation on term, business or geographic territory, type of product, etc. License agreements can be regulated, particularly where a government is the resource owner, or they can be private contracts that follow a general structure. However, certain types of [[franchising|franchise]] agreements have comparable provisions.{{Clarify|How is this related to royalties?|date=January 2012}}

==Non-renewable resources==
A landowner with petroleum or [[mineral rights]] to their property may license those rights to another party. In exchange for allowing the other party to extract the resources, the landowner receives either a [[resource rent]], or a "royalty payment" based on the value of the resources sold. When a government owns the resource, the transaction often has to follow legal and regulatory requirements.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the United States, [[fee simple]] ownership of mineral rights is possible and payments of royalties to private citizens occurs quite often. Local taxing authorities may impose a [[severance tax]] on the unrenewable natural resources extracted (or severed) from within their authority. The Federal Government receives royalties on production on federal lands, managed by the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], formerly the Minerals Management Service.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

An example from Canada's northern territories is the [[Government of Canada|federal]] [[Frontier Lands]] Petroleum Royalty Regulations. The royalty rate starts at 1% of gross [[revenues]] of the first 18 months of commercial production and increases by 1% every 18 months to a maximum of 5% until initial costs have been recovered, at which point the royalty rate is set at 5% of gross revenues or 30% of net [[revenues]]. In this manner risks and profits are shared between the government of Canada (as resource owner) and the petroleum developer. This attractive royalty rate is intended to encourage oil and gas exploration in the remote Canadian frontier lands where costs and risks are higher than other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law |title=Calculating Royalty |work=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada |year=2010 |accessdate=12 July 2018 |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100036110/1100100036114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions in North America, oil and gas royalty interests are considered real property under the NAICS classification code and qualify for a 1031 like-kind exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilgas1031.com/ |title=oilgas1031.com |publisher=oilgas1031.com |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406234155/http://www.oilgas1031.com/ |archivedate=6 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil and gas royalties are paid as a set percentage on all revenue, less any deductions that may be taken by the well operator as specifically noted in the lease agreement. The revenue decimal, or royalty interest that a mineral owner receives, is calculated as a function of the percentage of the total drilling unit to which a specific owner holds the mineral interest, the royalty rate defined in that owner's mineral lease, and any tract participation factors applied to the specific tracts owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadmoorminerals.com/resources/learn-more-sell-oil-and-gas-royalties-and-interests.html|title=Sell Gas Royalty, Sell Oil Royalty, Sell Mineral Rights &amp; Royalties|work=broadmoorminerals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a standard example, for every $100 bbl of oil sold on a U.S. federal well with a 25% royalty, the U.S. government receives $25. The U.S. government does not pay and will only collect revenues. All risk and liability lie upon the operator of the well.

Royalties in the lumber industry are called "[[stumpage]]".

==Patents==
{{Licensing of patents}}
An [[intangible asset]] such as a [[patent]] right gives the owner an [[exclusive right]] to prevent others from practicing the patented technology in the country issuing the patent for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]]. The right may be enforced in a lawsuit for [[monetary damages]] and/or imprisonment for violation on the patent. In accordance with a patent license, royalties are paid to the patent owner in exchange for the right to practice one or more of the basic patent rights: to manufacture, to use, to sell, to offer for sale, or to import a patented product, or to perform a patented method.

Patent rights may be divided and licensed out in various ways, on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The license may be subject to limitations as to time or territory. A license may encompass an entire technology or it may involve a mere component or improvement on a technology. In the United States, "reasonable" royalties may be imposed, both after-the-fact and prospectively, by a court as a remedy for [[patent]] infringement. In patent infringement lawsuits where the court determines an injunction to be inappropriate in light of the case's circumstances, the court may award "ongoing" royalties, or royalties based on the infringer's prospective use of the patented technology, as an alternative remedy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/ongoing-royalties-for-patent-infringement.html J. Gregory Sidak, ''Ongoing Royalties for Patent Infringement'', 24 TEX. INTELL. PROP. L.J. at 6 (forthcoming 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; At least one study analyzing a sample of 35 cases in which a court awarded an ongoing royalty has found that ongoing royalty awards "exceed[] by a statistically significant amount the jury-determined reasonably royalty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/ongoing-royalties-for-patent-infringement.html J.

In 2007, patent rates within the United States were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ranges of royalty rates, and royalty guidelines, U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry | url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/royalties/ | accessdate = 2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a pending patent on a strong [[business plan]], royalties of the order of 1%
:* issued patent, 1%+ to 2%
:* the pharmaceutical with pre-clinical testing, 2–3%

In 2002, the Licensing Economics Review found in a review of 458 licence agreements over a 16-year period an average royalty rate of 7% with a range from 0% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Economics Review. The Royalty Rate Journal of Intellectual Property, December 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample: License Parameters |url=http://www.intellectualpropertyanalysis.com/article4.html |accessdate=2007-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413013807/http://www.intellectualpropertyanalysis.com/article4.html |archivedate=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of these agreements may not have been at "arms length". In license negotiation, firms might derive royalties for the use of a patented technology from the retail price of the downstream licensed product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.

==Trade mark==
[[Trade marks]] are words, logos, slogans, sounds, or other distinctive expressions that distinguish the source, origin, or sponsorship of a good or service (in which they are generally known as [[service mark]]s). Trade marks offer the public a means of identifying and assuring themselves of the quality of the good or service. They may bring consumers a sense of security, integrity, belonging, and a variety of intangible appeals. The value that inures to a trade mark in terms of public recognition and acceptance is known as goodwill.

A trade mark right is an exclusive right to sell or market under that mark within a geographic territory. The rights may be licensed to allow a company other than the owner to sell goods or services under the mark. A company may seek to license a trade mark it did not create in order to achieve instant [[name recognition]] rather than accepting the cost and risk of entering the market under its own brand that the public does not necessarily know or accept. Licensing a trade mark allows the company to take advantage of already-established goodwill and brand identification.

Like patent royalties, trade mark royalties may be assessed and divided in a variety of different ways, and are expressed as a percentage of sales volume or income, or a fixed fee per unit sold. When negotiating rates, one way companies value a trade mark is to assess the additional profit they will make from increased sales and higher prices (sometimes known as the "relief from royalty") method.

Trade mark rights and royalties are often tied up in a variety of other arrangements. Trade marks are often applied to an entire [[brand]] of products and not just a single one. Because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer, in terms of getting what they are paying for, trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards. When the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a know-how, supplies, pooled advertising, etc., the result is often a [[franchising|franchise]] relationship. Franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence, but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales, among other payments.

In a long-running dispute in the United States involving the valuation of the DHL trade mark of [[DHL Express|DHL Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=DHL Corporation and Subsidiaries vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Docket Nos. 19570-95, 26103-95, United States Tax Court.| url=http://www.ausinc.com/news/More_on_Trademark.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2007-09-09| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307224114/http://www.ausinc.com/news/More_on_Trademark.pdf| archivedate=7 March 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reported that experts employed by the [[IRS]] surveyed a wide range of businesses and found a broad range of royalties for trade mark use from a low of 0.1% to a high of 15%.

===Franchises===
While a payment to employ a trade mark licence is a royalty, it is accompanied by a "guided usage manual", the use of which may be audited from time to time. However, this becomes a ''supervisory'' task when the mark is used in a [[franchising|franchise]] agreement for the sale of goods or services carrying the reputation of the mark. For a franchise, it is said, a ''fee'' is paid, even though it comprises a royalty element.

To be a franchise, the agreement must be a composite of the items:
::*  the right to use a trade mark to offer, sell or distribute goods or services (the trademark element)
::*  payment of a required royalty or fee (the fee element)
::*  significant assistance or control with respect to the franchisee's business (the supervisory element)

One of the above three items must ''not'' apply for the franchise agreement to be considered a trade mark agreement (and its laws and conventions). In a franchise, for which there is no convention, laws apply concerning training, brand support, operating systems/support and technical support in a written format ("Disclosure").&lt;ref&gt;Dicenstein_brands_2005-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Copyright law gives the owner the right to prevent others from copying, creating [[derivative work]]s, or using their works. Copyrights, like patent rights, can be divided in many different ways, by the right implicated, by specific geographic or market territories, or by more specific criteria. Each may be the subject of a separate license and royalty arrangements.

Copyright royalties are often very specific to the nature of work and field of endeavor. With respect to music, royalties for [[performance right]]s in the United States are set by the [[Library of Congress]]' [[Copyright Royalty Board]]. Performance rights to [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s of a performance are usually managed by one of several [[performance rights organization]]s. Payments from these organizations to performing [[artist]]s are known as [[residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] and performance royalties. [[Royalty-free music]] provides more direct compensation to the artists. In 1999, recording artists formed the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]] to repeal supposedly "technical revisions" to American copyright statutes which would have classified all "sound recordings" as "works for hire", effectively assigning artists' copyrights to [[record label]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Four little words | url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Don Henley Speaks on Behalf of Recording Artists | url=http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263  | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060117191640/http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263 |archivedate = 2006-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book [[author]]s may sell their [[copyright]] to the [[publishing|publisher]]. Alternatively, they might receive as a royalty a certain amount per book sold. It is common in the UK for example, for authors to receive a 10% royalty on book sales.

Some [[photographer]]s and [[musician]]s may choose to publish their works for a one-time payment. This is known as a [[royalty-free]] license.

==Book publishing==
All book-publishing royalties are paid by the publisher, who determines an author's royalty rate, except in rare cases in which the author can demand high advances and royalties.

For most cases, the publishers advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute the bulk of the author's total income plus whatever little flows from the "running royalty" stream. Some costs may be attributed to the advance paid, which depletes further advances to be paid or from the running royalty paid. The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author. There are many risks for the author—definition of cover price, the retail price, "net price", the discounts on the sale, the bulk sales on the POD ([[print on demand|publish on demand]]) platform, the term of the agreement, audit of the publishers accounts in case of impropriety, etc. which an agent can provide.

The following illustrates the income to an author on the basis chosen for royalty, particularly in POD, which minimizes losses from [[inventory]] and is based on computer technologies.

Hardback royalties on the published price of trade books usually range from 10% to 12.5%, with 15% for more important authors. On paperback it is usually 7.5% to 10%, going up to 12.5% only in exceptional cases. All the royalties displayed below are on the "cover price". Paying 15% to the author can mean that the other 85% of the cost pays for editing and [[proof-reading]], printing and binding, overheads, and the profits (if any) to the publisher.

The publishing company pays no royalty on bulk purchases of books since the buying price may be a third of the cover price sold on a singles basis.

Unlike the UK, the United States does not specify a "maximum retail price" for books that serves as base for calculation.

===Based on net receipts===

Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, which demanded increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book's cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts. According to ''The Writers' and Artists' Yearbook'' of 1984, under the new arrangement, 'appropriate [upward] adjustments are of course made to the royalty figure and the arrangement is of no disadvantage to the author."&lt;ref name="WAYB"&gt;''The Writers and Artists Yearbook'', 1984, p.422&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this assurance, in 1991, [[Frederick Nolan]], author and former publishing executive, explained that "net receipts" royalties are often more in the interest of publishers than authors:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher $90,000; the author's ten percent of that figure yields him $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer "net receipts" contracts....Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a 'sheet deal'. In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, can substantially reduce his printing cost by 'running on' a further 10,000 copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further profit by selling these 'sheets' at cost-price or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 percent of 'net receipts' from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akmedea.com/xQFN.html|title=Malcolm v. Oxford: Fred Nolan|website=www.akmedea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003 two American authors Ken Englade and Patricia Simpson successfully sued HarperCollins (USA) for selling their work to its foreign affiliates at improperly high discounts ("Harper Collins is essentially selling books to itself, at discounted rates, upon which it then calculates the author's royalty, and then Harper Collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates, without paying the author any further royalty.")&lt;ref name="Englade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/englade-v-harpercollins-publishers|title=Casetext|website=casetext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This forced a "class action" readjustment for thousands of authors contracted by HarperCollins between November 1993 and June 1999.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akmedea.com/englade1.html|title=Englade &amp; Simpson vs. HarperCollins|website=www.akmedea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music ==
Unlike other forms of intellectual property, music royalties have a strong linkage to individuals – composers (score), songwriters (lyrics) and writers of musical plays – in that they can own the exclusive copyright to created music and can license it for performance independent of corporates. Recording companies and the performing artists that create a "sound recording" of the music enjoy a separate set of copyrights and royalties from the sale of recordings and from their digital transmission (depending on national laws).

With the advent of pop music and major innovations in technology in the communication and presentations of media, the subject of music royalties has become a complex field with considerable change in the making.

A [[musical composition]] obtains copyright protection as soon as it is written out or recorded. But it is not protected from infringed use unless it is registered with the copyright authority, for instance, the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] in the United States, which is administered by the [[Library of Congress]]. No person or entity, other than the copyright owner, can use or employ the music for gain without obtaining a license from the composer/songwriter.

Inherently, as copyright, it confers on its owner, a distinctive "bundle" of five exclusive rights:

: (a) to make copies of the songs through print or recordings
: (b) to distribute them to the public for profit
: (c) to the "public performance right"; live or through a recording
: (d) to create a derivative work to include elements of the original music; and
: (e) to "display" it (not very relevant in context).

Where the score and the lyric of a composition are contributions of different persons, each of them is an equal owner of such rights.

These exclusivities have led to the evolution of distinct commercial terminology used in the music industry.

They take four forms:
: (1) royalties from "print rights"
: (2)  ''mechanical royalties'' from the recording of composed music on CDs and tape
: (3)  ''performance royalties'' from the performance of the compositions/songs on stage or television through artists and bands, and
: (4)  ''synch (for synchronization) royalties'' from using or adapting the musical score in the movies, television advertisements, etc. and

With the advent of the internet, an additional set of royalties has come into play: the ''digital rights'' from simulcasting, webcasting, streaming, downloading, and online "on-demand service".

In the following the terms "composer" and "songwriter" (either lyric or score) are synonymous.

===Print rights in music===
While the focus here is on royalty rates pertaining to music marketed in the print form or "sheet music", its discussion is a prelude to the much more important and larger sources of royalty income today from music sold in media such as CDs, television and the internet.

[[Sheet music]] is the first form of music to which royalties were applied, which was then gradually extended to other formats. Any performance of music by singers or bands requires that it be first reduced to its written sheet form from which the "song" (score) and its lyric are read. Otherwise, the authenticity of its origin, essential for copyright claims, will be lost, as was the case with folk songs and American "westerns" propagated by the oral tradition.

====Brief history====
The ability to print music arises from a series of technological developments in print and art histories over a long span of time (from the 11th to the 18th century) of which two will be highlighted.

The first, and commercially successful, invention was the development of the "movable type" printing press, the [[Gutenberg press]] in the 15th century. It was used to print the well-known Gutenberg Bible and later the printing system enabled printed music. Printed music, till then, tended to be one line chants. The difficulty in using movable type for music is that all the elements must align – the note head must be properly aligned with the staff, lest it have an unintended meaning.

[[Musical notation]] was well developed by then, originating around 1025. [[Guido d'Arezzo]] developed a system of pitch notation using lines and spaces. Until this time, only two lines had been used. Guido expanded this system to four lines, and initiated the idea of ledger lines by adding lines above or below these lines as needed. He used square notes called neumes. This system eliminated any uncertainty of pitch which existed at that time. Guido also developed a system of clefs, which became the basis for our clef system: bass clef, treble clef, and so on. (Co-existing civilizations used other forms of notation).

In Europe, the major consumers of printed music in the 17th and 18th centuries were the [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] for both solemn and festive occasions. Music was also employed for entertainment, both by the courts and the nobility. Composers made their livings from commissioned work, and worked as conductors, performers and tutors of music or through appointments to the courts. To a certain extent, music publishers also paid composers for rights to print music, but this was not royalty as it is generally understood today.

The European [[Christian Church|Church]] was also a large user of music, both religious and secular. However, performances were largely based on hand-written music or aural training.

=====American contribution: The Origins of Music Copyright and Royalties=====
Until the mid-18th century, American popular music largely consisted of songs from the British Isles, whose lyric and score were sometimes available in engraved prints. Mass production of music was not possible until the movable type was introduced. Music with this type was first printed in the US in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Printing &amp; Publishing of Music - A Short History &amp; How it is Done | url = http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php | accessdate =2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning the type consisted of the notehead, stem and staff which were combined into a single [[font]]. Later the fonts were made up of the notehead, stems and flags attached to the staff line. Until that time, prints existed only on engraved plates.

The first federal law on copyright was enacted in the US [[Copyright Act of 1790]] which made it possible to give protection to original scores and lyrics.

America's most prominent contribution is [[jazz]] and all the music styles which preceded and co-exist with it – its variations on church music, African-American work songs, [[field holler|cornfield hollers]], wind bands in funeral procession, blues, rag, etc. – and of innovations in church music, rhythmic variations, stamping, tapping of feet, strutting, shuffling, wailing, laments and spiritual ecstasy.

Until its recent sophistication, jazz was not amenable to written form, and thus not copyrightable, due to its improvisational element and the fact that many of the creators of this form could not read or write music.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Harman, ''A Popular History of Music'', Dell Publishing Company, New York, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; It was its precursor, [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], which came to be written and royalties paid for the use of popular music.

[[Blackface]] minstrelsy was the first distinctly American theatrical form. In the 1830s and 1840s, it was at the core of the rise of an American music industry. &lt;ref&gt;Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians, Elizabeth C. Axford, Scarecrow Press, 2004,{{ISBN|0-8108-5027-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephen Foster]] was the pre-eminent songwriter in the United States of that time. His songs, such as "[[Oh! Susanna]]", "[[Camptown Races]]", "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]", "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]" and "[[Swanee River (song)|Swanee River]]" remain popular 150 years after their composition and have worldwide appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibeliusmusic.com/index.php?sm=home.score&amp;?scoreid=127497|title=Score Exchange - Page not found|work=sibeliusmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster composed songs for [[Christy's Minstrels]], one of the prominent minstrel groups of the time.

Foster had little formal music training. While he was able to publish several songs before he was twenty, his sophistication came from Henry Kleber and Dan Rice. Kleber was a classically trained German immigrant, and Rice was a popular blackface performer who befriended Foster. But it was his joining the Christy Minstrels which made him, and his songs, favorites in North America.

W.C. Peters was the first major publisher of Foster's works, but Foster saw very little of the profits. "Oh, Susanna" was an overnight success and a [[Goldrush]] favorite but Foster received just $100 from his publisher for it - in part due to his lack of interest in money and the free gifts of music he gave to him. Foster's first love lay in writing music and its success. Foster did later contract with Christy (for $15 each) for "Old Folks at Home" and "Farewell my Lilly Dear". "Oh, Susanna" also led Foster to two New York publishers, Firth, Pond and Co. and F.D. Benson, who contracted with him to pay royalties at 2 cents for every printed copy sold by them.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth C. Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004,{{ISBN|0-8108-5027-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minstrelsy slowly gave way to songs generated by the American Civil War, followed by the rise of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Parlour music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php |title=Printing &amp; Publishing of Music. A Short History &amp; How it is Done |publisher=parlorsongs.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which led to an explosion of sheet music, greatly aided by the emergence of the [[player piano]]. While the player piano was to make inroads deep into the 20th century, more and more music was reproduced through [[radio]] and the [[phonograph]], leading to new forms of royalty payments, but leading to the decline of sheet music.

American innovations in church music also provided royalties to its creators. While Stephen Foster is often credited as the originator of print music in America, [[William Billings]] is the real father of American music. In 1782, of the 264 music compositions in print, 226 were his church-related compositions. Similarly, Billings was the composer of a quarter of the 200 anthems published until 1810. Neither he nor his family saw any royalties, although the Copyright Act of 1790 was in place by then.

Church music plays a significant part in American print royalties. When the Lutheran Church split from the Catholic Church in the 16th century, more than religion changed. [[Martin Luther]] wanted his entire congregation to take part in the music of his services, not just the choir. This new chorale style finds its way in both present church music and jazz.

===Print royalties (music)===
The royalty rate for printing a book (a novel, lyrics or music) globally, or its download, for sale varies from 20-30% of the suggested retail sales value, typically 20–25%, for a new writer that is taken by the publisher/distributor. The payment is made by the publisher/distributor and corresponds to the agreement (license) between the writer and the publisher/distributor as with other music royalties. The agreement is typically non-exclusive to the publisher and the term may vary from 3–5 years. Established writers favor certain publishers/distributors and usually receive higher royalties.

All of the royalty does not occur to the writer. It is shared with the publisher on of book sales income on a 50:50 basis.

If a book involved is a play, it might be [[drama]]tized. The right to dramatize is a separate right – known as a [[grand right]]. This income is shared by the many personalities and organizations who come together to offer the play: the playwright, composer of the music played, producer, director of the play and so forth. There is no convention to the royalties paid for grand rights and it is freely negotiated between the publisher and the mentioned participants.

If the writer's work is only part of a publication, then the royalty paid is ''[[pro-rata]]'', a facet which is more often met in a book of lyrics or in a book of hymns and sometimes in an anthology.

Church music – that is, music that is based on written work – is important particularly in the Americas and in some other countries of Europe. Examples are hymns, anthems and songbooks. Unlike novels and plays, hymns are sung with regularity. Very often, the hymns and songs are sung from lyrics in a book, or more common nowadays, from the work projected on computer screen. In the US, the Christian Copyright Licensing International, Inc. is the collection agency for royalties but song or hymn writers have to be registered with them and the songs identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingalls|first=Monique M.|title=The Evangelical British Invasion: Challenging Boundaries, Transforming Congregational Song|journal=IASPM Conference|date=30 May 2009|url=http://iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ingalls.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2011|location=San Diego, California|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205120049/http://iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ingalls.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign publishing===
Viewed from a US perspective, foreign publishing involves two basic types of publishing – sub-publishing and co-publishing occurrences in one or more territories outside that of basic origin. Sub-publishing, itself, is one of two forms: sub-publishers who merely license out the original work or those which make and sell the products which are the subject of the license, such as print books and records (with local artists performing the work).

Sub-publishers who produce and market a product retain 10–15% of the marked retail price and remit the balance to the main publisher with whom they have the copyright license. Those sub-publishers who merely license out the work earn between 15–25%.&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Bergman, [http://www.alanbergman.com/musicbusinesslanguage.pdf ''The Language of the Music Business'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical royalties===
Although the terms "mechanical" and [[mechanical license]] have their origins in the [[piano roll]]s on which music was recorded in the early part of the 20th century, the scope of their modern usage is much wider and covers any copyrighted audio composition that is rendered mechanically (i.e., without human performers).  As such, it includes:
:* [[Compact disc]]s, [[vinyl records]] and tape recordings
:* music videos
:* [[ringtone]]s
:* [[MIDI]] files
:* downloaded tracks
:* DVDs, VHS, UMDs
:* computer games
:* musical toys etc.

The United States treatment of mechanical royalties differs markedly from international practice.  In the United States, while the right to use copyrighted music for making records for public distribution (for private use) is an exclusive right of the composer, the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] provides that ''once'' the music is so recorded, anyone else can record the composition/song without a negotiated license but on the payment of the statutory compulsory royalty. Thus, its use by different artists could lead to several separately owned copyrighted "sound recordings".

The following is a partial segment of the compulsory rates as they have applied from 1998 to 2007 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Compulsory Rates for Mechanical royalties | url= http://www.copyright.gov/carp/m200a.html | accessdate= 2007-10-15 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011074348/http://copyright.gov/carp/m200a.html | archivedate= 11 October 2007 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The royalty rates in the table have two elements: (i) a minimum rate applies for a duration equivalent to 5 minutes, or less, of a musical composition/song and (ii) a per-minute rate if the composition exceeds it, whichever is greater.

In the predominant case, the composer assigns the song copyright to a publishing company under a "publishing agreement" which makes the publisher exclusive owner of the composition. The publisher's role is to promote the music by extending the written music to ''recordings'' of vocal, instrumental and orchestral arrangements and to administer the collection of royalties (which, as will shortly be seen, is in reality done by specialized companies). The publisher also licenses 'subpublishers' domestically and in other countries to similarly promote the music and administer the collection of royalties.

In a fair publishing agreement, every 100 units of currency that flows to the publisher gets divided as follows: 50 units go to the songwriter and 50 units to the publisher minus operating and administrative fees and applicable taxes. However, the music writer obtains a further 25 units from the publisher's share, if the music writer retains a portion of the music publishing rights (as a co-publisher). In effect, the co-publishing agreement is a 50/50 share of royalties in favor of the songwriter if administrative costs of publishing are disregarded. This is near international practice.

When a company (recording label) records the composed music, say, on a CD master, it obtains a distinctly ''separate'' copyright to the sound recording, with all the exclusivities that flow to such copyright. The main obligation of the recording label to the songwriter and her publisher is to pay the contracted royalties on the license received.

While the compulsory rates remain unaffected, recording companies in the U.S. typically will negotiate to pay not more than 75% of the compulsory rate where the songwriter is also the recording artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 'Reduced Rate' Royalties| url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will further (in the U.S.) extend that to a maximum of 10 songs, even though the marketed recording may carry more than that number. This 'reduced rate' results from the incorporation of a "controlled composition" clause in the licensing contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Royalties on Controlled Composition |url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since the composer as recording artist is seen to control the content of the recording.

Mechanical royalties for music produced outside of the United States are negotiated – there being no [[Compulsory license|compulsory licensing]] – and royalty payments to the composer and her publisher for recordings are based on the wholesale, retail, or "suggested retail value" of the marketed CDs.

''Recording artists'' earn royalties only from the ''sale'' of CDs and tapes and, as will be seen later, from sales arising from [[digital rights]]. Where the [[songwriter]] is also the recording artist, royalties from CD sales add to those from the [[recording contract]].

In the U.S., recording artists earn royalties amounting to 10%–25% (of the [[suggested retail price]] of the recording&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-recording.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106132315/http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-recording.html |date=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their popularity but such is before deductions for "packaging", "breakage", "promotion sales" and holdback for "returns", which act to significantly reduce net royalty incomes.

In the U.S., the [[Harry Fox Agency]], HFA, is the predominant licensor, collector and distributor for mechanical royalties, although there are several small competing organizations. For its operations, it charges about 6% as commission. HFA, like its counterparts in other countries, is a state-approved quasi-monopoly and is expected to act in the interests of the composers/songwriters – and thus obtains the right to audit record company sales. Additional third party administrators such as [[RightsFlow]] provide services to license, account and pay mechanical royalties and are growing. RightsFlow is paid by the licensees (artists, labels, distributors, online music services) and in turn does not extract a commission from the mechanical royalties paid out.&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Ed, Billboard, 11 March 2011, [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/rightsflow-builds-a-business-around-clearing-1005083892.story "RightsFlow Builds A Business Around Clearing Song Rights"]. Retrieved 2011-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]], MCPS (now in alliance with PRS), acts to collect (and distribute) royalties to composers, songwriters and publishers for CDs and for digital formats. It is a [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit organization]] which funds its work through a commissions on aggregate revenues. The royalty rate for licensing tracks is 6.5% of retail price (or 8.5% of the published wholesale price).

In Europe, the major licensing and mechanical royalty collection societies are:

: [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] in France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thorne|first=Michelle|title=Improbable Match: CC And Collecting Societies In Europe|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10819|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Creative Commons|date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Kevin J.|title=Royalty Dispute Stops Music Videos in Germany|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/internet/03youtube.html|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: SFA in Italy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scfitalia.it/webnew/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013054358/http://www.scfitalia.it/webnew/ |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SACEM acts collectively for "francophone" countries in Africa. The UK society also has strong links with English-speaking African countries.

Mechanical societies for other countries can be found at the main national collection societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.bemuso.com/musicbiz/collectionsocieties.html#themainnationalcollectionsocieties |title=The main national collection societies |publisher=bemuso.com  |accessdate=2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical royalty rate paid to the publisher in Europe is about 6.5% on the [[Published Price to Dealer]] (PPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Language of the Music Business | url= http://www.alanbergman.com/articles.htm |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record companies are responsible for paying royalties to those artists who have performed for a recording based on the sale of CDs by retailers.

===Performance===
"Performance" in the music industry can include any of the following:

:* a performance of a song or composition – live, recorded or broadcast
:* a live performance by any musician
:* a performance by any musician through a recording on physical media
:* performance through the playing of recorded music
:* music performed through the web (digital transmissions)

In the United Kingdom, the [[Church of England]] is specifically exempted from performance royalties for music performed in services because it is a state-established church. Traditionally, American music publishers have not sought performance royalties for music sung and played in church services–the license to perform being implied by distributors of church sheet music. [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[SESAC]] exempt church worship services from performance royalties, but make no exemption for church-hosted concerts.

It is useful to treat these royalties under two classifications:

:(a) those associated with conventional forms of music distribution which have prevailed for most part of the 20th century, and
:(b) those from emerging 'digital rights' associated with newer forms of communication, entertainment and media technologies (from 'ring tones' to 'downloads' to 'live internet streaming'.

====Conventional forms of royalty payment====
In the conventional context, royalties are paid to composers and publishers and record labels for public performances of their music on vehicles such as the jukebox, stage, radio or TV. Users of music need to obtain a "performing rights license" from music societies – as will be explained shortly – to use the music. Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés, skating rinks, etc.

Licensing is generally done by music societies called "Performing Rights Organizations" (PROs), ''some'' of which are government-approved or government-owned, to which the composer, the publisher, performer (in some cases) or the record label have subscribed.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bemuso-A.jpg|right|frame]] --&gt;

The diagram on the right titled "The Performance Rights Complex"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=Diagram courtesy |url=http://www.bemuso.com |publisher=bemuso.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the general sequences by which a song or a composition gets to be titled a "performance" and which brings royalties to songwriters/publishers, performing artists and record labels. How, and to whom, royalties are paid is different in the United States from what it is, for example, in the UK. Most countries have "practices" more in common with the UK than the US.

In the United Kingdom there are three principal organizations:

:(i) [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] (PPL)
:(ii) [[PRS for Music]] (formerly the Performing Right Society)
:(iii) [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] (MCPS)

who license music (to music-users) and act as royalty collection and distribution agencies for their members.

PPL issues performance licenses to all UK radio, TV and broadcast stations, as well as establishments who employ sound recordings (tapes, CDs), in entertaining the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='CITCO hotels cannot play PPL music'|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/citco-hotels-cannot-play-ppl-music/731460/|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Indian Express|date=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing company collects and distributes royalties to the "record label" for the sound recording and to "featured UK performers"  in the recording. Performers do not earn from sound recordings on video and film.

PRS, which is now in alliance with MCPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx |title=PRS for Music homepage |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127124500/http://prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; collects royalties from music-users and distributes them directly to "song-writers" and "publishers" whose works are performed live, on radio or on TV on a 50:50 basis. MCPS licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 5.25% of net advertising revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Songwriters challenge UK online royalty rate | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/07/uk_music_downloads_royalty_dispute/ |publisher=The Register|date=7 November 2005 |accessdate =2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MCPS also collects and disburses mechanical royalties to writers and publishers in a manner similar to PRS. Although allied, they serve, for now, as separate organizations for membership.

The next diagram shows the sequences in the licensing of performances and the royalty collection and distribution process in the UK.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Every song or recording has a unique identity by which they are licensed and tracked. Details of songs or recordings are notified to the PROs directly, or through Catco, an electronic tracking system. It needs to be clarified that while blanket licenses are commonly issued to music-users, the latter are responsible for "usage returns" – the actual frequency of performances under the license – which then becomes the basis for the PRO to apportion royalties to writers, publishers and record labels. ("DIY indies" are  "do-it-yourself" independent songwriters – and, often, the performers as well – who record and publish under their own labels). In the UK, music is licensed (and royalties paid on it) ''at the track level''.

There is also a separate organization in the UK called VPL, which is the collecting society set up by the record industry in 1984 to grant licenses to users of music videos, e.g. broadcasters, program-makers, video jukebox system suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppluk.com/ |title=VPL |publisher=Ppluk.com |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing income collected from users is paid out to the society's members after administrative costs are deducted.

There are different models for royalty collection in the European countries. In some of them, mechanical and performing rights are administered jointly. SACEM (France), SABAM (Belgium), GEMA (Germany) and JASRAC (Japan) work that way.

In the United States, in contrast, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]], BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc) and [[SESAC]] (Society of European Stage Authors &amp; Composers) are the three principal Performance Rights Organizations (PROs), although smaller societies exist. The royalty that is paid to the composer and publisher is determined by the method of assessment used by the PRO to gage the utilization of the music, there being no external metrics as in mechanical royalties or the reporting system used in the UK. Very basically, a PRO aggregates the royalties that are due to all of the composers/songwriters "who are its members" and each composer and publisher is paid royalties based on the assessed frequency of the music's performance, post deductions of charges (which are many). The PROs are audited agencies. They "directly" pay the songwriter and the publisher their respective shares. (If part of the publisher's share is retained by the songwriter, the publisher pays the songwriter that part of the publisher's share).

Typically, the PRO negotiates blanket licenses with radio stations, television networks and other "music users", each of whom receives the right to perform any of the music in the repertoire of the PRO for a set sum of money.

PROs use different types of surveys to determine the frequency of usage of a composition/song. ASCAP uses [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]], SESAC utilizes cue sheets for TV performances and 'digital pattern recognition' for radio performances while BMI employs more scientific methods.

In the United States only the composer and the publisher are paid performance royalties and not performing artists (digital rights being a different matter). Likewise, the record label, whose music is used in a performance, is not entitled to royalties in the US on the premise that performances lead sales of records.

Where a performance has co-writers along with the composer/songwriter – as in a musical play – they will share the royalty.

====In digital distribution====
=====US regulatory provisions=====
Regulatory provisions in the US, EU and elsewhere is in a state of flux, continuously being challenged by developments in technology; thus almost any regulation stated here exists in a tentative format.

The US [[Copyright Act of 1976]] identified "musical works" and "[[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]]" eligible for copyright protection. The term "musical work" refers to the [[Musical composition|notes]] and [[Songwriter|lyrics]] of a song or a piece of music, while a "sound recording" results from its fixation on physical media. Copyright owners of musical works are granted exclusive rights to license over-the-air radio and TV broadcasts, entitling them royalties, which are, as said earlier, collected and distributed by the PROs. Under the Act, [[Record label|record companies]] and recording artists are, presently, not entitled to royalties from radio and TV broadcasts of their music, except in the case of digital services and [[webcast]]s where copyright owners and performers obtain royalties (see later). This is in contrast to international standards where performers also obtain royalties from over-the-air and digital broadcasting.

In 1995, the Congress introduced the ''[[Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act|Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA)]]'', which became effective 1 Feb 1996. This Act granted owners of ''sound recordings'' the exclusive license to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of digital audio transmissions but it exempted non-subscription services (and some other services). Where the rights owner could not voluntarily reach agreement with the [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]], it could avail of compulsory licensing provisions. Under the Act, the compulsory royalty (the royalty schedule follows) was to be shared in the manner: 50% to the record companies, 45% to featured artists, 2½% to non-featured musicians through [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) in the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Federation of Musicians |url=http://www.afm.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961023234517/http://www.afm.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 1996 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2½% for non-featured vocalists through [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Federation of Television and Radio Artists | url=http://www.aftra.org | accessdate=2008-02-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720195027/http://www.aftra.org/ | archivedate=20 July 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress]] also created a new compulsory license for certain subscription digital audio services, which transmit sound recordings via cable television and [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) on a non-interactive basis in the absence of a voluntary negotiation and agreement.

In 1998, the Congress amended DPRA to create the '''[[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)]]''' by redefining the above-noted subscription services of DPRA as "preexisting subscription services" and expanded the statutory license to include new categories of digital audio services that may operate under the license. In effect, DMCA created three categories of licensees:

# pre-existing satellite digital audio radio services
# new subscription services, and
# eligible non-subscription transmission services.

In addition to the above, a fourth license was created permit webcasters to make "ephemeral recordings" of a sound recording (temporary copies) to facilitate streaming but with a royalty to be paid.

Non-subscription webcasting royalties have also to be shared between record companies and performers in the proportions set out under DPRA.

The Table below titled SUMMARY OF STATUTORY ROYALTY RATES FOR DIGITAL WEBCASTING - UNITED STATES encapsulates the royalties set for non-interactive webcasting.

To qualify for compulsory licensing under non-subscription services, the webcasting needs to fit the following six criteria:

:* it is non-interactive
:* it does not exceed the sound recording performance complement
:* it is accompanied by information on the song title and recording artist
:* it does not publish a program schedule or specify the songs to be transmitted
:* it does not automatically switch from one program channel to another, and
:* it does not allow a user to request songs to be played particularly for that user.

An ''inter-active service'' is one which allows a listener to receive a specially created internet stream in which she dictates the songs to be played by selecting songs from the [[website]] menu. Such a service would take the website out from under the compulsory license and require negotiations with the copyright owners.

However, a service is non-interactive if it permits people to request songs which are then played to the public at large. Nonetheless, several rules apply such as, within any three-hour period, three cuts from a CD, but no more than two cuts consecutively can be played, or a site can play four songs from any singer from a boxed CD-set, but no more than three cuts consecutively.

Both interactive and non-interactive streaming services are required and regulated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to pay out a minimum fee per stream. Interactive services must pay out $0.0022 per stream while non-interactive streaming services must pay $0.0017 per stream. These rates are set to be what these services are required to distribute per stream and has been the rate since January 1, 2016 and will be reevaluated after December 31, 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[SoundExchange]], a non-profit organization, is defined under the legislation to act on behalf of record companies (including the majors) to license performance and reproduction rights and negotiate royalties with the broadcasters. It is governed by a board of artist and label representatives. Services include track level accounting of performances to all ''members'' and collection and distribution of foreign royalties to all members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Sound Exchange|url=http://www.soundexchange.com|accessdate =2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a voluntary agreement between the SoundExchange and the broadcasters, [[Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel]] (CARP) was authorized to set the statutory rates as could prevail between a "willing buyer" and "willing sellers". SoundExchange handles only the collection of royalties from "compulsory licenses" for non-interactive streaming services that use satellite, cable or internet methods of distribution.

To recap, under the law three types of licenses are required for streaming of musical recordings:

:(a) a performance license applicable for underlying words( lyrics) and music (score)
:(b) a performance license applicable to the streaming the sound recording
:(c) a storage license for the passage of a sound recording through a file server

The royalties for the first of the above two licenses are obtained from SoundExchange and the third from the PROs. Failure to make required payments constitutes copyright infringement and is subject to statutory damages.

Both broadcasters involved in webcasting and pure-Internet non-broadcasters are required to pay these royalties under the rules framed under the Act. All webcasters are also required to be registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]].

In 2017, 82% of revenues for the entire music industry was attributed to digital music services. Streaming accounted for 67% of revenues in the US music industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riaa.com/facts/], The Recording Industry Association of America® (RIAA), All Music Facts&lt;/ref&gt;

=====UK legislation=====
The United Kingdom adopted the [[Copyright Directive|European Copyright Directive]] (EUCD) in 2003 and the meaning of broadcast performance was broadened to cover "communicating to the public". This then included music distribution through the internet and the transmission of [[ringtone]]s to mobiles. Thus a music download was a "copy" of proprietary music and hence required to be licensed.

After a prolonged battle on royalties between online music companies such as [[AOL]], [[Napster]] and the recording companies (but not all of them), represented by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), and organizations representing the interests of songwriters ([[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]]) a compromise was reached, leading to a subsequent 3-year interim legislation (2007) adopted by the UK [[Copyright Tribunal]] under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interim Settlement of Digital Royalty Rates (Music), United Kingdom |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ctribunaldownloadingdecision.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation, referring to a new JOL (Joint Online License), applies only to music purchased within UK.

The applicable royalties are given in the table below which, also includes music downloads and music services through mobile devices. This path-breaking legislation is expected to become the model for EU (which is yet to develop comprehensive legislation), and perhaps even extend to the US.

Note that the new legislation includes the distinction between downloads of musical tracks from iTunes and other stores, which were considered "sales" and the webcasts considered "performances".

In brief, the compromise reached is that songwriters will receive 8% of '''gross revenues''' (definition follows), less [[VAT]], as royalty for each track downloaded bridging the demand of the artists demanding a 12% royalty rate (what was, otherwise, the norm for a CD) and music companies holding out for 6.5%, slightly higher than the 5.7% paid for a 79p track sold by iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists bid for CD parity on digital royalties |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/78202/artists-bid-for-cd-parity-on-digital-royalties.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211115552/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/78202/artists-bid-for-cd-parity-on-digital-royalties.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum of four pence will be paid, in the new legislation, if tracks are discounted.

The terms used in the legislated Table are explained following it.

Not all music providers in the UK were part of the compromise that led to the legislation. For those not participating - principally, AOL, [[Yahoo!]] and RealNetworks - the Tribunal set the royalty rate for pure webcasting at 5.75%.

UK legislation recognizes the term '''[[Online and offline|online]]''' as referring to downloading digital files from the internet and mobile network operators.  '''Offline''' is the term used for the delivery of music through physical media such as a CD or a DVD.

A '''stream''' is a file of continuous music listened to through a consumer's receiving device with no playable copy of the music remaining.

'''Permanent Downloads''' are transfers (sale) of music from a website to a computer or mobile telephone for permanent retention and use whenever the purchaser wishes, analogous to the purchase of a CD.

A '''Limited Download''' is similar to a permanent download but differs from it in that the consumer's use of the copy is in some way restricted by associated technology; for instance, becomes unusable when the subscription ends (say, through an encoding, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], of the downloaded music).

'''On-demand streaming''' is music streamed to the listener on the computer or mobile to enable her to listen to the music once, twice or a number of times during the period of subscription to the service.

'''Pure Webcasting''' is where the user receives a stream of pre-programmed music chosen "by the music service provider". It is non-interactive to the extent that even pausing or skipping of tracks is not possible.

'''Premium and Interactive Webcasting''' are personalized subscription services intermediate between pure webcasting and downloading.

'''Special webcasting''' is a service where the user can choose a stream of music, the majority of which comprises works from one source – an artist, group or particular concert.

'''Simulcasting''', although not in the Table above, is the simultaneous re-transmission by a licensed transmission of the program of a [[radio]] or [[TV station]] over the internet of an otherwise traditional broadcast. The person receiving the simulcast normally makes no permanent copy of it. It is defined in the legislation as an offline service.

''''Gross Revenue'''', which is comprehensively defined in the legislation, summarized here, means, all revenue received (or receivable) by the licensee from Users, all revenue received through advertisements associated with the music service, sponsorship fees, commissions from third parties and revenue arising from barter or contra deals. No deductions are permitted except for refunds of unused music due to technical faults.

The advertising revenue which is shared between the artist and music provider is defined as:
* when the advertising is in-stream;
* when the music offered forms the only content of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself); and
* when the music offered forms more than 75% of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself).

===Synchronization===
According to Joel Mabus, the term [[synchronization]] "comes from the early days of the [[talkies]] when music was first synchronized with film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelmabus.com/royalties.htm |title=Royalties |publisher=Joelmabus.com |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology originated in US industry but has now spread worldwide.

In the UK and elsewhere, with the exception of the US, there is apparently no legal prohibition to the combination of audio and visual images and no explicit statutory right for the collection of synch royalties. In the US, however, the Copyright Act defines the audiovisual format as that of combining images with music for use in machines and there is no explicit rate set such as the "compulsory royalty rate" for copying music. However, there are instances of courts implying the synchronization right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintons.co.uk/?news_id=38 |title=US Court Recognises Existence of a "Sync Right" |publisher=Clintons |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6128717C16DB42D8882573C400597DC7/$file/0655102.pdf?openelement]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018084025/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6128717C16DB42D8882573C400597DC7/%24file/0655102.pdf?openelement |date=18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but even so, it is an amorphous colloquial commercial term of acceptance.

Synchronization royalties ("sync licenses") are paid for the use of copyrighted music in (largely) audiovisual productions, such as in DVDs, movies, and advertisements. Music used in news tracks are also synch licenses. Synchronization can extend to live media performances, such as plays and live theatre. They become extremely important for new media - the usage of music in the form of [[mp3]], [[wav]], [[flac]] files and for usage in [[webcasts]], embedded media in microchips (e.g. [[karaoke]]), etc. but the legal conventions are yet to be drawn.

Synchronization royalties are due to the composer/songwriter or his/her publisher. They are strictly contractual in nature and vary greatly in amount depending on the subjective importance of the music, the mode of production and the media used. The royalty payable is that of mutual acceptance but is conditioned by industry practice.

It is useful to note in this connection the concept of the "needle drop" (now laser drop) in that the synch royalty becomes payable every time the needle drops 'on the record player' in a public performance. All openings and closings, every cut to advertisements, every cut back from ads, all re-runs shown by every TV company, in every country in the world generates a "synchro", although a single payment may be renegotiable in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current UK Limited Synchronisation Licence example |url=http://i.current.com/pdf/music_sync_uk.pdf |publisher=i.current.com |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213413/http://i.current.com/pdf/music_sync_uk.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a category of [[royalty free music]] in the field of synchronization. This refers to the use of music in a "library" for which a one-time royalty has been negotiated. It is an alternative to needle-drop negotiation.

In terms of numbers, royalties can range from, say. $500–2000 for a "festival-use license" to $250,000 or more for a movie film score. For low-budget films, which are deemed less than $2 million, the royalties range from 3%–6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VanReece |first=Nancy |url=http://www.musesmuse.com/pubart.html |title=Songwriting Articles: Publishing |publisher=North American Folk Alliance Newsletter |agency=The Muse's Muse |date=September 1998 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or could be per song per usage.

===Audio Home Recording Act of 1992===
In the US, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] became effective law in October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1001- |title=United States Code: Title 17,1001. Definitions |publisher=Legal Information Institute: Cornell University Law School |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law enabled the release of recordable digital formats such as Sony and Philips' Digital Audio Tape without fear of contributory infringement lawsuits.

==Art royalties==

===Resale royalty or ''droit de suite''===
Art Resale Royalty is a right to a royalty payment upon resales of art works, that applies in some jurisdictions. Whilst there are currently approximately 60 countries that have some sort of Resale Royalty on their statute books, evidence of resale schemes that can be said to be actually  operating schemes is restricted to Europe, Australia and the American state of California. For example, in May 2011 the European commissions ec.europa webpage on Resale royalty stated that, under the heading  'Indicative list of third countries (Article 7.2)'  :
'A letter was sent to Member States on 1 March 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application. '''To date the Commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list'''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/resale-right/resale-right_en.htm |title=» Internal Market &amp;raquo Copyright &amp;raquo Resale Right |publisher=European Commission: The EU Single Market |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [The emphasis is from the European commission web page.]

Apart from placing a levy on the resale of some art-like objects, there are few common facets to the various national schemes. Most schemes prescribe a minimum amount that the artwork must receive before the artist can invoke resale rights ( usually the hammer price or price). Some countries prescribe and others such as Australia, do not prescribe, the maximum royalty that can be received. Most do prescribe the calculation basis of the royalty. Some country's make the usage of the royalty compulsory. Some country's prescribe a sole monopoly collection service agency, while others like the UK and France, allow multiple agencies. Some schemes involve varying degrees of retrospective application and other schemes such as Australia's are not retrospective at all.
In some cases, for example Germany, an openly tax-like use is made of the "royalties"; Half of the money collected is redistributed to fund public programs.

The New Zealand and Canadian governments have not proceeded with any sort of artist resale scheme. The Australian scheme does not apply to the ''first'' resale of artworks purchased ''prior to the schemes enactment''( June 2010) and individual usage of the right (by Australian artists) is not compulsory. In Australia artists have a case by case right (under clause 22/23 of the Act) to refuse consent to the usage of the right by the appointed collection society and/or make their own collection arrangements. Details of the Australian scheme can be gotten from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au/ |title=About the artists resale royalty scheme |publisher=resaleroyalty.org.au |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website of the sole appointed Australian agency; The "Copyright Agency Limited".

The UK scheme is in the context of common-law countries an oddity; No other common-law country has mandated an individual economic right where actual usage of the right is compulsory  for the individual right holder. Whether the common law conception of an individual economic right as an "individual right of control of usage" is compatible with the Code Civil origins of ''droit de suite'' is open to question.

The UK is the largest art resale market where a form of ARR is operating, details of how the royalty is calculated as a portion of sale price in the UK can be accessed here [http://www.dacs.org.uk/ DACS] 
In the UK, the scheme was, in early 2012, extended to all artists still in copyright. In most European jurisdictions the right has the same duration as the term of copyright. In California law, heirs receive royalty for 20 years.

The royalty applies to any work of graphic or plastic art such as a ceramic, collage, drawing, engraving, glassware, lithograph, painting, photograph, picture, print, sculpture, tapestry. However, a copy of a work is not to be regarded as a work unless the copy is one of a limited number made by the artist or under the artist's authority. In the UK the resale of a work bought directly from the artist and then resold within 3 years for a value of €10,000 or less is not affected by the royalty.

The situation as to how ARR applies in situations where an art work is physically made by a person or persons who are not the 'name artist' who first exhibits and sells the work is not clear. In particular whilst ARR is inalienable it seems conceivable that in cases where the copyright on an artwork is transferred/sold, prior to the first sale of an artwork, the inalienable ARR right is also effectively sold transferred.

Whether resale royalties are of net economic benefit to artists is a highly contested area. Many economic studies have seriously questioned the assumptions underlying the argument that resale royalties have net benefits to artists. Many modelings have suggested that resale royalties could be actually harmful to living artists' economic positions.&lt;ref&gt;name="Kirstein, R./Schmidtchen, D. (2001); Do Artists Benefit from Resale Royalties? An Economic Analysis of a New EU Directive. In: Deffains, B./Kirat, T. (eds.): Law and Economics in Civil Law Countries; The Economics of Legal Relationships Vol. 6, Elsevier Science, Amsterdam et al., 231-248."&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia's chief advocate for the adoption of artist resale royalties the collection society, Viscopy, commissioned in 2004 a report from Access Economics to model the likely impact of their scheme. In the resulting report, Access Economics warned that the claim of net benefit to artists was: "based upon extremely unrealistic assumptions, in particular the assumption that seller and buyer behaviour would be completely unaffected by the introduction of RRR [ARR]" and that, "Access Economics considers that the results of this analysis are both unhelpful and potentially misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/.../Viscopy_Access_Economics.pdf |format=PDF|title=Viscopy Access Economics|accessdate=29 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software royalties==
There is simply too much [[computer software]] to consider the royalties applicable to each. The following is a guide to royalty rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwds-ak.com/Web-Resources/Web-Design/Royalty-Rates |website=Northwest Data Solutions |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Computer Software: 10.5% (average), 6.8% (median)
*Internet: 11.7% (average), 7.5% (median)

For the development of customer-specific software one will have to consider:
* Total software development cost
* Break-even cost (if the software can be sold to many agencies)
* Ownership of code (if the client's, he bears the development cost)
* Life of the software (usually short or requiring maintenance)
* Risk in development (high, commanding A high price)

==Other royalty arrangements==
The term "royalty" also covers areas outside of IP and technology licensing, such as oil, gas, and mineral royalties paid to the owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource. In a business project the promoter, financier, LHS enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income, or profits, of the business. This sort of royalty is often expressed as a contract right to receive money based on a royalty formula, rather than an actual ownership interest in the business. In some businesses this sort of royalty is sometimes called an ''override''.

===Alliances and partnerships===
Royalties may exist in technological alliances and partnerships. The latter is more than mere access to secret technical or a trade right to accomplish an objective. It is, in the last decade of the past century, and the first of this one of the major means of technology transfer. Its importance for the licensor and the licensee lies in its access to markets and raw materials, and labor, when the international trend is towards [[globalization]].

There are three main groups when it comes to technological alliances. They are Joint-ventures (sometimes abbreviated JV), the Franchises and Strategic Alliances (SA).&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises, United Nations Industrial Organization, Vienna, Austria 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-1-106443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint-ventures are usually between companies long in contact with a purpose. JVs are very formal forms of association, and depending on the country where they are situated, subject to a rigid code of rules, in which the public may or may not have an opportunity to participate in capital; partly depending on the size of capital required, and partly on Governmental regulations. They usually revolve around ''products'' and normally involve an inventive step.

Franchises revolve around ''services'' and they are closely connected with trademarks, an example of which is McDonald's. Although franchises have no convention like trademarks or copyrights they can be mistaken as a trademark-copyright in agreements. The franchisor has close control over the franchisee, which, in legal terms cannot be tie-ins such as frachisee located in an areas owned by the franchisor.

Strategic Alliances can involve a project (such as bridge building). a product or a service. As the name implies, is more a matter of 'marriage of convenience' when two parties want to associate to take up a particular (but modest) short-term task but generally are uncomfortable with the other. But the strategic alliance could be a test of compatibility for the forming of a joint venture company and a precedent step.

Note that all of these ventures s could be in a third county. JVs and franchises are rarely found formed within a county. They largely involve third countries.

On occasion, a JV or SA may be wholly oriented to research and development, typically involving multiple organizations working on an agreed form of engagement. The Airbus is an example of such.

====Technical assistance and service in technology transfer====
Firms in developing countries often are asked by the supplier of know-how or patent licensing to consider technical service (TS) and technical assistance (TA) as elements of the technology transfer process and to pay "royalty" on them. TS and TA are associated with the IP (intellectual property) transferred – and, sometimes, dependent on its acquisition – but they are, by no means, IP.&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}, pp 260-261&lt;/ref&gt; TA and TS may also be the sole part of the transfer or the tranferor of the IP, their concurrent supplier. They are seldom met with in the developed countries, which sometimes view even know-how as similar to TS.

TS comprises services which are the specialized knowledge of firms or acquired by them for operating a special process. It is often a "bundle" of services which can by itself meet an objective or help in meeting it. It is delivered over time, at end of which the acquirer becomes proficient to be independent of the service. In this process, no consideration is given on whether the transfer of the proprietary element has been concluded or not.

On the other hand, technical assistance is a package of assistance given on a short timetable. It can range variously from procurement of equipment for a project, inspection services on behalf of the buyer, the training of buyer's personnel and the supply technical or managerial staff. Again, TA is independent of IP services.

The payment for these services is a fee, not a royalty. The TS fee is dependent on how many of the specialized staff of its supplier are required and over what period of time. Sometimes, the "learning" capacity to whom the TS is supplied is involved. In any case, the cost per service-hour should be calculated and evaluated. Note that in selecting a TS supplier (often the IP supplier), experience and dependency are critical.

In the case of TA there is usually a plurality of firms and choice is feasible.

==Approaches to royalty rate==

===Intellectual property===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
The rate of royalty applied in a given case is determined by various factors, the most notable of which are:

:* Market drivers and demand structure
:* Territorial extent of rights
:* Exclusivity of rights
:* Level of innovation and stage of development (see [[The Technology Life Cycle]])
:* Sustainability of the technology
:* Degree and competitive availability of other technologies
:* Inherent risk
:* Strategic need
:* The portfolio of rights negotiated
:* Fundability
:* Deal-reward structure (negotiation strength)

To correctly gauge royalty rates, the following criteria must be taken into consideration:

:* The transaction is at "arms-length"
:* There is a willing buyer and a willing seller
:* The transaction is not under compulsion

===Rate determination and illustrative royalties===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
There are three general approaches to assess the applicable royalty rate in the licensing of intellectual property. They are

# The Cost Approach
# The Comparable Market Approach
# The Income Approach

For a fair evaluation of the royalty rate, the relationship of the parties to the contract should:

:– be at "arms-length" (related parties such as the subsidiary and the parent company need to transact as though they were independent parties)
:– be viewed as acting free and without compulsion

====Cost approach====
The Cost Approach considers the several elements of cost that may have been entered to create the intellectual property and to seek a royalty rate that will recapture the expense of its development and obtain a return that is commensurate with its expected life. Costs considered could include R&amp;D expenditures, pilot-plant and test-marketing costs, technology upgrading expenses, [[patent application]] expenditure and the like.

The method has limited utility since the technology is not priced competitively on "what the market can bear" principles or in the context of the price of similar technologies. More importantly, by lacking optimization (through additional expense), it may earn benefits below its potential.

However, the method may be appropriate when a technology is licensed out during its R&amp;D phase as happens with [[venture capital]] investments or it is licensed out during one of the stages of [[clinical trial]]s of a pharmaceutical.

In the former case, the venture capitalist obtains an equity position in the company (developing the technology) in exchange for financing a part of the development cost (recovering it, and obtaining an appropriate margin, when the company gets acquired or it goes public through the [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] route).

Recovery of costs, with opportunity of gain, is also feasible when development can be followed stage-wise as shown below for a pharmaceutical undergoing clinical trials (the licensee pays higher royalties for the product as it moves through the normal stages of its development):

{| class="wikitable"
! Success State of development !! Royalty rates (%) !! Nature
|-
| Pre-clinical success || 0–5 || in-vitro
|-
| Phase I (safety) || 5–10 || 100 healthy people
|-
| Phase II (efficacy) || 8–15 || 300 subjects
|-
| Phase III (effectiveness) || 10–20 || several thousand patients
|-
| Launched product || 20+ || regulatory body approval
|-
|}

A similar approach is used when [[custom software]] is licensed (an in-license, i.e. an incoming license). The product is accepted on a royalty schedule depending on the software meeting set stage-wise specifications with acceptable error levels in performance tests.

====Comparable market approach====
Here the cost and the risk of development are disregarded. The royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry, modified by considerations of useful "remaining life" of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions, front-end royalties, field of use restrictions, geographic limitations and the "technology bundle" (the mix of patents, know-how, trade-mark rights, etc.) accompanying it. Economist J. Gregory Sidak explains that comparable licenses, when selected correctly, "reveal what the licensor and the licensee consider to be fair compensation for the use of the patented technology" and thus "will most accurately depict the price that a licensee would willingly pay for that technology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/apportionment-frand-royalties-comparable-licenses-ericsson-dlink.html J. Gregory Sidak, ''Apportionment, FRAND Royalties, and Comparable Licenses After'' Ericsson v. D-Link, 2016 U. Ill. L. REV. (forthcoming)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] has on numerous occasions confirmed that the comparable market approach is a reliable methodology to calculate a reasonable royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Systems, Inc., 773 F.3d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2014); LaserDynamics, Inc. v. Quanta Comput., Inc., 694 F.3d 51 (Fed. Cir. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although widely used, the prime difficulty with this method is obtaining access to data on comparable technologies and the terms of the agreements that incorporate them. Fortunately, there are several recognized{{by whom|date=October 2014}} organizations (see "Royalty Rate Websites" listed at the end of this article) who have comprehensive{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} information on both royalty rates and the principal terms of the agreements of which they are a part. There are also IP-related organizations, such as the [[Licensing Executives Society]], which enable its members to access and share privately assembled data.

The two tables shown below are drawn, selectively, from information that is available with an IP-related organization and on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use Of The 25 Per Cent Rule In Valuing IP |url=http://lesanz.org.au/realmcommunications/royaltyrates.html |last1=Goldscheider |first1=Robert |last2=Jarosz |first2=John |last3=Mulhern |first3=Carla |authorlink=Les Nouvelles |date=Dec 2002 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912203311/http://www.lesanz.org.au/realmcommunications/royaltyrates.html |archivedate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Your Intellectual Property for Strategic Alliances and Financing |url=http://www.njsbdc.com/SciTech/scitech120804weiler.ppt |author=David G.

The comparability between transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that may affect the contracting parties:
* Similarity of geographies
* Relevant date
* Same industry
* Market size and its economic development;
* Contracting or expanding markets
* Market activity: whether wholesale, retail, other
* Relative market shares of contracting entities
* Location-specific costs of production and distribution
* Competitive environment in each geography
* Fair alternatives to contracting parties

====Income approach====
The Income approach focuses on the licensor estimating the profits generated by the licensee and obtaining an appropriate share of the generated profit. It is unrelated to costs of technology development or the costs of competing technologies.

The approach requires the licensee (or licensor): (a) to generate a cash-flow projection of incomes and expenses over the life-span of the license under an agreed scenario of incomes and costs (b) determining the [[Net Present Value]], NPV of the profit stream, based on a ''selected'' [[discounting|discount factor]], and c) negotiating the division of such profit between the licensor and the licensee.

The NPV of a future income is always lower than its current value because an income in the future is attended by risk. In other words, an income in the future needs to be discounted, in some manner, to obtain its present equivalent. The factor by which a future income is reduced is known as the  'discount rate'. Thus, $1.00 received a year from now is worth $0.9091 at a 10% [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]], and its discounted value will be still lower two years down the line.

The actual discount factor used depends on the risk assumed by the principal gainer in the transaction. For instance, a mature technology worked in different geographies, will carry a lower risk of non-performance (thus, a lower discount rate) than a technology being applied for the first time. A similar situation arises when there is the option of working the technology in one of two different regions; the risk elements in each region would be different.

The method is treated in greater detail, using illustrative data, in [[Royalty rate assessment|Royalty Assessment]].

The licensor's share of the income is usually set by the "25% rule of thumb", which is said to be even used by tax authorities in the US and Europe for arms-length transactions. The share is on the operating profit of the licensee firm. Even where such division is held contentious, the rule can still be the starting point of negotiations.

Following are three aspects that are important for the profit:

:(a) the profit that accrues to the licensee may not arise solely through the engine of the technology. There are returns from the mix of assets it employs such as fixed and working capital and the returns from intangible assets such as distribution systems, trained workforce, etc. Allowances need to be made for them.

:(b) profits are also generated by thrusts in the general economy, gains from infrastructure, and the basket of licensed rights – patents, trademark, know-how. A lower royalty rate may apply in an advanced country where large market volumes can be commanded, or where protection to the technology is more secure than in an emerging economy (or perhaps, for other reasons, the inverse).

:(c) the royalty rate is only one aspect of the negotiation. Contractual provisions such as an exclusive license, rights to sub-license, warranties on the performance of technology etc may enhance the advantages to the licensee, which is not compensated by the 25% metric.

The basic advantage of this approach, which is perhaps the most widely applied, is that the royalty rate can be negotiated without comparative data on how other agreements have been transacted. In fact, it is almost ideal for a case where precedent does not exist.

It is, perhaps, relevant to note that the [[IRS]] also uses these three methods, in modified form, to assess the attributable income, or division of income, from a royalty-based transaction between a US company and its foreign subsidiary (since [[Law of the United States|US law]] requires that a foreign subsidiary pay an appropriate royalty to the [[Holding company|parent company]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Evaluations |url=http://www.intltaxlaw.com/shared/transfer/regs.htm |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920001149/http://www.intltaxlaw.com/SHARED/TRANSFER/REGS.HTM |archivedate=20 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other compensation modes===
Royalties are only one among many ways of compensating owners for use of an asset. Others include:
:*buying the asset outright, possibly with a [[leaseback]] arrangement
:*offering the licensor an [[Ownership equity|equity]] position in the licensee company
:*staged [[milestone]] payments (as in [[drug development]] and commissioned software arrangements)
:*[[lump sum]] payment made to the licensor in one or more installments
:*[[cross-licensing]] agreements with or without cash payments, and
:*entering into a [[strategic alliance]] or Joint Venture.

In discussing the licensing of Intellectual Property, the terms ''[[Intellectual property valuation|valuation]]'' and ''evaluation'' need to be understood in their rigorous terms.
Evaluation is the process of assessing a license in terms of the specific metrics of a particular negotiation, which may include its circumstances, the geographical spread of licensed rights, product range, market width, licensee competitiveness, growth prospects, etc.

On the other hand, valuation is the [[fair market value]] (FMV) of the ''asset'' – trademark, patent or know-how – at which it can be sold between a willing buyer and willing seller in the context of best awareness of circumstances. The FMV of the IP, where assessable, may itself be a metric for evaluation.

If an emerging company is listed on the [[stock market]], the [[Market capitalization|market value]] of its intellectual property can be estimated from the data of the [[balance sheet]] using the equivalence:

Market Capitalization = Net [[Working capital|Working Capital]] + Net [[Fixed asset|Fixed Assets]] + Routine [[Intangible asset|Intangible Assets]] + IP

where the IP is the residual after deducting the other components from the market valuation of the stock. One of the most significant intangibles may be the work-force.

The method may be quite useful for valuing trademarks of a listed company if it is mainly or the only IP in play (franchising companies).

'''SigFig''' (formerly '''Wikinvest''') is an investment portal that uses the [[wiki]] format. It is available online and via an app. Wikinvest was also a winner in the 2008 [[SXSW]] Interactive Web Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/winners/ |website=SXSW |title=Web Awards Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wikinvest was founded in 2006 by [[Parker Conrad]] and Michael Sha.&lt;ref name=sigfig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Mike|title=A Take-Charge Portfolio Manager|url=http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB50001424053111903964304577422322481308982|website=barrons.com|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2008, the site covered over 1800 companies and over 180 economic issues, and had around 1400 contributors. 

Wikinvest also provided a [[print syndication|syndication]] service for financial [[bloggers]], the '''''Wikinvest Wire'''''. Additionally, the site's '''''WikiCharts''''' feature allowed financial charts to be annotated as well as embedded in other websites.

Contributions fell under two main categories, ''companies'' and ''concepts''. The former offered financial and business analysis on individual [[corporations]], whereas the latter examined trends in broader [[economic]] issues. In addition to being an information resource for the public, the site's [[financial analysis]] has also been cited in mainstream business publications such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sec.online.wsj.com/article/SB121556943553838139.html |title=Wal-Mart Will Use Show To Test New Casual Lines|work=The Wall Street Journal|date= July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SigFig==
In May 2012, Wikinvest announced that it would be a portfolio tracking and investment adviser referral service with a new name, SigFig.&lt;ref name=pando&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffith|first1=Erin|title=Wikinvest Pivots to SigFig, a Comparison Site for Investments|url=http://pando.com/2012/05/01/wikinvest-pivots-to-sigfig-a-comparison-site-for-investments/|publisher=Pando Daily|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 June 2012, Wikinvest had 400,000 users.&lt;ref name=sigfig/&gt; Parker Conrad and Michael Sha said that Wikinvest would eventually be phased out.&lt;ref name=pando/&gt;

As of November, 2015, the Wikinvest website continues to work, but the mobile apps no longer function.  Accounts are now mirrored to SigFig.com with the same username and password as the Wikinvest website, but with new, additional features available.

In 2013 he launched a new website where people who lived through World War II can upload their personal accounts of the conflict. Residents at some of Balhousie Care Group's homes have been among the first to appear on Banks' World War II Video Memories site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21350298 | work=BBC News | title=Dundee Falklands War veteran launches World War II site | date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media career==
In 2009, Banks appeared on the sixth series of [[Channel 4]]'s [[The Secret Millionaire]] in which he spent some time living on a poor estate in Anfield getting to know some of the local residents. During the programme he donated money to people he had met. He has subsequently donated to organisations that he got to know while filming, including Daisy UK, a Liverpool-based organisation headed up by Dave Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-millionaire/episode-guide/series-6/episode-6 |title=The Secret Millionaire – Tony Banks |publisher=Channel 4 |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-exchange1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-exchange.co.uk/about/theboard/tony-banks/ |title=Tony Banks – The Entrepreneurial Exchange |publisher=Entrepreneurial-exchange.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the BBC filmed a documentary entitled 'From War to Peace', in which a film crew followed Banks on a journey to Argentina. Banks had left the Falklands with a war trophy which he had kept for 28 years – a trumpet taken from an Argentinean prisoner of war named Omar Tabarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell |first=Jeff |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/argentina/7829942/Falklands-veteran-returns-trumpet-seized-from-Argentine-soldier.html |title=Falklands veteran returns trumpet seized from Argentine soldier |publisher=Telegraph |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
With the help of a journalist who tracked down Tabarez, Banks visited him at his home in Argentina to hand back the trumpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arifa Farooq |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tlyfr |title=BBC One – BBC Scotland Investigates, 2010, From War to Peace  |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2012, Banks released ''Storming the Falklands: My War and After'', which charts his experiences in war, how he struggled for years with combat-related stress, and how he has just recently managed to come to terms with his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tony Banks |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110759/A-dirty-war-Life-Falkland-Islands-invasion.html |title=A very dirty war: Life in the Falkland Islands after the invasion &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Banks currently serves on the board of the Scottish Entrepreneurial Exchange.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-exchange1"/&gt; He is one of [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]]'s Millionaire Mentors for the Entrepreneurs' Business Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tony-banks.com/100_EntrepreneurialExchange.html |title=Entrepreneurial Exchange |publisher=Tony Banks |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Banks was one of 12 recipients in Scotland of the [[Ernst &amp; Young]] Entrepreneur of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EoY_-_2011_award_recipients/$FILE/EY_EOY_2011_award_recipients.pdf |title=Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2011 Award Recipients |publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]] |date=2011 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balhousie Care Group also supports the Memory Box Network, a charity which aims to use online reminiscence therapy to increase the quality of life of those who live with dementia. The team is developing a website where users can view and upload content which will act as a talking point between the person with dementia and their carers and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/memories-are-made-of-this-1.69099 |title=Memories are made of this |work=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish Independence==
Banks was a founder and board member of [[Business for Scotland]] and supports [[Scottish Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/business-for-scotland-independence-group-launches-1-2927647|title=Business for Scotland independence group launches |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=14 May 2013|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22521342|title=Scottish referendum: Business leaders join new pro-independence group|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=14 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court appearance==
In January 2016 Banks appeared in court, charged with domestic assault. He was alleged to have carried out an assault on his partner, Kimberley Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-35294090|title=Care home tycoon Tony Banks on domestic violence charge|date=12 January 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial on 22 March 2016, Anderson recanted her testimony, stating she had lied to the officers who took her statement. The Crown withdrew their intention to prosecute, resulting in Banks being cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-35875686 |title='Secret Millionaire' Tony Banks cleared of assault |work=BBC News |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tony Pua Kiam Wee''' ({{zh|t=潘儉偉|s=潘俭伟|p=Pānjiǎnwěi}}; born 1 August 1972) is a Malaysian politician, currently the Member of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] for [[Damansara (federal constituency)|Damansara]] and the [[Political Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Finance (Malaysia)|Minister of Finance]]. Pua is the former Malaysian CEO of Cyber Village Sdn Bhd, a SESDAQ ([[Singapore Exchange|SGX]] second board)-listed company. In early 2007, he disposed of all his interests in the company and tendered his resignation to join the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) in 2008.

Pua graduated from [[Keble College, Oxford]] with a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] under a scholarship from the MTC Foundation in 1994. Prior to that, he received Asean and Shaw Foundation scholarships to pursue his O- and A-Levels in [[Raffles Institution]] and [[Raffles Junior College]], in Singapore.

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Pua won the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliamentary]] constituency of [[Petaling Jaya Utara (federal constituency)|Petaling Jaya Utara]] on a DAP ticket. He ran against the incumbent, [[Malay titles|Datin Paduka]] [[Chew Mei Fun]], Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry for Women, Family &amp; Community Affairs, and Deputy Chief of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] women's wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonypua.blogspot.com/2008/02/tony-pua-for-parliament.html |title=Tony Pua for Parliament |accessdate=25 February 2008 |last=Pua |first=Tony |date=23 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Pua was appointed the DAP member of the [[Pakatan Rakyat]] committee.

Pua retained his parliamentary seat in [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 general election]] with a majority of 106,903, the largest majority in Malaysian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-election-damansara-parliamentary-seat-sees-biggest-victory-margin|title=Malaysia elections: Damansara parliamentary seat sees biggest victory margin|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|author=[[Bernama]]|date=10 May 2018|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tony Pua left home when he was 13 to do his secondary schooling in Singapore on an [[ASEAN Scholarship|ASEAN scholarship]] from the Singapore government. He attended [[Raffles Institution]] and Raffles Junior College. He then went on to [[Oxford University]] where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] at [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]] on a MTC scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/2/18/focus/16873677&amp;sec=focus |title=From cyber world to arena of politics |accessdate=31 January 2012 |last=Tan |first=Joceline |date=18 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021211/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F2%2F18%2Ffocus%2F16873677&amp;sec=focus |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Pua worked for Andersen Consulting (now renamed Accenture) as a consultant after he graduated from Oxford. Two years later, in March 1997, he started Cyber Village when demand for e-business consultancy grew.

With his combined savings and those of his parents amounting to RM20,000 and another RM30,000 chipped in by three friends, he went ahead to open an office in Overseas Union Garden, Old Klang Road, KL with four staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyber-village.net/cvnews_press_theedge.htm |title=Cyber Village does MSC proud |accessdate=15 February 2012 |last=Tan |first=Mary Anne |date=20 July 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235737/http://www.cyber-village.net/cvnews_press_theedge.htm |archive-date=11 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2001, Cyber Village became the first Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)-status company to list on the Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (Sesdaq). Its public offer of 400,000 shares drew an over-subscription of approximately 2.7 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/beritamalaysia/message/38144 |title=Cyber Village Sesdaq debut a success, says CEO  |accessdate=15 February 2012 |date=27 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Cyber Village had successfully undergone a management buyout under the Koyo Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koyotech.com/Koyo%20AR08_060409.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Bersih 1.0 anniversary vigil arrest===
On 9 November 2008, Tony Pua was amongst the 23 arrested during a candlelight vigil in Petaling Jaya to commemorate the first anniversary of the Bersih street demonstration. Pua, along with Kampung Tunku state assemblyman, Lau Weng San, were allegedly manhandled by the police when they were arrested. Pua alleged that he was kicked, shoved and had his shirt torn by the Selangor police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonypua.blogspot.com/2008/11/arrested.html |title=Arrested |accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=Pua |first=Tony |date=10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pua was released on police bail on the morning of 10 November 2008 and was later charged for illegal assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bersih.org/?p=1548 |title=Candlelight Vigil: All but One Freed |accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=Ong |first=Andrew |date=10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death threat===
On 10 August 2010, Tony Pua received a live [[5.56×45mm NATO|5.56mm bullet]] along with a threatening note posted from Tangkak, Johor. The bullet and the note were mailed to his constituency service centre in Damansara Utama. The note stated that Pua should watch out and that the whereabouts of his family, his house and his car were known.

Pua stated that the threat was perhaps related to his proposal to the Selangor government to slash Bumiputera discounts for homes and commercial property priced above RM 500,000 in the state, although he had also added that the 7% discounts enjoyed by Malays and other Bumiputeras should be retained for homes below RM 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pua-gets-bullet-in-mail-death-threat/ |title=Pua gets bullet in mail death threat |accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=Zalkapli |first=Adib |date=10 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509104900/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pua-gets-bullet-in-mail-death-threat/ |archive-date=9 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SYABAS suit===
On 28 January 2011, Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor (SYABAS) filed a lawsuit against Tony Pua claiming that he had permitted Nanyang Siang Pau's Metro edition to publish words defamatory of it. The article had quoted him saying that if the water concessionaires could not settle their debts, the state government should take over the rights of management of water supply in Selangor. Syabas claimed that with the publication of the report in the newspaper, the company had been brought into public scandal and its image had been tarnished. Besides seeking an injunction to prevent Pua or his agents from publishing defamatory words against the company, Syabas was also seeking general damages and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e.nst.com.my/nst/articles/07mbh/Article |title=Syabas chided over suit |accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=Surach |first=G |date=11 February 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pua argued that Syabas, as a public authority performing a public service, had no locus standi in making a defamation claim. He also said that he had a legal, moral and social duty as an MP and a member of the Selangor government Water Review Panel to publish those words as the public had a right to know. Pua also filed a counter-suit, claiming that Syabas' suit was frivolous, vexatious and amounted to an abuse of the court process, which resulted in him suffering losses and unnecessary harassment and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2011/5/19/nation/20110519174340 |title=PJ Utara MP Tony Pua withdraws bid to dismiss Syabas defamation suit |accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=NA |first=NA |date=19 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706034144/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F5%2F19%2Fnation%2F20110519174340&amp;sec=nation |archive-date=6 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2012, the Malaysian High Court had found that SYABAS had succeeded in making its case against Pua for defamation ordered Tony Pua to pay RM200,000 in damages to SYABAS and awarded SYABAS interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of judgment till full payment and also costs. Justice Amelia Tee Hong Geok Abdullah also struck out Pua's counter-claim application and granted SYABAS an injunction to restrain Pua and his agents from further publishing or giving permission to be published "similar defamatory words" against SYABAS.  The court found that "whilst the plaintiff may be encountering cash flow issues, the court does not believe that it is looking to this case to replenish its coffers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/6/6/nation/20120606164709&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221035155/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/6/6/nation/20120606164709&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 2013 |title=Tony Pua to pay Syabas RM200,000 over defamation suit |accessdate=20 July 2012 |last=NA |first=NA |date=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pua later stated on his blog that he maintains "that the above statement is not defamatory, and will instruct my lawyers to file an appeal in the Court of Appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonypua.blogspot.com/2012/06/tony-pua-ordered-to-pay-rm200000.html|title=Tony Pua Ordered To Pay RM200,000 Damages to SYABAS|accessdate=20 July 2012 |last=Pua |first=Tony |date=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2012, Pua posted on his blog that although an appeal was underway, he was required to pay the amount of RM200,000 to SYABAS by 16 July 2012. DAP Malaysia subsequently initiated  "RM1 for Water Rights: 100,000 Malaysians Support Tony Pua vs Syabas" an online public mass fund-raising campaign, calling for 100,000 Malaysians to donate RM1 each to help Pua pay for the damages to SYABAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonypua.blogspot.com/2012/07/100000-malaysians-support-tonypua-vs.html|title=100,000 Malaysians Support TonyPua vs SYABAS|accessdate=20 July 2012 |last=Pua |first=Tony |date=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently won the Court of Appeal case. SYABAS appealed the decision to the Federal Court.

In the 2015 Federal Court case ([2015] 6 MLJ 187), Tony Pua won the appeal based on Lucas-Box principle by providing his own reasonable meaning to the impugned words. Justification defense was successfully raised by Tony Pua.

==Remarks==

===Abolishing Bumiputra discounts for higher-priced housing===
Tony Pua suggested that the Bumiputera discount for housing and real estate must be abolished for houses above RM500,000. He said that he does not oppose affirmative actions. However, he disagrees with giving discounts on expensive houses such as those priced at RM 1 million or RM 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/diskaun-bumiputera-pas-selangor-tidak-selesa-syor-tony-pua/ Diskaun Bumiputera: PAS Selangor tidak selesa syor Tony Pua] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914024455/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/diskaun-bumiputera-pas-selangor-tidak-selesa-syor-tony-pua |date=14 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing civil servants===
In one of his statements, Tony Pua said that the government should reduce the number of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/2/18/focus/16873677&amp;sec=focus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222153347/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F2%2F18%2Ffocus%2F16873677&amp;sec=focus |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2007 |title=From cyber world to arena of politics |accessdate=31 January 2012 |last=Tan |first=Joceline |date=18 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his idea was rejected by PKR leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]] as not practical. Tony said that he only wants to see the government sector becoming more efficient with less cost.&lt;ref&gt;YUEN MEIKENG and RAHIMY RAHIM .

'''Unemployment extension''' occurs when regular [[unemployment benefits]] are exhausted and extended for additional weeks. Unemployment extensions are created by passing new [[legislation]] at the federal level, often referred to as an "unemployment extension bill."  This new legislation is introduced and passed during times of high or above average [[unemployment]] rates. Unemployment extensions are set during a date range in order to estimate their [[federal cost]].  After expiration, the unemployment data is re-evaluated, and new legislation may be proposed and passed to further extend them.

==Unemployment Extensions in The United States==
In the [[United States]], there is a standard of 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, known as "regular [[unemployment insurance]] (UI) benefits."  There are two programs for extending unemployment insurance (UI) benefits:&lt;ref name="ui1"&gt;[http://www.twc.state.tx.us/ui/bnfts/benefitextensions.pdf Texas Workforce Commission], Understanding Extended Unemployment Benefits PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency Unemployment Compensation]] (EUC) and Extended Benefits (EB).

The unemployment insurance program is a great benefit for workers whom have lost their job. The maximum duration of benefits has increased from 26 to 99 weeks in some states. Unemployment extensions across the United States are a concern due to the lack of motivation in obtaining a job due to health issues. A solution to the problem would be to implement frequent processes to ensure the individual continues to stay actively applying as well as proper health routines are done. The benefits given are too long causing a lack in motivation to find a job and health issues that arise as a result of being laid off. Health issues include: anxiety, depression, joint problems, and low self-esteem. A solution to the problem would be to require routine health checkups to individuals receiving the unemployment benefits. Another solution would be to provide seminars that help motivate individuals and keep them prepared when actively applying for jobs to avoid the benefits extension that would lead to underlying health issues. Providing unemployed individuals with the proper tools and resources will help with the unemployment rate and the need for extending unemployment benefits in the United States.

EUC is a 100% federally funded program that provides benefits to individuals who have exhausted regular state benefits. The EUC program was created on June 30, 2008, and has been modified several times. Most recently, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) extended the expiration date of the EUC program to January 1, 2014. To date, Congress has not passed any further extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/supp_act.asp|title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Expired on January 1, 2014, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)===
{{prose|section|date=September 2010}}
''EUC has four levels: Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4.''&lt;ref name="ui2"&gt;[http://www.esd.wa.gov/uibenefits/fileweekly/extension/emergency-unemployment-compensation.php Washington State Employment Dept.], Emergency Unemployment Compensation FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

EUC08, or Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008, is an extension of unemployment benefits authorized under Federal law.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (enacted on Feb 22, 2012) modified EUC08.&lt;ref name="ui5"&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/uipl_4_10_change9_acc.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 04-10, Change 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ui6"&gt;[http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/KeyDates_Table.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Key Dates for UI Programs Following Enactment of Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, P.L. 112-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimants who filed an initial claim effective on or after May 7, 2006 are potentially eligible for EUC08. Individuals who are monetarily ineligible when a new benefit year is filed may qualify for EUC08 on the basis of a previous claim.

* EUC Tier 1
** Provides up to 20 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 22, 2008)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 14 weeks of benefits
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust regular UI benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state


* EUC Tier 2
** Provides up to 14 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 6, 2009)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 1 benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state (a state high unemployment trigger was required before Nov 6, 2009)
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, requires 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%


* EUC Tier 3
** Provides up to 13 weeks of benefits 
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 9 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 2 benefits
** Enacted Nov 6, 2009
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 4.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 7.0%; IUR requirement not changed


* EUC Tier 4
** Provides up to 6 weeks of benefits
** Between Feb 22, 2012 and May 31, 2012 increased to 16 weeks of benefits in states not receiving Extended Benefits (EB).  Claimants may have their benefits increased in certain cases:
*** Claimants receiving Tier 4 benefits on Feb 22, 2012, in states not receiving Extended Benefits on Feb 22, 2012, will be increased to 16 weeks
*** New Tier 4 claims in this period (in states not receiving Extended Benefits the week of the new claim) are entitled to 16 weeks of benefits
*** Claimants in states that transition off Extended Benefits in this period are NOT entitled to an increase; their claim start week (compared to their state's EB status) determines whether they are entitled to 6 or 16 weeks of benefits.
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, 16 weeks of benefits reduced to 6 weeks (EB test removed)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, increased to 10 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 3 benefits
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 8.5%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 6.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 9.0%; IUR requirement not changed

===Extended Benefits (EB)===
Extended Benefits are available to workers who have exhausted regular unemployment insurance benefits during periods of high [[unemployment]]. The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment. Some States have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks (20 weeks maximum) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment.&lt;ref name="ui4"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/extenben.asp U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reachback==
In addition to individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits after the original date of enactment, the [[#Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)|EUC]] law includes what is commonly referred to as a [[reachback provision]]. A reachback provision makes eligible those individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits prior to the original date of enactment (back to a specified date). The EUC law makes eligible all individuals whose benefit year ending date is on or after May 1, 2007. Practically speaking, this means some individuals receiving EUC may have become unemployed as early as May 2006.&lt;ref name="ui3"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Program PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
