'''Ağdam''' (also spelled '''Agdam''' or '''Aghdam''') is a [[ghost town]] in the southwest part of [[Azerbaijan]] and the formal capital of its [[Agdam District]], today controlled by the [[Republic of Artsakh|de facto Republic of Artsakh]]. Founded in the early 19th century, it grew considerably during the Soviet period and had 28,000 inhabitants by 1989. Armenian forces [[Battle of Aghdam|captured Agdam]] in July 1993 during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caucasus City Falls to Armenian Forces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/24/world/caucasus-city-falls-to-armenian-forces.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 August 1993|quote=In July, Armenian forces forced out the defenders of Agdam, Azerbaijan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy fighting forced the entire population to flee eastwards. Upon seizing the city, [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] (NKR) forces destroyed much of the town to discourage Azerbaijanis from returning. More damage occurred in the following decades when locals looted the abandoned town for building materials. It is currently almost entirely ruined and uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Specter|first1=Michael|authorlink1=Michael Specter|title=Azerbaijan, Potentially Rich, Is Impoverished by Warfare|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/world/azerbaijan-potentially-rich-is-impoverished-by-warfare.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 June 1994|quote=Cities like Agdam have been emptied of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 it was renamed by the NKR government to '''Akna''' ({{lang-hy|Ակնա}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenian separatists rename Azeri town|url=http://www.azernews.az/azerbaijan/26472.html|work=azernews.az|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=July 23 marks 21st anniv. of Akna (Aghdam) liberation|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/foreign/news/180991/|agency=[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]|date=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administratively part of the town of [[Askeran (town)|Askeran]], which is located some 10&amp;nbsp;km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musayelyan|first1=Lusine|title=Life Among Ruins of Caucasus' Hiroshima|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/life-among-ruins-caucasus-hiroshima|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The city's name is of [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] origin and means "white house", where ''{{lang|az|ağ}}'' means "white" and ''{{lang|az|dam}}'' is "house" or "attic", thus referring to a "bright sun-lit, white house" which was given by [[Panah Ali Khan]] of the [[Karabakh Khanate]].&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agdam city |url=http://www.mct.gov.az/?/en/cities/view/291/ |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan]] |accessdate=26 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720031731/http://www.mct.gov.az/?%2Fen%2Fcities%2Fview%2F291%2F |archivedate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it was derived from ancient [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] glossary meaning "small fortress". In the distant past, Turkic speaking tribes built small fortresses for their protection and safety.&lt;ref name=orig/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Agdam mosque.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Agdam Mosque]] on Azerbaijani stamp (depicted as it looked before the Karabakh war)]]

===Nagorno-Karabakh War===
{{main|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}
[[File:Aghdam_6.jpg|thumb|Nature slowly reclaiming the ruins]]
Agdam was the scene of fierce fighting during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. According to journalist Robert Parsons, Azerbaijani forces used Agdam as a base for attacks on Karabakh, launching [[BM-21 Grad]] missiles and bombing raids from there against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parsons |first=Robert |title=Tug-of-war for Nagorno-Karabakh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/775655.stm |accessdate=26 July 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 June 2000 |archivedate=27 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427155501/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/775655.stm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Aghdam]], Armenian forces violated the rules of war by hostage-taking, indiscriminate fire, and the forcible displacement of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. ''Azerbaijan: Seven years of conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh''. p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; As the city fell, almost its entire population fled eastward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Amanda |title=Agdam – an Azerbaijani ghost town |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-244251-agdam----an-azerbaijani-ghost-town.html |accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519205653/http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-244251-agdam----an-azerbaijani-ghost-town.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armed Forces of Armenia]] still use the city as a [[buffer zone]], meaning that Ağdam remains empty and decaying, and usually off-limits for [[tourism|sightseeing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hannigan |first=Chris |title=Ghost Towns: Ağdam, Azerbaijan |url=http://googlesightseeing.com/2010/01/ghost-towns-agdam-azerbaijan/ |accessdate=26 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813235151/http://googlesightseeing.com/2010/01/ghost-towns-agdam-azerbaijan/ |archivedate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chauffor |first=Célia |title=Report: Agdam, ghost city |url=http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=55 |publisher=Caucaz Europenewz |accessdate=26 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701011859/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=55 |archivedate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war years===
The ruined city once had a population of almost 40,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pop-stat.mashke.org/azerbaijan-cities.htm|title=Azerbaijani cities}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today it is an almost entirely uninhabited [[ghost town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Abandoned Cities from Around the World|url=http://www.dailycognition.com/index.php/2008/08/30/20-abandoned-cities-from-around-the-world.html|work=Daily Cognition|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the houses are ruined, some by shells fired in the war, others due to looting for building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esslemont|first=Tom|title=Karabakh guns still at the ready|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8117243.stm|accessdate=21 February 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aze.az/eng.php?id=17254 Armenians occupied Agdam cities listed among the ghosts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706131004/http://www.aze.az/eng.php?id=17254 |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Azeri sources one of the buildings to be stripped of materials is the [[Agdam Mosque]], which has been converted into a barn for cattle and pigs. Its derelict condition, including a missing roof, drew criticism from Azerbaijani and Turkish communities, who wrote a letter in 2010 to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] asking him to warn Armenians (though Armenians predominantly follow a church which [[Armenian Apostolic Church#Miaphysitism versus monophysitism|broke with Rome]] in the 6th century) about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turks complain to Pope on vandalism in Karabakh mosque by Armenians |url=http://www.news.az/articles/19325 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720025140/http://www.news.az/articles/19325 |archivedate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Armenians the mosques in Karabakh are mostly perceived as an Iranian cultural heritage not Azerbaijani heritage and the mosque has never been used so. It is closed nowadays. Also, according to Artsakh republic authorities the roof of the mosque was restored.

[[Mugham]] music, a tradition in the Karabakh region, is an important part of Agdam's musical heritage; the city was home to [[Agdam Mugham School]], which produced "Karabakh nightingales" ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shirinov|first1=Elnur|title="Qarabağ bülbülləri" nin yaradıcısı kimdir |url=http://www.anl.az/down/medeniyyet2008/may/medeniyyet2008_may_579.htm|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Золотой голос Карабаха – Гадир Рустамов |url=http://karabakhinfo.com/4499?lang=ru|website=karabakhinfo.com|accessdate=14 November 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle in 1993 caused a lot of structural damage, and the 20 years since then have seen the natural deterioration of abandoned buildings as well as the local people taking materials for their own personal use. Anyone visiting now will see a ruined city which will bear little resemblance to the original place prior to 1993. This is in the buffer zone close to the front line with an uncertain future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4565">'''Ahmad ibn Sahl ibn Hashim''' (died 920) was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] aristocrat who served the [[Saffarids]] and later the [[Samanids]].

==Biography==
[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Khurasan]], [[Transoxiana]] and [[Tokharistan]]]]
Ahmad belonged to a ''[[dehqan]]'' family of [[Merv]] known as the Kamkarian family, which claimed descent from the last [[Sasanian]] king, [[Yazdegerd III]]. Ahmad was the son of a certain Sahl, and had three unnamed brothers, who were later killed during a local struggle in Merv between Iranians and [[Arabs]]. Ahmad, in order to avenge his three brothers, revolted against his overlord, the Saffarid ruler [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] (r. 879–901), but was defeated and taken prisoner in [[Sistan]].{{sfn|Gibb|1967|p=278}} However, he managed to escape and then returned to Merv, where he captured the local governor [[Abu Ja'far Ghuri]] and proclaimed his adherence to Samanid ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]] (r. 892-907).{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=643-644}} He shortly went to the Samanid court at [[Bukhara]] and quickly achieved prominence under Isma'il. 

In 900 (or 901), Ismail defeated and captured Amr at [[Balkh]], and shortly conquered his territories in Khurasan, which Ahmad also played a role in. In ca. 902, Ahmad was appointed as the governor of the newly conquered province of [[Tabaristan]]. He later served as the commander of the army in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and also as leader of the personal guards of the Samanid prince who governed the city, [[Abu Salih Mansur]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=54}} During the reign of Isma'il's successor, [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907-914), Ahmad was sent in 910-11 along with other prominent Samanid officers to conquer Sistan.

During the reign of Ahmad's successor, [[Nasr II]] (r. 914-943), Ahmad was sent in 919 to suppress the rebellion of the governor of Khurasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], which he managed to accomplish.{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=643-644}}{{sfn|Houtsma|1993|p=871}} Husayn was captured during the battle and was sent to Bukhara. After a few weeks, however, after being lied to by Nasr, who had been promising him a certain thing, Ahmad shortly rebelled at [[Nishapur]], made incursions into the Samanid city of [[Gorgan]], and managed to repel its governor Karategin.{{sfn|Houtsma|1993|p=872}} He then fortified himself in Merv to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]. Ahmad was captured during the battle and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.

The '''Aloha Festivals''' are an annual series of free cultural celebrations observed in the state of [[Hawaii]] in the [[United States]]. It is the only statewide cultural festival in the nation. Highlights include the presentation of the Royal Court, a [[ho'olaule'a]] in [[Waikiki]], and the Floral Parade. Approximately 30,000 people volunteer to plan, organize, and provide labor for the Aloha Festivals each year. Their efforts entertain over 1,000,000 people from throughout the state and visitors from all over the world.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
In the spirit of preserving the [[Hawaiian culture]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], the Aloha Festivals were established in 1946 as '''Aloha Week''' by former members of the local Junior Chamber of Commerce. The former manager of the festivals, [[Goriann Akau]], has said, "In 1946, after the war, Hawaiians needed an identity. We were lost and needed to regroup. When we started to celebrate our culture, we began to feel proud. We have a wonderful culture that had been buried for a number of years. This brought it out again. Self-esteem is more important than making a lot of money."&lt;ref name="Foster2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Jeanette|title=Frommer's Maui 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJB7ad5vqvEC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=7 July 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-10069-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Scaling down ===
The festival was celebrated on six of Hawaii's islands, but in 2008 festival organizers decided to hold most events on Oahu due to a lack of funding. There was also the chance that the Floral Parade would be cancelled altogether, but it was saved by private donors and funds from the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|City and County of Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/blogs/hawaii_today/2009/9/19/Aloha_Festivals_Hawaii_parade_2009_schedule|title=Aloha Festivals 2009 ho‘olaulea block party, parade coming up.

=== Presentation of the Royal Court ===

'''Anime South''' was a three-day [[anime convention]] held in the city of [[Pensacola, Florida]]. The convention also has the distinction of being the first anime convention to garner its [[seed money]] from a small number of contributors who desired an anime convention in the area.

==Programming==
Anime South hosted many events common to other anime conventions, such as anime screenings, panels and workshops, game shows, dealers room, artist alley, video game room, dance, and cosplay events.&lt;ref name="dl2006b"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Holt | first1 = Keri | title = Anime fans up to speed on dating scene | newspaper = The Destin Log | date = 2006-11-15 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Anime South was created by one of the co-founders of [[Anime USA]]. Planning took place over a two-month period, after which the largest luxury hotel in the region, The Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort &amp; Spa, was contracted for November 18–20, 2005.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} The 2015 event was cancelled due to financial issues.&lt;ref name="AC-2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/events/info/5477/anime-south-2015 | title = Anime South 2015 Information | publisher = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian Off Road Championship''' (AORC) is an off-road-based [[rally racing|rally]] championship held annually in [[Australia]], with the inaugural event held in [[1981 Australian Off Road Championship|1981]]. AORC events are defined as ‘long course’ events that are conducted on a track of no less than 15 kilometres in length, but are usually between 75 and 100 kilometres. The courses and tracks used for the AORC vary greatly and can be narrow, twisting and tree-lined, undulating farmland tracks, sand dunes and creek crossings, often incorporating man-made jumps and other obstacles but usually have high average speeds.

Most events run over three days with Scrutineering (safety checks on vehicles), Prologue (short time trial to determine starting order for event proper) and racing over one to two days (usually split into Sections). Most events also feature a Top Ten Shootout (opportunity for the ten fastest prologue vehicles to prologue again) and a Dash for Cash where the fastest two vehicles in each class (not involved in the Top Ten Shootout) race each other to win prize money.

To enter vehicles must comply with regulations determined by the Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS). There are ten classes for vehicles.

==Background==
When the [[Assyria]]n capital [[Nineveh]] was [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|overrun]] by the Medes, Scythians, Babylonians and their allies in 612 BC, the Assyrians moved their capital to [[Harran]]. When Harran was [[Fall of Harran|captured]] by the alliance in 609 BC,&lt;ref name="Grant1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle: A Visual Journey Through 5,000 Years of Combat |location=London |publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; remnants of the Assyrian army joined [[Carchemish]], a city under Egyptian rule, on the [[Euphrates]] river. Egypt (a former vassal of Assyria) was allied with the Assyrian king [[Ashur-uballit II]], and marched in 609 BC to his aid against the Babylonians.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian army of Pharaoh [[Necho II]] was delayed at [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Megiddo]] by the forces of King [[Josiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Josiah was killed, and his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)]].

The Egyptians and Assyrians together crossed the Euphrates and laid siege to Harran, which they failed to retake. They then retreated to north western Assyria (in what is today north eastern [[Syria]]).

==Battle==
The Egyptians met the full might of the Babylonian and Median army led by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] at Carchemish where the combined Egyptian and Assyrian forces were destroyed. Assyria ceased to exist as an independent power, and Egypt retreated and was no longer a significant force in the [[Ancient Near East]]. Babylonia reached its economic peak after 605&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;King, Philip J., 1993 ''Jeremiah: An Archaeological Companion'', Westminster/John Knox Press p.22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7xZ-HUcAEP8C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=carchemish+battle+605&amp;ei=0rNzSI6TIJXEigG_6_zpBw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Wzw_pgL4_ZsnOWUInugnu63dVpA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records of the battle==
The [[Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle]], now housed in the [[British Museum]], claims that Nebuchadnezzar "crossed the river to go against the Egyptian army which lay in Karchemiš. They fought with each other and the Egyptian army withdrew before him. He accomplished their defeat, decisively. As for the rest of the Egyptian army which had escaped from the defeat so quickly that no weapon had reached them, in the district of [[Hamath]] the Babylonian troops [[Battle of Hamath|overtook and defeated them]] so that not a single man escaped to his own country. At that time Nebuchadnezzar conquered the whole area of Hamath."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II. Retrieved July 18, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle is also mentioned and described in the [[Bible]], in the [[Book of Jeremiah]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bible, Jeremiah 46:3–12&lt;/ref&gt; The battle mentioned in 2 Chronicles 35:20-27 is not the same; the event referred to there is the [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)]], which occurred four years earlier, also near Carchemish (2 Chronicles 35:20).

== Discrepancy ==
However, it is unclear historically if Pharaoh Necho II was for or against the king of Assyria, according to [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] in his record ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0146:book=10:whiston+chapter=5:whiston+section=1|title=Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 10, Whiston chapter 5, Whiston section 1|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various christian commentators, such as [[Matthew Henry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/2-kings/23.html|title=2 Kings 23 Commentary - Matthew Henry Commentary on the Whole Bible (Complete)|website=Bible Study Tools|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Peter Lange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblehub.com/commentaries/lange/2_kings/22.htm|title=2 Kings 22 Lange Commentary on the Holy Scriptures|website=www.biblehub.com|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such accounts render the battle as King Josiah either heroically trying to rescue the Assyrians from their enemies or attempting to avoid being surrounded by an enemy.

'''Blue Ear''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Julie |last= Hanson|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20120526/NEWS/705269948|title=Superheroes do wear blue ears, thanks to NH boy|work= The Union Leader|date=May 26, 2012|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel created the character in honor of Anthony Smith, a [[Deafness|hard-of-hearing]] 4-year-old comic book fan from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]], [[New Hampshire]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/05/23/hearing-impaired-new-hampshire-boy-inspires-new-marvel-comics-super-hero/|title=Hearing-impaired New Hampshire boy inspires new Marvel Comics superhero| publisher= Fox News|date=May 23, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has no hearing in his right ear and minimal hearing in his left because he has Mosaic [[trisomy 22]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Michelle |last= Castillo|title=Marvel team creates deaf superhero called Blue Ear in honor of boy| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57441863-10391704/marvel-team-creates-deaf-superhero-called-blue-ear-in-honor-of-boy/|publisher=CBS News|date=May 25, 2012|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Smith was given a [[hearing aid]] by his mother, Christina D'Allesandro, and was using it regularly until he became depressed and refused to wear it to school in 2012. According to Smith, "superheroes don't wear blue ears". D'Allesandro was alarmed by this and emailed Marvel Comics in [[New York City]] for assistance with the situation. Designer and assistant editor, Nelson Ribeiro, then created the original image of the Blue Ear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fans.marvel.com/trades_department/blog/2012/05/24/the_blue_ear|title=The Blue Ear|publisher=''Marvel''|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent it to the D'Allesandro family. Later, production artist [[Manny Mederos]] started working on a sketch of Blue Ear as a kid. Mederos told ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that during the creative process, Mederos had an idea: "Why not have the superhero be a young kid himself?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Ileana |last= Llorens| url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/marvel-comics-artists-create-blue-ear-hearing-impaired-boy_n_1537300.html|title=Anthony Smith, Hearing-Impaired Boy, Gets Custom Superhero, 'The Blue Ear,' From Marvel Comics |work= Huffington Post| date=May 22, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel Comics responded by sending D'Allesandro comics of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] from the 1980s, when the superhero lost 80% of his hearing and had to wear hearing aids, along with a drawing of "The Blue Ear", a superhero based on Anthony, saying, "Thanks to my listening device I hear someone in trouble!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailywh.at/2012/05/24/heartwarming-tearjerker-of-the-day-58/|title=Heartwarming Tearjerker of the Day|publisher=The Daily What|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722155111/http://thedailywh.at/2012/05/24/heartwarming-tearjerker-of-the-day-58/#|archive-date=2012-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annmarie|last=Timmins|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/330760/real-life-heroes?page=0,0|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729182727/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/330760/real-life-heroes?page=0,0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 29, 2012|title=Marvel Comics came through when a New Hampshire mom put out the call for help|work=[[Concord Monitor]]|date=May 20, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Allesandro stated that Smith took the comic book pictures to his preschool, which pushed teachers to have a "superhero week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/marvel-creates-new-superhero-for-hearing-impaired-new-hampshire-boy/story-e6frf7l6-1226365269279| title= Marvel creates new superhero for hearing-impaired New Hampshire boy| work=Herald Sun|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's grandfather, New Hampshire senator [[Lou D'Allesandro]], stated, "This is a feel good moment, it's a feel good story, and we've got to get the world to recognize that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Stacey |last= Leasca| url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/weird-wide-web/marvel-blue-ear-hearing-impaired-superhero|title=Blue Ear superhero created by Marvel for hearing impaired boy |publisher=Global Post|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Smith attended an event at the Center for Hearing and Communication to debut a poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= JK |last= Parkin|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/iron-man-and-blue-ear-debut-poster-campaign-for-hearing-impaired-kids/|title= Iron Man and Blue Ear debut poster campaign for hearing-impaired kids|publisher=''Comic Book Resources''|work=Robot6|date= 2 March 2013| accessdate= March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blue Ear character returned for his comic debut in a Team-up Marvel Custom Solutions Iron Man Issue, along with the titular Iron Man &amp; new character named Sapheara, for another campaign for deaf kids. Under the costumes based on Nelson Ribeiro's design, Blue Ear this time was written under the name 'Dr. Pedro Perez', &amp; was given an origin for his heroic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Tim |last= Stevens|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/23586/iron_man_introduces_blue_ear/|title= IRON MAN INTRODUCES BLUE EAR|publisher=''Marvel''|date= 31 October 2014|accessdate= October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://read.marvel.com/#/labelbook/40645|title= ''Iron Man:Sound Effects'' #1|publisher=''Marvel''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Ear returns with Sapheara under a four-part, one-page 'Limited Comic Strip Series' called ''Blue Ear &amp; Sapheara'' in celebration for Better Hearing &amp; Speech Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.childrenshearing.org/sites/default/files/file/CHIBES1.pdf|title=''Blue Ear &amp; Sapheara Part 1:Rooftop Rescue''|publisher=''Children's Hearing Institute, Marvel''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabinet of [[Lucas Papademos]] succeeded the [[Cabinet of George Papandreou|cabinet]] of [[George Papandreou]], as an interim three-party coalition cabinet, leading a [[coalition government]] formed by the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) party, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party and [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucas Papademos sworn in as Greece's prime minister|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/11/lucas-papademos-greece-prime-minister|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=Guardian|date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Papandreou's decision to step down, and allow a [[national unity government|provisional coalition government]] to form with the task to take Greece out of a major political crisis caused by the country's [[Greek government debt crisis|debt crisis]].&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/lucas-papademos-greece-interim-coalition|title=Lucas Papademos to lead Greece's interim coalition government|date=10 November 2011|work=Guardian (UK)|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first coalition cabinet in Greece since the 1989–1990 Ecumenical Cabinet of [[Xenophon Zolotas]].

The [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] Lucas Papademos and the [[Cabinet of Greece|Cabinet]] were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Greek govt takes over, former banker at helm|url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-11-11-EU-Greece-Financial-Crisis/id-98805fa6da654460a141ba38be2d63e7|publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=11 November 2011|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government formation process==
{{wikinews|Greek PM survives confidence vote}}
On November 6, Prime Minister George Papandreou met with opposition leaders to try to reach an agreement on the formation of an [[provisional government|interim government]], after a narrow confidence vote win in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15604169 "Greek PM Papandreou faces unity challenge over bailout"] at bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; 
A day earlier, the leader of the opposition New Democracy party [[Antonis Samaras]] had rejected the proposal and called for an immediate election. 
After Papandreou agreed to step aside, however, the two leaders announced their intention to form a [[national unity government]] that would allow the EU bailout to proceed and pave the way for [[next Greek legislative election|elections]] on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/06/papandreou-greek-leaders-unity-deal |title=Papandreou out as Greek leaders agree unity government deal |last1=Kington |first1=Tom |last2=Smith |first2=Helena |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/greek-pm-george-papandreou-resigns;-polls-set-for-february/1/19851.html |title=Greek PM George Papandreou resigns; polls set for February |publisher=Business Today |accessdate=7  November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] and the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] Party, refused Papandreou's invitation to join talks on a new unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political opposition divided over unity government|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/11/2011_413717|publisher=e.kathemerini.com|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After several days of intense negotiations, the two major parties along with the Popular Orthodox Rally agreed to form a [[grand coalition]] headed by former [[European Central Bank]] vice-president [[Lucas Papademos]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15671354|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

On November 10, George Papandreou formally resigned as Prime Minister of Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Papandreou resigns as Greece's prime minister|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8879647/George-Papandreou-resigns-as-Greeces-prime-minister.html|publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=11 November 2011|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new coalition cabinet and Prime Minister Lucas Papademos were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/11/us-greece-f-idUSTRE7AA2H720111111 |title=Papademos sworn in, heads Greek cabinet of stalwarts |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national unity government's main task was to allow the EU bailout to proceed and to pave the way for elections on 19 February 2012. Papademos, who was not an elected MP, has said his priority will be to keep Greece in the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15691697 |title=Greece swears in unity cabinet and PM Lucas Papademos |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cabinet==
In total, 48 people including the prime minister make up the government, seven more than its immediate predecessor. There are 12 new ministers in its ranks, of which nine have been sworn into government office for the first time, including the new premier.
Broadly, most Cabinet members served in the previous government of George Papandreou. Nevertheless, the new coalition government also includes six members hailing from the main opposition New Democracy party.  

On 10 February 2012, the Popular Orthodox Rally withdrew from the coalition government after refusing to support the latest austerity deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/10/debt-crisis-greece Greece on shaky ground as coalition party rejects troika loan deal], ''The Guardian'', 10 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The party's only cabinet minister, [[Makis Voridis]], was expelled by [[Georgios Karatzaferis]] for supporting the package but retained his portfolio after consultations with the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Ναι» στο Μνημόνιο από 199 βουλευτές και «όχι» από 74|url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=443281|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=[[To Vima]]|date=13 February 2012|location=Athens|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Χωρίς ανασχηματισμό η κυβέρνηση - Παραμένει ο Βορίδης|url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=443589|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=To Vima|date=14 February 2012|location=Athens|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he joined New Democracy and surrendered his parliamentary seat to LAOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Προσχώρησαν στη Ν.Δ. οι Μ.

A minor cabinet reshuffle was announced in March 2012, after [[Christos Papoutsis]] resigned as [[Ministry of Citizen Protection (Greece)|Minister for Citizen Protection]] in order to pursue the PASOK leadership. He was replaced by [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]], who was succeeded as development minister by [[Anna Diamantopoulou]].

'''Central bank liquidity swap''' is a type of [[currency swap]] used by a country's central bank to provide liquidity of its currency to another country's central bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central banks to restore currency swaps|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a88cdda-5bdb-11df-85a3-00144feab49a.html#axzz1JqYrs5r2|date=May 10, 2010 |work=ft.com|author=James Politi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/china-newzealand-swaps-idUSL3E7FI0LH20110418|title=China, New Zealand sign 25 bln yuan currency swap deal |author=Zhou Xin |author2=Kevin Yao|date=Apr 18, 2011|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the Federal Reserve operates swap lines under the authority of Section 14 of the [[Federal Reserve Act]] and in compliance with authorizations, policies, and procedures established by the FOMC.

==History==
On December 12, 2007, the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) announced that it had authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements ('''central bank liquidity swap''' lines) with the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Swiss National Bank]] to help provide liquidity in U.S. dollars to overseas markets.&lt;ref name="Fed CBLS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Central bank liquidity swaps | work =Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet | publisher =Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date =2009-04-02 | url =http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_liquidityswaps.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the FOMC authorized liquidity swap lines with additional central banks. The swap lines are designed to improve liquidity conditions in U.S. and foreign financial markets by providing foreign [[central bank]]s with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of market stress.&lt;ref name="Fed FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title = Frequently asked questions: central bank liquidity swaps | work =Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet | publisher =Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date =2009-04-02 | url =http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_swapfaqs.htm | accessdate = 2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|4}}, swap lines were authorized with the following institutions: the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]], the [[Banco Central do Brasil]], the [[Bank of Canada]], [[Danmarks Nationalbank]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Bank of Japan]], the [[Bank of Korea]], the [[Banco de Mexico]], the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]], [[Norges Bank]], the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], [[Sveriges Riksbank]], and the Swiss National Bank. The FOMC authorized these liquidity swap lines through October 30, 2009.

By November 2011, swap agreements were extended until February 2013, at lower interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/30/142945987/the-central-banks-are-doing-what|accessdate=2012-01-02|date=2011-11-30|title=The Central Banks Are Doing What?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These swaps involve two transactions. When a foreign central bank draws on its swap line with the Federal Reserve, the foreign central bank sells a specified amount of its currency to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars at the prevailing market exchange rate. The Federal Reserve holds the foreign currency in an account at the foreign central bank. The dollars that the Federal Reserve provides are deposited in an account that the foreign central bank maintains at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]. At the same time, the Federal Reserve and the foreign central bank enter into a binding agreement for a second transaction that obligates the foreign central bank to buy back its currency on a specified future date at the same exchange rate. The second transaction unwinds the first. At the conclusion of the second transaction, the foreign central bank pays interest, at a market-based rate, to the Federal Reserve.

When the foreign central bank lends the dollars it obtained by drawing on its swap line to institutions in its jurisdiction, the dollars are transferred from the foreign central bank's account at the Federal Reserve to the account of the bank that the borrowing institution uses to clear its dollar transactions. The foreign central bank remains obligated to return the dollars to the Federal Reserve under the terms of the agreement, and the Federal Reserve is not a counterparty to the loan extended by the foreign central bank. The foreign central bank bears the credit risk associated with the loans it makes to institutions in its jurisdiction.

==Revenue and cost impacts==
The foreign currency that the Federal Reserve acquires is an asset on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. In tables 1, 9, and 10 of the H.4.1 statistical release, the dollar value of amounts that the foreign central banks have drawn but not yet repaid is reported in the line "Central bank liquidity swaps."&lt;ref name="Fed h41"&gt;{{cite web | title = Factors Affecting Reserve Balances | work =Federal Reserve Statistical Release | publisher =Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date =2009-04-02 | url =http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/ | accessdate = 2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the swap will be unwound at the same exchange rate that was used in the initial draw, the dollar value of the asset is not affected by changes in the market exchange rate. The dollar funds deposited in the accounts that foreign central banks maintain at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are a Federal Reserve liability. In principle, draws would initially appear in tables 1, 9, and 10 in the line "foreign and official" deposits. However, the foreign central banks generally lend the dollars shortly after drawing on the swap line. At that point, the funds shift to the line "deposits of depository institutions."

When a foreign central bank draws on its swap line to fund its dollar tender operations, it pays interest to the Federal Reserve in an amount equal to the interest the foreign central bank earns on its tender operations. The Federal Reserve holds the foreign currency that it acquires in the swap transaction at the foreign central bank (rather than lending it or investing it in private markets) and does not pay interest. The structure of the arrangement serves to avoid domestic currency reserve management difficulties for foreign central banks that could arise if the Federal Reserve actively invested the foreign currency holdings in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Fed FAQ"/&gt;

The Federal Reserve Board issues a weekly release that includes information on the aggregate value of swap drawings outstanding. With the onset of the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] and the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, the balance grew rapidly. {{As of|2009|April}} the balance was $293,533 million.&lt;ref name="Fed h41"/&gt; Central bank liquidity swaps have maturities ranging from overnight to three months. Table 2 of the H.4.1 statistical release reports the remaining maturity of outstanding central bank liquidity swaps.&lt;ref name="Fed h41"/&gt;

[[File:Navy Pier Chicago.JPG|thumb|275px|The Theater is located on Navy Pier in the building to the right.]] '''Chicago Shakespeare Theater''' ('''CST''') is a non-profit, professional theater company located at [[Navy Pier]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Its more than six hundred annual performances performed 48 weeks of the year include its critically acclaimed Shakespeare series, its World's Stage touring productions, and youth and family oriented programming concentrated in the summer.  The theater had garnered 77 [[Joseph Jefferson awards]] and three [[Laurence Olivier Awards]]. In 2008, it was the winner of the [[Regional Theatre Tony Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navypier.com/chicago-shakespeare-theater/|title=Chicago Shakespeare Theater - Navy Pier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The company's present artistic director [[Barbara Gaines (director)|Barbara Gaines]] founded the theater in 1986, when it began performances on the roof of the Red Lion Pub in the city's [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park neighborhood]].  In 1999, the company received permission to build its permanent home: a two-venue facility at [[Navy Pier]].

Productions at the theater include works from the [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean canon]] as well as other plays and musicals.  In addition to its own original productions, the Chicago Shakespare Theater also hosts touring productions from other theater companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoshakes.com/about_us/about|title=Chicago Shakespeare Theater About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago Shakespeare Theater is part of Theatre Communications Group (TCG), the [[Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]] (STAA) and National Alliance for Musical Theatre (NAMT) and the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).

==History==
Chicago Shakespeare Theater was founded as the Chicago Shakespeare Workshop by current Artistic Director Barbara Gaines in 1986, a name which was changed a year later to the Chicago Shakespeare Repertory and finally in 1999 to Chicago Shakespeare Theater.  It performed its first twelve seasons in residency at the Ruth Page Theater, where it performed titles ranging from better-known Shakespeare plays such as ''Hamlet'' and ''King Lear'' as well as lesser-known titles such as ''Troilus and Cressida'' and ''Timon of Athens''.  Although the theater was critically lauded for its innovative approach to classic works, it was limited by the age and spatial restrictions of the Ruth Page Theater and began looking for a new performance space in the late 1990s.

In 1997, CST announced its plans to move from the Ruth Page to a new facility located at [[Navy Pier]], a place better known for its family attractions and in fact the most popular tourist attraction in the [[Midwest]].  The move was accompanied by a public relations blitz, which even involved Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] naming April 23, 1997 Shakespeare Repertory Day.  The company began a large-scale capital campaign to finance the move, and opened its 1999-2000 season in its new, state-of-the-art facility.  Since then, CST has grown from the third-largest theater company in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to the third-largest in the entire [[Midwest]], at a rate 400% faster than the industry growth trend.

==Facilities==
Chicago Shakespeare Theater has, since October 1999, been in residence in a new, seven-story, {{convert|75000|m2|sqft|sing=on}} facility on Chicago's [[Navy Pier]], which houses its box office, administrative offices, and performance venues. The first performance at this facility was [[Eric Idle]] reading from his [[novel]], ''[[The Road to Mars]]''.

The 510-seat Courtyard Theater, which is the primary production venue for CST, features state-of-the-art technology and acoustics together with a versatile thrust stage and deep proscenium, that create a flexible performance space. A second theater, the 200-seat black box "Upstairs" space, is devoted to smaller but still-popular productions such as [[The Second City]]'s smash hit, ''Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People Vs. Friar Laurence, The Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet''.

==Educational outreach==
Chicago Shakespeare Theater's "Team Shakespeare" program is the largest arts-in-education program in the state of Illinois.  The program reaches 40,000 students annually through student matinée performances of its full-length production, an abridged Shakespeare production that each year is staged both at its home on Navy Pier and on tour to schools across the region, and discussions. Its extensive work with approximately 1,000 educators annually includes free teacher workshops and web-based resources.

==Awards ==
* 2016 production of ''The Tempest'' received the 2016 [[Jeff Award|Joseph Jefferson Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/news/ct-2016-equity-jeff-awards-winners-20161014-story.html|title='Dreamgirls' and 'Tempest' win at 2016 Equity Jeff Awards|first=Chris|last=Jones|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child recruits who survive armed conflict frequently suffer psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioural problems such as heightened aggression, leading to a high risk of poverty and unemployment in adulthood.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Research in the UK and US has also found that the enlistment of adolescent children, even when they are not sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/694167/20180327_Suicide_and_open_verdict_deaths_in_the_UK_Regular_Armed_Forces_1984-2017_Tables_and_Figures-O.xls|title=UK armed forces suicide and open verdict deaths: 1984-2017|last=UK, Ministry of Defence|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress-related mental disorders,&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; alcohol misuse,&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; and violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

A number of treaties have sought to curb the participation of children in armed conflicts.

==History==
{{Main|History of children in the military}}
History is filled with children who have been trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as [[human shield]]s or for political advantage in [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Children at war"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2009/01/13/ugandagirlsoldier809/|title=Girl Soldiers – The cost of survival in Northern Uganda, Women News Network – WNN|date=13 January 2009|publisher=Womennewsnetwork.net|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, for example, Napoleon conscripted many teenagers for his armies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813–1814, pg.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcvdhyc |title=How did Britain let 250000 underage soldiers fight in WW1? |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jzxt9FFBDPwC&amp;pg=PA603 ''Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw,''] Pan Books 2004 p.603&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosen2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=David M.

==Current situation==

=== State armed forces ===
Since the adoption in 2000 of the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict]] (OPAC) the global trend has been towards restricting armed forces recruitment to adults aged 18 or over, known as the ''Straight-18'' standard.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/international-laws-and-child-rights|title=International laws and child rights|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states with armed forces have opted in to OPAC, which also prohibits states that still recruit children from using them in armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Nonetheless, Child Soldiers International reported in 2018 that children under the age of 18 were still being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries;&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/|title=Child Soldiers World Index|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these, most recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruit from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/where-are-there-child-soldiers|title=Where are child soldiers?|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2017/821&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict, 2017|last=United Nations Secretary-General|first=|date=2017|website=www.un.org|page=41|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; States that still rely on children to staff their armed forces include the world's three most populous countries (China, India, and the United States) and the most economically powerful (all G7 countries apart from Italy and Japan).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and others have called for an end to the recruitment of children by state armed forces, arguing that [[Recruit training|military training]], the military environment, and a binding contract of service are not compatible with children's rights and jeopardise healthy development during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/GC/20&amp;Lang=en|title=General comment No. 20 (2016) on the implementation of the rights of the child during adolescence|last=Committee on the Rights of the Child|first=|date=2016|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://downloads.unicef.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UnicefChildSoldiersbriefing_UKweb.pdf?_ga=2.190210859.1420289747.1516916352-952164330.1516916352|title=Ending the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/children-not-soldiers/|title=Children, Not Soldiers {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict|website=childrenandarmedconflict.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-state armed groups ===
These include [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed]] [[Paramilitary|paramilitary organisations]],  using children such as [[militia]]s, [[insurgent]]s, [[terrorist organization]]s, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla movements]], ideologically or religiously-driven groups, armed [[liberation movement]]s, and other types of quasi-military organisation. In 2017 the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, [[Child soldiers in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, [[Child soldiers in Somalia|Somalia]], South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Not all armed groups use children and approximately 60 have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, by 2017, the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the Philippines had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/philippines/media_27217.html|title=UN Officials congratulate MILF for completion of disengagement of children from its ranks|last=UNICEF|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC-EP]] guerrilla movement in Colombia agreed to stop recruiting children.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Other countries have seen the reverse trend, particularly Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where [[Islamism|Islamist]] militants and groups opposing them have intensified their recruitment, training, and use of children.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2017/821&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict, 2017|last=United Nations Secretary-General|first=|date=2017|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global estimate ===
In 2003 [[P. W. Singer]] of the [[Brookings Institution]] estimated that child soldiers participate in about three-quarters of ongoing conflicts.&lt;ref name="saddam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2003/0114iraq_singer.aspx|title=Facing Saddam's Child Soldiers|author=[[P. W. Singer]]|date=14 January 2003|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212100221/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2003/0114iraq_singer.aspx|archivedate=12 February 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=3 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UNOCHA) estimated that most of these children were aged over 15, although some were younger.&lt;ref name="irin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/66280/africa-too-small-to-be-fighting-in-anyone-s-war|title=AFRICA: Too small to be fighting in anyone's war|last=|first=|date=December 2003|website=|publisher=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325052712/http://www.irinnews.org/Report/66280/AFRICA-Too-small-to-be-fighting-in-anyone-s-war|archive-date=2013-03-25|dead-url=yes|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, due to the widespread military use of children in areas where armed conflict and insecurity prevent access by UN officials and other third parties, it is difficult to estimate how many children are affected.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/FAQs/how-many-children-are-used-for-military-purposes-worldwide|title=How many children are used for military purposes worldwide?|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Child Soldiers International estimated that several tens of thousands of children, possibly more than 100,000, were in state- and non-state military organisations around the world,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and in 2018 the organisation reported that children were being used to participate in at least 18 armed conflicts.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;

==Rationale for the use of children==

Despite children's physical and psychological underdevelopment relative to adults, there are many reasons why state- and non-state military organisations seek them out. Cited examples include:
* Peter Singer has suggested that the global proliferation of light automatic weapons, which children can easily handle, has made the use of children as direct combatants more viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children at War|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|date=2005|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roméo Dallaire]] has pointed to the role of overpopulation in making children a cheap and accessible resource for military organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dallaire|first1=Roméo|title=They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: The Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers|date=2011|publisher=Walker and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Roger Rosenblatt has suggested that children are more willing than adults to fight for non-monetary incentives such as honour, prestige, revenge and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenblatt|first1=Roger|title=Children of War|journal=American Educator 8|date=1984|volume=1|pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several commentators, including Bernd Beber, Christopher Blattman, Dave Grossman, Michael Wessels, and McGurk and colleagues, have argued that since children are more obedient and malleable than adults, they are easier to control, deceive and indoctrinate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beber, Blattman|first1=Bernd, Christopher|title=The Logic of Child Soldiering and Coercion|journal=International Organization|date=2013|volume=67|issue=1|pages=65–104|doi=10.1017/s0020818312000409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wessells" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;
* David Gee and Rachel Taylor have found that in the UK, the army finds it easier to attract child recruits starting from age 16 than adults from age 18.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gee|first=David|last2=Taylor|first2=Rachel|date=2016-11-01|title=Is it Counterproductive to Enlist Minors into the Army?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03071847.2016.1265837|journal=The RUSI Journal|volume=161|issue=6|pages=36–48|doi=10.1080/03071847.2016.1265837|issn=0307-1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some leaders of armed groups have claimed that children, despite their underdevelopment, bring their own qualities as combatants to a fighting unit, often being remarkably fearless, agile and hardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beber|first=Bernd|last2=Blattman|first2=Christopher|date=2013|title=The Logic of Child Soldiering and Coercion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/logic-of-child-soldiering-and-coercion/EB8CC2FE13CC49C2846EEDE4FFD432FE|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=65–104|doi=10.1017/s0020818312000409|issn=0020-8183|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While some children are forcibly recruited, deceived, or bribed into joining military organisations, others join of their own volition.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53830868|title=Young soldiers : why they choose to fight|last=Brett|first=R|last2=Specht|first2=I|date=|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|others=|year=2004|isbn=9781588262615|location=Boulder, Colo.|pages=|oclc=53830868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/des-milliers-de-vies-rparer|title=Des Milliers de vies à réparer|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2016|website=|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wessells" /&gt; There are many reasons for this. In a 2004 study of children in military organisations around the world, Rachel Brett and Irma Specht pointed to a complex of factors that incentivise enlisting, particularly:
* Background poverty including a lack of civilian education or employment opportunities
* The cultural normalisation of war
* Seeking new friends
* Revenge (for example, after seeing friends and relatives killed)
* Expectations that a "warrior" role provides a [[rite of passage]] to maturity&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The following testimony from a child recruited by the Cambodian armed forces in the 1990s is typical of many children's motivations for joining up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I joined because my parents lacked food and I had no school... I was worried about mines but what can we do—it's an order [to go to the [[front line]]]. Once somebody stepped on a mine in front of me—he was wounded and died... I was with the radio at the time, about 60 metres away. I was sitting in my hammock and saw him die... I see young children in every unit... I'm sure I'll be a soldier for at least a couple of more years. If I stop being a soldier I won't have a job to do because I don't have any skills. I don't know what I'll do...&lt;ref name=":410"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Global Report on Child Soldiers|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=child-soldiers.org|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Impact on children ==

{{Further|Impact of war on children}}{{See also|Recruit training}}

The scale of the impact on children was first acknowledged by the international community in a major report commissioned by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], ''Impact of Armed Conflict on Children'' (1996), which was produced by the human rights expert [[Graça Machel]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children, presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and [[Mental disorder|psychiatrically injured]] around the world every year.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Since the ''Machel Report'' further research has shown that child recruits who survive armed conflict face a markedly elevated risk of debilitating psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioural problems.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/328940882/Child-Soldiering-Impact-on-Childhood-Development-and-Learning-Capacity|title=Child soldiering: Impact on childhood development and learning capacity|last=Boothby, N et al.|first=|date=2010|website=|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in Palestine and Uganda, for example, has found that more than half of former child soldiers showed symptoms of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] and nearly nine in ten in Uganda screened positive for [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Researchers in Palestine also found that children exposed to high levels of violence in armed conflict were substantially more likely than other children to exhibit [[aggression]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The combined impact of these effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Further harm is caused when child recruits are detained by armed forces and groups, according to [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name=":50"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/28/children-detained-war-zones|title=Children Detained in War Zones|date=2016-07-28|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often detained without sufficient food, medical care, or under other inhumane conditions, and some experience physical and sexual torture.&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt; Some are captured with their families, or detained due to the activity of one of their family members.

Other research has found that the enlistment of children, including older children, has a detrimental impact even when they are not used in armed conflict until they reach adulthood. Military academics in the US have characterised military training (at all ages) as "intense indoctrination" in conditions of sustained stress, the primary purpose of which is to establish the unconditional and immediate obedience of recruits.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The academic literature has found that adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to a high-stress environment, such as that of [[Recruit training|initial military training]], particularly those from a background of childhood adversity.&lt;ref name=":47"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/armed-forces-and-veterans-mental-health/written/79963.html|title=House of Commons Defence Committee Inquiry into Armed Forces and Veterans Mental Health: Written Evidence Submitted by Medact|last=Medact|first=|date=2018|website=|access-date=2018-03-24}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlistment, even before recruits are sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide in the US,&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ursano|first=Robert J.|last2=Kessler|first2=Ronald C.|last3=Stein|first3=Murray B.|last4=Naifeh|first4=James A.|last5=Aliaga|first5=Pablo A.|last6=Fullerton|first6=Carol S.|last7=Wynn|first7=Gary H.|last8=Vegella|first8=Patti L.|last9=Ng|first9=Tsz Hin Hinz|date=2016-07-01|title=Risk Factors, Methods, and Timing of Suicide Attempts Among US Army Soldiers|url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0600|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|language=en|volume=73|issue=7|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0600|issn=2168-622X|page=741}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher risk of mental disorders in the US and the UK,&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=L.|last2=Wessely|first2=S.|last3=Hotopf|first3=M.|last4=Jones|first4=M.|last5=Greenberg|first5=N.|last6=Rona|first6=R.

==International law==

=== Recruitment and use of children ===

==== Definition of child ====
{{Main|Convention on the Rights of the Child|Free Children from War conference}}

The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] defines a child as any person under the age of 18. The [[Free Children from War conference|Paris Principles]] define a child associated with an armed force or group as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the United Nations General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/ParisPrinciples310107English.pdf|title=Paris Principles: Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Children aged under 15 ====
{{Main|Convention on the Rights of the Child|Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court}}

The Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (1977, Art. 77.2),&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc_002_0321.pdf|title=Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|first=|date=1977|website=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (2002) all forbid state armed forces and non-state armed groups from using children under the age of 15 directly in armed conflict (technically "hostilities"). This is now recognised as a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (A/CONF.183/9)|last=|first=|date=1998|website=|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Children aged under 18 ====
{{Main|Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict}}{{Further|Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child}}
Most states with armed forces are also bound by the higher standards of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) (2000) and the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (1999), which forbid the compulsory recruitment of those under the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11300:0::NO::P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327|title=Ratifications of C182 – Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)|last=International Labour Organization|first=|date=|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPAC also requires governments that still recruit children (from age 16) to "take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities". In addition, OPAC forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting children under any circumstances, although the legal force of this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genevacall.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2013/12/Engaging-Nonstate-Armed-Groups-on-the-Protection-of-Children-Towards-Strategic-Complementarity-International-Peace-Institute..pdf|title=Engaging nonstate armed groups on the protection of children: Towards strategic complementarity|last=Geneva Call|first=|date=2012|website=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The highest standard in the world is set by the [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]],&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/child/|title=African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child|last=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|first=|date=2018|website=www.achpr.org|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. Most African states have ratified the Charter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Limitations and loopholes ====
States that are not a party to OPAC are subject to the lower standards set by Protocol I of the [[Third Geneva Convention|Geneva Conventions]], which allows armed forces to use children over the age of fifteen in hostilities, and possibly to use younger children who have volunteered as spotters, observers, and message-carriers:&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750099?OpenDocument ICRC Commentary on Protocol I: Article 77] website of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] ¶ 3183–3191 also ¶ [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750098?OpenDocument 3171]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces. In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavor to give priority to those who are oldest.}}

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] had proposed that the Parties to the conflict should "take all ''necessary'' measures", which became in the final text, "take all ''feasible'' measures", which is not a total prohibition because feasible is understood as meaning "capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, possible or practicable".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; During the negotiations over the clause "take a part in hostilities" the word "direct" was added to it, opening up the possibility that child volunteers could be involved indirectly in hostilities, such as by gathering and transmitting military information, helping in the transportation of arms and munitions, provision of supplies, etc.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

However, Article 4.3.c of [[Protocol II]], additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977, states "children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolII.aspx|title=Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949|last=|first=|date=1977|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104133522/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolII.aspx|archive-date=2013-11-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standards for the release and reintegration of children ===
{{main|Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers}}

OPAC requires governments to demobilise children within their jurisdiction who have been recruited or used in hostilities and to provide assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration.&lt;ref name="OptProto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30203.html|title=UNICEF: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|date=30 November 2005|work=UNICEF|accessdate=2 October 2014}} {{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|date=2014|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|volume=5|issue=1–2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=|doi=10.1163/18781527-00501008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under war, civil unrest, armed conflict and other emergency situations, children and youths are also offered protection under the United Nations ''[[Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict]]''. To accommodate the proper disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations started the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61724289|title=Child soldiers, adult interests : the global dimensions of the Sierra Leonean tragedy|last=John-Peter.|first=Pham,|date=2005|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=9781594546716|location=New York|oclc=61724289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes===
{{Further|War crime}}
Opinion is currently divided over whether children should be prosecuted for war crimes.&lt;ref name="McCollough-2008-03-10"&gt;Lauren McCollough, [http://www.crimesofwar.org/onnews/News-Khadr.html The Military Trial of Omar Khadr: Child Soldiers and the Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512083222/http://www.crimesofwar.org/onnews/News-Khadr.html |date=12 May 2008 }}, [http://www.crimesofwar.org/about/about.html Crimes of War Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222121657/http://www.crimesofwar.org/about/about.html |date=22 December 2008 }} 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; International law does not prohibit the prosecution of children who commit war crimes, but Article 37 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|Convention on the Rights of the Child]] limits the punishment that a child can receive: "Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age."&lt;ref name="McCollough-2008-03-10" /&gt;

==== Example: Sierra Leone ====
{{Main|Special Court for Sierra Leone}}
In the wake of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the UN mandated the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of [[International humanitarian law|humanitarian law]], including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators:

{{quote|... [those] who are accused of crimes under international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily as victims of offenses against international law; not only as perpetrators. They must be treated by international law in a framework of restorative justice and social rehabilitation, consistent with international law which offers children special protection through numerous agreements and principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/Paris_Conference_Principles_English_31_January.pdf The Paris Principles and Guidelines on Children associated with armed forces or armed groups],
February 2007. Section "Treatment of children accused of crimes under international law", p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

This principle was reflected in the Court's statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. [[David Crane (lawyer)|David Crane]], the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.&lt;ref name="McCollough-2008-03-10" /&gt;

==== Example: Omar Khadr ====
{{Main|Omar Khadr}}
In the USA, prosecutors charged [[Omar Khadr]], a Canadian, for offences they allege he committed in Afghanistan while under the age of 16 and fighting for the [[Taliban]] against [[United States forces|US forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE67847020100809|title=Omar Khadr's Confession Can Be Used at Guantanamo Trial|author=Jane Sutton|date=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crimes carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under US law.&lt;ref name="McCollough-2008-03-10" /&gt; In 2010, while under torture and duress, Khadr pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for [[terrorism]], and spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2010/10/26/10/stip.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf |title=USvKhadr Stipulation of Fact|date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/10/25/khadr.plea/|title=Youngest Guantanamo detainee pleads guilty |last=Meserve|first=Jeanne |author2=CNN Wire Staff|date=25 October 2010|work=CNN|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plea was offered as part of a [[plea bargain]], which would see Khadr deported to [[Canada]] after one year of imprisonment to serve seven further years there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/10/25/omar-khadr-trial-resumes.html | work=CBC News | title=Khadr to return to Canada: lawyer | date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omar Khadr remained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] and the Canadian government faced international criticism for delaying his repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/20/khadr-canada-us.html |title=Toews' request delays Khadr's transfer to Canada |date=20 July 2012 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khadr was eventually transferred to the Canadian prison system in September 2012 and was freed on bail by a judge in [[Alberta]] in May 2015.

Children's rights advocates were left frustrated after the final text of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) did not prohibit the military recruitment of all children under the age of 18, and they began to call for a new treaty to achieve this goal.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/837635842|title=Campaigning for justice: Human rights advocacy in practice|last=Becker|first=J|date=|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780804774512|location=Stanford, California|pages=11–31|chapter=Campaigning to stop the use of child soldiers|oclc=837635842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/88/120B_-_Optional_Protocol_to_the_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child_Brett__Rachel__2005.pdf|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OP/CAC)|last=Brett|first=R|date=2005|website=International Council on Human Rights Policy &amp; International Commission of Jurists|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence the newly formed Committee on the Rights of the Child made two recommendations: first, to request a major UN study into the impact of armed conflict on children; and second, to establish a working group of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Commission on Human Rights]] to negotiate a supplementary protocol to the Convention.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Both proposals were accepted.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Responding to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN General Assembly acknowledged "the grievous deterioration in the situation of children in many parts of the world as a result of armed conflicts" and commissioned the [[human rights]] expert Graça Machel to conduct a major fact-finding study.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/mandate/special-representative-of-the-secretary-general-for-children-and-armed-conflict/|title=Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict|last=Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict|first=|date=2018|website=childrenandarmedconflict.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Machel Report, ''Impact of armed conflict on children,'' was published in 1996.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The report noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly one of the most urgent priorities is to remove everyone under 18 years of age from armed forces.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=Impact of armed conflict on children|last=Machel|first=G|date=1996|website=|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Human rights commission|UN Commission on Human Rights]] established a working group to negotiate a treaty to raise standards with regard to the use of children for military purposes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; After complex negotiations and a global campaign, the new treaty was agreed in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The treaty prohibits the direct participation of children in armed conflict, but not their recruitment by state armed forces from age 16.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|last=|first=|date=2000|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502015246/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict ===
The Machel Report led to a new mandate for a [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict]] (SRSG-CAAC).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General's annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/16/confidential-u-n-report-accuses-saudi-coalition-of-killing-hundreds-of-children-in-yemen-conflict/|title=Confidential U.N.

=== Security Council ===
The [[United Nations Security Council]] convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] under the heading "Children in armed conflict". The first resolution on the issue, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1261|Resolution 1261]], was passed in 1999.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES12611999"&gt;{{UN document|docid=S-RES-1261(1999)|type=Resolution|body=Security Council|year=1999|resolution_number=1261|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1539|Resolution 1539]] was passed unanimously, condemning the use of child soldiers and mandating the UN Secretary-General to establish a means of tracking and reporting on the practice, known as the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/ACOS-64DFZ7?OpenDocument|title=Security Council condemns recruitment of child soldiers, asks Secretary-General to devise monitoring mechanism|date=22 April 2004|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_57997.html|title=Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) on grave violations of children's rights in situations of armed conflict|work=UNICEF|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Secretary-General ===
The Secretary-General publishes an annual report on children and armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/virtual-library/|title=Library of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict|last=Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict|first=|date=2018|website=childrenandarmedconflict.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 report identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups during 2016 (Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and six countries where state armed forces were using children in hostilities (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2011 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon raised the issue of children in conflict areas who are involved in violent activities according to the ''[https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/28/extreme-measures/abuses-against-children-detained-national-security-threats Extreme Measures]'' report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/28/extreme-measures/abuses-against-children-detained-national-security-threats|title=Extreme Measures {{!}} Abuses against Children Detained as National Security Threats|date=2016-07-28|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{main|Child soldiers in Africa}}

In 2003, the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] estimated that up to half of children involved with state armed forces and non-state armed groups worldwide were in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="irin" /&gt; In 2004, Child Soldiers International estimated that 100,000 children were being used in state and non-state armed forces on the continent;&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 an estimate put the total at 120,000 children, or 40 percent of the global total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rakisits|first=Claude|date=2008-12-01|title=Child Soldiers in the East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|url=https://academic.oup.com/rsq/article/27/4/108/1541878|journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=108–122|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdn054|issn=1020-4067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990), which has been ratified by most African states, prohibits all military recruitment of children aged under 18. Nonetheless, according to the UN, in 2016 children were being used by armed groups in seven African countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan) and by state armed forces in three (Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

International efforts to reduce the number of children in military organisations in Africa began with the Cape Town Principles and Best Practices, developed in 1997.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/Cape_Town_Principles(1).pdf|title=Cape Town Principles and Best Practices|date=April 1997|publisher=UNICEF|pages=8|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principles proposed that African governments commit to OPAC, which was being negotiated at the time, and raise the minimum age for military recruitment from 15 to 18.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The Principles also defined a child soldier to include any person under the age of 18 who is "part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or group in any capacity... including girls recruited for sexual purposes..."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

In 2007, the [[Free Children from War conference|Free Children from War Conference]] in Paris produced the Paris Principles, which refined and updated the Cape Town Principles, applied them globally, and outlined a practical approach to reintegrating current child soldiers.&lt;ref name="UNICEF12"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_38208.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], UNICEF press release&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central African Republic====
{{Main|Child soldiers in the Central African Republic}}

The use of children by armed groups in the Central African Republic has historically been common.&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1" /&gt; Between 2012 and 2015 as many as 10,000 children were used by armed groups in the nationwide armed conflict and {{as of|lc=yes|2016}} children were still being used.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_85654.html|title=Central African Republic: Children brutally targeted in weekend violence|last=UNICEF|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The mainly Muslim ''Séléka'' coalition of armed groups and the predominantly Christian ''[[Anti-balaka|Anti-Balaka]]'' militias have both used children in this way; some are as young as eight.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/des-milliers-de-vies-rparer|title=Des Milliers de vies à réparer|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2016|website=Child Soldiers International|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 at the ''Forum de Bangui'' (a meeting of government, parliament, armed groups, civil society and religious leaders), a number of armed groups agreed to demobilise thousands of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_81771.html|title=Armed groups in Central African Republic agree to release thousands of children|last=UNICEF|first=|date=2015-05-05|work=UNICEF|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a measure of stability returned to the Central African Republic and, according to the United Nations, 2,691 boys and 1,206 girls were officially separated from armed groups.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Despite this, the recruitment and use of children for military purposes increased by approximately 50 percent over that year, mostly attributed to the [[Lord's Resistance Army]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

[[File:DRC- Child Soldiers.jpg|thumb|250px|A group of demobilised child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
{{main|Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

Thousands of children serve in the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as in various rebel militias. It has been estimated that at the height of the Second Congo War more than 30,000 children were fighting with various parties to the conflict. It was claimed in the film ''[[Kony 2012]]'' that the Lord's Resistance Army recruited this number.&lt;ref name="guardian kony 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/16/kony-2012-child-soldiers-spotlight | title=Kony 2012 puts child soldiers back under the spotlight | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=16 March 2012 | accessdate=16 March 2012 | author=Smith, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the DRC has one of the highest proportions of child soldiers in the world. The international court has passed judgment on these practices during the war. [[Thomas Lubanga Dyilo]], one of the warlords in the DRC, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison because of his role in the recruitment of child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. Lubanga directed the [[Union of Congolese Patriots]] and its armed wing [[Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]]. The children were forced to fight in the armed conflict in Ituri.&lt;ref name="The Prosecutor v.

====Somalia====
A report published by the Child Soldiers International in 2004 estimated that 200,000 children had been recruited into the country's militias against their will since 1991.&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1" /&gt; In 2017 UN Secretary-General [[António Guterres]] commented on a UN report which estimated that over 50 percent of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]'s membership in the country was under the age of 18, with some as young as nine being sent to fight.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; The report verified that 6,163 children had been recruited in Somalia between 1 April 2010 and 31 July 2016, of which 230 were girls. Al-Shabaab accounted for seventy percent of this recruitment, and the [[Somali National Army]] was also recruiting children.&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/guterres-thousands-child-soldiers-fight-somalia-170120063747893.html|title=Guterres: Thousands of child soldiers fight in Somalia|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childsoldiers.org/preventing-the-use-of-child-soldiers-in-somalia/|title=Preventing the Use of Child Soldiers in Somalia – Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative|date=2017-01-30|work=Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudan====
[[File:SPLA Child Soldier.jpg|thumb|left|A child soldier of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (2007).]]In 2004 approximately 17,000 children were being used by the state armed forces and non-state armed groups.&lt;ref name=":51"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825978109|title=The social problems of children in Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Hollingsworth|first=J|date=|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781443845137|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=68|oclc=825978109}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 5,000 children were part of the main armed opposite group at the time, the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA).&lt;ref name=":51" /&gt; Some former child soldiers were sentenced to death for crimes committed while they were soldiers.&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1" /&gt;

In 2006, children were also recruited from refugee camps in Chad, and thousands were used in the conflict in Darfur.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Shop/global-report-2008-1|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008: Sudan|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2008|website=Child Soldiers International|pages=315–320|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the government ratified the OPAC treaty and by 2008 the military use of children had reduced in the country, but both state armed forces and the SPLA continued to recruit and use them.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; The use of children has continued to diminish, but in 2017 the UN was still receiving reports of children as young as 12 in government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SD|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Sudan|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the government of Bolivia acknowledged that children as young as 14 may have been forcibly conscripted into the armed forces during recruitment sweeps.&lt;ref name="globalmarch.org"&gt;[http://www.globalmarch.org/resourcecentre/world/bolivia.pdf Global March Against Child Labour: Bolivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182849/http://www.globalmarch.org/resourcecentre/world/bolivia.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} 2001&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of the Bolivian army was believed to be under the age of 18, with half of those below the age of 16.&lt;ref name="globalmarch.org" /&gt; {{As of|2018}}, Bolivia invites children to begin their adult conscription early, from age 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/BO|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Bolivia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colombia====
In the [[Colombian armed conflict]], from the mid-1960s to present, one fourth of non-state combatants have been and still are under 18 years old. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth in the world for the greatest use of child soldiers. There are currently 11,000–14,000 children in armed groups in the country. In negotiations with the government, armed groups have offered to stop the recruitment of minors as a bargaining chip, but they have not honoured these offers.&lt;ref name=":49"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|date=September 2003|title="You'll learn not to cry": Child Combatants in Colombia|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/colombia0903/colombia0903.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Overcoming Lost Childhood: Lessons from the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Former Child Soldiers in Colombia|last=Thomas|first=Virginia|publisher=Y Care International|year=2008|isbn=|location=London, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørkhaug argues that most child soldiers were recruited through some combination of voluntary participation and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjørkhaug|first=Ingunn|date=2010-06-28|title=Child Soldiers in Colombia: The Recruitment of Children into Non-State Violent Armed Groups|ssrn=1650250|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a Human Rights Watch press release indicated that 30 percent of some guerrilla units were made up of children and up to 85 percent of some of the militias, which are considered to serve as a "training ground for future guerrilla fighters", had child soldiers&lt;ref name="HRW1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/1998/10/07/child-soldiers-used-all-sides-colombias-armed-conflict|title=Child Soldiers Used by All Sides in Colombia's Armed Conflict|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same press release it was estimated that some of the government-linked paramilitary units consisted of up to 50 percent children, including some as young as 8 years old.&lt;ref name="aft"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/issues/winter05-06/singer.htm|title=Child Soldiers|author=[[P.

In 2005 an estimated 11,000 children were involved with left- or right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia. "Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the [[FARC]] or [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]]. The remainder fight in paramilitary ranks, predominately the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/02/22/colomb10202.htm|title=Colombia: Armed Groups Send Children to War|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=22 February 2005|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to P. W. Singer the FARC attack on the Guatape hydroelectric facility in 1998 involved militants as young as eight years old and a 2001 FARC training video depicted boys as young as 11 working with missiles. The group has also taken in children from Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador.&lt;ref name="aft" /&gt;

The Colombian government's security forces do not officially recruit children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/CO|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Colombia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the legal age for both compulsory and voluntary recruitment has been set at 18. However, students were allowed to enroll as cadets in military secondary schools and 16- or 17-year-olds could enter air force or national army training programs, respectively. In addition, captured enemy child combatants were employed by the Colombian military for intelligence gathering purposes in potential violation of legal prohibitions.&lt;ref name="Colombia2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/486cb0f4c.html|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 – Colombia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2008|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923142748/http://www.refworld.org/docid/486cb0f4c.html|archive-date=2013-09-23|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demobilisation efforts targeted toward the FARC in 2016–2017 have provided hope that the conflict will come to an end, limiting the number of children involved in violence.

In negotiations on the OPAC treaty during the 1990s the US joined the UK in strongly opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18, and as a consequence the treaty specified a minimum age of 16.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The US ratified the treaty in 2002 (but as of 2018 has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/Countries.aspx?CountryCode=USA&amp;Lang=EN|title=Reporting status for United States of America|last=UN, Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights|first=|date=2018|website=|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per OPAC, US military personnel are normally prohibited from direct participation in hostilities until the age of 18, but they are eligible for 'forward deployment', which means that may be posted to a combat zone to perform support tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/OPAC/USA/Q/2/ADD.1&amp;Lang=en|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict: List of issues concerning additional and updated information related to the consideration of the second periodic report of the United States of America (CRC/C/OPAC/USA/2): Addendum|last=Committee on the Rights of the Child|first=|date=2012|website=|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on the US to change this policy and ensure that no minor can be deployed to a forward operating area in a combat zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2fC%2fOPAC%2fUSA%2fCO%2f3-4&amp;Lang=en|title=Concluding observations on the combined third and fourth reports submitted by the United States of America under article 8 (1) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict|last=Committee on the Rights of the Child|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004 approximately 60 underage personnel were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq in error.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; The Department of Defense subsequently stated that "the situations were immediately rectified and action taken to prevent recurrence."&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense, Information Paper regarding the application of child soldiers protocols, provided to Senator Barbara Boxer, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 President [[George W.

It also prohibits arms sales to countries where children are used for military purposes. The law's definition of child soldiers includes "any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces." In 2014 President [[Barack Obama]] announced he was waiving the Child Soldiers Protection Act ban on aid and arms sales to nations that use child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/obama-waives-ban-on-aiding-regimes-that-use-child-soldiers/article/2536609|title=Obama waives ban on aiding regimes that use child soldiers|work=Washington Examiner|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel and Palestine====
{{Main|Child suicide bombers in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}

Jihad Shomaly, in a report entitled ''Use of Children in the Occupied Palestinian Territories'', published in 2004 for the Defence for Children International/Palestine Section, concludes the report by stating that a handful of children perceive martyrdom a way to strike a blow against those they hold responsible for their hopeless situation, and that they have been recruited by Palestinian paramilitary groups to carry out armed attacks. However, Shomaly goes on to state that there is no systematic recruitment and that senior representatives of the groups and of the Palestinian community are against the recruitment of children as a political strategy. Shomaly gave the opinion that the political leadership of the Palestinians could do more to discourage the use of children by paramilitaries by requesting that the leadership of the paramilitaries sign a memorandum forbidding the training and recruitment of children. Hamas, the Palestinian organisation governing the Gaza strip, has been known to indoctrinate child soldiers with controversial ideologies, such as inciting violence against Israeli occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.essex.ac.uk/armedcon/story_id/000205.pdf|title=Use of Children in the Occupied Palestinian Territories|last=Shomaly|first=Jihad|date=2004|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William O'Brien, a professor of Georgetown University, wrote about the active participation of Palestinian children in the [[First Intifada]]: "It appears that a substantial number, if not the majority, of troops of the intifada are young people, including elementary schoolchildren. They are engaged in throwing stones and molotov cocktails and other forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;Law and Morality in Israel's War With the PLO, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Arab journalist Huda Al-Hussein wrote in a London Arab newspaper on 27{{nbsp}}October 2000:

{{quote|While UN organizations save child-soldiers, especially in Africa, from the control of militia leaders who hurl them into the furnace of gang-fighting, some Palestinian leaders... consciously issue orders for the purpose of ending their childhood, even if it means their last breath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP14700 Arab Journalist Decries Palestinian Child-Soldiers] translated by [[MEMRI]].

In 2002 the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) said that, "while there are reports of children participating in hostilities, there is no evidence of systematic recruitment by armed groups".&lt;ref&gt;Jihad Shomaly, ''et al.''

On 23 May 2005 [[Amnesty International]] reiterated its calls to Palestinian armed groups to put an immediate end to the use of children in armed activities: "Palestinian armed groups must not use children under any circumstances to carry out armed attacks or to transport weapons or other material."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE150332005 Israel/Occupied Territories: Palestinian armed groups must not use children] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711013612/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE150332005|date=11 July 2007}} 23 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kurdistan====

In 2001 it was claimed that the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) had systemically recruited children. The organisation had referred to one report, in which it was claimed that the PKK had formed a [[battalion]] especially for this purpose, called ''Tabura Zaroken Sehit Agit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/498805c428.html|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2001 – Turkey|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2001|work=Refworld|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029165401/http://www.refworld.org/docid/498805c428.html|archive-date=2014-10-29|dead-url=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK) had recruited children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/498805f0c.html#_ftn954|title=Refworld {{!}} Child Soldiers Global Report 2001 – Iraq|last1=Refugees|first1=United Nations High Commissioner for|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Syrian Civil War multiple media outlets including [[Human Rights Watch]] have found evidence that the PKK-aligned Rojava has been recruiting and deploying child soldiers. Despite a claim by the group that it would stop using children, as this is a violation of international law, there is no evidence that it has done so.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170628-us-report-ypg-recruiting-child-soldiers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2017/06/28/US-YPG-still-recruits-child-soldiers-in-Syria.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/kurdish-ypg-militia-recruiting-child-soldiers-syria-hrw-930608836&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon====
Many different sides in the Lebanese Civil War used child soldiers. A May 2008 Child Soldiers International report stated that [[Hezbollah]] trains children for military services.&lt;ref name=Iran2008/&gt; In 2017, the UN reported that armed groups, suspected to be Islamist militants, were recruiting children in the country.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

====Syria====

[[File:Symbolic boy soldiers defending Damascus against terrorist attacks.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Symbolic Syrian boy soldiers, fans of the Syrian Army]]

During the ongoing Syrian Civil War children have joined groups opposed to Bashar al Assad. In 2012 the UN received allegations of rebels using child soldiers, but said they were unable to verify these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2012/03/27/syrian-rebels-accused-over-child-soldiers-un-official Syrian rebels accused over child soldiers: UN official]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 a United Nations report said that the opposition had recruited children in military and support roles. While there seemed to be no policy of doing so, the report said, there were no age verification procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/middleeast/at-least-10000-children-killed-in-syria-un-estimates.html?mcubz=0 U.N.

Kurdish forces have also been accused of using this tactic. In 2015 Human Rights Watch claimed that 59 children, 10 of them under 15 years old, were recruited by or volunteered for the YPG or YPJ since July 2014 when the Kurdish militia leaders signed a Deed of Commitment with Geneva Call.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-kurdish-forces-using-child-fighters-despite-pledge-to-demobilize/2862390.html Kurdish Militia Accused of Using Child Soldiers in Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]] stated in January 2010 that "large numbers" of teenage boys are being recruited in Yemeni tribal fighting.

====Afghanistan====
Militias recruited thousands of child soldiers during the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan civil war]] over three decades. Many are still fighting now, for the Taliban. Some of those taken from Islamic religious schools, or [[madrassas]], are used as suicide bombers and gunmen. A propaganda video of boys marching in camouflage uniform and using slogans of martyrdom was issued in 2009 by the Afghan Taliban's leadership in Pakistan, the [[Quetta Shura]]. This included a eulogy to a 14-year-old Taliban fighter who allegedly killed an American soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sengupta |first=Kim |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/appeals/indy-appeal/independent-appeal-a-child-is-reborn-1849087.html |title=Independent Appeal: A child is reborn |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burma/Myanmar====
The State Peace and Development Council has asserted that all of its soldiers volunteered and that all of those accepted are 18 or over. According to Human Rights Watch as many as 70,000 boys serve in Burma/Myanmar's national army, the [[Tatmadaw]], with children as young as 11 being forcibly recruited off the streets. Desertion, the group reported, leads to punishments of three to five years in prison or even execution. The group has also stated that about 5,000–7,000 children serve with a range of different armed ethnic opposition groups, most notably in the [[United Wa State Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2002/burma/Burma0902-01.htm#P296_16897|title='My Gun Was As Tall As Me': Summary|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|year=2002|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report in June 2009 mentioning "grave violations" against children in the country by both the rebels and the government.

According to Child Soldiers International the trend in Europe has been towards recruiting only adults from age 18;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; most states only allow adult recruitment,&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt; and as of 2016 no armed groups were known to be using children.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; {{as of|2018}} one country, the United Kingdom, was enlisting children from age 16, and five were enlisting from age 17 (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, and Netherlands).&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; Of these, the UK recruits children in the greatest numbers; in 2016, approximately a quarter of new recruits to the British army were aged under 18.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;

All European states have ratified the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; and so child recruits are not typically used in hostilities until they reach adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Children were used as combatants in the [[First Chechen War]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/country52/1996_13.htm|title=UN Commission on Human Rights – The situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (Mar 96)|publisher=.umn.edu|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement to end military use of children==
[[File:Children soldier.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|2008 poster by Rafaela Tasca and [[Carlos Latuff]]]]

The military use of children has been common throughout history; only in recent decades has the practice met with informed criticism and concerted efforts to end it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new|title=Child Soldiers Are Unfortunately Nothing New|last=Eigen|first=L D|date=2009-11-03|work=Scriptamus|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress has been slow, partly because many armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and partly because the behaviour of [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] is difficult to influence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Recent history ===

==== 1970s–1980s ====
International efforts to limit the participation of children in armed conflict began with the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2).&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; The new Protocols prohibited the military recruitment of children aged under 15, but continued to allow state armed forces and non-state armed groups to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Efforts were renewed during negotiations on the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), when Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) campaigned for the new treaty to outlaw child recruitment entirely.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Some states, whose armed forces relied on recruiting below the age of 18, resisted this, so the final treaty text of 1989 only reflected the existing legal standard: the prohibition of the direct participation of children aged under 15 in hostilities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== 1990s ====
In the 1990s NGOs established the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) to work with sympathetic governments on a campaign for a new treaty to correct the deficiencies they saw in the CRC.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; After a global campaign lasting six years, the treaty was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC). The treaty prohibits child conscription, ensures that military recruits are no younger than 16, and forbids the use of child recruits in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although most states negotiating OPAC supported a ban on recruiting children, some states, led by the US in alliance with the UK, objected to this.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; As such, the treaty does not ban the recruitment of children aged 16 or 17, although it allows states to bind themselves to a higher standard in law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== 2000s-present ====

[[File:Red Hand Day - Kinder sind keine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|[[Red Hand Day]], the International Day Against Use of Child Soldiers, is often marked by displaying red handprints.]]

After the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, a campaign for global ratification made swift progress.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As of 2018 OPAC had been ratified by 167 states.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The campaign also successfully encouraged many states not to recruit children at all. In 2001 83 states only allowed adult enlistment, by 2016 this had increased to 126, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children, often brokered by the UN or the NGO [[Geneva Call]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Child Soldiers International reports that the success of the OPAC treaty, combined with the gradual decline in child recruitment by state armed forces, has led to a reduction of children in military organisations worldwide.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; {{as of|2018}} the recruitment and use of children remains widespread. In particular, militant Islamist organisations such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and [[Boko Haram]], as well as armed groups fighting them, have used children extensively.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; In addition, the three most populous states – China, India and the United States – still allow their armed forces to enlist children aged 16 or 17, as do five of the Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, again.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Events ===
[[Red Hand Day]] (also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers) on 12{{nbsp}}February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts. The date reflects the entry into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Countering the militarisation of childhood ===
[[File:Master Sgt. Libby Lipscomb, a member of the Army Reserve Command Honor Guard, evaluates a high school honor guard.jpg|thumb|A United States Army sergeant drills high school students at Jackson High School in Georgia, US.]]

Many states which do not allow their armed forces to recruit children have continued to draw criticism for marketing military life to children through the education system, in civic spaces and in popular entertainment such as films and videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922406573|title=Spectacle Reality Resistance.|last=Gee|first=D|publisher=ForcesWatch|year=2014|isbn=9780993095504|location=London|pages=|oclc=922406573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have argued that this marketing to children is manipulative and part of a military recruitment process and should therefore be evaluated ethically as such.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vfpuk.org/2017/report-the-first-ambush/|title=The First Ambush: Effects of army training and employment|last=Veterans for Peace UK|first=|date=2017-07-03|work=Veterans For Peace UK|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle has led some groups to campaign for relations between military organisations and young people to be regulated, on the grounds of children's rights and public health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forceswatch.net/projects/details?quicktabs_3=2#quicktabs-3|title=Military Out of Schools|last=ForcesWatch|first=|date=2018|website=www.forceswatch.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the Countering the Militarization of Youth programme of [[War Resisters' International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antimili-youth.net/|title=Countering the Militarisation of Youth|last=War Resisters International|first=|date=2018|website=antimili-youth.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Stop Recruiting Kids campaign in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://srkcampaign.org/|title=Stop Recruiting Kids|last=|first=|date=2018|website=srkcampaign.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Military Out of Schools campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Similar concerns have been raised in Germany and Israel.&lt;ref name=":93"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Opinion of the Commission for Children's Concerns on the relationship between the military and young people in Germany|last=Germany, Bundestag Commission for Children's Concerns|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://new.newprofile.org/sites/default/files/infokits/english.pdf|title=The New Profile Report on Child Recruitment in Israel|last=New Profile|first=|date=2004|website=|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers==

{{Main|Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers}}{{See also|Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration}}

Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: "The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities"&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/reintegration|title=Reintegration|work=Child Soldiers International|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002"&gt;Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. "Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration" May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt; Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt;

Reintegration efforts can become challenging when the child in question has committed war crimes because in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt; These situations should be addressed immediately because if not, many children face the threat of re-enlistment.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002"/&gt;  Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programmes specific to their needs.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reconstruction Unit 2002" /&gt;

'''Cislunar Explorers''' is a pair of spacecraft that will show the viability of [[water electrolysis]] propulsion and interplanetary optical navigation to orbit the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name='Gunter CisExpl'&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/cislunar-explorers.htm Cislunar Explorers]. Dirk Krebs, ''Gunter's Space Page'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both spacecraft will launch mated together as two L-shaped 3-Unit [[CubeSat]]s, which fit together as a 6-Unit CubeSat of about 10×20×30 cm. 

The technology demonstrator spacecraft pair is being developed at [[Cornell University]] in New York, by a team of researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates.&lt;ref name='Wordpress'&gt;[https://cislunarexplorers.wordpress.com/ Cislunar Explorers - Streamlined, sustainable spacecraft]. Wordpress, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It will be one of thirteen CubeSats to be carried with the [[Exploration Mission 1|Orion EM-1 mission]] into a [[heliocentric orbit]] in [[cislunar space]] on the maiden flight of the [[Space Launch System]] scheduled to launch in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/three-diy-cubesats-score-rides-on-nasa-s-first-flight-of-orion-space-launch-system |title=Three DIY CubeSats Score Rides on NASA's First Flight of Orion, Space Launch System |publisher=NASA |first1=Gina |last1=Anderson |first2=Molly |last2=Porter |date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water powered==

The two spacecraft feature an unusual [[Electrolysis of water|water electrolysis]] propulsion system that splits the bond between hydrogen and oxygen, producing combustible gaseous mixture that can be used as engine propellant.&lt;ref name='Spotlight 2017'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/cubequest/cislunar-explorers Cube Quest Challenge Team Spotlight: Cislunar Explorers]. Jennifer Harbaugh, NASA. 22 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This propulsion system will be used to enter lunar orbit. The mission designers comment that if this water-based propulsion technology is successful, it may enable ''in-situ'' resources for refueling landers for commercial or science purposes.&lt;ref name='Spotlight 2017'/&gt; Such a spacecraft could refuel at space-bound water sources, like asteroids, instead of bringing all the needed fuel along with it from Earth.&lt;ref name='Lewin 2016'&gt;[https://www.space.com/34096-water-fueled-cubesat-lunar-challenge.html Water-Powered CubeSat Satellite Shoots for the Moon]. Sarah Lewin, ''Space.com'', 16 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/09/cornells-quest-make-first-cubesat-orbit-moon Cornell's quest: Make the first CubeSat to orbit the moon]. Tom Fleischman, ''The Cornell Chronicle''. 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical navigation==

Since the purpose of the ''Cislunar Explorers'' is to test a novel propulsion system, they will simply be injected in "any lunar orbit" and maintain it for as long as possible. ''Cislunar Explorers'' will navigate completely autonomously, with minimal control from Earth. ''Cislunar Explorers'' will each use commercial cameras that enable them to view the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. By computing the sizes of each of these objects and their locations relative to one another, the two spacecraft will deduce their locations.&lt;ref name='Lewin 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cislunarexplorers.wordpress.com/spacecraft-design/optical-navigation/ Cislunar Explorers - Optical Navigation].

'''''Cross and Sword''''' is a 1965 [[play (theatre)|play]] by American playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]]. It is [[Florida]]'s official state play, having received the designation by the [[Florida Senate]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="flher-play"&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/facts/symbols/symbol.cfm?page=2&amp;id=21 Florida State Symbols - The State Play: Cross and Sword] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607081614/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/symbols/symbol.cfm?page=2&amp;id=21 |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed during the summer in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] for more than 30 years, closing in 1996.&lt;ref name=njo082108/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocala082208/&gt;&lt;ref name="guide-rajtar"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Historic St. Augustine, Florida |last=Rajtar |first=Steve |author2=Kelly Goodman |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location= |isbn=978-1-59629-336-6 |pages=52–53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyrHSTZUw0cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA52,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
The [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] created a play in 1937 about [[Walter Raleigh]]'s [[Roanoke Colony]] entitled ''[[Lost Colony (play)|Lost Colony]]''. It was written as a "symphonic drama" blending music, dance, [[pantomime]], and poetic dialogue into a larger-than-life historical play. In 1965 Green was commissioned to write a play commemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of St. Augustine.&lt;ref name=njo082108&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/NewsJournalOnline/Entertainment/Music/entMUS01082108.htm |title=Amped at the amphitheatre |accessdate=2008-09-07 |author=de Yampert, Rick |date=2008-08-21 |publisher=Daytona Beach News-Journal Online}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was ''Cross and Sword: A Symphonic Drama of the Spanish Settlement of Florida''.&lt;ref name="green-biblio"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/paulgreen/bibliography.html Paul Green Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; The play is a musical reenactment depicting Florida's early history at St. Augustine, especially its colonization by Spaniard [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] and his settlers' bloody conflicts with French [[Huguenot]]s at [[Fort Caroline]] in present day [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].

==Professional interest==
Actor [[Richard Boone]] moved to St. Augustine from Hawaii in 1970, and worked with the production when he was not acting on television or in movies, until his death in 1981. In the last year of his life, Boone was appointed Florida's cultural ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-biography/richard-boone.1/ MSN Movies: Celebrities-Richard Boone]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, he wrote a newspaper column for the ''St. Augustine Record'' called, "It Seems To Me". He also gave acting lectures at [[Flagler College]] in 1972-1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/richard-boone/person/61528/biography.html TV-dot-Com: Biography-Richard Boone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630073811/http://www.tv.com/richard-boone/person/61528/biography.html |date=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End==

The '''Donoughmore Commission''' (DC) was responsible for the creation of the [[Donoughmore Constitution]] in effect  between 1931–47 in  [[Ceylon]] (now called Sri Lanka). In 1931 there were approximately 12%  Ceylonese [[Tamils]], 12%  Indian Tamils (migrant and immigrant workers employed in the Tea plantations established in the late 19th century), 65% [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], and ~3% Ceylon [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="jane"&gt; J. Russell, ''Communal Politics Under the Donoughmore Constitution'', Tisara Prakasakayo, Colombo 1982 &lt;/ref&gt; The British government had introduced a form of communal representation which a strong Tamil representation, out of proportion to the population of the Tamil community. The Sinhalese had been divided into up-country and low-country Sinhalese.

==Commissioners==
The commissioners were four British [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] appointed by [[Sydney Webb]], the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] the 13 November 1927. Their task was to draft a new constitution for [[Sri Lanka]] that would not only satisfy the aspirations of all the groups within the island, including British [[plantation]] owners, but also enable Sri Lanka to take its place as a partner in the socialist [[British empire]] that Webb envisioned. 

Two of the Commissioners, [[Dr. Drummond-Shiels]] and [[Frances Butler]], had been Labour Party London [[county council|County Councillors]] for many years prior to entering [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and serving in the short-lived [[Lib-Lab]] government coalition stitched together by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] in 1926. They were serious-minded men in the traditional Labour "[[Christian Socialist]]" mould. Above all, they were missionaries for the equitable, socialist vision of the world Webb was proselytising. [[Lord Donoughmore]], on the other hand, was a genial [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[peerage (disambiguation)|peer]], best known for championing [[Women's rights|women's right]] to university education and a [[gourmet]] palate.

==Consultation==
The Donoughmore Commission arrived in Sri Lanka in 1927 and spent four months interviewing islanders. They held 34 sittings and interviewed 140 people. The Commissioners listened to a plea for [[female suffrage]] for educated women, and granted suffrage to all women aged 21 in Sri Lanka – at a time when British suffragettes were still fighting to have the voting age lowered from 28.

==System developed==
Having noted that the island was riven by power struggles between competing [[ethnic group]]s, it devised a system of executive committees that would control all government departments. It rejected the principle of communal representation. Every parliamentarian in Sri Lanka would sit on one of these committees, ensuring that no one ethnic group could control all levers of power and patronage. Instead, all executive decisions would require a measure of consensus among the different ethnic representatives.  

==Reception of the Constitution==
The greatest misgiving of many of the Ceylonese leaders, both Sinhalese and Tamil, was the recommendation of [[universal franchise]] by DC. Jane Russell in her detailed study&lt;ref name="jane"&gt; J. Russell, ''Communal Politics Under the Donoughmore Constitution'', Tisara Prakasakayo, Colombo 1982 &lt;/ref&gt;  states that (p. 16) "Ponnambalam Ramnathan and most of the 'conservatives' believed and argued that the giving of the vote to the non-''vellala'' castes and to women was not only a grave mistake, leading to 'mob rule', but Ramanathan explicitly suggested that it was anathema to the Hindu way of life". The political leadership of the Ceylon Tamils was left dumbfounded ... by the complete boulversement of the policies they had pursued for the last decade(p. 18&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt; ). Further, "the Sinhalese leaders were also very dubious about the new franchise, but were willing to support it in a ''quid pro quo'' for the abolition of communal electorates"(p. 17&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt; ). 

The All-Ceylon Tamil league first opposed the DC on the grounds that the abolition of the communal (representation) principle when coupled with the universal franchise proposal would mean "death to the minorities", as the Sinhalese would now receive over 50% of the seats. Then in 1929 there was a tactical change, the Tamils opposing it as the Donougmore Constitution did not grant full self-government (p 20,&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Ceylon Daily News, 14. Aug., 1929 &lt;/ref&gt;).

The leaders of the Jaffna Youth congress, a radical group, also opposed the DC, but for reasons entirely different from those of the conservative Tamils. They were followers of [[Nehru]] and [[Gandhi]], and in 1925 called for the abolition of the caste system, cooperation with the Sinhalese, adoption of the national dress and "swabasha" in place of English. They called for a complete boycott of the Donoughmore Constitution. On 25 April 1931 the Jaffna Youth congress adopted the resolution that "this conference holds 'Swaraj' to be the inalienable birth-right of every people... Whereas the DC militates itself against the attainment of 'Swaraj', this congress further pledges itself to boycott the scheme"(p 29&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt;).  

Thus the first State Council of Ceylon opened on 7 July 1931 with much pomp and ceremony, but without any of the established and experienced Ceylon Tamil political leaders. The leaders of the Youth Congress maintained up to 1934 that the boycott was justified,&lt;ref&gt; S. H. Perampanayagam, History of the Jaffna Youth Congress &lt;/ref&gt; but later admitted that it was a grave mistake. Tamil leaders who did not take part in the boycott were Dr. Saravanamuttu (Colombo North), M. Subramanium (Trincomalee-Batticaloa), S. M. Ananthan (Mannar), Peri Sundaram (Hatton), S. P. Vytilingam (Talawakelle). [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], an ambitious catholic lawyer from Colombo who did not belong to the elit group of the earlier Tamil leaders, also rejected the boycott. He eventually took control of the leadership of the Tamils. The Indian Tamils (Tea plantation workers who were annual immigrants or immigrants since the late 19th century) were not granted the franchise by the first State Council.

The majority [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] MPs also worked hard to replace the DC by a cabinet model. They finally managed to get rid of it in 1947 when the [[Soulbury Commission|Soulbury constitution]] came into being with independence in 1948.

Sri Lanka remained virtually independent under the Donoughmore constitution, with full control over domestic affairs, using the mechanism of universal suffrage to elect a national government at a time when only white countries in the European empires had that privilege, and continue its passage to relative prosperity without any major ethnic clashes for 16 years. Under the island's several subsequent constitutions, Sri Lanka has suffered communal violence.

==Donoughmore Commission in Fiction==

[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|500px|right|Federal Funds Rate compared to [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury]] interest rates]]

The [[United States]] entered recession in January 1980 and returned to growth six months later in July 1980.&lt;ref name="NBER"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=8 April 2011|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html|title=United States Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher= [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although recovery took hold, the [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] remained unchanged through the start of a second recession in July 1981.&lt;ref name="Bednarzik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bednarzik |first1=Robert W. |last2=Hewson |first2=Marillyn A. |last3=Urquhart |first3=Michael A.|year=1982 |title=The Employment Situation in 1981: New Recession Takes its Toll |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=3–14 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1982/03/art1full.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The downturn ended 16 months later, in November 1982.&lt;ref name=NBER/&gt; The economy entered a strong recovery and experienced a lengthy expansion through 1990.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Jennifer M. |year=1994 |title=The 1990-1991 Recession: How Bad Was the Labor Market? |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=3–11 |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1994/06/art1full.pdf |accessdate=6 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal causes of the 1980 recession included [[contractionary monetary policy]] undertaken by the [[Federal Reserve Bank|Federal Reserve]] to combat double digit inflation and residual effects of the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]].&lt;ref name="CBO1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iden |first1=George R. |last2=Ribe |first2=Frederick C. |last3=Dennis |first3=Robert |year=1982 |title=The Prospects for Economic Recovery |pages=1–5 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/51xx/doc5135/doc03b-Entire.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing and construction failed to recover before more aggressive inflation reducing policy was adopted by the Federal Reserve in 1981, causing a second downturn.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBO1/&gt; Due to their proximity and compounded effects, they are commonly referred to as the early 1980s recession, an example of a W-shaped or "[[double dip recession|double dip]]" recession; it remains the most recent example of such a recession in the United States.&lt;ref name="HPost"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aversa |first1=Jeannine |year=2010 |title=A "Double Dip" Recession Defined |publisher=Huffpost Business |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/01/a-doubledip-recession-def_n_633004.html |accessdate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recession marked a shift in policy from more traditional Keynesian economics to the adoption of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies. This change was primarily achieved through tax reform and stronger [[monetarism|monetary policy]] on the part of the Federal Reserve, with the strong recovery and long, stable period of growth that followed increasing the popularity of both concepts in political and academic circles.

==Background==
Beginning in 1978, inflation began to intensify, reaching double digit levels in 1979. The [[consumer price index]] rose considerably between 1978 and 1980. These increases were largely attributed to the oil price shocks of 1979 and 1980, although the core consumer price index which excludes energy and food also posted large increases.&lt;ref name="Walsh1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 3, 2004|title=October 6, 1979|url=http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2004-35.pdf|dead-url=no|journal=FRBSF Economic Letter|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|volume=|pages=1–4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223110234/http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2004/el2004-35.pdf|archive-date=2006-02-23|lay-url=http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2004/december/october-6-1979/|last1=Walsh|first1=Carl E.|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Productivity, real [[gross national product]], and personal income remained essentially unchanged during this period, while inflation continued to rise, a phenomenon known as [[stagflation]].&lt;ref name=CBO1/&gt;

In order to combat rising inflation, recently appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, [[Paul Volcker]], elected to increase the [[federal funds rate]]. Following the October 6, 1979 meeting of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]], the federal funds rate increased gradually from 11.5% to an eventual peak of 17.6% in April 1980.&lt;ref name=Walsh1/&gt; This caused an economic recession beginning in January 1980, and in March 1980, president [[Jimmy Carter]] created his own plan for credit controls and budget cuts to beat inflation.&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1980 |title=Carter vs. Inflation |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921854-1,00.html |accessdate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to cooperate with these new priorities, the federal funds rate was lowered considerably from its April peak.&lt;ref name=Walsh1/&gt;

==1980==
A recession occurred beginning in January 1980.&lt;ref name=NBER/&gt; As a result of the increasing [[federal funds rate]], credit became more difficult to obtain for car and home loans. This caused severe contractions in manufacturing and housing, which were dependent on the availability of consumer credit.&lt;ref name=Time1/&gt; Most of the jobs lost during the recession centered around [[manufacturing|goods producing]] industries, while the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] remained largely intact.

Over the course of the recession, manufacturing shed 1.1 million jobs, with the recession posting a total loss of 1.3 million jobs, representing 1.2% of payrolls.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; The automotive industry, already in a poor position due to weak sales in 1979, shed 310,000 jobs, representing 33% of that sector. Construction declined by a similar 300,000. Unemployment rose to a recession peak of 7.8% in June 1980, however it changed very little through the end of the year, averaging 7.5% through the first quarter of 1981.&lt;ref name="Bednarzik2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bednarzik |first1=Robert W. |last2=Westcott |first2=Diane N.| |year=1981 |title=Employment and Unemployment: A Report on 1980 |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=4–14 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1981/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official end of the recession was established as July 1980.&lt;ref name=NBER/&gt; As interest rates dropped beginning in May, payrolls turned positive. Unemployment among auto workers rose from a low of 4.8% in 1979 to a record high of 24.7%, then fell to 17.4% by the end of the year. Construction unemployment rose to 16.3%, and also moderated near the end of the year.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik2/&gt;

During the final quarter of 1980, there were doubts that the economy was in recovery, and instead was experiencing a temporary respite.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik2/&gt; These concerns were fueled by poor performance in housing and auto sales in the final months of 1980, as well as a second wave of rising interest rates and stagnant unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik2/&gt;

==1981–1982==
[[File:Ronald_Reagan_televised_address_from_the_Oval_Office,_outlining_plan_for_Tax_Reduction_Legislation_July_1981.jpg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]] outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981.]]
As 1981 began, the Federal Reserve reported that there would be little or no economic growth in 1981, as interest rates were to continue rising in an attempt to reduce inflation.&lt;ref name="Rattner"&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Rattner |title=Federal Reserve Sees Little Growth in '81 With Continued High Rates |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/05/world/federal-reserve-sees-little-growth-in-81-with-continued-high-rates.html |work=New York Times |date=January 5, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Edward |last=Cowan |title=Bank Lending Rate Set at Record 14% By Federal Reserve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/05/business/bank-lending-rate-set-at-record-14-by-federal-reserve.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=May 5, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After failing to gain traction during the weak and brief recovery from the 1980 downturn, weakness in manufacturing and housing caused by rising interest rates began to have an expanded effect on related sectors beginning in mid-1981.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik/&gt; Job losses resumed, this time expanding to nearly all employment sectors through the end of 1982. Goods-producing sectors were hardest hit: 90% of all job losses in 1982 came from manufacturing, despite this sector making up only 30% of total non-farm employment. The machinery industry shed 400,000 jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing fell by 180,000 jobs. Layoffs in electrical and electronics manufacturing exceeded 100,000. The mining sector shed 150,000 jobs, likely a result of high commodity prices and cratering demand from the recession. Construction shed a total of 385,000 jobs from July 1981 through December 1982. Non-durable goods manufacturing (e.g. textiles, rubber, apparel, plastics, tobacco, food, etc.), already under pressure since the mid-1970s, suffered some 365,000 job cuts. &lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

The unemployment rate for auto workers rose from just 3.8% in early-1978 to 24% by the end of 1982; construction worker unemployment peaked at 22% during the same time. &lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

The services sector, while not hit nearly as hard as manufacturing, shed 400,000 jobs during the recession, with sharp declines in transportation, utilities, state &amp; local governments, and wholesale and retail trade. However, the finance, insurance, and real estate sector gained 35,000 jobs over the duration of the recession. &lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

The heavy losses in manufacturing and construction, contrasted with more minor losses in services, also affected the unemployment rates for men and women differently. While the increases in unemployment for both sexes were roughly equal during the recession of 1973-1975 recession, the unemployment rate for men increased 4.5 percentage points during the 1981-1982 recession, while women suffered a comparatively more mild 2.5 percentage point increase in joblessness. Between the fall of 1981 and the end of 1982, nearly 70% of the increase in unemployment came from men's unemployment. &lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

Unemployment had changed very little in the period between the end of the 1980 recession and the July 1981 start of the second, never dropping below 7.2%.&lt;ref name=Bednarzik/&gt; Unemployment rose to double digits for the first time since 1941 in September 1982, and stood at a postwar high of 10.8% by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Urquhart"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hewson |first1=Marillyn A. |last2=Urquhart |first2=Michael A.|year=1983 |title=Unemployment Continued to Rise in 1982 as Recession Deepened |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=3–12 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1983/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total increase in unemployment was 3.6%, which was less than the [[1973–75 recession]] increase of 3.8%, yet still higher than the 2.9% average. Because the recession began with already elevated levels of unemployment, the increase easily pushed it higher than any other post-war recession.&lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt; Overall, the recession caused the loss of 2.9 million jobs, representing a 3.0% drop in payroll employment, the largest percentage decline since the [[recession of 1958|1957–1958 recession]].&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; The number of underemployed workers (those who are working part-time but want full-time work) rose to the highest number ever recorded at that time since data collection began in 1955. &lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

Unemployment was particularly severe amongst teenagers and racial minorities: the unemployment rates for black Americans peaked at 20% in December 1982, compared to 15% for Latinos and 9.3% for white Americans. Teen unemployment hit 24%, and was particularly severe amongst black teenagers: for most of 1982, unemployment for black teenagers stayed at roughly 50%. 

[[Ronald Reagan]], who had assumed office in January 1981, brought his own economic plan to the table. In August 1981, the president signed the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]], a three-year tax cut plan.&lt;ref name="Laffer"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Arthur Laffer]] |title=The Laffer Curve: Past, Present, and Future|date=1 June 2004|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/06/the-laffer-curve-past-present-and-future|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the recession deepened in 1982, Reagan's approval rating also dropped. As a result, during the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1982|1982 midterm elections]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gains made in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] during the 1980 election were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven V. |last=Roberts |title=Democrats Regain Control in House |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/us/democrats-regain-control-in-house.html |work=New York Times |date=November 4, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, control of the Senate was retained by the Republicans.

==Recovery==
In July 1983, the official end of the recession was announced as November 1982, with the employment trough occurring in December. At the time of the announcement, output and sales had already met or exceeded levels achieved before the recession began.&lt;ref name="NBER2"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=12 April 2011|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/announcement/july1983.pdf|title=Recovery Began in November |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research (July 8, 1983)| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through December 1983, [[nonfarm payrolls]] rose by 2.9 million and the unemployment rate fell by 2.5%.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Eugene H. |last2=Bowers |first2=Norman |year=1984 |title=Employment and Unemployment Improvements Widespread in 1983 |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=3–14 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1984/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The auto industry had posted losses of $187 million in the third quarter of 1982, which turned into a gain of $1.2 billion during the same period in 1983.&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Charles P. |date= November 28, 1983 |title=A Lusty, Lopsided Recovery |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926382,00.html |accessdate=13 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a new surge of inflation, interest and mortgage rates remained abnormally high throughout 1983, delaying a recovery in construction and housing.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt;

A comparative analysis of the first six quarters of post-war economic recoveries published in the August 1984 issue of the ''[[Monthly Labor Review]]'' indicated the 1983–1984 recovery was stronger than any post-war recovery since that of the [[recession of 1953|1953 recession]].&lt;ref name="Devens"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devens |first1=Richard M. |year=1984 |title=Employment in the First Half: Robust Recovery Continues |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=3–7 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1984/08/art1full.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the third year of recovery drew to a close in 1985, payroll employment had grown by 10 million since the end of the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shank |first1=Susan E. |last2=Getz |first2=Patricia M. |year=1986 |title=Employment and Unemployment: Developments in 1985 |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=3–12 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1986/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth continued through July 1990, creating what was at the time the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;

==Impact==
{{Main|Savings and loan crisis}}
Although the economy recovered in 1983, the residual effects of high inflation and high interest rates had a profound impact on the savings and loans industry. [[Savings and loan associations]] were limited by interest rate ceilings. As a result of rising interest rates, many savings and loan institutions experienced frequent account withdrawals, as depositors moved their money to higher-earning accounts offered by [[commercial banks]]. The already struggling savings and loans industry posted large losses in 1981 and 1982.&lt;ref name="FDIC80s"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the 1980s: Lessons for the Future |year=1997 |publisher=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation |isbn=0-9661808-0-1 |url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/vol1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High mortgage rates eroded the value of mortgage-backed loans, the primary asset of savings and loan associations. These fixed-rate loans were sold at a loss in order to balance withdrawals. This [[asset liability mismatch]] was identified as the primary cause of the [[savings and loan crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodie |first1=Zvi |year=2006 |title=On Asset-Liability Matching and Federal Deposit and Pension Insurance |journal=Review |issue=July/August 2006 |pages=323–330 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/06/07/Bodie.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term Effects==
Although the U.S. macro economy recovered during the 1983-1990 economic expansion period, the early-1980s recession cast a long shadow over many parts of the United States, especially those reliant on heavy industry. For example, heavily industrialized [[Lake County, Indiana]] (home to major manufacturing cities such as Gary, East Chicago, and Hammond), did not recover its 1980 employment level until 1996. And as of 2010, the county's inflation-adjusted output has stubbornly remained 15-20% below its 1978 peak. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NORTHWEST INDIANA REGIONAL ANALYSIS: DEMOGRAPHICS, ECONOMY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION |url=http://cua6.urban.csuohio.edu/publications/center/center_for_economic_development/Northwest_Indiana_Consolidated_Final.pdf |publisher=Cleveland State University |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other steel-producing regions, such as the south side of [[Chicago]], the [[Mahoning Valley]], [[Cleveland]], and [[Pittsburgh]], had been struggling since the onset of the [[1973-75 recession]], but it was the early-1980s recession that left deep and lasting damage to local economies. Mining communities in Minnesota's [[Iron Range]], Wisconsin's [[Driftless Area]], eastern [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]] were also devastated after years of struggle.

Although inflation subsided and interest rates began to decline starting in 1983, the [[Federal Reserve]] was still committed to a [[strong-dollar policy]] through the mid-1980s. This prevented a recovery in manufacturing by undermining the competitiveness of exports of American manufactured goods (particularly automobiles and steel). It was not until 1985 that the Reagan administration and the Federal Reserve took action to correct this when the U.S. signed the [[Plaza Accord]] with France, West Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Twomey |first1=Brian |title=The Plaza Accord: The World Intervenes In Currency Markets |url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/plaza-accord.asp |publisher=Investopedia |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the U.S. Dollar depreciated some 50% against these major currencies, this agreement (combined with voluntary export restrictions) did help American exports recover, particularly in the automotive sector: by the early-1990s, the number of vehicles assembled by Japanese automakers in U.S. plants exceeded the number of auto exports from Japan to the U.S., a trend that still continues into the 2010s. However, many of the auto manufacturing plants were set up in states with [[right-to-work laws]], primarily in the South and West. The [[Rust Belt]] states, particularly the auto-making states of Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, did not always reap the full benefits of this change. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wiesenthal |first1=Joe |title=What Was The Plaza Accord, And What Does It Have To Do With Pressure On China To Revalue The Yuan? |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-plaza-accord-2010-9?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T |website=Business Insider |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. manufacturing employment peaked at 17.9 million in June 1979, before sharply declining by 2.8 million before bottoming out in January 1983. Although 1.2 million manufacturing jobs would be created during the 1983-1990 period, the 1979 peak would never be reached again. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=All Employees: Manufacturing |url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP |publisher=Federal Reserve |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; have found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".

Domestic violence during pregnancy can be missed by medical professionals because it often presents in non-specific ways. A number of countries have been statistically analyzed to calculate the prevalence of this phenomenon:

There are a number of presentations that can be related to domestic violence during pregnancy: delay in seeking care for injuries; late booking, non-attenders at appointments, self-discharge; frequent attendance, vague problems; aggressive or over-solicitous partner; [[Burn (injury)|burns]], pain, tenderness, injuries; vaginal tears, bleeding, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s; and [[miscarriage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Domestic violence against a pregnant woman can also affect the fetus and can have lingering effects on the child after birth.  Physical abuse is associated with [[neonatal death]] (1.5% versus 0.2%), and verbal abuse is associated with [[low birth weight]] (7.6% versus 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yost, Nicole P. |author2=Bloom, Steven L. |author3=McIntire, Donald D. |author4=Leveno, Kenneth J. |title=A Prospective Observational Study of Domestic Violence During Pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=61–65 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15994618 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000164468.06070.2a |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against men ===
Women's violence towards men is a serious social problem.&lt;ref&gt;In D.R. Loseke, R.J. Gelles &amp; M.M. Cavanaugh (Eds.), Current controversies on family violence (2nd edition, pp. 55–77). Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; While much attention has been focused on domestic violence against women, researchers argue that [[domestic violence against men]] is a substantial social problem worthy of attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, the issue of victimization of men by women has been contentious, due in part to studies which report drastically different statistics regarding domestic violence.

Some studies—typically crime studies—show that men are substantially more likely than women to use violence.&lt;ref name="Extent"&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/181867.txt Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies—typically family and domestic violence studies—show that men are more likely to inflict injuries, but also that when all acts of physical aggression or violence are considered in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]], women are equally violent as men,&lt;ref&gt;"A review of the research literature indicates that female intimate partner violence (IPV) is a frequent as male IPV. It is just as severe and has much the same consequences for males as for females." Donald G. Dutton."Female intimate partner violence and developmental trajectories of abusive females." ''[[International Journal of Men's Health]]''. Spring 2007. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAU/is_1_6/ai_n27283525/?tag=content;col1]&lt;/ref&gt; or more violent than men.&lt;ref&gt;A 2007 study of over 2,400 Spanish high school students found that girls are substantially more likely than boys to exhibit physical aggression (41.9% vs. 31.7%), including higher rates of hitting/kicking (13.4% vs 5.3%), slapping (12.4% vs 3.1%) and shoving/grabbing (22.5% vs 11.9%). See Munoz-Rivas, M. J., Grana, J. L., O'Leary, K. D., &amp; Gonzalez, M. P. (2007). Aggression in adolescent dating relationships: prevalence, justification, and health consequences. Journal of Adolescent Health, 40, 298–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A 2000 meta analysis found that men inflict 65% of domestic injuries, but women are more likely (d=-.05) to use any act of violence or aggression. See Archer, J. (2000)."Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: A meta-analytic review". ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', 126, 651–680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erin Pizzey]], founder of one of the world's first refuges for battered women, distinguished between the "genuinely battered" and the "violence prone, " additionally arguing that roughly two-thirds of the women at her shelter were violence prone, often provoking physical aggression and initiating violent conflicts. See Pizzey's "[http://dvmen.org/dv-130.htm Comparative Study Of Battered Women And Violence-Prone Women, "], co-researched with Dr. John Gayford of Warlingham Hospital.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A study of university students in Spain found that "Violent psychological behaviors (characterized by the presence of verbal aggression and coercive and jealous behaviors) and physical aggression were significantly higher in women, though the consequences of physical aggression were worse for the women's health."

In May 2007, researchers with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners using data from a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks more than twice as often as men (70% ''versus'' 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, women were more likely to be injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. Women were more likely to be injured in non-reciprocal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, D. et al. (2007) Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence. Am J Public Health. 2007 May; 97(5): 941–947. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020, http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray A. Straus|Straus]] argues that these discrepancies between the two data sets are due to several factors. For example, Straus notes that crime studies use different methodologies than family conflict studies.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (1999). "The Controversy Over Domestic Violence by Women". In ''Violence in Intimate Relationships''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Straus notes that most studies show that while men inflict the greater portion of injuries, women are ''at least'' as likely as men to shove, punch, slap or otherwise physically assault their partner, and that such relatively minor assaults often escalate to more serious assaults. Men generally do not report such assaults if asked general questions about violence or abuse; older studies frequently failed to ask about specific actions, thus falling afoul of quite different cultural gender norms for what constitutes abuse. ''Minor'' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The 2000 CDC report, based on phone interviews with 8000 men and 8000 women, reported that 7.5% of men claim to have been raped or assaulted by an intimate at some time in their life (compared to 25% of women), and 0.9 percent of men claim to have been raped or assaulted in the previous 12 months (compared to 1.5% of women).&lt;ref name="Extent"/&gt;

A 2007–2008 online non-random, self-report survey of the experiences and health of men who sustained partner violence in the past year. The study showed that male victims of IPV are very hesitant to report the violence or seek help. Reasons given for non-reporting were they (1) may be ashamed to come forward; (2) may not be believed; and (3) may be accused of being a batterer when they do come forward. The 229 U.S. heterosexual men, between 18 and 59, had been physically assaulted by their female partner within previous year and did seek help. The researchers say their findings emphasize the need for prevention on all levels:

* Primary prevention: Educate public and providers that both sexes can be IPV victims
* Secondary prevention: First responders (police, hotlines, medical professionals) should take concerns seriously from all individuals (including males) seeking help
* Tertiary prevention: Rehabilitative services available to all individuals&lt;ref&gt;Denise A. Hines, Emily M. Douglas.

When it comes to domestic violence towards children involving physical abuse, research in the UK by the [[NSPCC]] indicated that "most violence occurred at home" (78 per cent). 40—60% of men and women who abuse other adults also abuse their children.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychology Association.

=== Between teenagers ===
{{Main|Teen dating violence}}

{{Globalize/US|date=February 2015}}
Teen dating violence is a pattern of [[controlling behavior]] by one teenager over another teenager who are in a dating relationship. While there are many similarities to "traditional" domestic violence there are also some differences. Teens are much more likely than adults to become isolated from their peers as the result of controlling behavior by their boyfriend/girlfriend. Also, for many teens the abusive relationship may be their first dating experience and have never had a "normal" dating experience with which to compare it. While teenagers are trying to establish their sexual identities, they are also confronting violence in their relationships and exposure to technology. Studies document that teenagers are experiencing significant amounts of dating or domestic violence. Depending on the population studied and the way dating violence is defined, between 9 and 35% of teens have experienced domestic violence in a dating relationship. When a broader definition of abuse that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is used, one in three teen girls is subjected to dating abuse."&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King-Ries|first=Andrew|title=Teens, Technology, and Cyberstalking: The Domestic Violence Wave of the Future?|journal=Texas Journal of Women and the Law|year=2011|volume=20|pages=131–164|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a significant number of teens are victims of stalking by intimate partners. Although involvement with romantic relationships is a critical aspect of adolescence, these relationships also present serious risks for teenagers. Unfortunately, adolescents in dating relationships are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than any other age group. Approximately one third of adolescent girls are victims of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Estimates of sexual victimization range from 14% to 43% of girls and 0.3% to 36% for boys. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009, nearly 10% of students nationwide had been intentionally hit, slapped, or physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend. Twenty-six percent of girls in a relationship reported being threatened with violence or experiencing verbal abuse; 13% reported being physically hurt or hit.&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"/&gt;

==Measuring==
Measures of the incidence of violence in intimate relationships can differ markedly in their findings depending on the measures used. Care is needed when using domestic violence statistics to ensure that both gender bias and under-reporting issues do not affect the inferences that are drawn from the statistics.

Some researchers, such as Michael P. Johnson, suggest that where and how domestic violence is measured also affects findings, and caution is needed to ensure statistics drawn from one class of situations are not applied to another class of situations in a way that might have fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060449/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, such as David Murray Fergusson, counter that domestic violence prevention services, and statistics that they produce, target the extreme end of domestic violence and preventing child abuse rather than domestic violence between couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060442/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender bias===
{{weasel|date=September 2013}}
[[Statistical survey|Survey]] approaches to gathering domestic violence statistics have shown inconsistent results with regard to gender differences. Some surveys have shown comparable levels of violence by both men and women against partners, while other surveys have shown higher levels of violence by men. Approaches using data from reports of domestic violence offenses, for example, agency or hospital samples, tend to show women experiencing violence from male partners as the majority of cases (80–90%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Research based on the [[statistical survey|survey]]-based [[Conflict Tactics Scale]], a measure of intrafamily conflict and violence focusing on the adults in the family developed by Murray Straus (1979){{Clarify|date=May 2008}}, includes national surveys on the prevalence of domestic violence in the United States and other countries. These include the two U.S. National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985)&lt;ref&gt;http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000). The National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) found that women experience more intimate partner violence than do men, women experience more chronic and injurious physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men, and that violence perpetrated against women by intimates is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

Research based on reported domestic violence or on police records show men to be the perpetrators, and women the victims, of most reported domestic violence. However, the intervention of police may introduce a degree of gender bias into reporting. When faced with an uncertain domestic violence situation, removing one party will often defuse an altercation. Police officers may find it easier to take action against a man. This may be due to gender expectations, reinforced by previous incidents.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} . Additionally, removing the woman may entail involving other social services to care for any existing children for a time, something that may not be in the children's best interests, or may cause a significant delay. The fact that non-domestic offending is often committed by males may also influence an officer's decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Police responding to a complaint may act more favorably to the complainant than other parties (though some researchers report instances where men were attacked, called the police instead of fighting back, yet were arrested themselves). Some researchers have found that women are more likely to report domestic violence to police than men are. In Ireland, 29% of female victims and 5% of male victims of domestic abuse reported the abuse to the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1b&gt;"[http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf 36091 NCC Doc.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202916/http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}". www.gov.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, male victims are less likely than female victims to report rape, physical assault, or stalking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181867.pdf Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (NCJ 181867)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury and hospital admission statistics suggest that males are more frequently the perpetrators of injury causing violence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, both the difference in likelihood of reporting noted above, and the relative strength difference between males and females, could be factors in this reporting bias, as males may be more likely to injure females in otherwise equivalent circumstances.

===Under-reporting===

The problem of [[under-reporting]] to police is believed to be substantial. However, estimates about how much domestic violence is not reported vary widely. It must also be remembered that a significant amount of non-domestic violence crime is also not reported to police. Depending on what statistics are chosen, anywhere between a tenth of incidents and nothing significantly less than what would be expected for any other incident are reported to police.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}}

Many crime victimization surveys, from many countries, do show that there is a correlation between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending less likely to be reported to police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far less likely to be reported, even when they are serious.

== International levels ==
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that violence against women is a public health and human rights concern. Work in this area has resulted in the establishment of international standards, but the task of documenting the magnitude of violence against women and producing reliable, comparative data to guide policy and monitor implementation has been exceedingly difficult.

The World Health Organisation Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women 2005 is a response to this difficulty. Published in 2005 it is a groundbreaking study which analysed data from 10 countries and sheds new light on the prevalence of violence against women. It seeks to look at violence against women a public health policy perspective. The findings will be used to inform a more effective response from government, including the health, justice and social service sectors, as a step towards fulfilling the state's obligation to eliminate violence against women under international human rights laws.

===Europe===

According to the survey, 312,000 women and 93,000 men were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf Crime in England and Wales 2006/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122085133/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf |date=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====

In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson N, Nahwegahbow A | year = 2010 | title = Family violence and the need for prevention research in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities.

Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000 couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a gender bias in reporting.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"&gt;Straus, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One analysis found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, studies have shown that women are more likely to be injured.

A Canadian study showed that 7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/14/domestic-violence-050714.html |title=CBC News&amp;nbsp;– Canada&amp;nbsp;– Domestic violence rate unchanged, Statistics Canada finds |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their wives.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"/&gt;

According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;O'Grady William (2011).

Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a [[protection order]]. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense).

A study on [[Bedouin]] women in Israel found that most have experienced DV, most accepted it as a decree from God, and most believed they were to blame themselves for the violence. The study also showed that the majority of women were not aware of existing laws and policies which protect them: 60% said they did not know what a [[restraining order]] was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khoury |first=Jack |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/study-most-bedouin-victims-of-domestic-violence-believe-it-s-a-decree-from-god-1.427190 |title=Study: Most Bedouin victims of domestic violence believe it's a 'decree from God' Israel News Broadcast |publisher=Haaretz |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their
authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falls Music &amp; Arts Festival''' (commonly known as '''Falls''') is a multi-day [[music festival]] held annually in [[Lorne, Victoria|Lorne]] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]), [[Marion Bay, Tasmania|Marion Bay]] ([[Tasmania]]), [[Yelgun]] ([[New South Wales]]) and [[Fremantle]] ([[Western Australia]]), [[Australia]] over the [[New Year's Eve]] and January period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/alls-cool-as-lorne-rocks/story-e6frf7kx-1111115223726|date=1 January 2008|title=All's cool as Lorne rocks to Falls Festival sounds|work=[[Herald Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival hosts contemporary music performances, dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other art forms. [[Camping]] is available and all locations have nearby beaches which are either walking distance or a short bus ride away. 
Artists playing at the festival include [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop]], [[indie music]], [[electronic music]], [[blues]] and [[traditional music|roots]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
The festival started in 1993, with a small one-day concert, held in [[Lorne, Victoria|Lorne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, and was named '''Rock Above The Falls'''. The initial event attracted nearly 11,000 people, exceeding the organisers' expectations, and the organisers negotiated the use of neighbouring land to accommodate the crowd.

In 1995, the event adopted a two-day format, and in 1996 the name was changed to ''The Falls Music &amp; Arts Festival''.  The 1999 festival was the first to be held off the Lorne site, moved temporarily to the [[Torquay, Victoria|Torquay]] site of the [[Offshore Festival]] due to poor weather.

In 2003, two events were held simultaneously for the first time; one in Lorne, and an additional event at [[Marion Bay, Tasmania|Marion Bay]], [[Tasmania]].  The same acts played at both events; the 30 December acts who played at Lorne, play 31 December at Marion Bay, and vice versa. Both the Lorne and Marion Bay festivals have continued to run simultaneously and artists continue to be exchanged between the two locations over the course of the festival. Subsequent festivals retained this two-location format.

In 2013 the Byron addition of the event was introduced, increasing the reach of the festival across the country.

The headline acts typically perform in the evening on 30 December and 31 December.
==Awards==
In 2008, the Falls Festival won the [[FasterLouder]] Festival Award for 'Best Lineup' and the following year the Marion Bay site received the 'Favourite Venue and Location' award.&lt;ref name="fasterlouder"&gt;[http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/festivalawards/2009/results/winners/ FasterLouder Festival Awards 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808034101/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/festivalawards/2009/results/winners/ |date=8 August 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has a strong focus on sustainability, taking home the following awards over the past few years:
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2012
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2013
*Winner – Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2014 (inducted into the Hall of Fame)

In 2005 tickets for the Marion Bay festival sold out two and a half days after going on sale on 15 August, and Lorne tickets selling out one week after coming onsale.

Further allocations of tickets for both festivals were released during December and sold out within hours of coming on sale. An unlimited number of Falls Festival patrons were able to attend the 'Falls Cinema' on Thursday 29 December (one day earlier than the official kick-off) in an effort to minimize traffic congestion. In Tasmania, the number of tickets available were capped at 9000.

===2006===

In early July, a new website for the 2006 event was launched. People were able to subscribe to the official mailing list and be entered into the draw to be offered tickets ahead of the official release date of 16 August.  Subscribers that were selected were notified by 30 July.
Tickets for the 2006 festival were put on sale as of 9&amp;nbsp;am, 16 August. All tickets to the Lorne event were gone in about 2 hours. The Marion Bay event followed suit, with all tickets sold out within 3.5 hours.

The announced performers as of 28 December, include:

Restrictions on ticket sales were made in 2006 (in the form of a ballot) in an attempt to curb the increasing practice of [[ticket resale]], commonly known as 'scalping', as well as to make the access to tickets more equitable. The changes reflected similar alterations made to ticket sale procedures of other major Australian music festivals such as [[Splendour in the Grass]] and [[The Big Day Out]]. Previously, tickets had been released for sale in bulk and with no limit on the number of tickets able to be purchased by an individual, resulting in a high incidence of individuals purchasing multiple tickets, and a subsequent sell-out of tickets within 12 – 24 hours.

The restrictions included a purchasing limit of four tickets per any individual, as well as the initiation of an online ticket lottery, which randomly allocated the sale of approximately 50% of all tickets to a list of people who had registered their interest on the Festival's website. Tickets were also released on multiple dates rather than in bulk, to make sales more manageable and to increase consumer accessibility to the sale of tickets.

Ticket purchasing procedures changed again in 2007, extending changes made to procedures in 2006. Changes included:

*the extension of the ticket lottery from 50% to 80% of all tickets&amp;nbsp;– intended to increase the equity of ticket sale
*the centralisation of all ticket sales to the Falls Festival Website&amp;nbsp;– intended to eliminate the need to line up outside stores overnight in order to purchase a ticket, as well as prevent criminal problems associated with it such as littering and drinking in public
*the inclusion of a name and date of birth printed on the Festival ticket&amp;nbsp;– intended to further restrict scalping practices

Tickets went on sale to the general public on Monday 10 September at 9&amp;nbsp;am AEST, with the 14,500 tickets to the Lorne event selling out on the day they were released.

On 6 August 2009 some of the bands scheduled to play at the 2009 Falls Festival were [[News leak|leaked]] online due to a directory being left open on the official falls festival website. The organisers subsequently decided to officially release the entire first line-up announcement ahead of the scheduled 13 August release date.&lt;ref name="Falls Festival Lineup leaked"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/articles/falls-festival-2009-lineup-leak-confirmed!.aspx |title=Falls Festival 2009 lineup leak confirmed! |publisher=The Vine |accessdate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809141420/http://www.thevine.com.au/music/articles/falls-festival-2009-lineup-leak-confirmed!.aspx |archivedate=9 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2009 the Falls Festival announced that they would be putting on a pre-festival party, and extending the Falls Funk’n’Soul Revue to Lorne on 28 December. The extension of the revue made the Lorne festival a four-day event from 28 December to 1 January. The Funk’n’Soul Revue occurred over two days across the respective states, on the 28th in Lorne and on the 29th in Marion Bay with slightly differing lineups across the two locations.&lt;ref name="The Falls Funk n Soul Revue!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallsfestival.com.au/#home-lorne |title=The Falls Funk n Soul Revue!|publisher=The Falls Festival|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7106">'''Family Day''' is a public [[holiday]] in [[South Africa]], and in the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Alberta]],  [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Ontario]] and soon [[New Brunswick]], in the [[United States|American]] states of [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]], in [[Vanuatu]], in [[Vietnam]], in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], and as the second day of Songkran in Thailand.

== Australia ==

=== Australian Capital Territory ===
''Family and Community Day'' was celebrated on the first Tuesday of November from 2007–2009, coinciding with the [[Melbourne Cup]]. This public holiday was declared in 2007. [[Andrew Barr]], then [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] Minister for Industrial Relations, stated the purpose of the new public holiday was:

"...to enable workers to take a break from their hectic work and to spend some quality time with their family and friends. ... Australians do work the longest hours of any country in the western world.

== Canada ==
{{main|Family Day (Canada)}}
Nearly two-thirds of Canadians reside in a province that observes a statutory holiday on the third Monday of February. The holiday is called ''Family Day'' in four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario), ''Louis Riel Day'' in Manitoba, and ''Islander Day'' in Prince Edward Island. There is no federally established Family Day.

This holiday was first observed in Alberta in 1990, followed by Saskatchewan in 2007 and Ontario in 2008. On May 28, 2012, the BC government announced that Family Day would be observed on the second Monday in February each year, starting February 11, 2013.&lt;ref name="FamilyDayBCGov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.gov.bc.ca/bcfamilyday/?page_id=80|title=Government of BC Blog - About BC Family Day|accessdate=2013-02-04|date=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the BC government announced that Family Day would move to the third Monday in February from 2019 onward, aligning the holiday with other Canadian provinces.&lt;ref name="FamilyDayBCGovChange"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0018-000188|title=Government of BC News Release|accessdate=2018-02-09|date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a new holiday, there are no traditional activities that are associated with the day. Canadians use the long weekend for whatever purpose they like.

Family Day is unrelated to [[National Family Week]], a campaign put on each October by the Canadian Association of Family Resource Programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11577">[[Forgery]] is used by some governments and [[non-state actor]]s as a tool of [[covert operation]], [[disinformation]] and [[black propaganda]].  Letters, currency, speeches, documents, and literature are all falsified as a means to subvert a government’s political, military or economic assets.  Forgeries are designed to attribute a false intention and aspirations on the intended target.  They force the targeted government to spend a large amount of resources to refute the forgery.  Forgeries are an effective tool because of their ability to hold influence even after being proven false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document Forgery|url=http://www.faqs.org/espionage/De-Eb/Document-Forgery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|text=I arrived together with a group of American officers from Munich on 27 July in a Globemaster aircraft.... A few days ago we received orders to remain in Lebanon for 15 months to safeguard the peace and security of the United States.

There are also plans to undertake large scale works with the object of transforming the airfields of Rayack and Kolein't into American atomic bases; furthermore, 5 rocket launching pads will be erected along the Lebanon-Syrian border. More atomic weapons will be dispatched soon to Lebanon, and Beirut harbor will be transformed into America's principal naval base for its Near Eastern Fleet.

One cannot fail to realize that the object of all these preparations is to wipe out the millions of Arabs who are struggling for their national independence.... That is why I am asking you, my comrades, to demand that we be withdrawn from Lebanon to the United States quickly, and if we truly love our country we should return there without further delay.

==Techniques==

===Counterfeit money===

[[Counterfeiting]] is the creation of [[currency]] without the official sanction of the issuing state or government. It is designed to look like the real currency and convince others of its value. Counterfeiting has been used as a tactic to increase individual wealth since the creation of currency itself. Counterfeit money has also been used as a [[covert operation]] by rival nations in an attempt to create inflation and subvert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Counterfeit Money|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-counterfeit-money.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counterfeiting is a useful tool of [[subversion]] because it results in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hummel|first=William|title=Counterfeit Money, Who Takes the Hit?|url=http://wfhummel.cnchost.com/counterfeiting.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616172012/http://wfhummel.cnchost.com/counterfeiting.html|archivedate=2007-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reduction in the value of real money; an increase in prices ([[inflation]]) due to more money getting circulated in the economy - an unauthorized artificial increase in the money supply; a decrease in the acceptability of paper money; and losses, when traders are not reimbursed for counterfeit money detected by banks, even if it is confiscated.

===Operation Bernhard===

[[Operation Bernhard]] was a counterfeit campaign conducted by the [[Nazi]] regime to flood the United Kingdom with £5 and £50 banknotes. The scale of the counterfeit campaign was the largest ever conducted since the advent of paper money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=Money|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO; 2 edition|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was to introduce the counterfeit money into Great Britain to create inflation, but this plan was abandoned due to diplomatic issues. Rather, the counterfeit notes were used to finance war expenses. The counterfeited notes were created at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] by prisoners who were experts in forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=Money|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO; 2 edition|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philatelic forgeries===

[[Philatelic fakes and forgeries|Philatelic forgery]] is the creation of false postage stamps that are designed to look genuine. Because of their wide publication, stamps are a powerful tool of propaganda. Forged stamps were used by both the Allies and Axis Powers during [[World War II]]. Large philatelic campaigns were also conducted throughout the [[Cold War]].

===Literary forgery===

[[Literary forgery]] is a body of written work attributed to a certain eminent, historical or popular author. This forgery is often a fake manuscript or diary created to attribute certain ideological beliefs or actions to the figure. Literary forgery is often difficult to refute because the purported author is usually deceased.

==United States Secret Service==

The [[United States Secret Service]] is the agency within the United States' government tasked with the protection of U.S. currency.  The Secret Service has jurisdiction over violations involving the counterfeiting of United States obligations and securities. Some of the counterfeited United States obligations and securities commonly investigated by the Secret Service include U.S. currency (to include coins), U.S. Treasury checks, Department of Agriculture food coupons and U.S. postage stamps.&lt;ref name="secret service"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Secret Service|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/criminal.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The United States Secret Service was created by [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865 to combat the high counterfeit rate of currency. At the time, one-third to one-half of all U.S currency in circulation was counterfeit.&lt;ref name="secret service"/&gt; Today, the Secret Service continues its core mission by investigating violations of U.S. laws relating to currency, financial crimes, financial payment systems, computer crimes and electronic crimes. It utilizes investigative expertise, science and technology, and partnerships to detect, prevent and investigate attacks on the U.S. financial infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Secret Service Strategic Plan (FY 2008 - FY 2013)|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/usss_strategic_plan_2008_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formula 1000''' is an [[Open wheel car|open wheel]] class of Formula car racing, with professional and amateur series worldwide.  Formula 1000 gets its name from the 1000 [[Cubic centimeter|cc]] superbike engine used to power a single seat, open wheel race car with fully adjustable wings and suspension.  The F1000 class, known in SCCA as FB, is similar to racing classes FA ([[Formula Atlantic]]) and FC ([[Formula Continental]]).  In the United States, Formula 1000 races in the [http://www.NorthAmF1000.com North American Formula 1000 Championship presented by American Racer Tire]  as well as SCCA amateur competition.  

Formula 1000 cars can be purchased new, ready-to-race for $40,000 to $75,000.  SCCA rules also allow for converting an existing Formula car (e.g., FC) to meet F1000 requirements.  A converted older [[Van Diemen]] chassis with a used superbike engine ready-to-race can be found for $25,000 to $45,000.  A conversion kit for your current FC car can be purchased for between $8,000 and $12,000. 

Formula 1000 RaceCars can reach speeds in excess of 170mph; brake and corner beyond 3 g's; and provide a challenge to any driver, engineer, or team.   Drivers moving into Formula 1000 from lower formula racing are astonished to feel the power and braking ability in a 1000 pound superbike powered car.  

== Manufacturers ==
Manufacturers of purpose built Formula 1000 race cars and manufacturers of Formula 1000 race car conversions are listed below in alphabetical order.  A Formula 1000 conversion involves the modification of an existing formula race car to meet current Formula 1000 rules.  One of the major changes involved in a conversion is replacing the original engine and drive train with a 1000 cc superbike engine using a chain drive train.   Other modifications may include chassis frame changes, suspension changes and the addition of an aerodynamics package consisting of front and rear wings with a floor pan diffuser.

The '''''Francop Affair''''' was a [[high seas]] incident on November 4, 2009 in which the [[Israeli Navy]] seized the cargo ship [[MV Francop|MV ''Francop'']] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and its cargo of hundreds of tons of weapons allegedly bound from [[Iran]] to [[Hezbollah]]. The incident is also known by its military operation name, '''Operation Four Species'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126397.html|title=Report: U.S. stopped Israel from attacking 'Hezbollah arms ship'|date=6 November 2009|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Israeli commanders had received intelligence reports that the ship {{MV|Francop}} was carrying weapons originating from [[Iran]], which were to be transferred to [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; The ship was about {{convert|160|km|-1}} off the coast of [[Israel]], near [[Cyprus]], when it was stopped.

On November 4, 2009, the ship was radioed by an Israeli Navy [[missile boat]], which ordered it to halt and prepare for inspection. [[Shayetet 13]] naval [[commando]]s then boarded the ship without resistance.  The navy said that the crew was not aware of the purported smuggling and cooperated with the commandos.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; The commandos broke open the shipping containers and discovered crates of weapons and munitions hidden between sacks of polyethylene stacked along the openings and sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLCLYVjwomQ|title=IDF Navy commandoes board the Francop|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) said the ship was carrying "dozens of shipping containers, carrying numerous weapons, disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board". After boarding, the Israeli navy directed the ship to the Israeli [[port of Ashdod]] where a thorough inspection was held.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

According to the IDF, the ship picked up the cargo in [[Damietta]], [[Egypt]]; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]] on October 25.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126069.html |title=Israel seizes ship in Mediterranean carrying more than 3,000 rockets |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was then set to sail to [[Limassol]], Cyprus and then [[Latakia]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;  The IDF suspects that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Following the war, [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701]] forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. In 2010, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929]] authorized states to seize items, including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.

An Israeli naval chief said that the amount of weapons found is ten times more than that found during [[Operation Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hanan |last=Greenberg |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3800306,00.html |title=Navy: 10 times more arms on ship than on Karin-A |publisher=[[Ynet]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms shipment weighed 320 tons and were held in containers marked with Iranian shipping codes.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |first=Teibel |last=Amy |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3S0DqyLu9CfgcBASy2XHOGCk0IAD9BPAIG80 |title=Hezbollah denies link to arms ship |publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708082606/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455195197&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-08 | title=The haul: 320 tons of Katyushas, other rockets, shells and bullets | last=Katz | first=Yaakov | date=2009-11-05 | work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | publisher=jpost.com | accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seized weaponry consisted of 9,000 [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]], 2,125 107-mm [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]]s, 685 rocket fuses, 690 122-mm rockets, 21,100 F-1 fragmentation hand grenades, and 566,220 [[AK-47]] rounds.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh-pnuMJh3o&amp;feature=related|title=Slide Show of Weaponry Found on The 'Francop'|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Israeli military said that the shipment was equivalent to about ten percent of Hezbollah's stocks.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; The arms shipment was the largest ever seized by Israel.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

On November 5, 2009, ambassadors and diplomats from 44 countries, military attaches from 27 armies in the world, and the international media were invited by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry to show them the weapons and munitions seized from the ''Francop'' ship.&lt;ref name="IDF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |title=Ambassadors, Military Attaches Witness Weapons Seized from ''Francop'' |publisher=[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506234851/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/11/0505.htm |archivedate=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Ambassadors, Diplomats, and Military Attaches Examine Weaponry.jpg|thumb|300px|Ambassadors and military attaches witness weapons seized from ''Francop'']]
[[President of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]] said, "Today the whole world can see the large gap between Syria and Iran's statements and their actual activities. The ship's arrest is not only of critical military importance, but also of political importance. Facts cannot be argued with."&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Boudreaux |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-israel-arms-boat5-2009nov05,0,7130886.story |title=Israel seizes ship with alleged Hezbollah-bound arms |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] called it " a war crime that the UN Security Council should have a special meeting over".

[[Hezbollah]] made a statement to the press in which it denied "any connection with the weapons which the Zionist enemy claims it seized aboard the ''Francop'' ship".&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; [[Palestinian Authority]] spokesperson Ghassan Khatib stated that "Since the Israeli leadership and society are not ready for peace, they are using any pretext to shun peace obligations, and one is the issue of the Iranian shipment".&lt;ref name="Khaleej Times"/&gt;

An [[Iran]]ian media source commentary claimed that "Israeli propaganda" was aimed at diverting attention from U.N. allegations of Israeli [[war crime]]s during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]].&lt;ref name="Khaleej Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2009/November/middleeast_November176.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=|title=Israel accuses Iran of war crime over arms ship |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-06 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Khaleej Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]]n Foreign Minister [[Walid Muallem]] said, "Unfortunately, some official pirates in the seas, sometimes in the name of the navy, sometimes in the name of inspection, obstruct trade movement between Syria and Iran.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Glamorama''' was an annual fashion event taking place in [[Minneapolis]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], featuring top American and international fashion designers and [[celebrity|celebrities]].  The fashion show originated by [[Dayton-Hudson Corporation]] later operated through sponsorship by [[Target Corporation]], [[The May Department Stores Company]] and [[Macy's, Inc.]] during its history, concluding in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/morning_roundup/2015/05/macys-glamorama-is-out.html|title=Macy's: Glamorama is out|last=Reilly|first=Mark|date=2015-05-01|website=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glamorama debuted under [[Dayton's]] as A Cause for Applause in Minneapolis in 1992 and became known as Fash Bash in 1995. The Dayton's stores were renamed [[Marshall Field's]] in 2001 and sold to the [[The May Department Stores Company|May Company]] in 2004. The show was renamed Glamorama in 2003. In 2005, the May Company was acquired by [[Macy's, Inc.|Federated Department Stores]] which rebranded the Marshall Field's stores as Macy's in 2006.

Performers and presenters for the event over the years included [[Robin Thicke]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Cee-lo Green]], [[Big &amp; Rich]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[B-52’s]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Pussycat Dolls]], [[Ne-Yo]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Sheryl Crow]], and [[Jason Derulo]].

During its 23 years, Glamorama contributed nearly $5 million to the Minneapolis-based Children’s Cancer Research Fund. The show used 42 computers, 350 lighting fixtures, 12 projectors and 60,000 watts of sound. A total of 80 LED panels comprising more than 725,000 pixels and totaling nearly 500 square feet comprised the LED wall serving as the backdrop for the one-hour show, the result of more than a year's worth of planning.

'''Lansford Warren Hastings''' (1819–1870) is best remembered as the developer of [[Hastings Cutoff]], a shortcut across what is now the state of [[Utah]], a factor in the [[Donner Party]] disaster of 1846. He was a Major in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Born to Dr. Waitstill and Lucinda (Wood) Hastings in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio|Mount Vernon]], [[Ohio]], he was a descendant of [[Thomas Hastings (colonist)|Thomas Hastings]] who came from [[East Anglia]] in England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1634. Hastings was trained as a [[lawyer]]. In 1842, he traveled overland to [[Oregon]]. While there, he briefly represented Dr. [[John McLoughlin]], preparing his land claim near [[Willamette Falls]] and surveying [[Oregon City, Oregon]] (which would become the first incorporated city west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]). He left in the spring of 1843 for [[Alta California]], a sparsely populated province of [[Mexico]]. By the time he returned to the [[United States]] in 1844, he had decided to help to wrest California from Mexico and establish an independent [[Republic of California]], with himself holding high office.

==The Republic of California==
[[File:The Emigrants Guide to Oregon and California Lansford Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Title page]], ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California'', written by Lansford Hastings, and published in 1845]]
Hastings wrote ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California'' to induce Americans to move to California, hoping they could effect a bloodless revolution by sheer numbers. He described California in glowing terms and gave practical advice to overland travelers. Contrary to popular belief, he did not promote the cutoff that bears his name in his book. He merely described it in a single sentence as a possible route: "The most direct path would be leave the Oregon route, about two hundred miles east of Fort Hall; thence bearing west-south west, to the Salt Lake; and thence continuing down to the bay of San Francisco." (Hastings, pp.&amp;nbsp;137–138).  However, Hastings wrote this statement before he had traveled the route himself, and he may have been unaware of the difficulties in crossing the [[Wasatch Mountains|Wasatch Range]] and the [[Bonneville Salt Flats|salt flats]] of western Utah.

Hastings's dream of empire soon collapsed when California was conquered by the United States military during the [[Mexican–American War]]. In 1848, Mexico ceded California to the United States under the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].

==Later years==
[[File:Petition to President Abraham Lincoln requesting appointments in Arizona circa 1863.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Petition]] to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] by citizens of [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]], as well as [[John C. Frémont]], seeking an appointment for Lansford Hastings. Ca. 1863.]]
After serving as a captain in the [[California Battalion]] during the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], Hastings again took up the practice of law. He married Charlotte Toler in 1848 and was a delegate to the [[1849 California Constitutional Convention]]. In the late 1850s he moved his family to [[Yuma, Arizona]], where he served as postmaster and as a territorial judge. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Hastings sided with the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. In 1864, he travelled to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he met with Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] to gain his support for a plan to separate California from the Union and unite it with the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="clendenen309"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clendenen|first1=Clarence C.|authorlink=Clarence C. Clendenen|title=Dan Showalter: California Secessionist|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|date=December 1961|volume=40|issue=4|pages=309–325|doi=10.2307/25155429|via=[[JSTOR]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon meeting him, President Davis promoted Hastings to the rank of Major in the [[Confederate States Army]], and asked him to assemble a military unit in Arizona, with the aim of defending California.&lt;ref name="clendenen309"/&gt; However, the so-called Hastings Plot came to little, as the war ended early the following year.&lt;ref name="clendenen309"/&gt;

After the end of the war, many disgruntled former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]s [[Confederados|left the United States to establish colonies]] in [[Brazil]]. Hastings visited the region, made arrangements with the Brazilian government, and wrote ''The Emigrant's Guide to Brazil'' (1867) to attract potential colonists. He died at [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[Virgin Islands]] in 1870, possibly of [[yellow fever]], while conducting a shipload of settlers to his colony at [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]].

A '''leap year''' (also known as an '''intercalary year''' or '''bissextile year''') is a [[calendar year]] containing one additional day  (or, in the case of [[lunisolar calendar]]s, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the [[astronomical year|astronomical]] or [[seasonal year]].&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{citation|last1 = Meeus | first1=Jean | date = 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithims | publisher = Willmann-Bell | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'') an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox]].

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year - Definition of leap year in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English | accessdate = June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, and Monday in 2017, then it will fall on Tuesday in 2018, and Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of [[leap second]]s into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), owing to the variability of Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not entirely predictable.

==Gregorian calendar==

[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar.]]
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K. Lee |last1=Lerner |first2=Brenda W. |last2=Lerner |title=Calendar |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science |year=2004 |publisher=[[Gale]] |location=Detroit, MI |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.&lt;ref name="usno"&gt;{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years. By this rule, the average number of days per year is 365&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|4}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{frac|100}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|400}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;365.2425.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{citation | last = Richards | first = E.

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = E. G. | last = Richards | date = 1998 | title = Mapping time: The Calendar and its History | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 250–1 | isbn = 0-19-286205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The "[[Gregorian calendar#Accuracy|Accuracy]]" section of the "[[Gregorian calendar]]" article discusses how well the Gregorian calendar achieves this design goal, and how well it approximates the [[tropical year]].

===Algorithm===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS ALGORITHM ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES --&gt;

The following [[pseudocode]] determines whether a year is a ''leap year'' or a ''common year'' in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar before 1582). The ''year'' variable being tested is the integer representing the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the tests are arranged to dispatch the most common cases first. Care should be taken in translating mathematical integer divisibility into specific programming languages.

'''if''' (''year'' is not [[divisor|divisible]] by 4) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 100) '''then''' (it is a leap year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 400) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else''' (it is a leap year)

The algorithm applies to proleptic Gregorian calendar years before 1, but only if the year is expressed with [[astronomical year numbering]]. It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire.  The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.

===Leap day===
{{Main|February 29}}
[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]
[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]

February 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.

The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence "calendar") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

The Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', "twice sixth") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]
Until 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===
The Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.

The [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.

==Revised Julian calendar==
The [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.

==Chinese calendar==
The [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called "leap second month" i.e. {{zh|t=閏二月|s=闰二月|p=rùn'èryuè}}.

==Hebrew calendar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] --&gt;
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13&lt;/ref&gt; relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their "Law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} ("in order") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} ("lacking") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} ("filled") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendar==
The observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.&lt;ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu calendar==
In the [[Hindu calendar]], which is a lunisolar calendar, the embolismic month is called ''adhika maas'' (extra month). It is the month in which the sun is in the same sign of the stellar zodiac on two consecutive dark moons. ''Adhika maas'' occurs once every 33 to 34 months, compensating for the approximately eleven fewer days per year in twelve lunar months than the solar calendar. Thus, Hindu festivals tend to occur within a given span of the Gregorian calendar. For example: the No Moon during [[Diwali]] festival occurs between mid - October and mid - November. [[Buddhist calendar]]s in several related forms (each a simplified version of the Hindu calendar) are used on mainland Southeast Asia in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thai lunar calendar|Thailand]], [[Myanmar (formerly Burma)]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Hindu Calendar also known as [[Vikram Samvat]] is used in [[Nepal]] as the national calendar. All the official work is done based on this calendar.

The calendar followed in some parts of [[South India]] (mainly in [[Tamil Nadu]]) is [[Solar calendar|solar]]. It has a leap year every four years.

==Bahá'í calendar==
{{main | Bahá'í calendar }}
The Bahá'í calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of "Intercalary Days", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.

==Solar Hijri calendar==
{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}
The [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. The system used is more accurate and more complicated, and is based on the time of the March equinox as observed from [[Tehran]]. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

==Folk traditions==
[[File:Bob Satterfield cartoon about leap year traditions.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A [[spinster]] eagerly awaits the upcoming leap day, in this 1903 cartoon by [[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield.]]]]
In Ireland and Britain, it is a [[tradition]] that women may [[Proposal of marriage|propose marriage]] only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by [[Saint Patrick]] or [[Brigid of Kildare]] in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Mikkelson |first1=B. | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = D.P. | date = 2010 | url = http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/february29.asp | title = The Privilege of Ladies | website = The Urban Legends Reference Pages | publisher = snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Scotland]] (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1 and a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;Virtually no laws of Margaret survive. Indeed, none concerning her subjects are recorded in the twelve volume ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'' (1814–75) covering the period 1124–1707 (two laws concerning young Margaret herself are recorded on pages 424 &amp; 441–2 of volume I).&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, February 29, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, February 24.

According to Felten: "A play from the turn of the 17th century, 'The Maydes Metamorphosis,' has it that 'this is leape year/women wear breeches.' A few hundred years later, breeches wouldn't do at all: Women looking to take advantage of their opportunity to pitch woo were expected to wear a scarlet [[petticoat]] — fair warning, if you will."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Felten | first = E. | date = February 23, 2008 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120371485815386581 | title = The Bissextile b=Beverage | website = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the tradition is that if a man refuses a woman's proposal on leap day, he should buy her the fabrics for a skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hallett | first = S. | date = February 29, 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/27/leap-year-proposal-tradition_n_1305525.html | title = Leap Year Proposal: What's The Story Behind It? | website = Huffington Post | accessdate = December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, since 1980, a satirical newspaper entitled ''[[La Bougie du Sapeur]]'' is published only on leap year, on February 29.

In Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?la=eng&amp;pageID=151 | title = A Greek Wedding | website = Anagnosis Books | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in five engaged couples in Greece will plan to avoid getting married in a leap year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.developingteachers.com/tips/pasttips63.htm | title = Teaching Tips 63 | website = Developing Teachers | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988 the town of [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]] in Texas, declared itself "leap year capital of the world", and an international leapling birthday club was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/leap-year-capital.html|title=Anthony – Leap Year Capital of the World|publisher=Time and Date|date=2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthdays==
A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling" or a "leaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date =February 28, 2012 | article = February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day | title = Mirror | accessdate = December 7, 2015| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years, they usually celebrate their [[birthday]]s on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

===Republic of China===
{{Wikisource|Civil Code Part I General Principles}}
The Civil Code of the [[Republic of China]] since October 10, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Legislative History of the Civil Code of the Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:

{{quote|If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which precedes the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | article = Article 121 Civil Code | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Part I General Principles of the Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hong Kong===
Since 1990 non-retroactively, Hong Kong considers the legal birthday of a leapling March 1 in common years:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/E1BF50C09A33D3DC482564840019D2F4/22F10EC537B1BEBAC825648300339AA3?OpenDocument | title = Age of Majority (Related Provisions) Ordinance (Ch. 410 Sec. 5) | date = June 30, 1997 | publisher = Hong Kong Department of Justice}} (Enacted in 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
# The time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years shall be the commencement of the anniversary corresponding to the date of [their] birth.
# Where a person has been born on February 29 in a leap year, the relevant anniversary in any year other than a leap year shall be taken to be March 1.
# This section shall apply only where the relevant anniversary falls on a date after the date of commencement of this Ordinance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">The '''Linux Kongress''' was an annual conference of [[Linux]] developers from around the world, that took place every year from 1994 to 2010. It started as a two-day conference in 1994, when Linux was in the early stages of development, and by 2003 had become a four-day event. It occurred every year in Germany except 2001 and 2007. During its lifespan, Linux-Kongress was one of the three major international grass-roots Linux and Open Source conferences in the world, along with [[linux.conf.au]] and [[Ottawa Linux Symposium]].

The focus of Linux-Kongress was development topics, either in kernel or user space. The conference language was English. By the end, the event consisted of two days of conference preceded by two days of tutorials.

==Notable speakers==
The conference was a meeting place for many different types of developers. Speakers at the conference included [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] developers like [[Linus Torvalds]], [[Alan Cox]], [[Theodore Ts'o]], [[Rusty Russell]], James Bottomley, [[user space]] developers like [[Kalle Dalheimer]] and [[Miguel de Icaza]], and [[open source]] advocates like [[Eric S. Raymond]] and [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]].

==History==
In 1999 the conference cooperated with the Storage Management Workshop. In 2000 and 2001 there were several multi-day workshops sponsored by the German Ministry of Science and Education that preceded the conference. Also there was collaboration with [[NLUUG]]. In 2009 it was co-located with the OpenSolaris Developer Conference [[OSDevCon]].

The conference was organized by the [[German Unix User Group]] (GUUG). In 2011, GUUG decided not to hold a Linux Kongress, and instead focus its resources on [[LinuxCon]] Europe. There has not been a Linux Kongress since.

*2007 Panamanian [[Eduardo Arias]] discovered that toothpaste sold in his country was labeled as containing [[diethylene glycol]], the same ingredient that had tainted cough syrup and killed 138 Panamanians in 2006.

Fast action by the Ministry of Health, and notification through the media, prevented poisonings due to this product.

The '''Lottery League 2008''' was a musical event that took place from February 2 through April 12 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

The organizers of the event, a group of Cleveland [[musician]]s known as "the Council of Chiefs," held a [[lottery]] wherein roughly 150 musicians were placed in 33 semi-randomly generated bands.  One of the few guidelines was that none of the people in the bands were to have played with, worked with, or had "intimate relationships" with one another.

The Lottery League 2008 began with a Draft Night.  Shortly thereafter, the participants had 10 weeks to create and rehearse music to be performed at Cleveland [[music venue]], [[The Beachland Ballroom|The Beachland Ballroom and Tavern]].  The showcase was given the name of The Big Show, and would feature all participating bands on three stages within the span of six hours.  This show took place on April 12, 2008, to a crowd of several hundred people.

As part of the Lottery League 2008, each band was to submit [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s for their work.  Additionally, video and photo footage of band [[rehearsal]]s, [[interview]]s, and [[footage]] from the Big Show was also taken.  All of these will be gathered into a special CD/DVD release, slated for Fall 2008.

While many Lottery League groups made no plans to continue performing beyond the night of the Big Show, others have chosen to forge ahead, writing songs, booking shows, and recording more new music.

Initially President [[Petro Poroshenko|Poroshenko]] signed a decree for the martial law within the whole Ukraine for 60 days, however after 5 hours of deliberations, a less restrictive version was signed into the law by an emergency session of [[Verkhovna Rada]].&lt;ref name=u393&gt;[https://www.ukrmilitary.com/2018/11/ukaz-393-pro-voennyi-stan.html Указ №393 про введення воєнного стану в Україні (текст)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Martial law areas ==
The affected territories are located along the [[Russia-Ukraine border]], along the part of the [[Moldova–Ukraine border]] which runs along the unrecognised state of [[Transnistria]] (where Russian peacekeeping troops are present), and at the coasts of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Azov Sea]]s. The Ukrainian [[internal waters]] of the Azov–[[Kerch]] aquatory are also subject to the martial law.&lt;ref name=u393/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/europe/ukraine-russia-kerch-strait-intl/index.html Ukrainian lawmakers approve martial law as tensions with Russia escalate], [[CNN]], November 26, 2018 (retrieved November 28, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

; along the border with the unrecognised state of Transnistria:

* [[Odessa Oblast]]
; along the coast of the Black and Azov Seas:
* [[Odessa Oblast]]

; along the Russia-Ukraine border:
* [[Chernihiv Oblast]]
* [[Donetsk Oblast]]
* [[Luhansk Oblast]]
* [[Kharkiv Oblast]]
* [[Sumy Oblast]]

==Criticism==
The initial 60-day period was harshly criticized, since it ranged well into the election campaign of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|2019 Ukrainian presidential election]], which might be affected by the restrictions to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]] by the martial law (item 3 of the martial law decree).&lt;ref name=blo26112018&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-26/ukraine-imposes-martial-law-in-some-areas-after-russia-flare-up Ukraine Partially Imposes Martial Law After Russia Flare-Up], by Daryna Krasnolutska and Volodymyr Verbyany, [[Bloomberg.com]], November 26, 2018 (retrieved November 28, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--better refs exist, directly to critics, but i dont have time now. By the way now it is criticized as racist because it affects precizely the russophone teritories--&gt;

On the other hand, it has been criticized as being too late, because before the Kerch Straight incident several significantly more serious military incidents did occur since the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2018/11/27/7199417/ 30 days of war. What was the reason for the introduction of a state of war in Ukraine], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (27 November 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics associate the timing with Poroshenko's pre-election political ambitions, since his ratings for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election fell very low.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/warns-russia-outlaw-seizure-ukrainian-navy-boats-181126133646013.html Ukraine imposes martial law as tensions with Russia flare] , [[Al Jazeera]], November 26, 2018 (retrieved November 28, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I just recycled existing ext links, but easily verifiable more direct refs exist, but i dont have time now--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">Saint '''Mary the Younger''' ({{lang-el|Μαρία ή Νέα}}, to distinguish her from Saint [[Mary of Egypt]]; 875 – 16 February 902) is a [[Byzantine]] saint of [[Armenia]]n origin, the daughter of an Armenian noble.&lt;ref name="Halsall"&gt;Paul Halsall, ''Medieval Sourcebook: Life of Mary the Younger, d.c. 903''. (Bronx, New York: Fordham University Press, 1997), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some details of her life, including her following after the mid-10th century, are not known for certain; the text documenting some of her most noteworthy accomplishments was most likely written after 1025.&lt;ref name="MAT"&gt;Mary-Alice Talbot, ''Holy Women of Byzantium: Ten Saints’ Lives in English Translation''. (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1996), 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Her family originated from [[Greater Armenia]], where her father was among the local grandees. They had settled in [[Constantinople]], probably at the start of the reign of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] ({{reign|867–886}}), who called her father along with other Armenian grandees to enter his service.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Maria was born in 875, probably in Constantinople, shortly after the death of her father. She had four older siblings, two brothers and two sisters; the latter were already married, indicating that Maria was a late child of her parents.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} She was raised by her mother, and as soon as she was of age ({{circa|888}}), she married the ''[[droungarios]]'' Nikephoros, an acquaintance of her brother-in-law Bardas Bratzes. Nikephoros distinguished himself in the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|894–896 war]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], and was rewarded with a posting (probably as commander) to the division (''[[tourma]]'') of [[Bizye]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

The couple had four sons: Orestes, born {{circa|889/90}}, who died at the age of five; Bardanes, born after Orestes' death, who himself died in {{circa|895/6}}; and the twins Baanes and Stephen, born between 897 and 900, of whom Baaners became a soldier and Stephen a monk, under the [[monastic name]] Symeon.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Around 900 she was accused by the siblings of her husband, Helena and Alexios, of being profligate with money and of a liaison with their servant Demetrios. Mary vehemently denied these allegations, but Nikephoros posted a guard at her room and tortured her maidservant, Agathe, for interrogation. He furthermore removed the supervision of the household finances from Mary and gave it to the steward Drosos and a female servant, with express instructions not to give Mary any money. The latter was so distressed by her husband's treatment of her, that she developed a stomach ailment.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

In 902, according to her hagiography, she expressed her disapproval that her husband, along with his siblings and servants, did not observe the [[fasting]] of [[Lent]]. Her disapproval was transmitted to Nikephoros in much exaggerated form, according to which she claimed that he was no real Christian, but a devil. Enraged, he manhandled Mary, who hit her head trying to escape. She died ten days later, on 16 February.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} Her funeral was led by the Bishop of Bizye, and was attended by almost the entire population of the town, who accompanied the funeral procession to the local cathedral, where she was buried.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}} In 927, her son Stephen had her corpse, which had been miraculously preserved until that time, removed from her wooden coffin and placed in the marble [[sarcophagus]] of his father, whose corpse on the other hand had rotted away and was reburied outside the church.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Maria die Jüngere (von Bizye) (#24910)}}

==Attributes==
Mary the Younger was a symbol of female virtue. She is described as being merciful, having a pattern of divine love, and having high self-control, which was a stereotypical male quality. She also had duties as a wife and mother, while having a strong sense of loyalty to God.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; One of Mary the Younger’s defining characteristics was that she was highly charitable. She would send money to a tax collector who eased punishment for those imprisoned for not being able to pay the diokete- which was a public tribute tax for housekeeping. In addition, she sought gold to help individuals who were suffering, and protected widows and orphans.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; From a strictly religious perspective, Mary the Younger was steadfast in her faith to God, even through times of struggle. For example, after her son Orestes died, she praised the Lord in a sincere manner for having let her experience this. From a perspective of gender, the fact that she had a “Married” status was not a significant issue to those who admired her.&lt;ref name="Halsall" /&gt; At the same time, Mary the Younger was looked down upon and underestimated, particularly by males in high places of authority. One of the men who underestimated her was the Bishop of Bizye, who did not believe that a woman who died in a married state could perform miracles the way that a man could.&lt;ref name="MAT" /&gt;

{{Campaignbox Early Muslim Expansions}}

Northern Persia at the time when the Muslim conquests started included [[Tabaristan]], the greater portion of historic [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenia]], [[Caucasian Albania]], and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]. 

Sassanid Albania fell to the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th century and was incorporated into the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. King [[Javanshir]] of Albania, the most prominent ruler of [[Mihranid]] dynasty, fought against the Arab invasion of [[caliph]] [[Uthman]] on the side of Sassanid [[Iran]]. Facing the threat of the Arab invasion on the south and the [[Khazar]] offensive on the north, Javanshir had to recognize the caliph's suzerainty. The Arabs then reunited the territory with Armenia under one governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chaumont, M. L. |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html  |title=Albania |work=Encyclopædia Iranica |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310231608/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html |archivedate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Arab incursions in present-day Georgia happened approximately between 642 and 645, during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It soon turned into a full-scale invasion, and Tbilisi was taken in 645.&lt;ref name="Suny1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=8 May 2012|year=1994|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20915-3|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{Further|Romanization of Arabic}}
There is no universally accepted standard for [[transliteration|transliterating]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words and [[Arabic name]]s into English;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitaker |first=Brian |title=Arabic words and the Roman alphabet |url=http://www.al-bab.com/arab/language/roman1.htm |publisher=Al-Bab.com |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425213610/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/language/roman1.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered "Osama bin Laden". The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either "Usama bin Laden" or "Usama bin Ladin". Less common renderings include "Ussamah bin Ladin" and, in the French-language media, "Oussama ben Laden". Other spellings include "Binladen" or, as used by his family in the West, "Binladin". The decapitalization of ''bin'' is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions, articles, and [[patronymics]] uncapitalized in surnames; the [[nasab]] ''[[Arabic Name#Nasab نسب|bin]]'' means "son of". The spellings with ''o'' and ''e'' come from a [[Persian language|Persian]]-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years.

Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means "Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden". "Mohammed" refers to bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; "Awad" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] tribesman; "Laden" refers not to bin Laden's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to Aboud's father, Laden Ali al-Qahtani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/L%C4%81din-al-Qatani/6000000012479136624 |title=Lādin Ali al-Qatani |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116225543/https://www.geni.com/people/L%C4%81din-al-Qatani/6000000012479136624 |archivedate=November 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic [[natural language|linguistic]] convention would be to refer to him as "Osama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "bin Laden" alone, as "bin Laden" is a [[patronymic]], not a surname in the Western manner. According to bin Laden's son [[Omar bin Laden]], the family's hereditary surname is "[[Al-Qahtani (disambiguation)|al-Qahtani]]" ({{lang-ar|القحطاني}}, ''āl-Qaḥṭānī''), but bin Laden's father, [[Mohammed bin Laden]], never officially registered the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing up Bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World |last=bin Laden |first=Najwa |authorlink2=Omar bin Laden |last2=bin Laden |first2=Omar |last3=Sasson |first3=Jean |authorlink=Najwa Ghanem |authorlink3=Jean Sasson |year=2009 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-56016-4 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcBwm5b8VbAC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407011237/http://books.google.com/books?id=RcBwm5b8VbAC |archivedate=April 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osama bin Laden had also assumed the ''[[kunya (Arabic)|kunyah]]'' "Abū 'Abdāllāh" ("father of [[Abdallah Laden|Abdallah]]"). His admirers have referred to him by several nicknames, including the "Prince" or "[[Emir]]" (الأمير, ''al-Amīr''), the "[[Sheikh|Sheik]]" (الشيخ, ''aš-Šaykh''), the "Jihadist Sheik" or "Sheik al-[[Mujahideen|Mujahid]]" (شيخ المجاهد, ''Šaykh al-Mujāhid''), "[[Hajj]]" (حج, ''Ḥajj''), and the "Director".&lt;ref name="fbiwantednotice"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/terbinladen.htm |title=Most Wanted Terrorist – Usama Bin Laden |publisher=FBI |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310055924/http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/terbinladen.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''usāmah'' (أسامة) means "lion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almaany.com/home.php?language=english&amp;lang_name=English&amp;category=Names+Meanings&amp;word=USAMA |title=Meaning of Usama |year=2011 |work=English–Arabic Almaany Dictionary |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning him the nicknames "Lion" and "Lion Sheik".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/07/AR2007090700279.html |work=The Washington Post |title=In a New Video, Bin Laden Predicts U.S. Failure in Iraq |first=Joby |last=Warrick |date=September 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224030015/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/07/AR2007090700279.html |archivedate=February 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and ideology==
{{Main|Beliefs and ideology of Osama bin Laden}}
A major component of bin Laden's ideology was the concept that civilians from enemy countries, including women and children, were legitimate targets for jihadists to kill.&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005) p. 70. Al Jazeera, December 1998, following Kenya and Tanzania embassy attacks.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005), p. 119, October 21, 2001, interview with Taysir Alluni of Al Jazeera.&lt;/ref&gt; According to former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Michael Scheuer]], who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East,&lt;ref name="Scheuer 2004 9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheuer |first=Michael |title=Imperial Hubris |publisher=Brassey's, Inc. |year=2004 |location=Dulles, Virginia |page=9 |url= |id= |isbn=978-0-9655139-4-4 |quote=The focused and lethal threat posed to U.S. national security arises not from Muslims being offended by what America is, but rather from their plausible perception that the things they most love and value—God, Islam, their brethren, and Muslim lands—are being attacked by America.}}&lt;/ref&gt; condensed in the phrase, "They hate us for what we do, not who we are." Nonetheless, bin Laden criticized the U.S. for its [[Establishment Clause|secular]] [[United States Constitution|form]] of [[Federal government of the United States|governance]], calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and "reject the immoral acts of [[:wikt:fornication|fornication]], homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and [[usury]]", in a letter published in late 2002.&lt;ref name=Letter2002/&gt; His vocal criticism of Western government and society, and his claims that they were dominated by Jews, earned him respect from various sectors of the far right in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardell |first=Matthias |title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism |year=2003 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham and London |isbn=978-0822330714 |page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and that the complete restoration of [[Sharia]] law would be the only way to "set things right" in the Muslim world. He opposed such alternatives such as secular government,&lt;ref name=Letter2002/&gt; as well as "[[pan-Arabism]], socialism, communism, democracy."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', 2005, p. 218. "Resist the New Rome", audiotape delivered to al-Jazeera and broadcast by it on January 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He subscribed to the [[Athari]] (literalist) school of Islamic theology.&lt;ref name=Halverson-80&gt;{{cite book |last=Halverson |first=Jeffry R. |title=Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism |date=2010 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=osama&amp;f=false |quote="It was there that he met the Athari-Wahhabite militant Osama bin Laden..." |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101093302/https://books.google.com/books?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=osama&amp;f=false |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was heavily [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. In a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist [[Rahimullah Yusufzai]], bin Laden stated that [[Operation Desert Fox]] was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the United States and United Kingdom, directing them to kill as many Muslims as they could.&lt;ref name=Time1999&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,17676,00.html |title=Conversation With Terror |work=Time |date=January 1999 |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter released in late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States.&lt;ref name=Letter2002&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130826184301/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver October 6, 2002.

They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005), p. 190. from 53-minute audiotape that "was circulated on various websites" dated February 14, 2003. "Among a Band of Knights"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]] Muslims have been listed along with "[[heresy|heretics]], [...] America, and Israel" as the four principal "enemies of Islam" at ideology classes of bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=303 "From interview with [[Ali Soufan]] – a [[Lebanese American|Lebanese]] Sunni FBI agent"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was opposed to music on religious grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in "earth-moving machinery and [[genetic engineering]] of plants" on the one hand, but rejected "chilled water" on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the [[Soviet Union]] and United States was to lure them into a long [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by "bleeding" them dry.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html Bin Laden: Goal is to bankrupt U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305091629/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}". CNN. November 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, al-Qaeda manuals clearly express this strategy.

===Criticism===
A number of errors and inconsistencies in bin Laden's arguments have been alleged by authors such as [[Max Rodenbeck]] and [[Noah Feldman]]. 
*bin Laden described the US as having "no mentionable role" in "the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] ... but rather the credit goes to God and the [[mujahidin]] in Afghanistan ...".&lt;ref name="World 2005"&gt;p.50, ''Messages to the World'', 2005, quoting March 1997 interview with Peter Arnett&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the United States delivered [[Soviet–Afghan War#Foreign involvement and aid to the mujahideen|$3 billion worth of arms and money]] to mujahideen between 1981 and 1989.&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18750?email |title=Their Master's Voice, [a review of ''Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden] |journal=New York Review of Books |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden made a number of contradictory comments on democracy:
*He invoked [[democracy]] both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of [[Western world#Modern political|western]] political system—American law being "the law of the rich and wealthy"&lt;ref&gt;''Messages to the World, Statements of Osama bin Laden'', Verso, 2005, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;—and as the reason civilians are responsible for their government's actions and so can be lawfully punished by death.&lt;ref name="Shirazi-2006-listen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shirazi|first1=S|title=Listening to Bin Laden |url=http://www.printculture.com/item-799.html|website=printculture.com |accessdate=March 29, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122194233/http://www.printculture.com/item-799.html |archivedate=November 22, 2006|date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*He denounced [[democracy]] as a "religion of ignorance" that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, but in a later statement compares the Western democracy of [[Spain]] favorably to the Muslim world—because "the ruler there is accountable." "Evidently, [bin Laden] has never heard theological justifications for democracy, based on the notion that the will of the people must necessarily reflect the will of an all-knowing God," Rodenbeck comments. It is worth noting that Spain was once under the rule of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].
*In 1997 he condemned the United States government for its hypocrisy in not labeling the bombing of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] as terrorism. In November 2001, he maintained that revenge killing of Americans was justified because he claimed that Islamic law allows believers to attack invaders even when the enemy uses [[human shields]]. However, according to Rodenbeck, "this classical position was originally intended as a legal justification for the accidental killings of civilians under very limited circumstances — not as a basis for the intentional targeting of noncombatants."&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB/&gt;  
*A few months later in a 2002 letter, he made no mention of this justification but claimed "that since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government's actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets."&lt;ref name=nyt-2006-2-12&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/books/review/12feldman.html?ex=1297400400&amp;en=2e621025586a71b3&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss nytimes.com "Becoming bin Laden," Review by NOAH FELDMAN, February 12, 2006 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB/&gt;

There were also questionable claims in his arguments about the exploitation and oppression of Muslims and Arabs by the US:
*He asserted infidels were "attacking Muslims like people fight over a plate of food," planning to "enslave" Muslims or to "annihilate" Islam.&lt;ref name="World 2005"/&gt; Yet if America bore enmity towards Muslims why hadn't it attacked the militarily undefended city of  [[Mecca]]—holy to Muslims?&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB/&gt; 
*The claim that America "`robs` Arabs of their oil"&lt;ref name="World 2005"/&gt; was belied (according to critics) by the 100s of millions of dollars in [[petroleum]] revenue earned by the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] .&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB/&gt; 
*Bin Laden "repeatedly" accused the Christian West of having waged war on Islam "for 80 years". But during this time European imperialism was in retreat. Events he describes as the most "penetrating and brutal" acts of imperialism—[[Dutch East Indies|Dutch conquest of the East Indies]], the [[French Algeria|French invasion of Algeria]] in the 1830s, or Britain's crushing of the 1857 [[Indian Mutiny]]—happened outside the period.&lt;ref name=Rodenbeck-NYRoB/&gt; 
*He claimed "Muslims are starving to death" because "the United States is stealing their oil" by paying too little for it, but bases the claim of theft on the assumption that oil prices would continue to climb following the [[1973 oil crisis|massive price increases]] of 1973 and 1974;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamismland.googlepages.com/stealingmuslimoil "The War against Islam," Stealing Muslim Oil]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*He claimed that the high [[Iraq sanctions#Infant and child death rates|infant mortality rates]] in Iraq from American-supported [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions]] were "the greatest slaughter of children that mankind has known". Similarly extremely high infant and young children mortality rates in Afghanistan caused by the Taliban expelling international aid groups were not only not criticized, but bin Laden praising the [[Taliban]] for making Afghanistan "the only Islamic country" in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamismland.googlepages.com/isthereawaragainstislam The "War against Islam" Killing Muslim Children.

===Mujahideen in Afghanistan===
After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]] and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the [[Mujahideen]] resistance in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/155236.stm |title=Who is Osama Bin Laden? |publisher=BBC News |date=September 18, 2001 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224201012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/155236.stm |archivedate=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told a journalist: "I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Robert Fisk, March 22, 1997, 'The Great War For Civilisation', 2005, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under CIA's [[Operation Cyclone]] from 1979 to 1989, the United States and [[Saudi Arabia]] provided $40&amp;nbsp;billion worth of financial aid and weapons to almost 100,000 Mujahideen and "[[Afghan Arabs]]" from forty Muslim countries through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban |title=Story of US, CIA and Taliban |work=[[The Brunei Times]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205090713/http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban |archivedate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Jason Burke]] wrote that "bin Laden's Office of Services, set up to recruit overseas for the war, received some US cash."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frankenstein the CIA created |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/17/yemen.islam |work=The Guardian |date=January 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden met and built relations with [[Hamid Gul]], who was a [[three-star rank|three-star]] [[Lieutenant General (Pakistan)|general]] in the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani army]] and head of the ISI agency.

By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam established [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], which funneled money, arms and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=145 "Lawrence Wright estimates his share of the Saudi Binladin Group circa fall 1989 as amounted to 27&amp;nbsp;million Saudi riyals – a little more than [US]$7&amp;nbsp;million."}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]; he would also participate in some combat activity, such as the [[Battle of Jaji]]. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.&lt;ref name=fisk1 /&gt;

===Formation and structuring of Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|Al-Qaeda}}
By 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|pp=74–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988 indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]'') to follow one's superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between "several senior leaders" of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=August+11,+1988,+meeting+between+%22several+senior+leaders%22+of+Egyptian+Islamic+Jihad,+Abdullah+Azzam,+and+bin+Laden |title=Urban Terrorism : Myths And Realities |first=N.

Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have "brought down the mighty superpower" of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;'The Great War for Civilisation', Robert Fisk, 2005, p4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] on August 2, 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent. Bin Laden met with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], and Saudi Defense Minister [[Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Sultan]], telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others, and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Jehl |first=Douglas |title=A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked Away |work=The New York Times |date=December 27, 2001 |pages=A1, B4 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118105250/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html |archivedate=November 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. military, arguing the two holiest shrines of Islam, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the cities in which the [[Prophet Mohamed]] received and recited Allah's message, should only be defended by Muslims. Bin Laden's criticism of the Saudi monarchy led them to try to silence him. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of [[Dhahran]] and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

Meanwhile, on November 8, 1990, the FBI [[raid (military)|raided]] the [[New Jersey]] home of [[El Sayyid Nosair]], an associate of al-Qaeda operative [[Ali Mohamed]]. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tkb.org/CaseHome.jsp?caseid=332 |title=USA v.

In March–April 1992, Bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating [[Afghan Civil War (1989–92)|civil war in Afghanistan]], by urging warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to join the other [[mujahideen]] leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself.{{sfnp|Gutman|2008|page=37}}

Bin Laden continued to speak publicly against the Saudi government, for which the Saudis banished him. In 1992 he went to live in exile in Sudan, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abdullah Assam: The Man Before Osama Bin Laden |author=Steve Emerson |url=http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218211532/http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html |archivedate=February 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, bin Laden was being linked with [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ [[Attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak|attempted to assassinate]] the Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ.

The U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a "[[State terrorism|sponsor of international terrorism]]" and bin Laden of operating "terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert". According to Sudan officials, however, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader [[Hassan al-Turabi]] lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the U.S. but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled bin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized U.S. intelligence officials to visit Sudan.&lt;ref name=VF2002/&gt;

The 9/11 Commission Report states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer [[Billy Waugh]] tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting the Jackal: A Special Forces and CIA Soldier's Fifty Years on the Frontlines of the War Against Terrorism,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Ambassador [[Timothy M. Carney|Timothy Carney]] encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against bin Laden in any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch4.pdf |format=PDF |title=Responses to Al Qaeda's Initial Assaults |publisher=9/11 Commission |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015032827/http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch4.pdf |archivedate=October 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] further states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. U.S. officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the [[CIA]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, bin Laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to [[Jalalabad|Jalalabad, Afghanistan]] aboard a chartered flight on May 18, 1996; there he forged a close relationship with [[Mullah Mohammed Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224 |title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Megan K.

In August 1996, bin Laden declared war against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2008|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assurance of President [[George H. W. Bush]] to [[King Fahd]] in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that "the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into 'an American colony".&lt;ref name=fisk2 /&gt;

He issued a [[fatwā]] against the United States, which was first published in ''[[Al Quds Al Arabi]]'', a London-based newspaper. It was entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031024057/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 31, 2001 |title=Bin Laden's Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=August 20, 1998 |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia is sometimes called "The Land of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. The reference to "occupation" in the fatwā referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as [[Operation Southern Watch]].

In Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from "donors from the days of the Soviet jihad", and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden effectively took over [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of bin Laden's terrorist network.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Braun; Judy Pasternak [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 "Long Before Sept. 11, Bin Laden Aircraft Flew Under the Radar"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADRSXn9k?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 |date=August 26, 2012 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

===Early attacks and aid for attacks===
It is believed that the first bombing attack involving bin Laden was the December 29, 1992, bombing of the [[Gold Mihor Hotel]] in [[Aden]] in which two people were killed.&lt;ref name="pbschronology"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html |title=Who is bin Laden?: Chronology |publisher=PBS |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023118/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html |archivedate=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) if they were good Muslims and to ''[[Jahannam]]'' (hell) if they were bad or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, U.S. v. Usama bin Laden, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.

In the 1990s, bin Laden's al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially and sometimes militarily in Algeria, Egypt and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993 bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The [[Algerian Civil War#Massacres and reconciliation|war]] that followed caused the deaths of 150,000–200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamist surrender to the government.

It has been claimed that bin Laden funded the [[Luxor massacre]] of November 17, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Jailan Halawi, "bin Laden behind Luxor Massacre?", ''Al-Ahram Weekly'', May 20–26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Barbara |last=Plett |title=Bin Laden 'behind Luxor massacre' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/343207.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=May 13, 1999 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121090734/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/343207.stm |archivedate=November 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Profile: Ayman al-Zawahiri |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1560834.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819003214/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1560834.stm |archivedate=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the [[Northern Alliance]] threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing bin Laden to abandon his [[Najim Jihad]] compound and move his operations to [[Tarnak Farms]] in the south.&lt;ref name="arkChark"&gt;Testimony of [[Abdurahman Khadr]] as a witness in the trial against Charkaoui, July 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another successful attack was carried out in the city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand [[Hazaras]] overrunning the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, Osama bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] co-signed a ''fatwa'' in the name of the [[World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders]], which declared the killing of North Americans and their allies an "individual duty for every Muslim" to "liberate the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] (in [[Jerusalem]]) and the holy mosque (in Mecca) from their grip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/fatw2.htm |title=World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders: Initial "Fatwa" Statement |author=Shaykh Usamah Bin-Muhammad Bin-Ladin |first2=Ayman |last2=al-Zawahiri |author3=Abu-Yasir Rifa'i Ahmad Taha |author4=Shaykh Mir Hamzah |first5=Fazlur |last5=Rahman |date=February 23, 1998 |work=al-Quds al-Arabi |language=Arabic |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm |title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.

The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placing bin Laden on its [[FBI ten most wanted fugitives|Ten Most Wanted]] list.

In December 1998, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] Counterterrorist Center reported to President [[Bill Clinton]] that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the United States of America, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522041639/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001110635/0001110635_0001.gif |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |title=Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack U.S. Aircraft and Other Attacks |date=December 4, 1998 |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |publisher=[[Director of Central Intelligence]] |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001110635/0001110635_0001.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2000, [[Richard A.

In 1992, hundreds of volunteers joined an "all-mujahedeen unit" called El Moujahed in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall.

According to Middle East intelligence reports, bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was [[Karim Said Atmani]], who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/50933336.html?FMT=ABS |title=A Bosnian Village's Terrorist Ties |work=The Washington Post |author=R.

A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former Mujahideen who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=on}} north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. [[Khalil al-Deek]] was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997, report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, ''The New York Times'' noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces.

In 1999 the press reported that bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and [[Bosnian passport]]s in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by the Bosnian government following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that bin Laden "did not personally collect his Bosnian passport" and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; The Bosnian daily ''[[Oslobođenje]]'' published in 2001 that three men, believed to be linked to bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.

[[SHISH]]'s head Fatos Klosi said that Osama was running a terror network in [[Albania]] to take part in [[Kosovo War]] under the guise of a humanitarian organisation and it was reported to have been started in 1994.

During his trial at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], former Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] quoted from a purported [[FBI]] report that bin Laden's al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. He claimed bin Laden had used Albania as a "launchpad for violence" in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed [[Richard Holbrooke]] that KLA was being  aided by Al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] earlier. Milošević had argued that the United States aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the Kosovo War.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roche, Reuters, "Milosevic: U.S. was Ally of Al Qaeda in Kosovo", February 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/21743/us-backed-al-qaeda-in-kosovo-milosevic-chinese-embassy-bombing-termed-deliberate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1862515.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rest-easy-bill-clinton-mi_b_17235&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden became the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1990s|456th person listed]] on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on June 7, 1999, following his indictment along with others for [[Capital punishment|capital crimes]] in the 1998 embassy attacks.

Years later, on October 10, 2001, bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George W. Bush, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists.

Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. They did however offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial in return for the United States ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding "there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5 |title=Bush rejects Taliban offer to hand Bin Laden over |work=The Guardian |date=October 14, 2001 |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825195435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5 |archivedate=August 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the September 11 attacks, U.S. government officials named bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25&amp;nbsp;million for information leading to his capture or death.&lt;ref name="fbiwantednotice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/nov03/laden110503.htm |title=Five Years Ago Today – Usama bin Laden: Wanted for Murder |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109080055/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/nov03/laden110503.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50&amp;nbsp;million though the amount was never changed.&lt;ref name="BBCJuly07"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6898075.stm |title=Senate doubles Bin Laden reward |publisher=BBC News |date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808104324/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6898075.stm |archivedate=August 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airline Pilots Association]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] offered an additional $2&amp;nbsp;million reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Katie Turner |author2=Pam Benson |author3=Peter Bergen |author4=Elise Labott |author5=Nic Robertson |publisher=CNN |date=September 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/23/france.binladen/index.html |title=Officials, friends can't confirm Bin Laden death report |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326042339/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/23/france.binladen/index.html |archivedate=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the U.S. government concluded that Osama bin Laden was present during the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], Afghanistan in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the United States to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |last2=Ricks |first2=Thomas E. |title=U.S. Concludes Bin Laden Escaped at Tora Bora Fight |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16 |archive-url= http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100301195609/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= March 1, 2010 |date=April 17, 2002 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in [[Tora Bora]] between August 14–16, 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-[[Ramadan]] meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21000298 |title=Bin Laden may have just escaped U.S. forces |publisher=MSNBC |author1=Justin Balding |author2=Adam Ciralsky |author3=Jim Miklaszewski |author4=Robert Windrem |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123104421/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21000298 |archivedate=January 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] said in December 2009 that officials had had no reliable information on bin Laden's whereabouts for years. One week later, General [[Stanley McChrystal]], the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless its leader, Osama bin Laden, were captured or killed. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said that bin Laden had become an "iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world", and that Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. "I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed," McChrystal said of bin Laden. According to him, killing or capturing bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8402138.stm |title=Gen McChrystal: Bin Laden is key to al-Qaeda defeat |publisher=BBC News |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428192959/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8402138.stm |archivedate=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, President Obama ordered a covert [[Death of Osama bin Laden|operation]] to kill or capture bin Laden. On May 2, 2011, the White House announced that U.S. Navy SEALs had successfully carried out the operation, killing him in his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|Abbottabad compound]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13256791 |title=Osama Bin Laden dead, US President Obama confirms |publisher=BBC News |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503194908/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13256791 |archivedate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks==

While referring to Osama bin Laden in a CNN film clip on September 17, 2001, then President George W. Bush stated, "I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted dead or alive' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2001, President George W.

Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghanistan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place. Some of the conflicting reports regarding bin Laden's continued whereabouts and mistaken claims about his death follow:
* On December 11, 2005, a letter from [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] to [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] indicated that bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the [[Waziristan]] region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's [[Combating Terrorism Center]] at [[West Point]], "Atiyah" instructs Zarqawi to "send messengers from your end to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership [...] I am now on a visit to them and I am writing you this letter as I am with them ..." Al-Rahman also indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are "weak" and "have many of their own problems." The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100101083.html |title=Letter Gives Glimpse of Al-Qaeda's Leadership |work=The Washington Post |author=Karen DeYoung |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425085210/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100101083.html |archivedate=April 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf |format=PDF |title=Letter Exposes New Leader in Al-Qa'ida High Command (PDF) |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center at West Point |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808182757/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detainee reported that in January or February (2009) he met a trusted contact who had seen bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on December 6, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had no reliable information on the whereabouts of bin Laden in years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8397684.stm "No Bin Laden information in years, says Gates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206051926/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8397684.stm |date=December 6, 2009 }}.

In a 2010 letter, bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted ''al-tatarrus''—an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaida, Bin Laden condemned [[Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan]] for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that "the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants." Bin Laden wrote that the tatarrus doctrine "needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established." He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a "truce" that would bring the country "stability" or would at least "show the people that we are careful in keeping ... the Muslims safe on the basis of peace." In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]] to pursue economic development.

"Obviously bin Laden did have a support system," he said. "The issue is, was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan, or within the society of Pakistan?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/death-bin-laden-live-report-013459906.html |title=Death of Bin Laden: Live report |publisher=Yahoo! |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118191002/http://ph.news.yahoo.com/death-bin-laden-live-report-013459906.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Palaiologos Tagaris''' ({{lang-el|Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος Τάγαρις}}, {{circa|1320/1340}} – after 1394) was a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] monk and impostor. A scion of the Tagaris family, Paul also claimed a somewhat dubious connection with the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty that ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] at the time. He fled his marriage as a teenager and became a monk, but soon his fraudulent practices embroiled him in scandal. Fleeing [[Constantinople]], he traveled widely, from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to [[Persia]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] and eventually, via [[Ukraine]] and [[Hungary]] to [[Italy]], [[Latin Greece]], [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[France]].

During his long and tumultuous career, Paul was appointed an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, pretended to be the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], switched from [[Greek Orthodoxy]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] and back again, supported both the [[See of Rome]] and the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon anti-popes]] in the [[Western Schism]], and managed to be named [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]]. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a [[synod]] in 1394.

== Early life and family ==
The main source on Paul's life is the document of his confession before the patriarchal synod in [[Constantinople]], which is undated, but included among documents of the years 1394–1395. It was published in modern times by Franz Ritter von Miklosich and Joseph Muller (eds.), ''Acta et Diplomata Græca medii ævi sacra et profana'', Vol. II, ''Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitanæ'', Vienna 1860. The confession is complemented by an account of his visit to Paris in 1390, written by a monk of the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] and included in the anonymous ''[[Chronique du religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le règne de Charles VI de 1380 à 1422]]''.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=289, 290 (note 1)}}{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}

Paul Tagaris was apparently a scion of the Tagaris family, a lineage which first appears in the early 14th century.{{sfn|Trapp|1991|p=2006}} His father is unnamed, but is described by Paul as a valiant and famous soldier, so that he is possibly identifiable either with the ''[[megas stratopedarches]]'' [[Manuel Tagaris]],{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=290 (note 2)}} or with the latter's son, [[George Tagaris]].{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}} Paul Tagaris claimed to be related to the ruling imperial dynasty of the [[Palaiologoi]] and adopted the surname for himself. Manuel Tagaris was indeed married to Theodora Asanina Palaiologina, daughter of [[Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria]], and niece of Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], but even if Paul was Manuel's son, Theodora was, according to the Byzantinist [[Donald Nicol]], "almost certainly not the mother of Paul".{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=290}}

According to Nicol, Tagaris was probably born in the 1320s,{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=289}} while other modern sources like the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'' and the ''[[Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit]]'' put it later, around the year 1340.{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}} His parents arranged his marriage at the age of 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}} After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch [[Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople|Kallistos I]] declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his ''[[locum tenens]]'', the [[hieromonk]] Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=290–291}}

== Career in the East ==
In Palestine, Paul was able to secure his ordination as a [[deacon]] by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] Lazaros, who took him under his protection (ca. 1364).{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}}{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=291}} Shortly after, Lazaros left for Constantinople, and his ''locum tenens'' Damianos brought charges against Paul, who was forced to abandon Jerusalem for [[Antioch]].{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=291}} In Antioch, Paul once again managed to befriend an influential figure, the newly elected (1368) [[Greek Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch]] Michael, who not only ordained him a priest, but eventually made him patriarchal [[exarch]] and administrator of the Patriarchate's affairs. It was not long before Paul began abusing his authority: he sacked serving bishops and put their sees up for sale, threatening to report those who complained to the Turkish authorities. Soon he claimed the title of Patriarch of Jerusalem for himself and began to ordain bishops, even in territories subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=291}} In 1370, he went to [[Iconium]] and then to [[Persia]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], where, according to his own recollection, he adjudicated a dispute among three rival claimants of the throne, finding in favour of the highest bidder. No such dispute is recorded in Georgian sources at this time.{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}}{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=291–292}}

At this point, again according to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Arsenius of Tyre|Arsenius]], Metropolitan of Tyre in 1351–1376 and rival Patriarch of Antioch in 1366–1376. {{harvnb|PLP|loc=1407. Ἀρσένιος}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the [[Taurus Mountains]] or in the [[Tauric peninsula]], i.e. the Crimea{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon ({{circa|1375}}). At the same time, the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheos I Kokkinos]] heard about his dealings in the east, and at [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=292}}

== Latin Patriarch of Constantinople ==
[[File:Urbanus VI tondo.jpeg|thumb|Pope Urban VI (modern painting, [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome)]]
Reluctant to face the Patriarch's wrath, Paul once more decided to flee, and try his luck in Rome. As Nicol points out, such a move would be highly unusual for an Orthodox priest, but may be explained by his family's links with pro-Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital: George Tagaris, his putative brother or father, was among those who supported the Union of the Churches and had received letters of encouragement from [[Pope Innocent VI]].{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=292–293}} To avoid passing near Constantinople, Paul was forced to make a broad detour. He took a ship, probably from Trebizond, to the Crimea, where he presented the local governor of the [[Golden Horde]] with jewels from the treasure he had amassed. In exchange, he received an escort through the Horde lands (modern [[Ukraine]]) to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and thence to Rome. There he secured an audience with [[Pope Urban VI]], claiming to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Paul presented himself to the Pope as a penitent, offered a confession, and embraced the Catholic faith. Impressed by Paul's humble demeanour, the Pope named him (in late 1379 or early 1380) to the titular post of [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]], which had been vacant since September 1378, when its incumbent, [[Giacomo da Itri]], had declared his allegiance to the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon anti-pope]] [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]]. Urban also named Paul [[apostolic legate]] for all countries "east of [[Durrës|Durazzo]]".{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=293}}{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|p=228}}

After his appointment as a "second Pope", as he called it, Paul abandoned his simple [[monastic habit]] and adopted magnificent [[vestment]]s to suit his new rank, wore ostentatious jewellery, and, according to the chronicler of Saint-Denis, went about on horseback surrounded by a magnificently outfitted entourage.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=294}} A likely example of Paul's splendid vestments and accoutrements at this time is a richly embroidered altar cloth, featuring a Byzantine [[double-headed eagle]] with a monogram on its breast and the legend "Paul, Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome" in Greek, now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Ball|2006|pp=59–64}}

Since Constantinople had been recovered by the Byzantines in 1261, the seat of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople had been since 1314 at [[Chalcis|Negroponte]], which still remained in [[Triarchy of Negroponte|Latin hands]].{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|p=226}} Soon after his investment, Paul stopped in [[Ancona]] on his way to Greece. He remained in the city for several weeks, fêted by the locals, and presented them with purported [[relic]]s: on 4 March 1380 the head of [[James the Just]], followed on 17 April by the foot of [[Saint Anne]] and a nail from the [[True Cross]]. As Nicol comments, "one may be tempted to question the authenticity, and still more the provenance, of his donation". The documents of grant, preserved in the cathedral of Ancona, are signed by Paul and a certain "Alexios Palaiologos the [[Despot (court title)|Despot]]", allegedly a son of the Byzantine emperor but in reality, according to Nicol, probably "another figment of Paul's fertile imagination".{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=294–295}}{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|pp=228–229, 238–239, 243–250}}

From 1380 until 1384, Paul remained at his see in Negroponte. A relative of his, George Tagaris—probably a different person than Manuel Tagaris' son{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}}—was called in to help with the administration of the patriarchal domains. His tenure was troubled, as the local Orthodox clergy appealed to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] authorities for protection against his exactions, while the [[Latin Archbishop of Athens]], [[Antonio Ballester]], complained of the Patriarch's interference in his diocese. Furthermore, his lease of some of the Church lands in 1383 to a Venetian from [[Crete]], Giacomo Grimani, proved a source of protracted legal trouble since Grimani, in the words of the French medievalist [[Raymond-Joseph Loenertz]], "revealed himself as much a scoundrel as the Patriarch".{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=295}}{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|pp=229, 239–240, 250–256}} In 1384, Paul was once again denounced as an impostor to the Pope, possibly by Ballester, who was named [[vicar-general]] of the Patriarchate in the same year, and who had held the same office during the 1378–1379 vacancy.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=295}}{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|pp=229, 231}} Paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation, and resumed his wanderings. In 1385, he was in [[Cyprus]], where he crowned [[James I of Cyprus|James of Lusignan]] as [[King of Cyprus]] in exchange for 30,000 gold coins, and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on the island as if he were still patriarch.{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}}{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=295–296}}

[[File:Pape avignon clement7.jpg|thumb|left|Avignon anti-pope Clement VII (modern painting by [[Calixte Serrur]])]]
In 1388 he returned to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, [[Pope Boniface IX|Boniface IX]].{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=296}} Leaving Rome, Paul went to the court of [[Amadeus VII of Savoy]]. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress [[Anna of Savoy]], Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=296}}

Paul received a magnificent welcome at Avignon, where he was fêted by Clement VII and his cardinals. Clement, moved by his guest's tales of suffering at the hands of the Roman popes, loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to Paris. There, King [[Charles VI of France]] likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest. Paul was an exotic and popular sight in the French capital, and was lavishly hosted and entertained. He obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there, "safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered", according to Nicol. For further safety, he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=297}} On his visit to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, he claimed that there were several relics of the [[Denis|abbey's patron saint]]—commonly confused with the Athenian saint [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] at the time—to be found back in Greece, and promised to help the monks bring them to France. His proposal was enthusiastically taken up, and two monks received permission and funds from the king to accompany Paul back to Greece. When the party arrived in the port in Italy from which they would sail for Greece, however, Paul bribed the captain of the ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure. In the same night, he and his servants set sail with their entire baggage, leaving the two monks behind. It was only in Rome, where the monks went in search of answers for Paul's behaviour, that they learned the true identity of their travelling companion. From them the chronicler of the abbey later received his information.{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=297–298}}

== Return to Constantinople ==
According to Nicol, the achievement of the "accomplished sinner" Paul was without parallel: "No-one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides, first in the [[Schism of 1054|schism]] between the Greek and Latin Churches, and then in the [[Western Schism|schism]] between the pope in Rome and the pope in Avignon. It is no mean feat to arrive in Rome as Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem and then to be received in Avignon as Catholic patriarch of Constantinople."{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=289–290}}

Now, though, having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul was left with no option other than to return to Constantinople. In 1394, he was back in the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople|Antony IV]], before whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, "Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic".{{sfn|Nicol|1970|p=298}} The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing the verdict, is missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so it is likely that he was forgiven. His subsequent life is unknown.{{sfn|Talbot|1991|p=2006}}{{sfn|PLP|loc=27401. Τάγαρις, Παῦλος Παλαιολόγος}}{{sfn|Nicol|1970|pp=298–299}}

'''Peace Tree Day''' is an annual [[festival]] for children and families of every [[culture]] and [[faith]] to share and celebrate [[peace]] and [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] together. It was founded by [[educator]]/[[filmmaker]] [[Mitra Sen]], the [[Film producer|producer]]/[[Film director|director]] of the award-winning film ''[[The Peace Tree]]''.  

==History==
In 2004, Mitra Sen, the founder of Peace Tree Day, produced and directed the film ''The Peace Tree'', which shares the story of two little girls, one [[Muslim]] and one [[Christian]], who dream of celebrating each other's festivals, [[Christmas]] and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]. While working on the film, she came up with the concept of a Peace Tree that has the [[symbols]] of all our cultures and faiths on one tree to reflect the beauty of "diversity in unity".  She also realized that it was important to create an inclusive festival that celebrates all cultures and faiths together as most of the festivals have their roots in only one [[religion]] and not all.

==Proclamation==
In 2006, Mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] proclaimed June 1 as Peace Tree Day in the city of [[Toronto]].  The city of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], [[Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario|Whitchurch-Stouffville]], [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region]], [[York Region District School Board]], [[York Catholic District School Board]] and [[York Regional Police]] have all proclaimed Peace Tree Day and have organized celebrations for June 1, 2007. Children in schools in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], the [[Bahamas]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Australia]] are creating Peace Trees that highlight symbols from all our cultures and faiths on one tree.

==Peace Tree Day Celebration 2006==
On June 1, 2006, 300 school children and educators from over 40 schools across Southern Ontario, from [[Niagara Regional Municipality, Ontario|Niagara]] to [[Durham Regional Municipality, Ontario|Durham]], flocked to [[Nathan Phillip’s Square]] in downtown Toronto, celebrated the world's first Peace Tree Day celebration, proclaimed by Mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] in the City of Toronto. Crafted by their own hands, each child created a symbol of cultural or religious significance, and as an act of fellowship and [[harmony]], placed it upon the Peace Tree. Each participant, given the title of [[Peace Tree Ambassador]], was encouraged to teach their family, friends, and entire communities the value of the Peace Tree project and Peace Tree Day. Peace Tree Day celebrations included workshops presented by children and seniors that shared [[literature]], [[music]], [[art]], [[dance]], and [[food]] from around the world.

List of workshops during the Peace Tree Day celebration 2006:
*Storytelling ([[Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes]])
*Paper Cranes for Peace
*African Drumming Village
*Bharatnatyam Dance Place
*[[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi]] Centre
*Aboriginal Peace Art
*[[Yoga]] Corner
*Peace Tree Day Card Corner
*Sushi Bar
*Tabla Beats
*Peace Tree Place
*[[Dreidel|Spin the Dreidel]]
*[[Mehndi]]
*Peace Planet
*Chinese [[paper lantern|Lantern]]

==Peace Tree Day Celebration 2007==
Celebrations were held in [[parks]], [[schools]], [[hospitals]], [[Camping|camps]], and [[organizations]] across York Region, Windsor, [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Toronto]] and [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] this year. Children in schools and [[film festivals]] around the world have started creating Peace Trees after viewing the film. In Toronto, students have also started Peace Tree Clubs, Peace Tree Centres and the Peace Tree Ambassadors’ Network has connected children around the world who have started the Peace Tree movement in their schools.  

===Peace Tree Garden===
In the year 2007, during the celebration of Peace Tree Day, the Police Services and sponsors unveiled the plans for the world’s first '''Peace Tree Garden'''.  The Peace Tree Garden, located in [[Bruce’s Mill]] in York Region in Ontario, will incorporate plants from diverse cultures, include a medicine wheel around the Peace Tree and share peace quotes by human rights leaders like [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mother Teresa]] and many others. The Peace Tree, located in the center of the garden, highlights the symbols of every culture and faith to celebrate the beauty of "diversity in unity."

===Peace Tree Stand===
In June 2007, a group of preschool and kindergarten children worked together to create the first Peace Tree Stand and raised $5,000 worth of medical supplies for [[Free the Children]], the charitable organization founded by [[Craig Kielburger]].  The Peace Tree Stand, created in celebration of Peace Tree Day, featured drinks and treats from around the world along with [[workshops]] reflecting diversity and peace. Drinks included [[Sharbat Alabalou]] from [[Iran]] and [[Mugi cha]] from [[Japan]], [[Jeera Pani]] from [[India]], and sweet treats from different parts of [[Asia]]. The workshops featured children drawing [[mehndi]] peace symbols, making [[origami]] [[paper crane]]s, drumming workshops and sharing books about peace.  The little toddlers tried their hand at creating new rhythms on the tabla and African drums blending beats and creating new rhythms.

==Peace Trees around the world==
To date, the Peace Tree has begun to grow in India, Canada, USA, Pakistan, Australia, [[China]], [[South Africa]], England, [[Germany]], Ireland, [[Dubai]], and in the Bahamas.

==Peace Tree Ambassadors==
Peace Tree Ambassadors are young people (mostly children) who are really inspired by the idea of the Peace Tree and Peace Tree Day, who are trying to spread peace around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4999">The '''PHS Philadelphia Flower Show''' is an annual event produced by The [[Pennsylvania Horticultural Society]] (PHS) and held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], at the [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]] in early March. It is the "largest indoor flower show in the world,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://phsonline.org/about About PHS]&lt;/ref&gt; attracting more than 250,000 people annually.
The show features large scale gardens, which range from elaborate landscaped displays to individual and club entries of a prize horticultural specimen. Each year there is an official theme which serves as the inspiration for most exhibits. The exhibits are submitted for judging in many categories, and are highly competitive.

The amateur division of the show known as the Competitive Classes often have an assigned theme, related to the overall show theme.  The 2007 Show, Legends of Ireland, featured Pressed Plant Material (i.e. dried flower pictures) that "incorporated a [[Celtic Knot]]."  The first weekend's Medium Niche theme was ''Wish You Were Here'' "Exhibitors will be sent Irish postcards for inspiration.  A copy of the postcard will be mounted next to the exhibit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theflowershow.com/attractions/exguide.html How to Enter Competitive Classes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225112235/http://www.theflowershow.com/attractions/exguide.html |date=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrants for that class typically have a mockup of the niche at home, where they practice assembling and lighting their entry in the months preceding the show.  In a ''Challenge'' class, entrants bring only pruning shears, and must use show-provided materials to interpret a theme within a limited amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theflowershow.com/attractions/amateurentries.html Individual &amp; Club Entries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307130647/http://theflowershow.com/attractions/amateurentries.html |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three typical ''Horticulture'' classes are 142: ''Clivia, flowering. Pot 8" or under'', 143: ''Clivia, flowering. Pot 8"-10"'', and 144: ''Clivia, foliage''.  (There was also a Clivia entered in 2007 under ''Exceptional plants 10–20 years old, to be judged against “perfection” for their species/cultivar.'')

A popular part of the show floor is the Garden marketplace where visitors can buy plants and seeds, cut flowers, craft items, and other flower, landscaping and horticulture-related items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theflowershow.com/attractions/vendors.html Marketplace Vendors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304190237/http://www.theflowershow.com/attractions/vendors.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Show boasts fabulous floral and garden design, live entertainment, culinary events and extraordinary gardening how-to workshops and lectures by experts.

==History==
The [[Pennsylvania Horticultural Society]] was founded in 1827.  The nation's first flower show was held in Philadelphia in 1829, and showcased many exotic and native plants. The flower show moved to the now-demolished [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] in 1966, where it remained each year until 1996, when it moved to its present location at the [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]]. Today, PHS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennsylvaniahorticulturalsociety.org/aboutus/pfs_history.html History of the Philadelphia Flower Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101223557/http://www.pennsylvaniahorticulturalsociety.org/aboutus/pfs_history.html |date=2005-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to the local economy and the green life of Philadelphia and the region. Proceeds from the Flower Show support thousands of revitalization projects in communities. In recent years, a youth division was added to the pressed flower category, with the most recent winner being Kendall Wolson, a 17-year-old student from New Jersey who created a scene depicting two bears catching fish in a river.

'''''Sol Phryne''''' was a [[ferry]] of Sol Maritime Services Ltd. She was bought by the [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] and sunk on 16 February 1988.

''Sol Phryne'' was built in Japan in 1947 as '''''Taisetsu Maru'''''.

From 1967 to 1974, she was owned by [[Efthymiades Line]] and used for regular ferry duties between [[Greek islands]] as '''''Eolis'''''. In 1974, she was purchased by Sol Maritime Services Ltd., renamed ''Sol Phryne'' and was then used in the Middle East, notably evacuating Palestinian guerrillas from [[Beirut]] in 1982. She was sunk during an attempt to ferry Palestinian deportees to [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].

== Voyage ==
The 6,151-ton ''Sol Phryne'' was purchased in some secrecy by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and renamed ''Al Awda'' ("the Return"). The PLO planned to symbolically ferry 135 Palestinian deportees and, if they accepted the short notice invitation, hundreds of journalists and other observers, to the Israeli port city of [[Haifa]] for a "journey of return", echoing the 1947 journey of {{SS|Exodus}}.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966806-3,00.html |title=Middle East Land for Peace? |work=Time |date=29 February 1988 |last=Doerner |first=William R. |accessdate=24 April 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D81138F935A25751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Blast Disables P.L.O.'s 'Exodus' Ferry in Port |work=New York Times |date=16 February 1988 |last=Cowell |first=Alan |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Defence Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] stated that Israel would oppose the voyage "in whatever ways we find,"&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; while Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] labeled the journey "a declaration of war".&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1031F93BA25751C0A96E948260 P.L.O. "Scuttles ship plans"], ''New York Times'', 18 February 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, chartered ship had been scheduled to sail from [[Piraeus]] on 9 February, but the departure was postponed several times because Greek ship owners feared commercial retaliations from Israel if their vessel was used.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; With this difficulty chartering a ship, on 13 February 1988 the PLO purchased the aging ''Sol Phryne'' in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]] at auction for $600,000. By the time of the sinking the crew of the ship had not been informed of the new owners.

On 15 February, three high-ranking military officials of the PLO were assassinated in Limassol by a remote-controlled bomb planted on their car.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC103FF934A25751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= P.L.O.

Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, p. 24.{{ISBN|0283997109}}&lt;/ref&gt; attached to the hull exploded and holed a fuel tank of the ''Sol Phryne'', flooding it and causing the ship to list.

Verified 28 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but this ended the attempt.  Yassar Arafat alleged that this was done by Israeli frogmen but did not provide any evidence to support his claim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1988_523261/day-of-rage-ends-in-relative-calm-as-palestinians.html `Day of rage' ends in relative calm as Palestinians strike] by Michael Ross and Charles P. Wallace. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 17 February 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sol Phryne'' was raised and transferred to [[Bijela, Herceg Novi|Bijela]], in [[Yugoslavia]].
As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported, "Israel officially denied complicity in the car bombing but hardly bothered to conceal its role in disabling the ferry"&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; and suspicions of Israeli involvement were further reinforced when Israeli Transport Minister [[Chaim Corfu]] threatened that, if a further attempt was made by the PLO, "its fate will be the same".&lt;ref name="NYT3" /&gt; Fuad al-Bitar, Athens representative of the PLO told an Athens news conference that "it is clear that the only one interested" in the sabotage was Israel.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; In July 2008, [[Haaretz]] referred to this attack, without admitting Israeli responsibility, in the context of the threatened&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1012171.html Israel may use force to halt boat trying to break Gaza siege] ''Haaretz'' 17 August 2008.

Three claims of responsibility were made,&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt; two of them being:
* an anonymous caller, claiming to be from the Palestine Salvation Front because "rejected many times [[Yasir Arafat]]'s idea to arrange this propaganda trip" - denied by Abdul Hadi al-Nahhad for the Damascus-based group and by the PLO.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;
* a telephone call received by the [[Associated Press]] claimed the attack for the [[Jewish Defence League]]&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;

{{italic title}}

'''''The Ducktators''''' is a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' black and white cartoon that was produced by [[Leon Schlesinger Productions]] and was released in 1942 by [[Warner Bros.]]. Directed by [[Norman McCabe]], the cartoon satirizes various events of [[World War II]]. The title is a pun on ''[[dictator]]''.

==Story==
The cartoon takes place on a [[farm]], beginning with a few [[ducks]], [[geese]] and [[chickens]] being shown. After a brief few moments, two ducks (who are expecting a duckling) go over to their unusually black-colored egg as it starts to hatch. Once the egg has hatched, a duckling with an [[Adolf Hitler]] appearance emerges and yells "[[Sieg Heil]]!" while giving the [[Nazi salute]].

After time passes, the Hitler duck grows into adulthood, holding aggressive speeches toward other ducks and geese. One goose, representing [[Benito Mussolini]], agrees with him and gives the Nazi salute. Afterward, a postcard from The Management of the Theatre that says "We wish to apologize to the NICE DUCKS and GEESE who may be in the audience" is shown. The Hitler duck then gathers up a group of soldiers to join him in his own [[Axis Powers]] [[Army]], including a [[Daffy Duck]]-like character, who claims to be from South Germany. The Mussolini goose then delivers a speech to the only listener: a little chick who had been forced to stay and applaud. After these happenings, storm troopers are sent marching across the area, while the [[Doves as symbols|Dove of Peace]] (possibly representing [[Franklin Roosevelt]]), grieves at what is happening ("Have they forgot? 'Tis love that's right, and naught is gained by show of might.").

A group of chickens and the Mussolini goose are then seen at what appears to be a [[Peace Conference]], in which the Hitler duck slaps the Mussolini goose for dim-wittedly taking part in it and puts the newly signed [[peace treaty]] through a [[Paper shredder|shredder]], whereupon everyone in the Peace Conference area brawl against each other.

Another duck with large teeth and round glasses holding the flag of the [[Empire of Japan]], representing [[Hideki Tojo]], is seen swimming across the water and placing the flag (with the words "[[South Pacific Mandate|Japanese Mandate Island]]" written on the back of the flag) on a tiny island that turns out to be a [[turtle]], who emerges from the water and chases the duck, beating him with the "Japanese Mandate Island" sign as he is now on the warpath against Tojo. The Japanese duck tries to get out of being beaten by flashing a badge that reads, "I Am [[Chinese people|Chinese]]," but to no avail. "And I'm [[mock turtle soup]]!" shouts the infuriated turtle sarcastically. A subtitle below the badge states that it was made in Japan, which may explain why the turtle did not buy the ruse.

The three (Hitler Duck, Mussolini Goose and Tojo Duck) are then seen marching across a field while singing a parody of "[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]" ("One two, button my shoe. Three four, shut honorable door"), they're joined by a newly born duckling straight from an egg, who has a soft [[Spanish people|Spanish]] accent, alluding to the supposed fourth wheel of the Nazi empire: [[Francoist Spain|Spanish dictator]] [[Francisco Franco]].

The Dove then tries to reason with the Axis Powers. However, they ignore him and trample him. His temper reaching breaking point, the Dove yells at the Axis Powers to "STOP!!". The Dove proceeds to [[combat]] against the Tojo duck who is rubbing his hands in a sinister way, the Hitler duck and the Mussolini goose, as well as their storm troopers. With the help of a group of chickens, the baby chick who had been forced to cheer for the Mussolini goose earlier after being captured (how he was rescued is not explained), a crazy rabbit with a mustache (impersonating [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and possibly representing [[Joseph Stalin]]) wielding a large wooden hammer for a weapon and hiding in a barrel which he also uses for transportation and a human man carrying a sniper rifle that emerges from a poster that says "For Victory, Buy United States [[Victory Bond]]s" and fires at the fleeing axis powers, the Dove overthrows the Axis Powers and saves the day.

Years later, the Dove, now a brave war hero, has two children (one named "Peace", the other named "Quiet"). The Dove explains to his children that even though he hates war, he chose to be brave and stand up against the Axis Powers. The Dove then points out to his children that his enemies (the Hitler and Tojo ducks and the Mussolini goose) are now [[moose]]-head [[Hunting trophy|trophies]] above his [[fireplace]] in beaten up appearances.

The final message of the cartoon [[Fourth wall|states to the U.S. audience]] that if they wish to defeat the Axis Powers and bring peace to the world once again, all they have to do to ensure the country's victory is to buy [[United States Treasury security|United States Savings Bonds]] and [[Revenue stamp|Stamps]].

==Political references==
The first duckling to hatch from the egg had a mustache and a [[Nazi]] emblem throughout the cartoon, indicating that the duck symbolized [[Adolf Hitler]]. The goose who helped the duck had an open [[Italian language|Italian]] accent, and the chick at the end of one of his speeches could be heard yelling "[[Duce]]!" multiple times, indicating that this goose is Benito Mussolini. The other duck was using the flag of the Empire of Japan, and openly singing'' "[[The Japanese Sandman]]"''. He is presumably intended to be [[Hideki Tojo]], judging by the military hat he is wearing. The black duck may be a reference to [[Erwin_Rommel|Rommel]] as he was also from South Germany and spoke with an [[Swabian_German|accent]], but can also relate to how African Americans were a huge demographic in the [[Southeast United States|Southern United States]] at the time.

==Changes in Sunset Productions version==
The ending where the dove is sitting with his kids and points out that his enemies have been defeated (and are now moose-heads above the fireplace), followed by a notice to buy war bonds, has been rarely seen since the short was sold to [[Sunset Productions]] in the 1950s and syndicated through them (as Guild Films). As the cartoon is in the public domain, this edited version has frequently been found on VHS and DVD home video collections. However, on the [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6]] DVD set and the World War II cartoons special on the Cartoon Network show ''ToonHeads'', the full ending is shown uncut and uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/d/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505014827/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/d/ |archivedate=2016-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
Due to the short's World War II stereotypes, it has rarely been shown on American television, except for [[Cartoon Network]] as part of its anthology television show, ''[[ToonHeads]]''. ''The Ducktators'' is available uncut on ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6]]'', Disc 2.

'''Wartime sexual violence''' is [[rape]] or other forms of [[sexual violence]] committed by [[combatant]]s during [[armed conflict]], war, or [[military occupation]] often as [[War looting|spoils of war]]; but sometimes, particularly in [[ethnic conflict]], the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include [[gang rape]] and rape with objects. It is distinguished from [[Sexual harassment in the military|sexual harassment]], [[Military sexual trauma|sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconservativeblog.co.uk/?p=2382 "30% of Women in USA Military Raped Whilst Serving by Fellow Soldiers"]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 |title=The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers|publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/|title=Why Soldiers Rape – Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military |journal=In These Times |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power.

During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of [[psychological warfare]] in order to [[Demoralization (warfare)|humiliate]] the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific [[battle]]s or [[massacre]]s, and individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.

Rape can also be [[genocidal rape|recognized]] as [[genocide]] or [[ethnic cleansing]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group; however, rape remains widespread in conflict zones. There are other international legal instruments to prosecute perpetrators but this has occurred as late as the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/702/art%253A10.1007%252Fs12142-010-0163-x.pdf?auth66=1424563295_b4649e7e2308a9f1ccdbb20e63977441&amp;ext=.pdf Mobilizing the Will to Prosecute: Crimes of Rape at the Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunal]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for ''international'' conflicts, thus putting the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.

==Definition of rape==
{{main article|Rape}}
The terms ''rape'', ''[[sexual assault]]'' and ''[[sexual violence]]'' are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=nobelwomen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/war-on-women-web.pdf|title=War on Women – Time for action to end sexual violence in conflict|work=Nobel Women's initiative|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no universally accepted definition of "war rape". The Explanatory Note of the [[Rome Statute]], which binds the [[International Criminal Court]], defines rape as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body."&lt;ref name=ICCelements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/basicdocuments/elements%28e%29.html |title=Elements of Crimes |accessdate=2017-05-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201233451/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/basicdocuments/elements%28e%29.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df= }}. PDF: {{PDFWayback |date=20071029095823 |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Element_of_Crimes_English.pdf }}. [[International Criminal Court]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or [[abuse of power]], against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of giving genuine consent.&lt;ref name=ICCelements/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.&lt;ref name="viol-tactique-de-guerre"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viol-tactique-de-guerre.org/documents/IMG/pdf/advocacy_paper.pdf |format=PDF |last=Minzoni – Deroche |first=Angela |title=Rape as a tactic of war – Advocacy Paper |publisher=Caritas France |date=November 2005 }}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Lawlessness during wars and civil conflicts can create a culture of impunity towards human rights abuses of civilians. Among some armies, [[looting]] of civilian areas is considered a way for soldiers to supplement their often meager income, which can be unstable if soldiers are not paid on time. Some militias that cannot afford to adequately pay their troops promote pillaging as a compensation for victory, and rape of civilians can be seen as a reward for winning battles.&lt;ref name="nobelwomen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23086003"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brown C| title=Rape as a weapon of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. | journal=Torture | year= 2012 | volume= 22 | issue= 1 | pages= 24–37 | doi= | pmc= | pmid=23086003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[UNICEF]], "systematic rape is often used as a weapon of war in [[ethnic cleansing]]," having been used in various armed conflicts throughout the twentieth century alone, including [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Uganda]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/sowc96pk/sexviol.htm|title=Sexual violence as a weapon of war|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United Nations Security Council]] argued that "women and girls are particularly targeted by the use of sexual violence, including as a tactic of war to humiliate, dominate, instil fear in, disperse and/or forcibly relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx|title=Rape: Weapon of war|publisher=OHCHR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dara Kay Cohen]] argues that some militia groups use [[gang rape]] to bond soldiers and create a sense of cohesion within units, particularly when troops are recruited by force.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D.K. (2011). "Causes of Sexual Violence During Civil War: Cross-National Evidence (1980-2009) Prepared for the Minnesota International Relations Colloquium, March 28, 2011."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] argues that in modern conflicts rape is used deliberately as a military strategy.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/4078677.stm| last = Smith-Spark | first = Laura | title = How did rape become a weapon of war?|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-07-28 | date=8 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International describes war rape as a "weapon of war" or a "means of combat"&lt;ref name="viol-tactique-de-guerre" /&gt; used for the purpose of conquering territory by expelling the population therefrom, decimating remaining civilians by destroying their links of affiliations, by the spread of AIDS, and by eliminating cultural and religious traditions. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] characterizes "group rape perpetrated by the conquerors" as "a metonymic celebration of territorial acquisition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spivak |first=Gayatri Chakravorty |authorlink=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak |title=A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-17764-2 |page=300 |quote=The group rape perpetrated by the conquerors is a metonymic celebration of territorial acquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence provided by Cohen also suggests that some militaries that use [[child soldier]]s use rape as a maturation ritual to increase the tolerance of troops for violence, especially in [[Patriarchy|patriarchal societies]] that equate masculinity with dominance and control. Some [[refugee]]s and [[internally displaced people]] experience human trafficking for sexual or labour exploitation due to the breakdown of economies and policing in conflict regions.[[Wartime sexual violence#cite note-10|[10]]] In some conflicts, rape is used as a means of extracting information to force women and girls to give up the location of arms caches. In discussing gang rape as a means of bonding among soldiers, Cohen discusses the viewpoint of "[[combatant socialization]]", in which military groups use gang rape as a socialization tactic during armed conflict. By using gang rape during armed conflict, militia group members:
# Prompt feelings of power and achievement
# Establish status and a reputation for aggressiveness
# Create an enhanced feeling of masculinity through bonding and bragging
# Demonstrate dedication to the group and a willingness to take risks
While war rape may not be an apparent tool or weapon of war, it does serve as a primary tool to create a cohesive military group.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D.K. (2011). "Causes of Sexual Violence During Civil War: Cross-National Evidence (1980-2009) Prepared for the Minnesota International Relations Colloquium, March 28, 2011."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
[[Susan Brownmiller]] was the first historian to attempt an overview of rape in war with documentation and theory.&lt;ref name=Google.books /&gt; Brownmiller's thesis is that "War provides men with the perfect psychological backdrop to give vent to their contempt for women. The maleness of the military—the brute power of weaponry exclusive to their hands, the spiritual bonding of men at arms, the manly discipline of orders given and orders obeyed, the simple logic of the hierarchical command—confirms for men what they long suspect—that women are peripheral to the world that counts." She writes that rape accompanies territorial advance by the winning side in land conflicts as one of the spoils of war, and that "Men who rape are ordinary Joes, made unordinary by entry into the most exclusive male-only club in the world."

[[Kelly Dawn Askin]] observes that increasingly, the victims of war are [[civilian]]s. An estimated 45 million plus civilians died during [[World War II]]. Male and female civilians may be subject to [[torture]], but many studies show that war rape is more frequently perpetrated on women than men.&lt;ref name="Askin_12_13"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Dorothy Q.|last2=Reagan |first2=E. Ralph |title=Rape in War: Challenging the Tradition of Impunity |publisher=SAIS Review, Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1994 |url=https://www.hrw.org/women/docs/rapeinwar.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306161448/http://www.hrw.org/women/docs/rapeinwar.htm |archivedate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the reluctance of men to come forward with accusations of being raped, and also an institutional bias amongst NGOs, who frequently focus resources on female victims.&lt;ref name=Storr/&gt; However rape against women is also underreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Violence Against Women: Global Scope and Magnitude|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11410834|journal = The Lancet|volume = 359|issue = 9313|pages = 1232–1237|access-date = 2016-02-10|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1|pmid = 11955557|year = 2002|last1 = Watts|first1 = Charlotte|last2 = Zimmerman|first2 = Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators of sexual violence against women and children "commonly include not only enemy civilians and troops but also allied and national civilians and even comrades in arms."&lt;ref name="Askin_12_13"/&gt;

The victims of war rape are usually "civilians", a category first recognized in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Askin_26_27"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although war rape of women is documented throughout history, laws protecting civilians in armed conflict have tended not to recognize sexual assault on women. Even when laws of war have recognized and forbidden sexual assault, few prosecutions have been brought. According to Kelly Dawn Askin, the laws of war perpetuated the attitude that sexual assaults against women are less significant crimes, not worthy of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; War rape has until recently been a hidden element of war, which according to [[Human Rights Watch]] is linked to the largely gender-specific character of war rape – abuse committed by men against women. This gender-specific character has contributed to war rape being "narrowly portrayed as sexual or personal in nature, a portrayal that depoliticizes sexual abuse in conflict and results in its being ignored as a [[war crime]]."&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;

"To the victor go the spoils" has been a war cry for centuries, and women classed as part of the spoils of war.&lt;ref name="Askin_10_21"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=10–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, war rape has been downplayed as an unfortunate but inevitable side effect of sending men to war.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; Also, war rape has in the past been regarded as a tangible reward to soldiers (who were paid irregularly), and as a soldier's proof of masculinity and success.&lt;ref name="Askin_27"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to war rape in ancient times, Harold Washington argues that warfare itself is imaged as rape, and that the cities attacked are its victims. He argues that war rape occurs in the context of stereotypes about women and men, which are part of the basic belief that violent power belongs to men, and that women are its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levinson |first=Bernard M |title= Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2rZnXQwPX8gC&amp;dq=rape+in+warfare+ancient |page= 20 |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-567-08098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape of men===
The [[Male rape|rape of men]] by other men is also common in war. A 2009 study by Lara Stemple&lt;ref name=Stemple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stemple |first=Lara |title=Male Rape and Human Rights |journal=[[Hastings Law Journal]] |date=February 2009 |volume=60 |issue=3 |page=605 |url=http://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol60/Stemple_60-HLJ-605.pdf |accessdate=2011-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602095417/https://www.uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol60/Stemple_60-HLJ-605.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that it had been documented in conflicts worldwide; for example, 76% of male political prisoners in 1980s [[El Salvador]] and 80% of concentration camp inmates in [[Sarajevo]] reported being raped or sexually tortured. Stemple concludes that the "lack of attention to sexual abuse of men during conflict is particularly troubling given the widespread reach of the problem".&lt;ref name=Storr&gt;{{cite news|last=Storr|first=Will|title=The rape of men|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|accessdate=2011-07-17|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stemple, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; Mervyn Christian of Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that male rape is commonly underreported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2011/10/mil-111013-irin01.htm "Rape as a 'weapon of war' against men."] ''IRIN'', 13 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 2010, 30% of women and 22% of men from the eastern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] reported that they had been subject to conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref name=Storr/&gt;  Despite the popular perception that rape during conflict is primarily targeted against women, these figures show that sexual violence committed against men is not a marginal occurrence. The lack of awareness for the magnitude of the rape of men during conflict relates to chronic underreporting. Although the physical and psychological repercussions from rape are similar for women and men, male victims tend to demonstrate an even greater reluctance to report their suffering to their families or the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/93960/health-rape-as-a-weapon-of-war-against-men |title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; HEALTH: Rape as a "weapon of war" against men &amp;#124; DRC &amp;#124; South Sudan &amp;#124; Children &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; Health &amp; Nutrition &amp;#124; Human Rights |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Both perpetrator and victim enter a conspiracy of silence and why male survivors often find, once their story is discovered, that they lose the support and comfort of those around them. In the patriarchal societies found in many developing countries, gender roles are strictly defined. […] Often, […] wives who discover their husbands have been raped decide to leave them. They ask me: 'So now how am I going to live with him? As what? Is this still a husband? Is it a wife?' They ask, 'If he can be raped, who is protecting me?'".&lt;ref name=Storr/&gt;

Gender roles within social hierarchies are concerned with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in conventional sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, [[Uganda]]n male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grace Natabaalo |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/04/2013411111517944475.html |title=Male rape survivors fight stigma in Uganda – Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[LGBT rights in Uganda|homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda]], male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is denied.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History of laws against sexual assault during war ==
{{Main article|Laws of war}}
Prosecution of rapists in [[War crimes trials|war crime tribunals]] is a recent development. However, the lack of explicit recognition of war rape in international law or applicable humanitarian law may not be used as a defense by the perpetrator of war rape.&lt;ref name="Askin_17"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws and customs of war prohibit offenses such as "inhuman treatment" or "indecent assaults", adding to this domestic military codes and domestic civil codes (national law) may make sexual assault a crime.

More recent [[humanitarian law]] concerns the maltreatment of civilians and "any devastation not justified by military necessity".&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-modern European era===
{{See also|International humanitarian law}}
One of the first references to the "laws of war", or "traditions of war" was by [[Cicero]], who urged soldiers to observe the rules of war, since obeying the regulations separated the "men" from the "brutes". Conquering the riches and property of an enemy was regarded as legitimate reason for war in itself. Women were included with "property", since they were considered under the lawful ownership of a man, whether a father, husband, slave master, or guardian. In this context, the rape of a woman was considered a property crime committed against the man who owned the woman.&lt;ref name="Askin_10_21"/&gt;

The ancient Greeks considered war rape of women "socially acceptable behavior well within the rules of warfare", and warriors considered the conquered women "legitimate booty, useful as wives, [[concubine]]s, slave labor, or battle-camp [[trophy]]".&lt;ref name="Askin_10_21"/&gt;

In the Middle Ages, and until the 19th century, this attitude and practice prevailed, and the legal protection of women in war time related indirectly to the legal protection women were granted in peace times. In medieval Europe, women were considered as an inferior gender by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church sought to prevent rape during feudal warfare through the institution of [[Peace and Truce of God]] which discouraged soldiers from attacking women and civilians in general and through the propagation of a Christianized version of [[chivalry]] ideal of a knight who protected innocents and did not engage in lawlessness.

According to [[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Fadl]], Medieval [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] laid down severe penalties for those who committed rape.&lt;ref name = Fadl/&gt; The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator.&lt;ref name = Fadl&gt;[[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Abou El Fadl, Khaled]] (2001). ''[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/22/local/me-36804 Commentary: Terrorism Is at Odds With Islamic Tradition]''. [[LA Times]]. Retrieved 11 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1159, [[John of Salisbury]] wrote ''[[Policraticus]]'' in an attempt to regulate the conduct of armies engaged in "justifiable" wars. Salisbury believed that acts of theft and "rapine" (property crimes) should receive the most severe punishment, but also believed that obeying a superior's commands whether legal or illegal, moral or immoral, was the ultimate duty of the soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th and 16th century, despite considerations and systematization of the laws of war, women remained objects available to the conquering male in any way whatsoever. The influential writer [[Francisco de Vitoria]] stood for a gradual emergence of the notion that glory or conquest were not necessarily acceptable reasons to start a war. The jurist [[Alberico Gentili]] insisted that all women, including female combatants, should be spared from sexual assault in wartime. However, in practice war rape was common.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

It is suggested that one reason for the prevalence of war rape was that at the time, military circles supported the notion that all persons, including women and children, were still the enemy, with the belligerent having conquering rights over them.&lt;ref name="Askin_26_27"/&gt; In the late Middle Ages, the laws of war even considered war rape as an indication of a man's success in the battlefield and "opportunities to rape and loot were among the few advantages open to... soldiers, who were paid with great irregularity by their leaders....triumph over women by rape became a way to measure victory, part of a soldier's proof of masculinity and success, a tangible reward for services rendered....an actual reward of war".&lt;ref name="Askin_27"/&gt;

During this period in history, war rape took place not necessarily as a conscious effort of war to terrorize the enemy, but rather as earned compensation for winning a war. There is little evidence to suggest that superiors regularly ordered subordinates to commit acts of rape.&lt;ref name="Askin_28"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period of history war became more regulated, specific, and regimented. The first formal prosecution for war crimes did not take place until the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Askin_28"/&gt;

===Early modern European era===
[[Hugo Grotius]], considered the father of the law of nations and the first to conduct a comprehensive work on systematizing the international laws of war, concluded that rape "should not go unpunished in war any more than in peace". [[Emmerich van Vattel]] emerged as an influential figure when he pleaded for the immunity of civilians against the ravages of war, considering men and women civilians as non-combatants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century and 19th century, treaties and war codes started to include vague provisions for the protection of women: The Treaty of Amity and Commerce (1785) specified that in case of war "women and children....shall not be molested in their persons". Article 20 of the Order No. 20 (1847), a supplement to the US Rules and Articles of war, listed the following as severely punishable "Assassination, murder, malicious stabbing or maiming, rape". The Declaration of Brussels (1874) stated that the "honours and rights of the family....should be respected".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the treatment of soldiers, prisoners, the wounded, and civilians improved and core elements of the [[laws of war]] were put in place.{{By whom|date=December 2009}} However, while the customs of war mandated more humane treatment of soldiers and civilians, new weapons and advanced technology increased destruction and altered the methods of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lieber Code]] (1863) was the first codification of the international customary laws of land war and an important step towards humanitarian law. The Lieber Code emphasized protection of civilians and stated that "all rape...[is] prohibited under the penalty of death", which was the first prohibition of rape in customary humanitarian law.&lt;ref name="Askin_35_36"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, international legal procedures attempted to prevent and prosecute perpetrators of war rape. Similarly, individual states developed laws pertaining to war rape's victims and perpetrators.

Article 46 of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 regarding Land Warfare]] explicitly required that "[f]amily honour and rights [and] the lives of persons...must be respected" by the occupying powers.&lt;ref name="Askin_35_36"/&gt;

After [[World War I]], the [[Commission of Responsibilities]], set up in 1919 to examine the atrocities committed by the [[German Empire]] and the other [[Central Powers]] during the war, found substantial evidence of sexual violence and subsequently included rape and forced prostitution among the violations of the laws and customs of war. Efforts to prosecute failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
The [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials|Tokyo Tribunals]] became the first [[international court]]s of real significance. The victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] established them in 1945 and 1946 respectively to prosecute the major war criminals of the European [[Axis powers]] (in fact only Germans) and of Japan for [[crimes against peace]], [[war crimes]], and [[crimes against humanity]]. The possibility of prosecuting sexual violence as a war crime was present because of the recognition of war rape as serious violation of the laws of war in the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] assertion that "[f]amily honour and rights [and] the lives of persons...must be respected."

While the Nuremberg Tribunals failed to charge Nazi war criminals with rape, witnesses testified about it occurring. Previous war crimes trials had prosecuted for sex crimes, hence war rape could have been prosecuted under customary law and/or under the IMT (International Military Tribunals) Charter's Article 6(b): "abduction of the civilian population....into slavery and for other purposes" and "abduction unjustified by [[military necessity]]." Similarly, it would have been possible to prosecute war rape as crime against humanity under Article 6(c) of the [[Nuremberg Charter]]: "other inhumane acts" and "enslavement". However, notwithstanding evidence of sexual violence in Europe during World War II, a lack of will led to rape and sexual violence not being prosecuted at the Nuremberg Tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] did convict Japanese officers "of failing to prevent rape" in the [[Nanking Massacre]], which is known as the "Rape of Nanking".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/0628warcrimes-tribunal.html| last = Simons | first = Marlise | title = For first time, Court Defines Rape as War Crime| work =The New York Times |date=June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E3DD133AF936A35757C0A96E958260| last = Rosenberg | first = Tine | title = Editorial Observer; New punishment for an ancient war crime| work =The New York Times |date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal, in Tokyo, prosecuted cases of sexual violence and war rape as war crimes under the wording "inhumane treatment", "ill-treatment," and "failure to respect family honour and rights." According to the prosecution, in excess of 20,000 women and girls were raped during the first weeks of the Japanese occupation of the Chinese city of [[Nanking]]. The War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo included accounts of sexual violence crimes in the trial testimonies as well as public records.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_8"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, a commander of the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|14th Area Army]], [[General Yamashita]], was convicted for, inter alia, "rape under his command."&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_8"/&gt; Some 35 Dutch [[comfort women]] brought a successful case before the Batavia Military Tribunal in 1948.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_8"/&gt;

It is well-known that brutal mass rapes were committed against German women; both during and after World War II. According to some estimations over 100,000 women were raped by Soviet soldiers in Berlin during and after The Battle of Berlin.&lt;ref name="The rape of Berlin - BBC News"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title = The rape of Berlin – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32529679|journal = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-05|language = en-GB|date = May 2015|last1 = Ash|first1 = Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "from eight to 80" was used to describe potential victims of Soviet mass-rape. "Red Army soldiers don't believe in 'individual liaisons' with German women," wrote the playwright Zakhar Agranenko in his diary when serving as an officer of marine infantry in East Prussia. "Nine, ten, twelve men at a time – they rape them on a collective basis."&lt;ref name="The rape of Berlin - BBC News"/&gt; Rape was regarded by men in the Soviet army as a well-deserved form of punishment, whether the civilians had anything to do with the war or not. In total, historians estimate that over two million German women were raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Silence Broken On Red Army Rapes In Germany|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106687768|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1949 Geneva Conventions===
{{Main article|Geneva Conventions}}
[[Geneva Conventions#Common Article 3 relating to Non-International Armed Conflict|Common Article 3]] of the 1949 Geneva Conventions provides that "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture" and "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment" are prohibited under any circumstance whatsoever with respect to persons who are [[hors de combat]] or who are not taking part of direct hostilities in internal conflicts.

Article 27 of the 1949 [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution in international conflicts.

The prohibitions outlined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions were reinforced by the 1977 [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref name="Askin_17"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] ''[[Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict]]'', which went into effect in 1974, does not mention rape specifically.

====1998–2007====
In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] established by the United Nations made landmark decisions defining [[genocidal rape]] (rape intended to affect a population or culture as a whole) as a form of [[genocide]] under international law. In the trial of [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the mayor of Taba Commune in [[Rwanda]], the Trial Chamber held that "sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide."&lt;ref name=unreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English%5CAnnualReports%5Ca-54-315.pdf|date=19 October 1999|title=Fourth annual report of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Navanethem Pillay]], now the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a [[war crime]]. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war."&lt;ref name="paulwalters"&gt;[[Navanethem Pillay]] is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary doctorate of law, [[Rhodes University]], April 2005 [http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926231120/http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW2010%20Report_by%20chapter%28pdf%29/violence%20against%20women.pdf|date=3 September 2010|title=Violence against women|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Paul Walters in his April 2005 statement of support of her honorary [[doctorate of law]] at [[Rhodes University]] wrote:&lt;ref name=paulwalters/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under her presidency of the [[Rwanda Tribunal]], that body rendered a judgment against the mayor of Taba Commune which found him guilty of genocide for the use of rape in "the destruction of the spirit, of the will to live, and of life itself."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. The Trial Chamber held that rape (which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive") and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group, as such. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.&lt;ref name=unreport /&gt;

Rape first became recognized as [[crime against humanity]] when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants in 1993, based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognized that Muslim women in [[Foča]] (southeastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture and [[sexual enslavement]] by [[Bosnian Serb]] soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city (April 1992).&lt;ref name="haverford"&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html Rape as a Crime Against Humanity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127013306/http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/rape.html |date=27 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="haverford"/&gt; The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH Bosnia-Herzegovina : Foca verdict – rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907091105/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&amp;of=ENG-BIH |date=7 September 2009 }}. 22 February 2001. [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of [[Bosniac]] (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in Foča, eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently [[forced disappearance|disappeared]].&lt;ref name=AmnestyInt2001feb22/&gt; However, Justice Richard Goldstone, chief prosecutor at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], commented that "rape has never been the concern of the international community."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

United States law specifies that rape in wartime is punishable by death or imprisonment under Article 120 of the United States' [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] and Section d(g) of the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]]. However a total ban on abortion is a requirement of US humanitarian aid for war victims, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.&lt;ref name="awid.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |title=UN Security Council Takes a Historic Stand Supporting Abortion Access for Women Raped in War / Library / Homepage |publisher=AWID |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101025/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognizes rape, sexual slavery, [[enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation.

In September 1999, the United Nations published a ''"Report of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighboring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994"''. The report states that on 2 September 1998, Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judges Laïty Kama, Presiding, Lennart Aspegren and Navanethem Pillay, found Jean Paul Akayesu guilty of 9 of the 15 counts proffered against him, including genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and crimes against humanity, murder, torture, rape, and other inhumane acts. The Tribunal found Jean Paul Akayesu not guilty of the six remaining counts, including the count of complicity in genocide and the counts relating to violations of Common Article 3 to the [[Geneva Conventions]] and of Additional Protocol II thereto.&lt;ref name=unreport /&gt; On 2 October 1998, Jean Paul Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of the nine counts, the sentences to run concurrently. Both Jean Paul Akayesu and the Prosecutor have appealed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Chamber.&lt;ref name=unreport /&gt;

===United Nations actions on sexual violence in conflict ===
[[File:Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (14220829419).jpg|thumb|Some of the delegates to the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict held in 2014]]
In 2008, the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE HALT TO ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT ZONES, UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTING RESOLUTION 1820 (2008) |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/ Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict] (SRSG-SVC) was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]] (2009), one in a series of resolutions which recognized the detrimental impact that sexual violence in conflict has on communities, and acknowledged that this crime undermines efforts at peace and security and rebuilding once a conflict has ended.  The office serves as the United Nations’ spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence, and is the chair of the network UN Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict.

In April 2010, the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]] of Sweden, established the Office and served as the United Nations’ spokesperson and political advocate on this issue.  In September 2012, [[Zainab Bangura|Zainab Hawa Bangura]] of Sierra Leone took over as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.

The six priorities of the office are:
* to end impunity for sexual violence in conflict by assisting national authorities to strengthen criminal accountability, responsiveness to survivors and judicial capacity;
* the protection and empowerment of civilians who face sexual violence in conflict, in particular, women and girls who are targeted disproportionately by this crime;
* to mobilize political ownership by fostering government engagement in developing and implementing strategies to combat sexual violence;
* to increase recognition of rape as a tactic and consequence of war through awareness-raising activities at the international and country levels;
* '''to harmonise the UN’s response''' by leading UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict, a network of focal points from 13 UN agencies that amplify programming and advocacy on this issue in the wider UN agenda;
* to emphasize greater national ownership.
The Office has eight priority countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina; Central African Republic (CAR); Colombia; Côte d'Ivoire; Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); Liberia; South Sudan and Sudan.  While six of the eight priority countries are in Africa, this problem is widespread and the Office of the Special Representative is engaged on this issue in Asia and the Pacific (in Cambodia for residual cases from the Khmer Rouge period) and the Middle East (Syria).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/|title=About the Office {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed [[UNSCR 122|Resolution 2122]], which supported abortion rights for girls and women raped in wars, "noting the need for access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services, including regarding pregnancies resulting from rape, without discrimination."&lt;ref name="awid.org" /&gt; United Nations Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] had recommended to the U.N. Security Council earlier in 2013 (in September) that girls and women raped in war should have access to "services for safe termination of pregnancies resulting from rape, without discrimination and in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law." In March 2013 Ban Ki-moon had also recommended to the Council that women raped in war have access to abortion services.&lt;ref name="awid.org" /&gt;

[[File:Psychosocial workers help rape survivors (5686874987).jpg|thumbnail|right|Psychosocial workers with International Rescue Committee (IRC) help rape survivors in South Kivu DRC]]

War rape may include physical rape of the male organ. Gang rape and rape with human objects or physical objects, such as fists, sticks, rods, and gun barrels are also methods used in war rape. Women victims may suffer from [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] and [[vaginal fistula]] as a result of these particularly violent instances of rape.&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan24/&gt; Vaginal fistula is a medical condition of vaginal abnormality where there is hole in the vagina in close proximity to the colon (anus or rectum) or bladder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/vaginal-fistulas/ vaginal-fistula].&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, it is a birth defect, in others it is a result of [[Female genital mutilation|female genital cutting]]&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Female genital mutilation|publisher=who.int|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FGM) and rape. In extreme instances of violent rape in war, the walls of the vagina are torn or punctured, resulting in severe pain and debilitating incontinence (urinary complications) and bowel containment.&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan24/&gt; Violent rape is also a cause of obstetric fistula which is a hole in the female organ and birth canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/obstetric_fistula/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; 10 facts on obstetric fistula |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical effects may also include bone breakage such as backbreaking and cranial cracks, causing future disability, visual and hearing impairment, and mental incapacitation.

===Psychological effects===
Victims and survivors of war rape are at very high risk of psychosocial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3f696bcc4.pdf |title=Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons. Guidelines for Prevention and Response, UNHCR (SGVB Guidelines) |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-term psychological injuries to the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, [[sadness]], disorientation, [[Solitary confinement|isolation]], [[vulnerability]], and [[despair (emotion)|desperation]]. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. Causes of death as the result of sexual violence include [[suicide]] and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.

Long-term psychological injuries may include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[post-traumatic stress syndrome]] (PTSS)), multiple [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] symptoms, [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], on-going trauma, chronic insomnia, self-hatred, nightmares, paranoia, difficulty re-establishing intimate relationships, shame, disgust, anger, and persistent fears.&lt;ref name="confex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_108859.htm |title=War, rape and genocide: From ancient times to the Sudan |publisher=Apha.confex.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could have trouble sleeping, experience changes in their appetite, or develop full-blown emotional problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse, or dependence. Individuals who have experienced sexual assault are at risk for other day-to-day problems, including arguing with family members and having problems at work. Lack of medical psychological support resources also puts victims of war rape at further disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Hagen_Yohani"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kristine T. Hagen  |author2=Sophie C. Yohani  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=The nature and psychosocial consequences of war rape for individuals and communities |journal=[[International Journal of Psychological Studies]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=14–25 |url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijps/article/viewFile/5755/6360 |doi=10.5539/ijps.v2n2p14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugee women are also at a disadvantage of receiving adequate assistance to deal with the psychological consequences of war rape - not only do they lack legal representation, they also may lack protection from the perpetrators of the violent act.&lt;ref name="Hagen_Yohani"/&gt; Furthermore, there is an increase in dislike of refugees and asylum seekers which is another obstacle in the psychological healing process of victims seeking assistance outside of their countries that may still be under civil strife.&lt;ref name="Hagen_Yohani"/&gt; Psychological support and counseling sessions given by individuals not part of the ethnic, linguistic, or community may incite difficulties in communication between patient and caregiver. As a result, adequate emotional and psychological support to the victims is not fully developed, affecting the long-term healing potential for the patient.

===Psychosocial and societal effects===
In addition to the physical and psychological damages resulting from rape, sexual violence in the context of war often disrupt the linkages between the rape victims and their communities. Thus, the phenomenon of war rape can structurally affect entire societies, which is closely linked to the logic underlying the strategic use of rape as an instrument in armed conflicts. Raping ‘enemy’ women also constitutes an act of abuse and humiliation against the men of the community the victims were representative of.&lt;ref name=skjelsbaek2006&gt;Inger Skjelsbaek: "Victim Survivor: Narrated Social Identities of Women Who Experienced Rape During the War in Bosnia-Herzegovina", Feminism &amp; Psychology, 16/4, pp. 373–403, 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the psychosocial effects on women as the most frequent victims of wartime rape, [[Pregnancy from rape#Children of rape|children born of rape]] are faced with distinct social stigmas. The existence of taboos around the issue of war rape can also be an obstacle to post-conflict reconciliation.

====Stigmatization and isolation====
Psychosocial consequences&lt;ref name="Hagen_Yohani"/&gt; of war rape describe how the linkages between victims and the society are altered as a result of sexual abuses during war. Both during and even more in the aftermath of conflict, when abuses become known, victims of war rape risk finding themselves in situations of social isolation, often abandoned by their husbands and rejected by their communities&lt;ref name=wardmarsh2006&gt;Jeanne Ward, Mendy Marsh: "Sexual Violence Against Women and Girls in War and Its Aftermath: Realities, Responses, and Required Resources", paper prepared for the Symposium on Sexual Violence in Conflict and Beyond, 21–23 June 2006, Brussels, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordeal is thus not over with the survival of the act of abuse but has a long-term effect that can only to a limited extent be dealt with by the victims themselves. The process of re-victimization captures how victims of sexual violence continue to "receive additional hurt after the direct cause of victimization has disappeared"&lt;ref name=bloomfield2003&gt;David Bloomfield, Teresa Barnes, Luc Huyse: "Reconcilisation After Violent Conflict. A Handbook", International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, 2003, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; with stigmatization and exclusion being among the main sources of re-victimization.&lt;ref name=bloomfield2003/&gt;

This is particularly relevant in [[Patriarchy|patriarchal societies]], where female sexuality is linked to male honour, virginity is a core value, and where a culture considers ethnicity transmitted through male genes.&lt;ref name=clifford2008&gt;Cassandra Clifford: "Rape as a Weapon of War and it's Long-term Effects on Victims and Society", paper presented at the 7th Global Conference on Violence and the Contexts of Hostility, 5–7 May 2008, Budapest, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dikenlautsen2005&gt;Bülent Diken, Carsten Bagge Lautsen: "Becoming Abject: Rape as a Weapon of War", Body and Society 11/1, 111-128, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the ethnic dimension of sexuality, rape can become a means of ethnic cleansing or [[Genocidal rape|genocide]], as has been claimed in relation to systematic instances of rape in Rwanda and Bosnia.&lt;ref name=russell-brown2003&gt;Sherrie L. Russel-Brown: "Rape as an Act of Genocide", Berkeley Journal of International Law, 21/2, 2003, pp. 350-374.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, "rape as a weapon of war is not an individual issue, but a societal one."&lt;ref&gt;Cassandra Clifford: "Rape as a Weapon of War and it's Long-term Effects on Victims and Society", paper presented at the 7th Global Conference on Violence and the Contexts of Hostility, 5–7 May 2008, Budapest, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of countries, the targeted infection of women with HIV, which creates further suffering for victims experiencing social exclusion and [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|discrimination for having HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name=aginam2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/rape-and-hiv-as-weapons-of-war.html |title=Rape and HIV as Weapons of War – United Nations University |publisher=Unu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact on children born out of rape====
War rape can have an equally strong and long-term effect on the children that are born as a result. On the one hand, these children may not be immediately identified and might find out about their origins only at a later point in their lives. In turn, if the children themselves but even more their environment knows about the 'war babies',&lt;ref name=carpenter&gt;Charli Carpenter: "War's Impact on Children Born of Rape and Sexual Exploitation: Physical, Economic and Psychosocial Dimensions", University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; they risk being regarded as 'other' by the communities they are born into. Recurring patterns in countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Uganda, [[Sierra Leone]] and Rwanda show how children born of war rape and to mothers who don't want them have to face struggles with regard to issues related to identity – both in an administrative as well as in a personal sense – and are sometimes restricted in their [[Children's rights|rights]] to education, non-discrimination and even physical security.&lt;ref name=daniel2007&gt;Joana Daniel-Wrabetz: "Children Born of War Rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Convention on the Rights of the Child", in Charli Carpenter (Ed.): Born of War: Protecting Children of Sexual Violence Survivors in Conflict Zones, Lynne Rienner, 2007, 21-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unwanted children born of rape are potentially more vulnerable in a psychological as well as in a physical way and cases of abandoned children are reported from various contemporary conflict and post-conflict societies.&lt;ref name=independent2005&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Kate |last1=Holt |first2=Sarah |last2=Hughes |title=Bosnia's rape babies: abandoned by their families, forgotten by the state |journal=The Independent |date=13 December 2005 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bosnias-rape-babies-abandoned-by-their-families-forgotten-by-the-state-519257.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apio2007&gt;Eunice Apio: "Uganda's Forgotten Children of War", in Charli Carpenter (Ed.): Born of War: Protecting Children of Sexual Violence Survivors in Conflict Zones, Lynne Rienner, 2007, 94-109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckinley1996&gt;{{Cite newspaper |first=James |last=McKinley |title=Legacy of Rwanda Violence: The Thousands Born of Rape |journal=The New York Times |date=23 September 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/legacy-of-rwanda-violence-the-thousands-born-of-rape.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact on post-conflict reconciliation====
The societal consequences of war rape can equally have a negative impact on post-conflict reconciliation and the judicial follow-up on wartime crimes, including rape. Given the stigmatisation of victims and their isolation or fear thereof, they might prefer to remain silent with regard to the violations they have suffered. Indeed, underreporting of cases of rape during armed conflict is a practical challenge post-conflict communities have to face that is pointed to by a number of actors, including the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]],&lt;ref name=unsg2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/149 |title=United Nations Official Document |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&lt;ref name=ohchr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx |title=Rape: Weapon of war |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].&lt;ref name=hrw1996&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Rwanda.htm |title=Rwanda |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Human Rights Watch]] reported with regard to war rape during the [[Rwandan Genocide]], victims "expressed dismay at the fact that they were being urged to forget what happened to them in the name of peace and reconciliation".&lt;ref name=hrw1996 /&gt;  The fear of consequences and threat of exclusion felt by the victims makes it difficult to establish clear figures of war rape incidents and to hold perpetrators accountable for the crimes they have committed, as has been claimed with regards to war rape in [[War in Darfur|Darfur]]: "Underreporting of cases may be attributed to the stigma associated with rape, shame and fear of reprisal, denial that rape occurs, intimidation by many Government officials and the inability to access some conflict-affected areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/149 |title=United Nations Official Document |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This points to another difficulty victims of war rape have to deal with at the societal level. The perpetrators of rape are often officials or otherwise affiliated with the state's institutions, which might make reporting of assaults appear useless.&lt;ref name=physforhr2009&gt;{{cite web |title=Physicians for Human Rights: Nowhere to Turn: Failure to Protect, Support and Assure Justice to Darfuri Women |year=2009 |page=4 |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/nowhere-to-turn.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric care===
Disrupted healthcare sectors is a term the World Health Organization describes for medical facilities that are destroyed or partially destroyed in war torn areas.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;Analysing Disrupted Health Sectors: A Modular Manual. Department of Recovery and Transition Programmes Health Action in Crises. World Health Organization Draft. June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Health care facilities are essential for the establishment of support systems for rape victims. Psychological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners and health-care workers face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; As the WHO explains, "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses".&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;{{rp|7}} War-torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. "If we do not have the capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Hollifield, M. (2005). Taking measure of war trauma. The Lancet, 365(9467), 1283–1284.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to psychological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape who are at the margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, I.

International Journal of Gynaecology &amp; Obstetrics, 48(3), pp. 311-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Rape has accompanied warfare in virtually every known historical era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levinson |first=Bernard M |title= Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2rZnXQwPX8gC&amp;dq=rape+in+warfare+ancient |page= 203 |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-567-08098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] armies reportedly engaged in war rape, which is documented by ancient authors such as [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]], and [[Livy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Ancient sources held multiple, often contradictory attitudes to sexual violence in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ancient origins: Sexual violence in warfare, Part I|first=Elisabeth|last=Vikman|doi=10.1080/13648470500049826|pmid=28135871|journal=Anthropology &amp; Medicine|volume=12|issue=1|date=April 2005|pages=21–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible:
"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women taken..." {{bibleref|Zechariah|14:2|ESV}} "Their little children will be dashed to death before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked, and their wives will be taken." {{bibleref|Isaiah|13:16|NLT}}

The Torah:
The Torah in Deuteronomy 21:10-14 allows the taking of a female captive only within the context of marriage. The female captive must be brought to the home and, following the month in which she is given to mourn, the man must decide to either take her as a wife or set her free. According to Rabbi Yohanan in the Jerusalem Talmud, only after deciding to marry the female captive are sexual relations permitted. This in effect prohibits rape in the process of war, but does not prohibit forced marriages and marital rape.

Roman military officers often [[Pederasty|used the young boys]] of defeated peoples for homosexual intercourse. The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] noted this happening during the [[Revolt of the Batavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=roman+homosexuality#v=snippet&amp;q=batavian%20boys%20sexual%20purposes&amp;f=false|title=The marriage of Roman soldiers (13 B.C.-A.D. 235): law and family in the imperial army|author=Sara Elise Phang|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|page=268|isbn=978-90-04-12155-3|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vikings]] (Scandinavians who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe from the late 8th century to the early 11th century),&lt;ref&gt;Roesdahl, pp. 9–22.&lt;/ref&gt; have acquired a reputation for "rape and pillage". Viking settlements in Britain and Ireland are thought to have been primarily male enterprises, with a lesser role for Viking females.

===Early modern period===
====Second Manchu invasion of Korea====
{{main article|Second Manchu invasion of Korea#Aftermath}}

In the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea]] when [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] forces invaded the Korean [[Joseon|Kingdom of Joseon]], many Korean women were subjected to rape at the hands of the Qing forces, and as a result they were unwelcomed by their families even if they were released by the Qing after being ransomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women in Korean History 한국 역사 속의 여성들 |first=Pae-yong |last=Yi |editor-first=Ted |editor-last=Chan |year=2008 |publisher=Ewha Womans University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3yW5MdzKnUC&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-8973007721 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European colonial era===
====Dutch Formosa (Taiwan)====
Multiple [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese Aboriginal]] villages in frontier areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to acts of oppression, such as when the Dutch ordered that aboriginal women be turned over to them for sex, and when they demanded that deer pelts and rice be given to them by aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village, sparking a rebellion in December 1652. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and two additional Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan. The aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3oWoSKVnVIC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shepherd1993], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch women were kept as sexual slaves by the Chinese after the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan in 1662. During the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] loyalist forces commanded by [[Koxinga]] besieged and defeated the [[Dutch East India Company]] and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary [[Antonius Hambroek]], two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war who were being held captive by [[Koxinga]]. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding that he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were being held prisoner. He urged the commander of the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation, and in addition to this, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwanese aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children who were also being held prisoner. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moffett |first=Samuel H. |date=1998 |title=A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500–1900 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_XglAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=hambroek+daughter&amp;q=one+sweet+young+seized+harem |location= |publisher=Orbis Books |edition=2, illustrated, reprint |volume=Volume 2 of A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500-1900.

The topic of the Chinese taking the Dutch women and the daughter of [[Antonius Hambroek]] as concubines was featured in Joannes Nomsz's play which became famous and well known in Europe and revealed European anxieties about the fate of the Dutch women along with their sense of humiliation after being subjected to defeat at the hands of non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/2012/06/01/koxinga-the-pirate.html/ |title=Koxinga the Pirate |author=Ernie |last2= |first2= |date=1 June 2012 |website=China Expat |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the play was "Antonius Hambroek, of de Belegering van Formoza" rendered in English as "Antonius Hambroek, or the Siege of Formosa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton/NomszHambroek1775.html |title=Antonius Hambroek, of de Belegering van Formoza |last1=Nomsz |first1=Joannes |last2= |first2= |date=1775|website=Universiteit Leiden |publisher=IZAAK DUIM, op den Cingel, tusschen de Warmoesgracht, en de Drie-Koningstraat |location=AMSTELDAM |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |date=2011|title=Lost Colony: The Untold Story of China's First Great Victory Over the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yzRscizpLMC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUgTnxgotUC&amp;pg=PT372&amp;lpg=PT372&amp;dq=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton/NomszHambroek1775.html&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pav5C_k7cX&amp;sig=v4IJ7RElYsD03gP8MxCQrZvKT3s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL3_La2obOAhUEGh4KHf13CFcQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.let.leidenuniv.nl%2FDutch%2FCeneton%2FNomszHambroek1775.html&amp;f=false|archivedate=10 December 2014 |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press|edition=|volume= |issue=illustrated |series= |page=5|isbn=978-0691144559|accessdate=10 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian Rebellion====
Along with the origins of the mass media in the 19th century, accusations of war rape were occasionally used as propaganda by European [[Colonialism|colonialists]] in order to justify the colonization of places which they had previously conquered.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt; The most notable example of this may have occurred during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], known as "[[India's First War of Independence (term)|India's First War of Independence]]" to the Indians and as the "Sepoy Mutiny" to the British, where Indian [[sepoy]]s rebelled against the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]]. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women and girls were generally uncommon during the rebellion, they were exaggerated to great effect by the British media in order to justify continued British colonialism in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Beckman&gt;{{harvp|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of English women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, but with little physical evidence to support these accounts. It was later found{{Citation needed||date=January 2014}} that most of these accounts were false stories which had been created in order to paint native Indian people as savages who had to be civilized by British colonialists, a mission sometimes known as ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''. One such account published by ''The Times'', regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10–14 had been raped by the Indian rebels in Delhi, was criticized as a false propaganda story by [[Karl Marx]], who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beckman|2003|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luella Miner wrote that the behavior of the Russian and French was particularly appalling. Chinese women and girls committed suicide in order to avoid being raped. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to the "gallantry of the French soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWxKQejMtlMC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=boxer+rebellion+japanese+regimental+wives#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20soldiers%20atrocious%20french%20not%20better&amp;f=false|title=The boxer rebellion: the dramatic story of China's war on foreigners that shook the world in the summer of 1900|author=Diana Preston|year=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|page=284|isbn=978-0-8027-1361-2|accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapes were allegedly committed during the Imperial German advance through Belgium in the first months of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brownmiller|1975|pp=40–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war [[Harold Lasswell|Harold D.

The individual stories of the women that were impacted were used to justify the war and to market it to the civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crouthamel|first=Jason|date=January 8, 2017|title=Sexuality, Sexual Relations, Homosexuality - 1914-1918|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/pdf/1914-1918-Online-sexuality_sexual_relations_homosexuality-2014-10-08.pdf|journal=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|volume=|pages=1–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
The sometimes widespread and systematic occurrence of war rape of women by soldiers has been documented. During World War II and in its immediate aftermath, war rape occurred in a range of situations, ranging from institutionalized sexual slavery to war rapes associated with specific battles. The Judge Advocate General's office reports that there were 971 convictions for rape in the U.S. military from January 1942 to June 1947, which includes a portion of the occupation.&lt;ref name=susanbrownmiller /&gt;

{{Main article|Comfort women}}
The term "[[comfort women]]" is a euphemism for the estimated 200,000, mostly Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese and Filipino women who were forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese military brothels during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/03/19/2007031961023.html |title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan |publisher=English.chosun.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Nanking Massacre]], Japanese soldiers sexually assaulted female civilians who were trapped in the city of [[Nanjing]] when it  fell to the Japanese on 13 December 1937.

Chuo University professor Yoshiaki Yoshimi states there were about 2,000 centers where as many as 200,000 Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Taiwanese, Burmese, Indonesian, Dutch and Australian women were interned and used as sex slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=91, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====US Army=====
It has been claimed that some U.S. military personnel raped Okinawan women during the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945. Following the war there were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of [[Kanagawa prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrijvers|first=Peter|title=The GI War Against Japan|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8147-9816-4|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being told by the Japanese military that they would suffer rape, torture and murder at the hands of the Americans, Okinawans "were often surprised by the comparatively humane treatment which they received from the American enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&amp;pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-415-19194-4 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2300-9 | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by [[Mark Selden]], the Americans "did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual instances of rape have reportedly been committed by members of the [[United States Forces Japan|United States Army in Japan]] while [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|their forces were stationed in post-war Japan]], such as the [[Yumiko-chan incident]] and the [[1995 Okinawa rape incident]].

=====Soviet Red Army=====
Soviet [[Red Army]] troops looted and terrorized the people of [[Mukden]] located in [[Manchuria]], the northernmost province of China. A foreigner witnessed Soviet troops, formerly stationed in Berlin, who were allowed by the Soviet military to go into the city of Mukden "for three days of rape and pillage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+last+empress+chiang#v=onepage&amp;q=mukden%20berlin%20rape%20and%20pillage&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=530|isbn=978-1-4391-4893-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Army's influence in the region was affected for years to come.

====Europe====
=====British=====
The Italian statistics record eight rapes and nineteen attempted rapes by British soldiers in Italy between September 1943 and December 1945. Various sources, including the [[Special Investigation Branch]] as well as evidence provided by Belgian reporters, said that rape and [[sexual harassment]] by British troops occurred frequently following the [[invasion of Sicily]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="SO"&gt;Emsley, Clive (2013) ''Soldier, Sailor, Beggarman, Thief: Crime and the British Armed Services since 1914''. Oxford University Press, USA, p. 128-129; {{ISBN|0199653712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although far from the scale of those committed by the [[Wehrmacht]] or [[Red Army]], rapes of local women and girls were committed by British troops during the last months of WWII in Germany. Even elderly women were targeted. Though a high-profile issue for the [[Royal Military Police]], some officers treated the behaviour of their men with leniency. Many rapes were committed by men who were either under the influence of alcohol or suffering from post-traumatic stress, but there were cases of premeditated attack, like the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am Rübemberge, on 16 April 1945, or the attempted [[gang-rape|gang rape]] of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near [[Nienburg, Lower Saxony|Nienburg]], which ended in the death of one of the women when, whether intentionally or not, one of the soldiers discharged his gun, hitting her in the neck.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Longden, Sean (2004) ''To the Victor the Spoils: D-Day to Ve Day, the Reality Behind the Heroism''. Arris Books, p. 195. {{ISBN|1844370380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also reports of "sexual assault and offences" committed by British soldiers against children in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], and a number of men were convicted of these crimes while they were fraternizing with Dutch and Belgian families during the winter of 1944-45.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; On a single day in mid-April 1945, three women in [[Neustadt am Rübenberge|Neustadt]] were raped by British soldiers. A senior British Army [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] who followed the troops reported that there was a "good deal of rape going on". He then added that "those who suffer [rape] have probably deserved it." In the summer of 1945, two drunken British soldiers stormed into a farmhouse in [[Klagenfurt]] with a drawn revolver when there were only two women present. The older of the two women was forced to go upstairs while the other, an 18-year-old girl, was raped by one of the soldiers.&lt;ref name="SO" /&gt;

Rapes were committed by Wehrmacht forces on Jewish women and girls during the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939;&lt;ref name="Datner"&gt;"55 Dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce" [[Szymon Datner]] Warsaw 1967 page 67 "Zanotowano szereg faktów gwałcenia kobiet i dziewcząt żydowskich" (Numerous rapes were committed against Jewish women and girls)&lt;/ref&gt; they were also committed against Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian women and girls during mass executions which were primarily carried out by the [[Selbstschutz]] units, with the assistance of Wehrmacht soldiers who were stationed in territory that was under the administration of the German military; the rapes were committed against female captives before they were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz3,2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029144245/http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz3%2C2.htm |archivedate=29 October 2007 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one case of rape was prosecuted by a German court during the military campaign in Poland, and even then the German judge found the perpetrator guilty of ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (committing a shameful act against his race as defined by the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]]), rather than rape.&lt;ref name=Wprost&gt;Numer: 17/18/2007 Wprost "Seksualne Niewolnice III Rzeszy"&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women were particularly vulnerable to rape during [[The Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vallentinemitchell.metapress.com/content/122369 |title=Holocaust Studies: A Journal of Culture and History – Vallentine Mitchell |publisher=Vallentinemitchell.metapress.com |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2014-04-30 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131202112303/http://vallentinemitchell.metapress.com/content/122369 |archive-date=2 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapes were also committed by German forces stationed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], where they were largely unpunished (as opposed to rapes committed in Western Europe); the overall number of rapes is difficult to establish due to the lack of prosecutions of the crime by German courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Jews, Germans, and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany'', Atina Grossmann, page 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gegenwind.info/175/sonderheft_wehrmacht.pdf Zur Debatte um die Ausstellung.

In Italy, victims of the [[mass rape]] committed after the Battle of Monte Cassino by Goumiers, [[colonial troops]] of the [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943-1944)|French Expeditionary Corps]], are known as ''[[Marocchinate]]''. According to Italian sources, more than 7,000 Italian civilians, including women and children, were raped by Goumiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1952: Il caso delle "marocchinate" al Parlamento |url=http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French [[Senegal]]ese troops too, known as [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]], who landed on the island of [[Elba]] on 17 June 1944, were responsible for mass rapes, though their behaviour was considered less brutal than that of the French North African troops in continental [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=Bracalini&gt;Bracalini, Romano: "Paisà.

Polish sources claim that mass rapes were committed in Polish cities that had been taken by the [[Red Army]]. It is reported that in [[Kraków]], the Soviet occupation was accompanied by the mass rape of Polish women and girls, as well as the plunder of all private property by Soviet soldiers.

Many of these victims were raped repeatedly.

A female [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] war correspondent described what she had witnessed: "The Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty. It was an army of rapists."

[[Antony Beevor]] estimates that up to half of all rape victims were victims of gang rapes. Naimark states that not only did each victim have to carry the trauma with her for the rest of her days, it also inflicted a massive collective trauma on the East German nation. Naimark concludes "The social psychology of women and men in the Soviet zone of occupation was marked by the crime of rape from the first days of the occupation, through the founding of the [[East Germany|GDR]] in the fall of 1949, until, one could argue, the present."&lt;ref&gt;Norman M.

During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, numerous women were tortured and raped by Pakistani army. Exact numbers are not known and are a subject of debate. Most of the women were captured from [[Dhaka University]] and private homes and kept as sex-slaves inside the Dhaka Cantonment.&lt;ref name="time.oct25-1971"&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877316,00.html East Pakistan: Even the Skies Weep], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 25 October 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Doctor Geoffrey Davis was brought to Bangladesh by the United Nation and [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] to carry out late-term abortions on rape victims. He was of the opinion that the 200,000 to 400,000 rape victims was an underestimation. On the actions of Pakistan army he said "They’d keep the infantry back and put artillery ahead and they would shell the hospitals and schools. And that caused absolute chaos in the town. And then the infantry would go in and begin to segregate the women. Apart from little children, all those were sexually matured would be segregated...And then the women would be put in the compound under guard and made available to the troops…Some of the stories they told were appalling. Being raped again and again and again.

=== Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan ===
The Soviet forces abducted Afghan women in helicopters while flying in the country in search of mujahideen. In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama. Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of [[Kabul]] and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them.&lt;ref&gt;Kakar, M.

The Soviets troops would also encircle villages and massacre  the inhabitants, including old men, women and children. Before leaving, they would burn down the entire village. A 1986 report provides a description:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.mediamonitors.net/Headlines/Casualties-and-War-Crimes-in-Afghanistan|title=Casualties and War Crimes in Afghanistan|last=|first=|date=2004-08-11|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In three small villages near Qandahar, last year, the Soviets killed close to 350 women and children in retaliation for a Mujahadeen attack in the vicinity. After slitting the throats of the children, disemboweling pregnant women, raping, shooting and mutilating others, the Russians poured a substance on the bodies which caused instant decomposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evidence of the magnitude of rape in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] prompted the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to deal openly with these abuses.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The issue of rape during armed conflict was brought to the attention of the United Nations after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, in conjunction with the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/sowc96pk/sexviol.htm|title=United Nations, Department of Public Information|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of sexual violence during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95) and [[Kosovo War]] (1996–99), part of the [[Yugoslav wars]], a series of conflicts from 1991 to 1999, have been described as "especially alarming".&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_9"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Kosovo War thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence by Serbian paramilitaries, soldiers or police man.Majority of rapes were gang rapes. &lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_10"/&gt; Since the entry of the [[NATO]] in the Kosovo War, rapes of Serbian, Albanian, and Roma women were committed by ethnic [[Albanians]] sometimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, have also been documented.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_11"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that during the Bosnian War between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped. The majority of the rape victims were Muslim women raped by Serbian soldiers. Although men also became victim of sexual violence, war rape was disproportionately directed against women who were (gang) raped in the streets, in their homes and/or in front of family members. Sexual violence occurred in a multiple ways, including rape with objects, such as broken glass bottles, guns and truncheons.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_9"/&gt; War rape occurred as a matter of official orders as part of ethnic cleansing, to displace the targeted ethnic group out of the region.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_10"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Bosnian War, the existence of deliberately created "rape camps" was reported. The reported aim of these camps was to impregnate the Muslim and Croatian women held captive. It has been reported that often women were kept in confinement until the late stage of their pregnancy. This occurred in the context of a patrilineal society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, hence the "rape camps" aimed at the birth of a new generation of Serb children. According to the Women's Group Tresnjevka more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run "rape camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newint.org/features/1993/06/05/rape/ new Internationalist] issue 244, June 1993.

During the Kosovo War thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence. War rape was used as a weapon of war and an instrument of systematic [[ethnic cleansing]]; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a 2000 Human Rights Watch report war rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women's homes, rapes during fighting, and rapes in detention. The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but they also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Most rapes were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_10"/&gt;

====Mass rape in the Bosnian War====
{{Main article|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
During the [[Bosnian War]], [[Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb]] forces conducted a sexual abuse strategy against thousands of Bosnian Muslim girls and women which became known as a "mass rape phenomenon".

===Rwandan genocide===
{{Main article|Rwandan Genocide}}
During the Rwandan genocide, from April until July 1994, hundreds of thousands of women and girls were raped or became the victims of other forms of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_11"/&gt; Although no explicit written orders to commit rape and other acts of sexual violence have been found, evidence suggests that military leaders encouraged or ordered their men to rape the [[Tutsis]], and they also condoned the acts which were already taking place, without making efforts to stop them.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_13"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other conflicts, the sexual violence in [[Rwanda]] stands out in terms of the organised nature of the propaganda that contributed significantly to fuelling sexual violence against Tutsi women, the very public nature of the rapes and the level of brutality towards the women. Anne-Marie de Brouwer concludes that considering the massive scale and public nature of war rape during the [[Rwandan genocide]], "it is difficult to imagine anybody in Rwanda who was not aware of the sexual violence taking place."&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_14"&gt;{{harvp|de Brouwer|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] made the landmark decision that the war rape during the Rwanda genocide was an element of the crime of genocide. The Trial Chamber held that "sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide."&lt;ref name=unreport /&gt;

In his 1996 report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Rwanda, Rene Degni-Segui stated that "rape was the rule and its absence was the exception." The report also stated that "rape was systematic and was used as a "weapon" by the perpetrators of the massacres. This can be estimated from the number and nature of the victims as well as from the forms of rape."&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_11"/&gt; A 2000 report prepared by the Organisation of African Unity’s International Panel of Eminent Personalities concluded that "we can be certain that almost all females who survived the genocide were direct victims of rape or other sexual violence, or were profoundly affected by it".&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_11"/&gt;

The Special Rapporteur on Rwanda estimated in his 1996 report that between 2,000 and 5,000 pregnancies resulted from war rape, and that between 250,000 and 500,000 Rwandese women and girls had been raped.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_11"/&gt; Rwanda is a patriarchal society and children therefore take the ethnicity of the father, underlining the fact that war rape occurred in the context of genocide.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_14"/&gt;

Within the context of the Rwandan genocide, victims of sexual violence were predominantly attacked on the basis of their gender and ethnicity. The victims were mostly Tutsi women and girls, of all ages, while men were only seldomly the victims of war rape. Women were demonized in the anti-Tutsi propaganda prior to the 1994 genocide. The December 1990 issue of the newspaper ''[[Kangura]]'' published the "Ten Commandments", four of which portrayed Tutsi women as tools of the Tutsi community, as sexual weapons that would be used by the Tutsi to weaken and ultimately to destroy the Hutu men.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_13"/&gt; Gender based propaganda also included cartoons printed in newspapers that portrayed Tutsi women as [[sex object]]s. Examples of gender based hate propaganda used to incite war rape included statements by perpetrators such as "You Tutsi women think that you are too good for us" and "Let us see what a Tutsi woman tastes like".&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_13"/&gt; Victims of war rape during the Rwandan genocide also included [[Hutu]] women considered moderates, such as [[Hutu]] women married to Tutsi men and Hutu women politically affiliated with the Tutsi. War rape also occurred regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with young or beautiful women being targeted based on their gender only. Sexual violence against men occurred significantly less frequently, but it frequently included the mutilation of their genitals, which were often displayed in public.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_13"/&gt; The perpetrators of war rape during the Rwandan genocide were mainly members of the Hutu militia, the "[[Interahamwe]]". Rapes were also committed by military personnel within the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), including the Presidential Guard, and civilians.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_13"/&gt;

Sexual violence against women and girls during the Rwandan genocide included: rape, gang rape, sexual slavery (either collectively or individually through "forced marriages"), rape with objects such as sticks and weapons often leading to the victim’s death, sexual mutilation of, in particular, breasts, vaginas or buttocks, often during or following rape. Pregnant women were not spared from sexual violence and on many occasions victims were killed following rape. Many women were raped by men who knew they were HIV positive and it has been suggested that there were deliberate attempts to transmit the virus to Tutsi women and their families. War rape occurred all over the country and it was frequently perpetrated in plain view of others, at sites such as schools, churches, roadblocks, government buildings or in the bush. Some women were kept as personal slaves for years after the genocide, and they were eventually forced to move to neighbouring countries after the genocide along with their captors.&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_14"/&gt;

The long-term effects of war rape in Rwanda on its victims include social isolation (the social stigma attached to rape meant that some husbands left their wives who had become victims of war rape, or that the victims became unmarriageable), unwanted pregnancies and babies (some women resorted to self-induced abortions), [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]], including [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhoea]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] (access to anti-retroviral drugs remains limited).&lt;ref name="de_Brouwer_14"/&gt;

The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 after the Rwandan Genocide, has only brought three perpetrators before the Tribunal, with the first conviction in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War's dirty secret: Rape, prostitution, and other crimes against women.|last=Barstow|first=Anne Llewellyn|publisher=Pilgrim Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka civilian war===
During the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], multiple Human Rights Organizations have reported cases of rape, violence and disappearance of women in the 1990s, claiming to be committed by security forces.&lt;!--mixed references, below--&gt; Government officials, including the president, have denied the claims and agreed to co-operate with the investigations and prosecute whomever they find guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport/Asia-10.htm |title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 |accessdate=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Special Rapporteur]], has reported that individual investigations and proceedings relating to these cases have commenced at the local [[magistrates]] courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/2848af408d01ec0ac1256609004e770b/b0c23b08bd41fc0f802567240054637f?OpenDocument#Sri |title=United Nation's Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy |year=2000 |accessdate=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable cases of murdered raped victims and the massacres associated with the rape incidents are – [[Krishanti Kumaraswamy]], [[Arumaithurai Tharmaletchumi]], [[Ida Carmelitta]], [[Ilayathambi Tharsini]], [[Murugesapillai Koneswary]], [[Premini Thanuskodi]], [[Sarathambal]], [[Kumarapuram massacre]] and [[Vankalai massacre]].&lt;!-- The citations for each of these are in the wikilinked articles themselves; they do not need to be reproduced here, as well. --&gt; There have been many instances in which the terrorist organization LTTE had been identified as perpetrators of sexual violence against civilians as well. However, there are few official records of such violence due to the fear experienced by civilians to report such violations against the brutal terrorist outfit.

According to Amnesty International, recent documented cases of war rape include incidents in  [[Afghanistan]], [[Chechnya]], [[Colombia]], Iraq, [[Sudan]], and Nepal.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Commenting on the rape of women and children in recent African conflict zones, [[UNICEF]] said in 2008 that rape was no longer just perpetrated by combatants but also by civilians. According to UNICEF rape is common in countries affected by wars and natural disasters, drawing a link between the occurrence of sexual violence and significant uprooting of a society and the crumbling of social norms. UNICEF states that in Kenya reported cases of sexual violence doubled within days of recent post-election conflict erupting. According to UNICEF rape was prevalent in conflict zones in [[Sudan]], Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7242421.stm| title = Africa war zones’ ‘rape epidemic’|publisher=BBC News | date=13 February 2008 | accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''UN News Centre.''&lt;/ref&gt; titled "[[UNICEF]] adviser says rape in Darfur, [[Sudan]] continues with impunity" reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Armed militias in Sudan’s strife-torn Darfur region are continuing to rape women and girls with impunity, an expert from the United Nations children’s agency said today on her return from a mission to the region. Pamela Shifman, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) adviser on violence and sexual exploitation, said she heard dozens of harrowing accounts of sexual assaults – including numerous reports of gang-rapes – when she visited [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) at one camp and another settlement in North Darfur last week. "Rape is used as a weapon to terrorize individual women and girls, and also to terrorize their families and to terrorize entire communities," she said in an interview with the UN News Service. "No woman or girl is safe."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article Pamela Shifman was reported to have said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;every woman or girl she spoke to had either endured sexual assault herself, or knew of someone who had been attacked, particularly when they left the relative safety of their IDP camp or settlement to find firewood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) has employed sexual violence against women and men in a manner that has been described as "[[terrorism]]".&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/sep-18-2014-1.2907543/isis-sexual-violence-is-an-act-of-terrorism-says-former-cia-analyst-1.2907548|title=ISIS sexual violence is an act of terrorism, says former CIA analyst|date=25 September 2014|publisher=Cbc.ca|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL has utilized sexual violence in order to undermine a sense of security within communities, as well as to raise funds through the sale of captives into sexual slavery.&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt; According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ISIL appeals to [[Islamic eschatology|apocalyptic beliefs]] and claims "justification by a [[Hadith]] that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Nour Malas, [https://online.wsj.com/articles/ancient-prophecies-motivate-islamic-state-militants-1416357441 "Ancient Prophecies Motivate Islamic State Militants: Battlefield Strategies Driven by 1,400-year-old Apocalyptic Ideas"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 18 November 2014; accessed 22 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, ISIL released a pamphlet on the treatment of female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Smith, [http://www.newsweek.com/isis-release-questions-and-answers-pamphlet-how-treat-female-slaves-290511 "ISIS Publishes Pamphlet On How to Treat Female Slaves"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', 9 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abul Taher, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2872884/Our-faith-condones-raping-underage-slaves-ISIS-publishes-shocking-guidebook-telling-fighters-buy-sell-abuse-captured-women.html "Our faith condones raping underage slaves: ISIS publishes shocking guidebook telling fighters how to buy, sell and abuse captured women"], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 13 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Botelho, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves "ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK"], ''[[CNN]]'', 13 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Lackey, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/12/13/pamphlet-islamic-state-guidelines-sex-slaves/20359049/ "Pamphlet provides Islamic State guidelines for sex slaves"], ''[[USA Today]]'', 13 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey Lodge, [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/islamic.state.issues.abhorrent.sex.slavery.guidelines.about.how.to.treat.women/44435.htm "Islamic State issues abhorrent sex slavery guidelines about how to treat women"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Withnall, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-releases-abhorrent-sex-slaves-pamphlet-with-27-tips-for-militants-on-taking-punishing-and-raping-female-captives-9915913.html "Isis releases 'abhorrent' sex slaves pamphlet with 27 tips for militants on taking, punishing and raping female captives"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in August 2015 that "[t]he systematic rape of women and girls from the [[Yazidi]] religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State in the year since the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution."&lt;ref name="Theology of Rape"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callimachi|first1=Rukmini|title=ISIS Enshrines a Theology of Rape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/middleeast/isis-enshrines-a-theology-of-rape.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 August 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Libyan civil war===
{{main article|2011 Libyan rape allegations}}
The chief prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], claimed that there is evidence that [[Gaddafi]]'s troops used rape as a weapon during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]]. He also said, "Apparently, he [Gaddafi] decided to punish, using rape," while witnesses confirmed that the [[Libyan government]] also purchased a large number of [[Viagra]]-like drugs. The Libyan government, on the other hand, does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13705854 |title=Libya: Gaddafi investigated over use of rape as weapon |journal=BBC News |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Afghan Taliban ===
In 2015, Amnesty International reported that the Afghan Taliban had engaged in mass murder and gang rapes of Afghan civilians in Kunduz.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/afghanistan-harrowing-accounts-emerge-of-the-talibans-reign-of-terror-in-kunduz/|title=Afghanistan: Harrowing accounts emerge of the Taliban's reign of terror in Kunduz|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban fighters killed and raped female relatives of police commanders and soldiers. The Taliban also raped and killed midwives who they accused of providing reproductive health services to women in the city.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One female human rights activist described the situation:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Taliban asserted their control over Kunduz, they claimed to be bringing law and order and Shari’a to the city. But everything they’ve done has violated both. I don’t know who can rescue us from this situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rape in contemporary peace operations by UN peacekeepers===

In contemporary conflict zones, international organizations, particularly the United Nations peacekeepers, have been involved in maintaining peace and stability in the area as well as distribute humanitarian aid to the local population. At present there are 16 Peace Operations directed by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The peacekeepers are mainly composed of military personnel (but to a less number also the police) sent by governments of various member-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/current.shtml |title=Current peacekeeping operations. United Nations Peacekeeping |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of their involvement in the field, peacekeepers have also been accused and at times found guilty of committing rape and other forms of sexual violence to the local population, in particular to women and children. Among all international staff in the conflict zone, United Nations peacekeepers (handled by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) have been most frequently identified as the perpetrators of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Defeis|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motivations for rape and sexual abuse by peacekeepers====

Like traditional military ventures, peacekeepers are deployed in highly unstable areas similar to war zones, where there is absence of the rule of law, disintegration of society and great psychological and economic hardships.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Shotton, A Strategy to Address Sexual Exploitation by U.N. Peacekeeping Personnel, 39 CORNELL L. REV. 97, 103 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Having an image of wealth and authority, peacekeepers can easily exercise power over the local population, which is often abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Defeis|2008|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as members of their respective country’s militaries, peacekeepers also carry with them in the peace operations the "hyper-masculine culture" that encourages sexual exploitation and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refugeesinternational.org/files/6976_file_FINAL_MustBoys.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822023939/http://www.refugeesinternational.org/files/6976_file_FINAL_MustBoys.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2006 |title=Must boys be boys? Ending Sexual Exploitation &amp; Abuse in UN Peacekeeping Missions |author=Sarah Martin |date=October 2005 |publisher=[[Refugees International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is supported by the fact that most of the peacekeepers are male. As of November 2003, while there are 81,181 male peacekeeping soldiers, there are only 2,322 female peacekeeping troops; on the other hand, while there are 11,644 male police, only female police are only 1,273.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/gender.shtml |title=Gender statistics. United Nations Peacekeeping |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivations for rape differ from the traditional perpetrators (government and rebel forces) in that rape is not part of a war strategy that contributes to fulfilling the organization’s mission, but rather more as means to relieve the perpetrators’ sexual urges most often related to the military culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/bosnia-and-herzegovina/un-peacekeepers-and-cultures-violenc |title=UN Peacekeepers and Cultures of Violence |publisher=Cultural Survival |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from putting the victim under the threat of physical violence, perpetrators induce sexual acts from the victim through payment, and granting or denying humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, Natalie. "When Those Meant to Keep the Peace Commit Sexualized Violence | Women Under Siege Project." Accessed 18 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cases of rape and sexual abuse in peace operations====

UN peacekeepers’ involvement in rape was found as early as 1993 during the [[Bosnian genocide]], where peacekeepers were found to regularly visit a Serb-run brothel in Sarajevo that housed Bosniak and Croat women who were forced to become prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bosniagenocide.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/un-peacekeepers-took-part-in-rapes-during-bosnian-genocide/ |title=UN peacekeepers took part in rapes during Bosnian Genocide &amp;#124; We Remember the Bosnian Genocide, 1992-95.

In one instance, BBC News reports that Uruguayan soldiers raped a young man. In another instance, Uruguayan UN soldiers were recently convicted of raping a Haitian boy, sparking protests that called for the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14796970 |title=BBC News – Haiti anger over alleged Uruguay UN rape |journal=BBC News |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Congo in 2004, peacekeepers from [[Uruguay]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Nepal]] have faced 68 cases of rape, prostitution and [[pedophilia]]. The investigation resulted in the jailing of six Nepalese troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3145-2004Dec15.html |title=U.N. Sexual Abuse Alleged in Congo |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, the Egyptian contingent was accused of raping six women when the civilians took shelter at the peacekeepers’ headquarters in order to flee from the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30286-2005Mar12.html |title=U.N.

Peacekeeper Rape Scandal |publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Punitive measures====

The most common challenge in reprimanding perpetrators is the significant underreporting of the issue mainly due to three reasons. First, the victims do not report or file complaints due to fears of revenge from the offender(s), denial of aid and the social stigma against rape victims in the victims’ own community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/7420798.stm |title=Special Reports &amp;#124; Peacekeepers 'abusing children' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, UN higher officials previously dismissed such allegations as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref&gt;Profile: Bureaucrat at Large in the Balkans; Yasushi Akashi, Almost Painfully Diplomatic U.N. Envoy, The Independent, 30 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, fellow peacekeepers are accustomed to the "wall of silence" in the spirit of brotherhood characteristic of military culture but also to protect the reputation of their sending government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:DS8SVzkECNAJ:english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fat_code%3D382507+OhMyNews+UN+peacekeeping+2006&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us]&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, whistleblowers are often stigmatised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/bosnia-sex-trade-shames-un-1-1381668 |title=Bosnia sex trade shames UN |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2003-02-09 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if there would indeed be reports, the UN instituted the Conduct and Discipline Teams (CDTs) to conduct an investigation referring the allegations for serious offense to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).&lt;ref&gt;Secretary-General, Comprehensive Report Prepared Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 59/296 on Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, Including Policy Development, Implementation and Full Justification of Proposed Capacity on Personnel Conduct Issues, 14, delivered to the General Assembly, U.N. Doc. A/60/862 (24 May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; When found guilty, the course of the specific disciplinary action is dependent on the employee status of the offender. UN civilian staff and personnel have functional immunity that can only be waived by the UN Secretary-General. In the case of military personnel, they are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective sending governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Defeis|2008|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual practice for offending soldiers has been to repatriate the personnel and prosecute them in their home country. In several cases, punitive measures are imposed such as demotion or dishonorable dismissal. However, very few among guilty personnel have faced criminal charges in their home countries after repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/blog/entry/Survival-sex-how-NGOs-and-peacekeepers-exploit-women-in-war |title='Survival sex': How NGOs and peacekeepers exploit women in war |publisher=Women Under Siege Project |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape camp==
{{See also|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
A rape camp is a detention facility that is designed for or turns into a place where authorities regularly rape the detainees.

Rape camps set up by the Bosnian Serb authorities have been extensively documented in the Bosnian War:&lt;ref name="Human Rights: Waking Up the World"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newint.org/features/1993/06/05/rape/|title=Rape: weapon of war|date=1993-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen, Beverly |title=Rape Warfare: The Hidden Genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8166-2818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced prostitution and sexual slavery in war==
{{Main article|Forced prostitution|Sexual slavery}}
[[Forced prostitution]] and [[sexual slavery]] are distinct as forms of war rape, as they entail more than the opportunistic rape by soldiers of women captives. Instead, women and girls are forced into sexual slavery, in some cases for prolonged periods. This is defined by the UN as "the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including sexual access through rape or other forms of sexual violence".&lt;ref name=UN_Contemporary_slavery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0811fcbd0b9f6bd58025667300306dea/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument#Ipurp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011117223019/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0811fcbd0b9f6bd58025667300306dea/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |archive-date=17 November 2001 |dead-url=yes |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on systematic rape |accessdate=2014-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; War time forced prostitution takes several forms ranging from individual trafficking by armed forces to the institutionalization of the act of rape by military or civil authorities. The term ‘forced prostitution’ is often used in the press to refer to men and women displaced by war who are forced to engage in prostitution to survive.&lt;ref name=Independent_Hassan&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The Independent|last=Hassan |first=Nihal|year=2007 |title=50,000 Iraqi Refugees forced into prostitution |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/50000-iraqi-refugees-forced-into-prostitution-454424.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Why–because analysis''' ('''WBA''') is a method for [[accident analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|date= April 1998|series=Spring Symposion|publisher=[[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]|title=Analysing Aviation Accidents Using WB-Analysis - an Application of Multimodal Reasoning|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/1998/SS-98-04/SS98-04-031.pdf|first1=Peter|last1=Ladkin|first2=Karsten|last2=Loer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent of application domain and has been used to analyse, among others, aviation-, railway-, marine-, and computer-related accidents and incidents. It is mainly used as an after the fact (or [[a posteriori]]) analysis method.  WBA strives to ensure objectivity, [[falsifiability]] and reproducibility of results.

The result of a WBA is a '''why–because graph''' ('''WBG'''). The WBG depicts [[causal relation]]s between factors of an accident. It is a [[directed acyclic graph]] where the nodes of the graph are factors. Directed edges denote  [[Causality|cause–effect]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] between the factors.

== WBA in detail ==

WBA starts with the question "What is the accident or accidents in question?". In most cases this is easy to define. Next comes an iterative process to determine causes. When causes for the accident have been identified, formal tests are applied to all potential cause-effect relations. This process can be iterated for the newfound causes, and so on, until a satisfactory result has been achieved.

At each node (factor), each contributing cause (related factor) must have been [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] to cause the accident, and the totality of causes must have been [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] to do so.

== The formal tests ==

The ''counterfactual test'' (CT) – The CT leads back to [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' formal notion of causality and [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]. The CT asks the following question: "If the cause had not been, could the effect have happened?". The CT proves or disproves that a cause is a necessary causal factor for an effect. Only if it is necessary for the cause in question then it is clearly contributing to the effect.

The ''causal sufficiency test'' – The CST asks the question: "Will an effect always happen if all attributed causes happen?". The CST aims at deciding whether a set of causes are sufficient for an effect to happen. The missing of causes can thus be identified.

Only if for all causal relations the CT is positive and for all sets of causes to their effects the CST is positive the WBG is correct: each cause must be necessary (CT), and the totality of causes must be sufficient (CST): nothing is omitted (CST: the listed causes are sufficient), and nothing is superfluous (CT: each cause is necessary).
