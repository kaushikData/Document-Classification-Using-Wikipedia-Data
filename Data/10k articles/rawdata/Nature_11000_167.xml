'''Artsivi (Eagle) Gorge Natural Monument''' ({{lang-ka|არწივის ხეობა}}) consists of two sites: limestone rock canyon and nearby forested area, where in [[5th century]] [[Khornabuji Castle|Khornabuji fortress]] was built. Sites are located in [[Dedoplistsqaro Municipality]],  [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]  and incorporated in Vashlovani Protected Areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.protectedplanet.net/eagle-canyon-natural-monument Eagle canyon in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eagle gorge is located 2 km from the city of [[Dedoplistsqaro]] on the [[limestone]] rock massive.  Here is the only local endemic species of Georgia - [[wikispecies:Campanula kachetica|Campanula kachetica]], rare species of [[wikispecies:Globularia trichosantha|Globularia trichosantha]], [[Galium pedemontanum]] and rare oriental thuja ([[Biota orientalis]]), which is not available in any other corner of Georgia.  Eagle gorge is also distinguished by more than sixty varieties  birds, including nesting rare species of birds - [[black stork]] and [[Griffon vulture]].  Eagle canyon is an ideal place for [[birdwatching]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">Bacteria biooxidation is an oxidation process caused by microbes where the valuable metal remains (but becomes enriched) in the solid phase.In this process, the metal remains in the solid phase and the liquid can be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.biomine.skelleftea.se/wiki/index.php/Biooxidation|title=Biooxidation - BioMineWiki|website=wiki.biomine.skelleftea.se|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Bacterial oxidation'''  is a [[biohydrometallurgy|biohydrometallurgical]] process developed for pre-[[cyanidation]] treatment of [[refractory]] [[gold]] [[ores]] or concentrates.  The [[bacterial culture]] is a mixed culture of ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'', ''[[Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]''.  The bacterial [[oxidation]] process comprises contacting refractory [[sulfide]] ROM ore or concentrate with a strain of the  bacterial culture for a suitable treatment period under an optimum operating environment.  The bacteria oxidise the sulfide minerals, thus liberating the occluded gold for subsequent recovery via [[cyanidation]].

The BIOX® process is a proprietary technology owned by Biomin South Africa and used under licence by a number of operating mines. The BIOX® process involves bacterial oxidation in agitated tanks for pre-treatment of refractory ores and concentrates ahead of conventional cyanide leach for gold recovery.

Under controlled continuous plant conditions, the number of bacterial cells and their activity is optimised to attain the highest rate of [[sulfide oxidation]].  The bacteria require a very [[acidic environment]] ([[pH]] 1.0 to 4.0), a [[temperature]] of between 30 and 45 °C, and a steady supply of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] for optimum growth and activity.  The unusual operating conditions for the bacteria are not favourable for the growth of most other [[microbes]], thus eliminating the need for sterility during the bacterial [[oxidation]] process.  Because organic substances are toxic to the bacteria, they are non-pathogenic and incapable of causing disease.  The bacteria employed in the process do not, therefore, pose a health risk to humans or any animals.

The bacterial oxidation of [[iron sulfide]] [[minerals]] produces [[iron(III) sulfate]] and [[sulfuric acid]], and in the case of [[arsenopyrite]], [[arsenic acid]] is also produced.  The arsenic is removed from the liquor by [[coprecipitation]] with the iron and sulfate in a two-stage [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralisation]] process.  This produces a solid neutralisation [[precipitate]] containing largely [[calcium sulfate]], basic [[iron(III) arsenate]] and [[iron(III) hydroxide]]. The iron(III) arsenate is sufficiently insoluble and stable to allow the neutralisation product to be safely disposed of on a slimes dam.  The neutralisation liquor, purified to contain an acceptable level of arsenic, can be re-used in the milling, flotation or bacterial oxidation circuits.

[[File:Beer–Lambert law in solution.JPG|thumb|A demonstration of the Beer–Lambert law: green laser light in a solution of [[Rhodamine B|Rhodamine 6B]]. The beam radiant power becomes weaker as it passes through solution]]
The '''Beer–Lambert law''', also known as '''Beer's law''', the '''Lambert–Beer law''', or the '''Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law''' relates the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] of [[light]] to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling. The law is commonly applied to [[chemical analysis]] measurements and used in understanding attenuation in [[physical optics]], for [[photons]], [[neutrons]] or rarefied gases. In [[mathematical physics]], this law arises as a solution of the [[Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook|BGK equation]].

== History ==
The law was discovered by [[Pierre Bouguer]] before 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bouguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JNkTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière''] (Paris, France: Claude Jombert, 1729) pp. 16–22.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who cited Bouguer's ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière'' (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729)—and even quoted from it—in his ''[[Photometria]]'' in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Lambert, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_zmpJAAAAYAAJ''Photometria sive de mensura et gradibus luminis, colorum et umbrae''] [Photometry, or, On the measure and gradations of light, colors, and shade] (Augsburg ("Augusta Vindelicorum"), Germany: Eberhardt Klett, 1760).&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert's law stated that absorbance of a material sample is directly proportional to its thickness (path length). Much later, [[August Beer]] discovered another attenuation relation in 1852. Beer's law stated that absorbance is proportional to the concentrations of the attenuating species in the material sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beer | first1 =  | year = 1852 | title = "Bestimmung der Absorption des rothen Lichts in farbigen Flüssigkeiten" (Determination of the absorption of red light in colored liquids) | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=PNmXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 | journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 78–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern derivation of the Beer–Lambert law combines the two laws and correlates the absorbance to both the concentrations of the attenuating species and the thickness of the material sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. D. J. |last=Ingle |first2=S. R. |last2=Crouch |title=Spectrochemical Analysis |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=New Jersey|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beer–Lambert law ==
By definition, the [[transmittance]] of material sample is related to its [[optical depth]] &lt;math&gt;{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; and to its [[absorbance]] ''A'' as
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}} = e^{-\tau} = 10^{-A},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radiant flux]] ''transmitted'' by that material sample;
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt;is the radiant flux received by that material sample.

The '''Beer–Lambert law''' states that, for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; attenuating species in the material sample,
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently that
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \sum_{i = 1}^N \tau_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_{i = 1}^N A_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] of the attenuating species &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the material sample;
*&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[number density]] of the attenuating species ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' in the material sample;
*&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;is the [[molar attenuation coefficient]] or [[Molar absorptivity|absorptivity]] of the attenuating species ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' in the material sample;
*&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amount concentration]] of the attenuating species ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' in the material sample;
*&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i = \frac{\mathrm{N_A}}{\ln{10}}\,\sigma_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and number density and amount concentration by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \frac{n_i}{\mathrm{N_A}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N_A}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]].

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Beer–Lambert law|file=B00626|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\ell\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i} = 10^{-\ell\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \ell\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \ell\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Cases of ''non-uniform'' attenuation occur in [[atmospheric science]] applications and [[radiation shielding]] theory for instance.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly [[scattering]]. If the radiation is especially intense, [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes can also cause variances. The main reason, however, is the following. At high concentrations, the [[Molecule|molecules]] are closer to each other and begin to interact with each other. This interaction will change several properties of the molecule, and thus will change the attenuation.

=== Expression with attenuation coefficient ===
The Beer–Lambert law can be expressed in terms of [[attenuation coefficient]], but in this case is better called Lambert's law since amount concentration, from Beer's law, is hidden inside the attenuation coefficient. The (Napierian) attenuation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and the decadic attenuation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu_{10}=\mu/\ln 10&lt;/math&gt; of a material sample are related to its number densities and amount concentrations as
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_i(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i(z),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{10}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_{10,i}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i(z)&lt;/math&gt;
respectively, by definition of attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient. Then the Beer–Lambert law becomes
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int_0^\ell \mu(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\,\mathrm{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\mu\ell} = 10^{-\mu_{10}\ell},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \mu\ell,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \mu_{10}\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivation ==
Assume that a beam of light enters a material sample. Define ''z'' as an axis parallel to the direction of the beam. Divide the material sample into thin slices, perpendicular to the beam of light, with thickness d''z'' sufficiently small that one particle in a slice cannot obscure another particle in the same slice when viewed along the ''z'' direction. The radiant flux of the light that emerges from a slice is reduced, compared to that of the light that entered, by {{nobreak|1=dΦ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = −''μ''(''z'')Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') d''z''}}, where ''μ'' is the (Napierian) [[attenuation coefficient]], which yields the following first-order [[Linear differential equation|linear ODE]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z) = -\mu(z)\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z).&lt;/math&gt;
The attenuation is caused by the photons that did not make it to the other side of the slice because of [[scattering]] or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. The solution to this differential equation is obtained by multiplying the [[integrating factor]]
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'}&lt;/math&gt;
throughout to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'} + \mu(z)\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which simplifies due to the [[product rule]] (applied backwards) to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\bigl(\Phi_\mathrm{e}(z)\,e^{\int_0^z \mu(z')\mathrm{d}z'}\bigr) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating both sides and solving for Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for a material of real thickness ''ℓ'', with the incident radiant flux upon the slice {{nobreak|1=Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(0)}} and the transmitted radiant flux {{nobreak|1=Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; = Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'' )}} gives
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t} = \Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}\,e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
and finally
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{t}}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{i}} = e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the decadic attenuation coefficient ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is related to the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient by {{nobreak|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μ''/ln 10}}, one also have
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\int_0^\ell \ln{10}\,\mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z} = \bigl(e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z}\bigr)^{\ln{10}} = 10^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z}.&lt;/math&gt;

To describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[Number density|number densities]] ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the ''N'' attenuating species of the material sample, one introduces the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] {{nobreak|1=''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')/''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}}. ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has the dimension of an area; it expresses the likelihood of interaction between the particles of the beam and the particles of the specie ''i'' in the material sample:
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can also use the [[molar attenuation coefficient]]s {{nobreak|1=''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = (N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/ln 10)''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]], to describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[amount concentration]]s {{nobreak|1=''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')/N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the attenuating species of the material sample:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\ln{10}}{\mathrm{N_A}}\varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z} = \\
 \Bigl(e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell \frac{n_i(z)}{\mathrm{N_A}}\mathrm{d}z}\Bigr)^{\ln{10}} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\mathrm{d}z}.\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

== Validity ==
Under certain conditions Beer–Lambert law fails to maintain a linear relationship between attenuation and concentration of [[analyte]].&lt;ref&gt;Mehta A.[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/05/ultraviolet-visible-uv-vis-spectroscopy-%E2%80%93-limitations-and-deviations-of-beer-lambert-law/ Limitations and Deviations of Beer–Lambert Law]&lt;/ref&gt; These deviations are classified into three categories:
# Real—fundamental deviations due to the limitations of the law itself.
# Chemical—deviations observed due to specific chemical species of the sample which is being analyzed.
# Instrument—deviations which occur due to how the attenuation measurements are made.

There are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for Beer–Lambert law to be valid. These are:
# The attenuators must act independently of each other.
# The attenuating medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume.
# The attenuating medium must not scatter the radiation—no [[turbidity]]—unless this is accounted for as in [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]].
# The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the absorbing medium.
# The incident radiation should preferably be [[monochromatic]], or have at least a width that is narrower than that of the attenuating transition. Otherwise a spectrometer as detector for the power is needed instead of a photodiode which has not a selective wavelength dependence.
# The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a non-invasive probe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical saturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise to stimulated emission.

If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from Beer–Lambert law.

The Beer–Lambert law is not compatible with [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayerhöfer|first=Thomas G.|last2=Mutschke|first2=Harald|last3=Popp|first3=Jürgen|date=2016-04-01|title=Employing Theories Far beyond Their Limits—The Case of the (Boguer-) Beer–Lambert Law|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cphc.201600114/abstract|journal=ChemPhysChem|language=en|pages=1948–1955|doi=10.1002/cphc.201600114|issn=1439-7641|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being strict, the law does not describe the transmittance through a medium, but the propagation within that medium. It can be made compatible with Maxwell's equations if the transmittance of a sample with solute is ratioed against the transmittance of the pure solvent which explains why it works so well in [[Spectrophotometry, ultraviolet|spectrophotometry]]. As this is not possible for pure media, the uncritical employment of the Beer–Lambert law can easily generate errors of the order of 100% or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In such cases it is necessary to apply the [[Transfer-matrix method (optics)|Transfer-matrix method]].

== Chemical analysis by spectrophotometry ==
Beer–Lambert law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by [[spectrophotometry]], without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of [[bilirubin]] in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar attenuation coefficient ''ε'' is known. Measurements of decadic attenuation coefficient ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; are made at one wavelength ''λ'' that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences. The amount concentration ''c'' is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\mu_{10}(\lambda)}{\varepsilon(\lambda)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two species at amount concentrations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The decadic attenuation coefficient at any wavelength ''λ'' is, given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{10}(\lambda) = \varepsilon_1(\lambda) c_1 + \varepsilon_2(\lambda) c_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the amount concentrations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as long as the molar attenuation coefficient of the two components, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]]. In practice it is better to use [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of ''N'' wavelengths for a mixture containing ''N'' components.

The law is used widely in [[infra-red spectroscopy]] and [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] for analysis of [[polymer degradation]] and [[oxidation]] (also in biological tissue) as well as to measure the [[concentration]] of various compounds in different [[food]] samples. The [[carbonyl group]] attenuation at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the [[polymer]] calculated.

== Beer–Lambert law in the atmosphere ==
This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The optical depth for a slant path is {{nobreak|1=''τ''′ = ''mτ''}}, where ''τ'' refers to a vertical path, ''m'' is called the [[airmass|relative airmass]], and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as {{nobreak|1=''m'' = sec ''θ''}} where ''θ'' is the [[zenith angle]] corresponding to the given path. The Beer–Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-m(\tau_\mathrm{a} + \tau_\mathrm{g} + \tau_\mathrm{RS} + \tau_\mathrm{NO_2} + \tau_\mathrm{w} + \tau_\mathrm{O_3} + \tau_\mathrm{r} + \ldots)},&lt;/math&gt;
where each ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:
* a refers to [[aerosols]] (that absorb and scatter);
* g are uniformly mixed gases (mainly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  and molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which only absorb);
* NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[nitrogen dioxide]], mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only);
* RS are effects due to [[Raman scattering]] in the atmosphere;
* w is [[water vapour]] [[water absorption|absorption]];
* O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is [[ozone]] (absorption only);
* r is [[Rayleigh scattering]] from molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (responsible for the blue color of the sky);
* the selection of the attenuators which have to be considered depends on the wavelength range and can include various other compounds. This can include [[tetraoxygen]], [[HONO]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glyoxal]], a series of halogen radicals and others.

''m'' is the ''optical mass'' or ''[[airmass]] factor'', a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of ''θ'') to 1/cos ''θ'', where ''θ'' is the observed object's [[celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] (the angle measured from the direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site). This equation can be used to retrieve ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the aerosol [[optical depth|optical thickness]], which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.

'''Bog snorkelling''' is a sporting event in which competitors complete, in the shortest time possible, two consecutive lengths of a water-filled trench cut through a [[peat bog]]. Competitors must wear [[Snorkelling|snorkel]]s and [[Swimfin|flippers]] and complete the course without using conventional [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] strokes, relying on flipper power alone.  A [[wetsuit]] is not compulsory, but is often worn.

The length of the trench is {{convert|60|yds|m}}, traversed twice for a course of {{convert|120|yds|m}}.&lt;ref name="irishbog"&gt;Irish Bog Snorkelling (2009).

The world record was set by Neil Rutter at the Waen Rydd bog, [[Llanwrtyd Wells]] on 26 August 2018 with a time of 1 min 18.81 secs.

Paddy Lambe finished the Irish championship event in a time of 1:19 in September 2016.

==History of bog snorkelling==
The activity of bog snorkelling was started in 1976 near [[Llanwrtyd Wells]], [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]]. It began as a result of an over-the-bar conversation in The Neuadd Arms between Gordon Green and a few regulars.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==World Bog Snorkelling Championship==
The '''World Bog Snorkelling Championship''', first held in 1985, takes place every August [[Bank Holiday]] in the dense Waen Rydd peat bog, near [[Llanwrtyd Wells]] in [[mid Wales]]. In 2018 Neil Rutter smashed the previous world record held by Kirsty Johnston when he returned a time of 1 min 18.81 secs.

Elinor MacCormac (1 min 48.46) is the 2018 Ladies Champion. The ladies' champion 2017, Jess Fidler, had a time of 1 min  41.87 secs. Paddy Lambe, the 2016 Irish champion, set a time at the Irish Bog Snorkelling Championships in September 2016 of 1:19, a new world record for bog snorkelling. The Irish event in 2016 was also the first time a brother and sister won the national championship in the same year. Moira Lambe, Paddy's sister, won the ladies' event in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mayhem-in-the-muck-at-bog-snorkelling-championship-35040728.html|title=Mayhem in the muck at bog snorkelling championship - Independent.ie|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bog snorkelling events take place, particularly in Wales, but also in [[Australia]], [[Ireland]], and [[Sweden]]. Associated events include the associated [[mountain bike]] bog snorkelling, where competitors must ride through the bog on specially prepared mountain bikes, and the Bog Snorkelling [[Triathlon]], which consists of a 60-yard (110 metre){{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{Fix|text=numbers don't match}} Snorkel, a 12-mile (31 kilometre) bike ride and an 8-mile run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-events.co.uk/events.php?sel_year=2009#id28|title=World Bog Snorkelling Championship|accessdate=January 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kgbo" &gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/teenager-in-bog-snorkelling-record-29526605.html|title=Teenager in bog snorkelling record|author= |accessdate=4 June 2014|date=25 August 2013|work=Belfasttelegraph|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeds from the championship go to a local charity each year. Charities include the [[Cystic Fibrosis Trust]] (2005) and the Motor Neurone Association (2006). The 2006 charity was chosen in memory of the Green Events treasurer, Ron Skilton, who died in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llanwrtyd-wells.powys.org.uk/bog.html|title=Llanwrtyd Wells Bog Snorkelling site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214181427/http://llanwrtyd-wells.powys.org.uk/bog.html |archivedate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STS040-614-61.jpg|thumb|right|NASA image of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] showing the green bosque area surrounding the [[Rio Grande]]]]
[[File:Bosque in the spring.jpg|thumb|right|Ballooning through the bosque near the Rio Grande River.]]
A '''bosque''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|s|k|ɛ}} {{respell|BOHS|keh}}) is a type of [[gallery forest]] habitat found along the [[riparian]] [[flood plain]]s of stream and river banks in the [[southwestern United States]].  It derives its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''[[wikt:bosque|woodlands]]''.

== Setting ==
In the predominantly [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]] southwestern United States, a bosque is an [[oasis]]-like ribbon of green vegetation, often [[Canopy (forest)|canopied]], that only exists near rivers, streams, or other water courses.  The most notable bosque is the {{convert|300|mi|km|adj=on}}-long [[ecosystem]] along the middle [[Rio Grande]] in [[New Mexico]] that extends from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] south to [[El Paso, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=65792|title=Rio Bosque Wetlands Park|last=(CERM)|first=Center for Environmental Research &amp; Management|website=research.utep.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous and ecologically intact sections of the bosque is included in the [[Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge]].

== Flora and fauna ==
Common trees in the bosque [[habitat]] include [[mesquite]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], [[Chilopsis|desert willow]], and [[Forestiera pubescens|desert olive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://bemp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BEMP_comprehensive_report-1997-2009.pdf|title=Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (BEMP) Comprehensive Report: 1997-2009|last=Eichhorst|first=Kim D.|date=June 2012|publisher=University of New Mexico|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is often only a single canopy layer and because the tree species found in the bosque are generally [[deciduous]], a wide variety of shrubs, grasses, and other understory vegetation is also supported.  [[Celtis|Desert hackberry]], [[blue palo verde]], [[Condalia|graythorn (''Condalia lycioides'')]], [[Sambucus|Mexican elder (''Sambucus mexicana '')]], [[virgin's bower]],&lt;!--a common "common" name: is a Clematis intended here?--&gt; and [[Aralia racemosa|Indian root]]&lt;!-- possibly Aralia racemosa?--&gt; all flourish in the bosque. The habitat also supports a large variety of [[lichen]]s.  For a semi-arid region, there is extraordinary [[biodiversity]] at the interface of the bosque and surrounding [[desert]] ecosystems. Certain subsets of vegetative association are defined within the [[A.W. Kuchler|Kuchler scheme]], including the ''[[Mesquite Bosque]]''.

The bosque is an important stopover for a variety of migratory birds, such as ducks, geese, egrets, herons, and [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Cranes]]. Year-round avian residents include Red-tailed hawks, Cooper's hawks, American kestrels, hummingbirds, owls, woodpeckers, and the [[southwestern willow flycatcher]]. Aquatic fauna of the bosque include the endangered [[Rio Grande silvery minnow]].

==Restoration==
Ongoing efforts to undo damage to the bosque ecosystem caused by human development, fires, and [[invasive species]] in the 20th century. Where possible, [[levee]]s and other flood control devices along the Rio Grande are being removed, to allow the river to undergo its natural cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/215/10856|title=Bringing back the bosque: Pueblo tribes take the lead in restoring the Rio Grande's riverside forest|last=Hanscom|first=Greg|date=2001-11-19|work=High Country News|access-date=2018-01-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996, Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (BEMP) of the University of New Mexico has worked on [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]] and ecological monitoring within the bosque, as well as raising awareness of the ecological importance of this habitat through educational outreach initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bemp.org/history/|title=History of BEMP|last=|first=|date=|website=bemp.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Climate Research''''' is a small [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the Inter-Research Science Center that was established in 1990. Its founder and long time publisher was marine biologist [[Otto Kinne]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.int-res.com/journals/cr/about-the-journal/ |title=Inter Research » Journals » CR » Information |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the climate research community, the journal is mostly known for its 2003 publication of a controversial and now discredited climate change article.

Three volumes, each typically containing half a dozen articles, are published each year. Each of its 12 editors therefore handles an average of less than 2 articles a year. ''Climate Research'' covers all aspects of the interactions of climate with organisms, [[ecosystem]]s, and human societies. In 2006, a special issue of the journal, titled "Advances in Applying Climate Prediction to Agriculture", was published under [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://start.org/programs/climag|title=Climate Prediction and Agriculture (CLIMAG)|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v33/n1/|title=CR - Vol. 33, No. 1 - Table of contents|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nephology''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; from the Greek word ''nephos'' for 'cloud') is the study of [[cloud]]s and cloud formation. British meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] was a major researcher within this field, establishing a [[Cloud#Classification|cloud classification system]].

While this branch of [[meteorology]] still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used.  The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth.&lt;ref&gt;

Recently, interest in nephology (if not the name) has surged as many meteorologists have begun to focus on the relationship between clouds and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8f279aca-b0f6-11db-b901-0000779e2340.html Fluffy Thinking] ''Financial Times''.  Retrieved 2007-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since the late 1990s, some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of [[cosmic ray]]s, that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet.

The '''Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly''' is a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] ([[volcanic complex]]) on the [[Moon]]. It is on the [[far side of the Moon]] and was found by a [[gamma-ray spectrometer]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="lps42"/&gt; It is an area of concentrated [[thorium]], a radioactive element.&lt;ref name="1b"/&gt; Lunar rock samples from the [[Apollo missions]] reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt;

==Description==
The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly was found in 1998 by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) instrument on board the [[Lunar Prospector]] (LP) and subsequently identified as a hotspot, located around {{coord|61.1|N|99.5|E|globe:Moon_type:landmark}}.&lt;ref name="1b"&gt;{{cite conference |bibcode=2002LPI....33.1970L |title = Small-Area Thorium Enhancements on the Lunar Surface |conference=33rd Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |last1=Lawrence |first1=D.

Compared to the Earth's thorium concentration of {{nowrap|0.06 µg/g}}, the Compton–Belkovich's is very high.&lt;ref name="SMALLAREA"/&gt; It has unusually high [[reflectance]], identified by a visible imaging study that was carried out later by the [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] spacecraft in a Clementine Visible Images study.&lt;ref name="1e"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo1212|title=Non-mare silicic volcanism on the lunar farside at Compton–Belkovich |date=July 24, 2010|journal=Nature Geoscience|author=Bradley L.

[[File:Compton-Belkovich Thorium Anomaly.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly's location on the Moon.]]

===Location===
The anomaly is between the [[Bel'kovich (crater)|Bel'kovich]] crater, which is {{convert|214|km}} wide, and the [[Compton (crater)|Compton]] crater, which is {{convert|162|km}} wide.&lt;ref name="SMALLAREA"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2003JE002050 | title = Small-area thorium features on the lunar surface | year = 2003 | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = D.

The center of the region is a volcanic complex, {{convert|25|km}} to {{convert|35|km}} across, between the Bel'kovich and the [[Compton (crater)|Compton]] craters. It is {{convert|900|km}} from the extent of the northeastern [[Lunar terrane|Procellarum KREEP Terrane]] (an area which has high abundances of [[KREEP]], a geochemical component of some lunar rocks).&lt;ref name="lps42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1b" /&gt;

===Features===
In the center of the elevated region is a depression; this is bounded by [[cliff|scarps]] and may be some kind of [[caldera]].
Just to the north is a feature called Little Dome, {{convert|500|m}} in diameter. Further north is an elongated dome, oriented north-south, called Middle Dome. It is {{convert|2.5|km}} long and {{convert|0.6|km}} wide. Both Little Dome and Middle Dome have boulders on top that may be [[volcanic block]]s. Big Dome is further to the north at the edge of the anomaly. It is {{convert|2.5|km}} in diameter with a depression in the top.&lt;ref name="lps42"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2011/pdf/2224.pdf|conference=42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |title=Compton-Belkovich: Nonmare, Silicic Volcanism on the Moon’s Far Side|last1=Jolliff|first1=B.

An extension of the reflective material extends to the south-east from the elevated region by about {{convert|7|km}}. This may be a [[pyroclastic flow]]. This more highly reflective area also matches an area that shows a [[Christiansen feature]] with shorter wavelength. It reflects more strongly in the 7.1 to 7.5&amp;nbsp;μm range, which indicates [[quartz]] or [[alkali feldspar]] is the major constituent.&lt;ref name="lps42"/&gt;

Explosive remains also appear scattered to the east for about 300&amp;nbsp;km covering an area of 70,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Durham University|title=Extent of Moon's giant volcanic eruption is revealed|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-03-extent-moon-giant-volcanic-eruption.html|publisher=PhysOrg|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volcanic slope===
Volcanic features provide information about the composition of the lava that formed the Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly. On average, many volcanoes on the Moon have slopes of lower than 7 degrees. However, the Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly has a slope which reaches 25 degrees at the highest. This suggests that the region was formed by more viscous lava.&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{cite conference| title = Scientific Return from Systematic Imaging of the Constellation Exploration Sites: Compton–Belkovich Example | bibcode =2010LPI....41.2412J| author1 = Jolliff| first1 = B.

===Composition===
Using infrared reflectance data from Clementine at 750&amp;nbsp;nm and 950&amp;nbsp;nm, the level of iron oxide was determined to be about 3% by mass.&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2002/pdf/1967.pdf|title=The Compton-Belkovich Region of the Moon: Remotely Sensed Observations and Lunar Sample Association|last1=Gillis|first1=J.

H. |last5=Prettyman |year=2002 |conference=33rd Lunar and Planetary Science|accessdate=May 14, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
A direct analysis of [[Apollo program]] samples revealed that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago. However, volcanic activity on the unsampled lunar back side could have occurred around 1 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="1e"/&gt; The smoothness of the surface associated with the anomaly indicates that it could possibly have been formed in a more recent event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1029/1999JE001177 | title =Thorium abundances on the lunar surface | year =2000 | last1 =Lawrence | first1 =D.

As the [[lava]] cooled, it would have [[crystallize]]d to produce a [[Silicate mineral|silicate structure]]; [[incompatible element]]s such as thorium would have been excluded from the process and formed thorium-rich pockets in the remaining liquid rock.&lt;ref name="1e"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1029/2000GL012739 | title =Compositional structure within the lunar crust as constrained by Lunar Prospector thorium data | year =2001 | last1 =Warren | first1 =Paul H. | journal =Geophysical Research Letters | volume =28 | issue =13 | pages =2565–2568|bibcode = 2001GeoRL..28.2565W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption associated with the thorium anomaly could have created the elevated features to the west and the low and broad area to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ngeo1212 | title = Non-mare silicic volcanism on the lunar farside at Compton–Belkovich | year = 2011 | last1 = Jolliff | first1 = Bradley L. | last2 = Wiseman | first2 = Sandra A. | last3 = Lawrence | first3 = Samuel J. | last4 = Tran | first4 = Thanh N. | last5 = Robinson | first5 = Mark S. | last6 = Sato | first6 = Hiroyuki | last7 = Hawke | first7 = B.

The '''Eastern Dry Forest''' lies at the eastern end of [[Grand Cayman]], one of the [[Cayman Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is one of the territory’s [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs).

==Description==
Eastern Dry Forest is a 239&amp;nbsp;ha tract of native [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] lying north of the town of East End. The only area of dry forest left at the eastern end of the island, it is privately owned, unprotected and is subject to [[deforestation|clearance]] and fragmentation. In the 1980s the site contained some of the largest trees on the island and was an important breeding site for parrots.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

===Birds===
The IBA was identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports populations of [[Cuban amazon]]s, [[Caribbean elaenia]]s, [[thick-billed vireo]]s, [[Yucatan vireo]]s and [[vitelline warbler]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Eastern Dry Forest |accessdate=2014-04-01 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QE8rvIqH?url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Family portrait (Voyager 1).png|250px|thumb|alt=The ''Family Portrait'' of the Solar system taken by ''Voyager 1'']]
[[File:Voyager Portrait Family diagram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Diagram of the Voyager ''Family Portrait''|Diagram of the ''Voyager 1'' ''Family Portrait''.]]

The '''''Family Portrait''''', or sometimes '''''Portrait of the Planets''''', is an image of the [[Solar System]] acquired by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' on February 14, 1990 from a distance of approximately 6 billion kilometers from Earth.  It features individual frames of six planets and a partial background indicating their relative positions.  The picture is a [[mosaic]] of 60 individual frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/charts/solar-system-family-portrait.html | title=Planetary.org | accessdate=March 23, 2014 | author=Planetary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frames used to compose the image were the last photographs taken by either Voyager spacecraft (which continued to relay other telemetry afterward).

These frames were also the source of the famous ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' image of the [[Earth]]. Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was part of the Voyager imaging team, campaigned for many years to have the pictures taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00451 | title=Photojournal | publisher=Photojournal | accessdate=March 23, 2014 | author=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voyager_1_-_14_February_1990.png|thumb|Position of ''Voyager 1'' above the plane of the ecliptic on February 14, 1990]]

==Description==
Six [[planets]] are visible in the mosaic, from left to right: [[Jupiter]], [[Earth]], [[Venus]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]]. The [[Sun]], also a point of light at this distance, is included in the image.  [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] was too close to the Sun to be seen, [[Mars]] could not be detected by the Voyager cameras due to light from the Sun behind it scattering in the optics, and [[Pluto]] (which in 1990 was still considered a planet) was not included because its small size and distance from the Sun left it too dim to image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3405/voyagers-group-portrait | title=astrobio.net | accessdate=March 23, 2014 | author=astrobio.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image does not have a unified appearance. The individual frames were acquired using various filters at varying exposures to bring out as much detail as possible in each. For example, the Sun was imaged with the darkest filter and shortest exposure available, to avoid damaging the Imaging Science System [[vidicon tube]]s. The majority of the frames were acquired in gray scale with the probe's Wide-Angle Camera, while the close-up views of each planet were acquired in color using the Narrow-Angle Camera.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The image was acquired at a distance of approximately 40.11 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from Earth and approximately 32° above the [[ecliptic]] plane. Of the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft, ''Voyager 1'' was chosen to create the mosaic because its trajectory had taken it above the plane of the Solar System, and unlike ''[[Voyager 2]]'', was in a position to view Jupiter free of light disturbances by the Sun's glare. In 2013, a reverse image was taken of ''Voyager 1'', using radio telescopes. ''Voyager 1'' cannot be seen in visible light, but its radio signal is very bright compared to most natural things studied by radio telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Flow-following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model''' (FIM) is an experimental [[numerical weather prediction]] model that was developed at the [[Earth System Research Laboratory]] in the United States from 2008 to 2016.

The FIM was developed as a candidate to eventually supplant the [[Global Forecast System]], the United States's current medium-range forecast model. The FIM was originally slated to become operational some time in 2014 but never did so. The model produces similar results to the GFS, but runs slower on the NWS's operational computers.  Its three-part name derives from its key features: "flow-following" indicates that its vertical coordinates are based on both terrain and [[potential temperature]] (isentropic [[sigma coordinates]], previously used in the now-discontinued [[rapid update cycle]] model), and [[Finite volume method|"finite-volume" describes the method]] used for calculating horizontal transport. The "icosahedral" portion describes the model's most uncommon feature: whereas most grid-based forecast models have historically used rectangular grid points (a less than ideal arrangement for a planet that is a slightly [[oblate spheroid]]), the FIM instead fits Earth to a [[Goldberg polyhedron]] with [[icosahedral symmetry]], with twelve evenly spaced pentagons (including two at the poles) anchoring a grid of hexagons.

In November 2016, the ESRL announced it was no longer pursuing the FIM as a replacement for the GFS and would be instead developing the FV3, which uses some of the FIM's principles except on a square grid. The FIM will continue to be run for experimental purposes until FV3 commences. The FIM will also be upgraded with some of the same features as FV3 (retaining the icosahedral grid) and coupling to examine the use of the model in the longer ranges.

The FIM runs as a multiscale model, with a suffix number indicating the model's horizontal resolution. FIM7 operates at a spatial resolution of approximately 60 km, FIM8 at 30 km, FIM9 at 15 km and FIM9.5 at 10 km. Each scale runs on a temporal resolution of 6-hour steps. As of 2017, only the FIM7 (running out 10 days) and FIM8 (running out 14 days) continue to be run daily. The FIM7 also runs four runs between Tuesday and Wednesday each week as a [[climate model]], with the mean output from those runs issued in one-week intervals; it thus complements the [[Climate Forecast System]], the only other model in the U.S. government's arsenal that covers that time frame.

A well-preserved, pristine wilderness, it contains the largest remaining raised bog in Northern Europe.&lt;ref name=Vild/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=largest&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lillevildmose.dk/en/|title= Danish wilderness recreation|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Lillevildmose.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its habitat consists of raised bogs (once part of the seabed), former islands (during the [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]]), and a large area of coastal hills and [[beach meadow]]s.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;
[[File:Tofte Sø da 090822.jpg|thumbnail|left|Tofte Lake]]
The raised bogs flourished undisturbed for 1,200 years till they were intentionally drained around 1750. They contain layers of [[peat]] growing at an annual rate of {{Convert|4|-|5|mm}} and reaching a depth of {{Convert|5|m}}. Rainwater provides the nutrients.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; Tofte Lake (''Tofte sø'') has been formed after draining the marsh over a period of 200 years. The deciduous forests of Høstemark, Tofte, and Mose are part of the protected area secured by fencing. Trees have started to grow on the Portlandmose and Paraplymose, both raised bogs, as a result of drainage.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

==History==
Rye was cultivated in Lille Vildmose prior to the medieval period when hemp was introduced for diversification, after ca. 1140. Agricultural production dropped and farmland in Lille Vildmose was abandoned between 1360 and 1540 due to the [[Black Death]] plague, resulting in the regeneration of woodland. After 1540, farming was intensified, the main products being rye and hemp.{{sfn|Clarke|Merlin|2013|p=176}} 
By 1760, when Lille Vildmose belonged to the Lindenborg Estate, more than {{convert|5,000| ha|abbr=on}} were tilled for the estate's farm, Vildmosegård.{{sfn|Kjærgaard|2006|p=43}}
In the early 19th century, the reclamation of Lille Vildmose was the impetus needed to establish a peat industry.{{sfn|Kjærgaard|2006|p=113}} The peatcutting have now been terminated completely for many reasons of which the conservation efforts is just one.

In 2003, together with [[Mols Bjerge National Park|Mols Bjerge]] and [[Møn]], Lille Vildmose was selected by the Ministry of the Environment to participate in a pilot project to develop a model for Danish national parks.{{sfn|Bell|Simpson|Tyrväinen|Sievänen|2008|p=100}} 
[[File:Lille Vildmosecentret da 090821.jpg|right|thumb|Lille Vildmosecentret]]
The visitor center, Lille Vildmosecentret, was designed by [[C. F. Møller Architects]] and opened in 2006. It contains an activity center and is also the starting point for visiting the bogs and forests.&lt;ref name=largest/&gt; Wildlife can be observed from the park's look-out tower. An eagle simulator, landscape models, interactive exhibits, recreation areas for children, and hiking paths are other features.&lt;ref name=Vild/&gt; Double-decker bus service began in 2009 from [[Hobro]] in the south to Egense near [[Hals, Denmark|Hals]] in the north.

==Flora and fauna==
Høstemark and Tofte forests and bogs have been undisturbed habitats for flora and fauna. There are 12-15 different species of plants including ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss, [[Ericaceae|heather]], [[bell heather]], [[crowberry]], [[Ericaceae|rosemary heather]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Rhynchospora|white beak rush]] and [[Eriophorum|tue-cottongrass]]; a rare plant is [[cloudberry]]. Flowering plants grow on the peat sponge.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; There are no trees within the bog, however [[birch]] and [[willow]] are recorded in the bog's wooded marginal zones known as "[[Lagg (landform)|lagg]]".&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

A stock of [[red deer]] totals about 550 animals. Other fauna reported in the moor area includes wild [[boar]]s, [[otter]]s, and [[fox]]es. [[Moose]], [[beaver]]s, [[wild horse]]s and [[Heck cattle]] were proposed to be introduced in the protected zones. The area is a breeding ground for [[golden eagle]]s. [[Cormorant]]s, [[crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[raven]]s and [[crow]]s are also noted, [[white-tailed eagle]] frequents the area and [[black stork]], [[red kite]] and [[short-eared owl]] have been recorded occasionally on the bog. Tofte Lake is an ornithological haven, where native ducks breed and migrating ducks flock apart from [[Greylag goose|gray geese]], [[marsh harrier]] and [[Montagu's harrier]]. The lake has Denmark's largest cormorant colony of about 4,000 pairs. &lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

In September 2011 a large common European conservation programme was initiated for Lille Vildmose under [[the LIFE Programme]]. It is budgeted at € 5,5 million and scheduled to terminate with the end of the year 2016.

=== Project Aurochs ===
[[File:Urokse.jpg|right|thumb|The Taurus bull ″Leonardo″ ([[Chianina]] × [[Heck cattle|Heck]]) from Lille Vildmose, 2004.]]
The [[Aurochs]] is an extinct species of large wild cattle that once inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa. In 2003 the [[breeding back|back-breeding]] project Projekt Urokse ('Project Aurochs') was initiated in Lille Vildmose, in which a [[Crossbreed|crossbred]] population of [[Heck cattle]], [[Chianina]] and [[Sayaguesa Cattle|Sayaguesa]] was released under controlled conditions and is being bred and selected for heightened similarity to the extinct aurochs in both [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (looks) and [[instincts]] (behaviour).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051028215321/http://www.nja.dk/NR/rdonlyres/ecwlmvg5bshiwvkk573oixwfdzty2cdygur226qyl2ydxxk2rjn3rz27kdsqapwukqtxy6q7axs4jb2ggzt3hrza5td/FolderUrokseprojekt.pdf Projekt Urokse – A pilot project from Lille Vildmose National Park]  pdf. The Amt of Northern Jutland. 2005. Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding herd consisted of one Chianina × Heck bull, four Heck cows and one Sayaguesa × Heck cow, and in 2009 three Sayaguesa bulls were added.  As of 2010, the herd had grown to a size of 56 individuals.&lt;ref name='Status rapport 2007–2010'&gt; Uffe Gjøl Sørensen: ''[http://www.aalborgkommune.dk/kultur-og-fritid/Natur/Naturomraader/Lillevildmose/Documents/Status-rapport-endelig.pdf Vildokserne ved Lille Vildmose 2003–2010.

Retrieved 26 November 2013. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is part of the [[Taurus cattle|Taurus Project]] initiated in Germany in 1996, which is not to be confused with the newer [[Tauros Programme]] initiated in the Netherlands.

A '''South American hurricane''' is a [[tropical cyclone]] that affects the continent of South America or its countries. The continent is rarely affected by tropical cyclones, though most storms to hit the area are formed in the North [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; Typically, strong upper level winds and its proximity to the equator prevents North Atlantic impacts.&lt;ref name="asktom"&gt;{{cite web|year=2004 |title=Ask Tom Why |publisher=WGN9 Chicago |accessdate=2006-07-20 |url=http://wgntv.trb.com/news/weather/weblog/wgnweather/archives/000098.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427143006/http://wgntv.trb.com/news/weather/weblog/wgnweather/archives/000098.html |archivedate=2006-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No tropical cyclone has ever affected the Pacific side of South America.  Although conditions are typically too hostile for many storms to hit the area from the South Atlantic Ocean, there have been a few tropical cyclones to affect land. Based on climatology, northern [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] have a 1 to 5% chance of a hurricane strike in any given year, while all locations south of 10° N have less than a 1% chance of a direct hit.&lt;ref name="sciencepolicy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pielke, Rubiera, Landsea, Fernández, and Klein|year=2003|title=Hurricane Vulnerability in Latin America &amp; The Caribbean|publisher=National Hazards Review|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-1769-2003.21.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 43 tropical cyclones have affected the continent since 1588.

==Storms in the South Atlantic==
{{main|South Atlantic tropical cyclone}}
The [[South Atlantic Ocean]] is generally inhospitable to the formation of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the South Atlantic Ocean near [[Brazil]], such as the unofficially-named [[Hurricane Catarina]] of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2 on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]]. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as [[Subtropical Storm Arani]]. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.

*January 28, 2009 – A cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level warm-core low formed a system over Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil and moved eastward into the South Atlantic. The system was eventually classified as a subtropical cyclone, making it the only subtropical cyclone on record to affect South America, and the second subtropical system ever recorded in the South Atlantic, with the first being a subtropical cyclone in 1974. Winds exceeded {{convert|54|knots}} on the coast of Uruguay and extreme southern Rio Grande do Sul, and the system produced {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall or more in 24 hours in some locations of Rocha (Uruguay) and southern Rio Grande do Sul.

==Tropical cyclone warnings and watches==
[[Image:SC Breakpoints.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Tropical Cyclone Breakpoints in South America]]
In the event an [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]] threatens the northern coast of South America, the [[National Hurricane Center]] defines nine locations as [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical cyclone warning breakpoints]]. The westernmost is the border between [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]], and the easternmost is [[Georgetown, Guyana]], located at 6.82° N. In the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], tropical cyclone warning breakpoints extend eastward to the border of Panama and Colombia at 7.23° N.&lt;ref name="breakpoint"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center |year=2006 |title=Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watch/Warning Breakpoints |accessdate=2006-11-18 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints_list.shtml? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708223310/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints_list.shtml |archivedate=July 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Atlantic hurricane has existed south of 6.82° N,&lt;ref name="hurdat"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division |year=2006 |title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851–2005 |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=2006-11-18 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705190625/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt |archivedate=2006-07-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and no [[Pacific hurricane]] has existed east of 80° W,&lt;ref name="epachurdat"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division |year=2006 |title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949–2005 |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2006-11-18 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614182321/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt |archivedate=2006-06-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the event a tropical cyclone threatens a region of South America without warnings, additional warning sites can be selected. In addition to warnings on the mainland of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines the entire island of San Andres as a tropical cyclone warning breakpoint.&lt;ref name="breakpoint"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9819">There are fourteen extant [[family (biology)|families]] of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Testudines]], an order of [[reptile]] commonly known as turtles, [[tortoise]]s and [[terrapin]]s. The testudines are some of the most ancient reptiles alive, with only the [[tuatara]]s considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 [[extant species]] and 97 [[genera]] of testudines, split into two [[suborders]]: the [[Cryptodira]]ns and the [[Pleurodira]]ns. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The [[Pelomedusidae]] and [[Chelidae]] are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The [[Carettochelyidae]], [[Cheloniidae]], [[Chelydridae]], [[Dermatemydidae]], [[Dermochelyidae]], [[Emydidae]], [[Kinosternidae]], [[Testudinidae]] and [[Trionychidae]] are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the [[Paracryptodira]]ns, are extinct.&lt;ref name=eol&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eol.org/pages/8120 |title=Testudines |last=Pecor |first=Keith |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528234247/http://eol.org/pages/8120 |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2014}}{{dubious|date=March 2014}}

Reptiles are classified according to the pattern of [[wikt:fenestration|fenestration]] in the temporal region of the [[skull]]. Testudines are placed in the subclass [[Anapsida]] because they lack fenestration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S.]] (1933). ''Vertebrate Paleontology''. University of Chicago Press. , 3rd ed., 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; There are suggestions that this lack of fenestration is a secondary characteristic and that turtles belong in [[Diapsida]].&lt;ref name="Laurin 1995 165–223"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurin|first=M.|author2=Reisz, R. R. |year=1995|title=A reevaluation of early amniote phylogeny|url=|journal=[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]]|volume=113|issue=2|pages=165–223|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00932.x}} ([http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/zj/1995/00000113/00000002/art00007 abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell is not an [[exoskeleton]], but a modified [[ribcage]] and part of the [[vertebral column]]. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.&lt;ref name=eol /&gt;

The earliest known turtles are from fossils in the [[Upper Triassic]]. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern turtles anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly of the genus [[Proganochelys]]), the teeth have already been lost, and a [[keratin]] beak is suggested by the [[mandible]]s. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.&lt;ref name=eol /&gt;

==Notes==
* The 'States Total' value represents the sum of {{CO2|link=yes}} emissions from the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia. This value differs from total U.S. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel combustion reported in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120915230825/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport.html Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks]. The U.S. inventory value is larger because it includes emissions from U.S. territories and protectorates; it also uses a different approach for estimating emissions from non-energy uses of fossil fuels (which are not included in the combustion-related values shown in this table).
* Nationally, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel combustion represented the largest source (76%) of total [http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/definitions/gwp.html GWP]–weighted emissions from all emission sources in 2014.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt; Similarly, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel combustion are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions within a state.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt;

[[File:AUFAN1.jpg|thumb|The ''Aufanian Matronae'' (detail) from the Gallo-Roman temple site at [[Görresburg]], Nettersheim (Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn)]]

The '''Matres''' (Latin "mothers"&lt;ref name=LINDOW224&gt;Lindow (2001:224).&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Matronae''' (Latin "matrons"&lt;ref name=LINDOW224/&gt;) were female [[deity|deities]] venerated in [[Northwestern Europe]], of whom relics are found dating from the first to the fifth century.   They are depicted on [[votive offering]]s and [[altar]]s that bear images of [[goddess]]es, depicted almost entirely in groups of three, that feature inscriptions (about half of which feature [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] names and half of which feature [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] names) and were venerated in regions of [[Germania]], [[Gaul|Eastern Gaul]], and [[Northern Italy]] (with a small distribution elsewhere) that were occupied by the [[Roman army]] from the first to the fifth century.&lt;ref name = SIMEK204-205/&gt;

Matres also appear on votive reliefs and inscriptions in other areas occupied by the Roman army, including southeast Gaul, as at [[Vertillum]]; in Spain and Portugal, where some twenty inscriptions are known, among them several ones which include local epithets like a dedication to the ''Matribus Gallaicis'' "to the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] Mothers";&lt;ref&gt;CIL II 2776.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the Romano-Celtic culture of [[Pannonia]] in the form of similar reliefs and inscriptions to the ''Nutrices Augustae'', "the august Nurses" found in Roman sites of [[Ptuj]], [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Wigand, "Die Nutrices Augustae von Poeticio" ''Jahreshrift Österreiches Archäologisches Institut'' '''18''' (1915), pp 118-218, illus., noted by Susan Scheinberg, "The Bee Maidens of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''83''' (1979), p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motifs==

Matres and Matronae appear depicted on both stones with inscriptions and without, both as altars and votives. All depictions are frontal, they appear almost exclusively in threes with at least one figure holding a basket of fruit in her lap, and the women are either standing or sitting.   In some depictions, the middle figure is depicted with loose hair and wearing a headband, and the other two wear head dresses.   In addition, snakes, children, and nappies appear.  Other motifs include depictions of sacrifice—including burning incense, pigs, and bowls filled with fruit—and decorations of fruits, plants and trees.  In most cases, the votive stones and altars are not found singularly, but rather in groups around temple buildings and cult centers.&lt;ref name=SIMEK206&gt;Simek (2007:206).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Scholars connect the Germanic Matres with the [[dís]]ir, [[valkyrie]]s, and [[norns]] attested largely in 13th century sources.&lt;ref name=LINDOW224/&gt;

The motif of [[triple deity#triple goddesses|triple goddesses]] was widespread in ancient Europe; compare the [[Fates]] (including [[Moirai]], [[Parcae]] and [[Norns]]), the [[Erinyes]], the [[Charites]], [[the Morrígan]], the [[Horae]] and other such figures.

[[Rudolf Simek]] comments that the loose hair may point to maidenhood, whereas the head dresses may refer to married women, the snakes may refer to an association with the souls of the dead or the underworld, and the children and nappies seem to indicate that the Matres and Matronae held a protective function over the family, as well as a particular function as midwives.&lt;ref name=SIMEK206/&gt;

===Veneration===

Information about the religious practices surrounding the Matres is limited to the stones on which their depictions and inscriptions are found, of which over 1,100 exist.&lt;ref name=SIMEK204-205&gt;Simek (2007:204-205).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Motifs include depictions of sacrifice—including burning incense, pigs, and bowls filled with fruit—and decorations of fruits, plants and trees.  In most cases, the votive stones and altars are not found singularly, but rather in groups around temple buildings and cult centers.&lt;ref name=SIMEK206&gt;Simek (2007:206).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

R. Pascal theorizes that [[The Three Marys]] may be [[Christianization|Christianized]] versions of the Matres and Matronae.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pascal observed of the pagan sources of Christian liturgical drama ("On the origins of the liturgical drama of the Middle Ages" ''The Modern Language Review'', '''36'''.3 [July 1941:369-387] p. 372) that "the three Maries are a Christianized form of the Celtic-Germanic deities, the mothers (''matres, matrones'') to whose cult hundreds of Rhenish inscriptions testify"; he offers as a further reference R. Stumpfl, ''Kultspiele der Germanen als Ursprung des mittelalterlichen Dramas'' (Berlin, 1936:215ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 13 '''monarchies in the Americas''' ([[Self-governance|self-governing]] states and territories that have a [[monarch]] as [[head of state]]). Each is a [[constitutional monarchy]], where in the sovereign inherits his or her office, usually keeping it until death or [[abdication]], and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers. Ten of these monarchies are independent states, and equally share Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who resides primarily in the [[United Kingdom]], as their respective sovereign, making them part of a global grouping known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, while the remaining three are [[dependent territory|dependencies]] of European monarchies. As such, none of the monarchies in the [[Americas]] have a permanently resident monarch.

These crowns continue a history of monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Both tribal and more complex [[pre-Columbian]] societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast [[empire]]s under a central [[Monarch|king]] figure, while others did the same with a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary [[Tribal chief|chieftain]]. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] that spread their reach across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], beginning in the mid 14th century.

From that date on, through the [[Age of Discovery]], European colonization brought extensive American territory under the control of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]], usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as [[Canada]]'s [[patriation]] of its constitution from the [[United Kingdom]]. A certain number of former colonies became [[republic]]s immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with [[Endemism|endemic]] constitutional monarchies—in the cases of [[Haiti]], [[Mexico]], and [[Brazil]]—with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the [[Caribbean]], sharing their monarch with their former [[metropole]], the most recently created being [[Monarchy of Belize|that of Belize]] in 1981.

==Current monarchies==
===American monarchies===
{{main|Lists of monarchs in the Americas}}
While the one monarch of each of the American monarchies resides predominantly in Europe, each of the states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], and thus have distinct local monarchies [[Seat (legal entity)|seated]] in their respective [[Capital (political)|capital]]s, with the monarch's day-to-day governmental and ceremonial duties generally carried out by an appointed local [[viceroy]].

====Antigua and Barbuda====
{{main|Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
The monarchy of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] has its roots in the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], as a [[Crown colony]]. On 1 November 1981, the country gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]], retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda. The monarch is represented in the country by the [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda]], Sir Rodney [[Rodney Williams (governor-general)|Williams]].&lt;ref name=FCO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/north-central-america/antigua-barbuda| last=Foreign and Commonwealth Office| authorlink=Foreign and Commonwealth Office| title=Country profiles &gt; North &amp; Central America and Caribbean &gt; Antigua and Barbuda| publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth and her [[Prince consort|royal consort]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], included Antigua and Barbuda in their 1966 [[Caribbean]] tour, and again in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|the Queen's Silver Jubilee]] tour of October 1977. Elizabeth returned once more in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4928.asp| title=The  Monarchy Today &gt; Queen and Commonwealth &gt; Other Caribbean realms| last=Royal Household at Buckingham Palace| publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the country's 25th anniversary of independence, on 30 October 2006, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]], opened Antigua and Barbuda's new parliament building, reading a message from his mother, the Queen. HRH The Duke of York visited Antigua and Barbuda in January 2001.&lt;ref name=FCO /&gt;

====The Bahamas====
{{main|Monarchy of The Bahamas}}
The monarchy of [[The Bahamas]] has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony, after 1717. On 10 July 1973, the country gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]], retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/AD50C97FCEE345FE06256F02007F60C0| last=Government of the Bahamas| authorlink1=Politics of the Bahamas| title=The Government of the Bahamas &gt; About The Government &gt; Overview and Structure of the Government| publisher=Government of the Bahamas| accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of The Bahamas. The monarch is represented in the country by the [[List of Governors-General of the Bahamas|Governor-General of the Bahamas]], Dame [[Marguerite Pindling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bahamaislandsinfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5343:sir-arthur-foulkes-is-new-governor-general-&amp;catid=34:Bahamas%20National%20News&amp;Itemid=147|title=Sir Arthur Foulkes is new Governor-General | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barbados====
{{main|Monarchy of Barbados}}
The monarchy of Barbados has its roots in the [[Monarchy of England|English monarchy]], under the authority of which the island was claimed in 1625 and first colonized in 1627,&lt;ref name=BParlHist&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php| last=The Clerk Of Parliament| title=The Barbados Parliament &gt; Parliament's History| publisher=Parliament of Barbados| accessdate=1 December 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523083154/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php| archivedate=23 May 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the British monarchy. By the 18th century, Barbados became one of the main seats of the British Crown's authority in the [[British West Indies]], and then, after an attempt in 1958 at [[West Indies Federation|a federation with other West Indian colonies]], continued as a [[self-governing colony]] until, on 30 November 1966, the country gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]], retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Barbados. The monarch is represented in the country by the [[List of Governors-General of Barbados|Governor-General of Barbados]], Sir [[Elliott Belgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/gg.htm| last=Government Information Service| title=Government &gt; Governor General| publisher=Government of Barbados| accessdate=5 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118142029/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/gg.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Elizabeth's cousin, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], opened the second session of the first parliament of the newly established country,&lt;ref name=BParlHist /&gt; before the Queen herself, along with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, toured Barbados. Elizabeth returned for her Silver Jubilee in 1977, and again in 1989, to mark the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Barbadian parliament.&lt;ref name=BParlHist /&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4928.asp| last=Royal Household at Buckingham Palace| title=The Monarchy Today &gt; Queen and Commonwealth &gt; Other Caribbean Realms| publisher=Her Majesty’s Stationery Office| accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Prime Minister of Barbados|Prime Minister]] [[Owen Arthur]] called for a referendum on Barbados becoming a republic to be held in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas |first=Norman |title=Barbados to vote on move to republic |publisher=Caribbean News |date=7 February 2005 |url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/02/07/vote.shtml |accessdate=1 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228082001/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2005/02/07/vote.shtml |archivedate=28 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the vote was then pushed back to "at least 2006" in order to speed up Barbados' integration in the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]]. It was announced on 26 November 2007 that [[Barbadian republic referendum|the referendum]] would be held in 2008, together with the [[Barbadian general election, 2008|general election that year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Staff| title=Referendum on Republic to be bundled with election| publisher=Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation| date=26 November 2007| url=http://www.evernetcorp.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=13417| accessdate=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was, however, postponed again to a later point, due to administrative concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Gollop |title=Vote Off |url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/317791120649409.php |publisher=The Nation |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228045102/http://www.nationnews.com/story/317791120649409.php |archivedate=28 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belize====
{{main|Monarchy of Belize}}
Belize was, until the 15th century, a part of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan Empire]], containing smaller states headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ''[[ajaw]]'' (later ''k’uhul ajaw'').{{#tag:ref|Both terms appear in early Colonial texts (including ''Papeles de Paxbolón'') where they are used as synonymous to Aztec and Spanish terms for supreme rulers and their domains – ''tlahtoani'' (''[[Tlatoani]]'') and ''tlahtocayotl'', ''rey'', or ''magestad'' and ''reino'', ''señor'' and ''señorío'', or ''dominio''.|group=N|name=Maya1}} The present monarchy of Belize has its roots in the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the area was first colonised in the 16th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony.

{{main|Monarchy of Denmark}}
[[File:HakonTheOldAndSkule-Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|right|Hákon, King of Norway (seated on the left) took possession of Greenland in 1261.]]
[[Greenland]] is one of the three [[Countries of the Kingdom of Denmark|constituent countries]] of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], with [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]]; by 1360, Norway had entered into a [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of Denmark, which became more entrenched with the union of the kingdoms into [[Denmark–Norway]] in 1536. After the dissolution of this arrangement in 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after [[Greenland in World War II|its role in World War II]], was granted its special status within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the ''[[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland|Rigsombudsmand]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stm.dk/Index/dokumenter.asp?o=71&amp;n=1&amp;d=1037&amp;s=2&amp;str=stor |title=Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands |accessdate=5 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Prime Minister of Denmark |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[High Commissioner]]), [[Mikaela Engell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/gl.html |title=Greenland |accessdate=15 January 2009 |work= |publisher=CIA World Factbook |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{main|Monarchy of the Netherlands}}
[[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] are constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and thus have [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] as their sovereign, as well as the remaining islands forming the [[Caribbean Netherlands]]. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the [[Royal Navy]] of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The former [[Netherlands Antilles]] were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained under the control of the Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574919/aruba.html|title=Aruba|accessdate=1 January 2009|work=|publisher=MSN Encarta|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx8ZpKD5?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574919/aruba.html|archivedate=1 November 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Netherlands Antilles again split as three areas in 2010.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Monarchy of the United Kingdom}}
The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] possesses a number of [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]] in the Americas, for whom Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is monarch. In North America are [[Anguilla]], [[Bermuda]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Montserrat]], and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], while the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are located in South America. The [[Caribbean]] islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly [[Monarchy of England|English]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch]], or [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish]], throughout the first half of the 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of [[Charles II of England|Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland]]. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the [[Governor of Anguilla]], [[Tim Foy]]; the [[Governor of Bermuda]], [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; the [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands]], [[Augustus Jaspert|Gus Jaspert]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukinbvi.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/hm-governor |title=HM Governor |accessdate=5 January 2009 |work= |publisher=HM Government of the British Virgin Islands |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Governor of the Cayman Islands]], [[Helen Kilpatrick]]; the [[Governor of Montserrat]], [[Andrew Pearce (diplomat)|Andrew Pearce]]; and the [[Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]].

The Falkland Islands, off the south coast of [[Argentina]], were simultaneously claimed for [[Louis XV of France]], in 1764, and [[George III of the United Kingdom]], in 1765, though the French colony was ceded to [[Charles III of Spain]] in 1767. By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain [[James Cook]] for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were governed by the British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985. The monarch is represented in these regions by [[Nigel Phillips]], who is both the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]] and the [[Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Falklands' Swearing in Ceremony for Governor Phillips on 12 September |first= |last= |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date= 2017-09-02 |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2017/09/02/falklands-swearing-in-ceremony-for-governor-phillips-on-12-september |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legend|#A05050|[[Primogeniture#Male-preference cognatic primogeniture|male-preference cognatic primogeniture]]}}]]
Before 28 October 2011, the [[succession order]] in the American Commonwealth realms, as well as those American territories under the British crown, adhered to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], by which succession passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and subsequently to daughters, again in order of birth. However, with the [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013#Challenges in Canadian courts|possible exception of Canada]], following the legislative changes giving effect to the [[Perth Agreement]], succession is by [[absolute primogeniture]] for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender. As these states share the person of their monarch with other countries, all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/english/content.jsp?objectid=13308 |title=Succession to the throne |accessdate=18 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Dutch Monarchy |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822054634/http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/english/content.jsp?objectid=13308 |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4310654,00.html Females get the nod in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folketinget.dk/doc.aspx?/Samling/20051/lovforslag/L1/som_vedtaget.htm |title=Suggested changes to the Succession |accessdate=25 January 2009 |publisher=Parliament of Denmark}} (In Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monumento de Cuauhtemoc.jpg|thumb|left|The monument to [[Cuauhtémoc]], the last sovereign king of the [[Aztec]] Empire]]
Most [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian cultures]] of the Americas developed and flourished for centuries under monarchical systems of government. By the time [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans arrived on the continents]] in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, however, many of these civilizations had ceased to function, due to various natural and artificial causes. Those that remained up to that period were eventually defeated by the agents of European monarchical powers, who, while they remained on the European continent, thereafter established new American administrations overseen by delegated [[viceroy]]s. Some of these colonies were, in turn, replaced by either republican states or locally founded monarchies, ultimately overtaking the entire American holdings of some European monarchs; those crowns that once held or claim territory in the Americas include the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese]], [[List of French monarchs|French]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish]], and [[List of Russian rulers|Russian]], and even [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Baltic Courland]], [[Holy Roman Emperors|Holy Roman]], [[List of rulers of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian]]. Certain of the locally established monarchies were themselves also overthrown through [[revolution]], leaving five current [[Pretender#Americas|pretenders to American thrones]].

{{Main|Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia}}
[[File:Orélie Antoine de Tounens.JPG|thumb|right|150px|King [[Orélie-Antoine de Tounens|Orélie-Antoine I]] of Araucania and Patagonia]]
The [[Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia]] was a short-lived attempt at establishing a constitutional monarchy, founded by [[France|French]] lawyer and adventurer [[Orelie-Antoine de Tounens]] in 1860. Nominally, the "kingdom" encompassed the present-day  [[Argentina|Argentine]] part of [[Patagonia]] and a small segment of [[Chile]], where [[Mapuche]] peoples were fighting to maintain their sovereignty against the advancing Chilean and Argentine armed forces.&lt;ref name=HistKing&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.araucania.org/araucania/aukin1_fichiers/aukin1eng.htm| title=Histoiry of the King Orllie-Antoine| publisher=Kingdom of Araucania &amp; Patagonia| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Orélie-Antoine never exercised sovereignty over the claimed territory, and his ''de facto'' control was limited to nearly fourteen months and to a small territory around a town called [[Perquenco]] (at the time mainly a Mapuche tent village), which was also the declared capital of his ''kingdom''.

Orélie-Antoine felt that the indigenous peoples would be better served in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader,&lt;ref name=HistKing /&gt; and was accordingly elected by a group of Mapuche ''loncos'' (chieftains) to be their king.&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.araucania.org/| author=Marhique, Huichacurha| title=The Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia| publisher=Kingdom of Araucania &amp; Patagonia| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made efforts to gain [[Diplomatic recognition|international recognition]], and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the [[occupation of the Araucanía]], a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in [[Tourtoirac]], France. A recent pretender, [[Jean-Michel Parasiliti di Para|Prince Antoine IV]], lived in France until 2017. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Menéndez| first=Braun| title=Pequeña historia patagónica| publisher=Emecé Editores| year=1959| page=128|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.&lt;ref name=kingdom /&gt;

Brazil was created as a kingdom on 16 December 1815, when [[John VI of Portugal|Prince João]], [[Princes of Brazil|Prince of Brazil]], who was then acting as [[regent]] for his ailing mother, [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria]], elevated the colony to a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vianna | first = Hélio | title = História do Brasil: período colonial, monarquia e república | publisher = Melhoramentos | year = 1994 | location = São Paulo | isbn = |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the royal court was still based in [[Rio de Janeiro]], João ascended as king of the united kingdom the following year, and returned to Portugal in 1821,&lt;ref name=Pedro1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=427| author=Miller, James| title=Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil| publisher=Historical Text Archive| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his son, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], Prince of Brazil, as his regent in the Kingdom of Brazil.

Prince Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822, with the title of Pedro I (on that date, he was formally offered the Throne of the newly created Empire, accepted it, and was acclaimed as monarch), and his coronation took place on 1 December 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Vainfas| first=Ronaldo| title=Dicionário do Brasil Imperial| publisher=Objetiva| year=2002| location=Rio de Janeiro|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Pedro [[Abdication|abdicated]] the throne on 7 April 1831, the Brazilian empire saw only one additional monarch: [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]],&lt;ref name=Pedro1 /&gt; who reigned for 58 years before a [[coup d'état]] overthrew the monarchy on 15 November 1889. There are two pretenders to the defunct Brazilian throne: [[Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza]], head of the Vassouras branch of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]], and, according to legitimist claims, ''de jure'' Emperor of Brazil; and [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza]], head of the [[Petrópolis]] line of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and heir to the Brazilian throne according to royalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper| author=Handler, Bruce| date= 5 March 1989| title=Brazil to Decide on Return of Monarchy| journal=Los Angeles Times| page=34 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-05/news/mn-199_1_vote-set |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian constitution of 1988 called for a general vote on the restoration of the monarchy, which was [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1993|held in 1993]]. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters.

====Haiti====
{{Main|First Empire of Haiti|Second Empire of Haiti|Kingdom of Haiti}}
The entire island of [[Hispaniola]] was first claimed on 5 December 1492, by [[Christopher Columbus]], for [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]], and the first Viceroy of the Americas was established along with a number of colonies throughout the Island. With the later discovery of Mexico and Peru many of the early settlers left for the main land, but some twelve cities and a hundred thousand souls remained, mainly in the Eastern part of the Island. Through the Treaty of Riswick in 1697, [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] received the western third of the Island  from Spain as retribution and formalized the first French pirate settlement in existence since the mid-1600s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Richard A.| last=Haggerty| title=Haiti, A Country Study: French Settlement and Sovereignty| url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/7.htm| publisher=US Library of Congress| year=1989| accessdate=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the colony administered by [[Gouverneur général|a governor-general representing the French crown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=35359| title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online &gt; Emmanuel-Auguste de Cahideuc, Comte Dubois de la Motte| publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval |accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; an arrangement that stood until the [[French Revolution]] toppled the monarchy of France on 21 September 1792. Though the French government retained control over the region of [[Saint-Domingue]], on 22 September 1804, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who had served as Governor-General of Saint-Domingue since 30 November 1803, declared himself as head of an independent [[Empire of Haiti (1804–1806)|Empire of Haiti]], with his coronation as Emperor Jacques I taking place on 6 October that year. After his assassination on 17 October 1806, the country was split in half, the northern portion eventually becoming the [[Kingdom of Haiti]] on 28 March 1811, with [[Henri Christophe]] installed as King Henri I.&lt;ref name=ceac&gt;{{cite book| last=Cheesman| first=Clive| title=The Armorial of Haiti| publisher=The College of Arms| year=2007| location=London| url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/| isbn=978-0-9506980-2-1| accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When King Henri committed suicide on 8 October 1820, and his son, [[Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti]], was murdered by revolutionaries ten days later, the kingdom was merged into the southern Republic of Haiti, of which [[Faustin I of Haiti|Faustin-Élie Soulouque]] was elected [[President of Haiti|president]] on 2 March 1847. Two years later, on 26 August 1849, the [[National Assembly of Haiti|Haitian national assembly]] declared the president as Emperor Faustin I, thereby re-establishing the Empire of Haiti. But this monarchical reincarnation was to be short lived as well, as a revolution broke out in the empire in 1858, resulting in Faustin abdicating the throne on 18 January 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jan| last=Rogozinski| year=1999| title=A Brief History of the Caribbean| edition=Revised| publisher=Facts on File, Inc.| location=New York| page=220| isbn=0-8160-3811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inca Empire]] spread across the north western parts of South America between 1438 and 1533, ruled over by a monarch addressed as the [[Sapa Inca|''Sapa Inca'', ''Sapa'', or ''Apu'']]. The [[Inca civilization]] emerged in the [[Kingdom of Cusco]], and expanded to become the ''Ttahuantin-suyu'', or "land of the four sections", each ruled by a governor or viceroy called ''Apu-cuna'', under the leadership of the central ''Sapa Inca''. The Inca Empire eventually fell to the Spanish in 1533, when the last ''Sapa Inca'' of the empire, [[Atahualpa]], was captured and executed on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560004_3/Inca_Empire.html#s12 |title=Inca Empire: Spanish Conquest |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work= |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kyWmnijq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560004_3/Inca_Empire.html|archivedate=2 November 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquerors installed other ''Sapa Inca'' beginning with Atahualpa's brother, [[Túpac Huallpa]].

====Maya====
{{Main|Maya Civilization}}
The [[Maya civilization]] was located on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and into the [[Isthmus|isthmian]] portion of North America, and the northern portion of [[Central America]] (Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras) was formed of a number of ''ajawil'', ''ajawlel'', or ''ajawlil''– hierarchical polities headed by an hereditary ruler known as a ''[[Ajaw|kuhul ajaw]]'' (the [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] term indicating a sovereign leader).{{#tag:ref|Both terms appear in early Colonial texts (including ''Papeles de Paxbolón'') where they are used as synonymous to Aztec and Spanish terms for supreme rulers and their domains– ''tlahtoani'' (''[[Tlatoani]]'') and ''tlahtocayotl'', ''rey'', or ''magestad'' and ''reino'', ''señor'' and ''señorío'', or ''dominio''.|group=N|name=Maya1}} Despite constant warfare and shifts in regional power, most [[Maya civilization#Political structures|Maya kingdoms]] remained a part of the region's landscape, even following subordination to hegemonic rulers through conquest or dynastic union. Nonetheless, the Maya civilization began its decline in the 8th and 9th centuries, and by the time of the arrival of the Spanish, only a few kingdoms remained, such as the [[Peten Itza kingdom]], [[Mam people|Mam]], [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], and the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]]. On 13 March 1697, the last [[Itza]] Maya king was [[Spanish conquest of Petén#Fall of Nojpetén|defeated at Nojpetén]] by the forces of King [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ancient Maya |last=Sharer |first=Robert J. |author2=Sylvanus Griswold Morley |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2130-1 |page=423 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c65_g571LyAC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=1697+Tayasal |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{Main|First Mexican Empire|Second Mexican Empire}}
With the victory of the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] over the Spanish imperial army in 1821, the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] came to a conclusion. The newly independent [[Congress of Mexico|Mexican Congress]] still desired that [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]], or another member of the [[House of Bourbon]], agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico, thereby forming a type of [[personal union]] with Spain. The Spanish monarchy, however, refused to recognise the new state, and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. Thus, the Mexican [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822, with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following. Only a few months later, Augustine dissolved a factious congress, thereby prompting an enraged [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] to mount a coup, which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822. In order to end the unrest, Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country, and the Mexican monarchy was abolished. After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication, Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824, but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and, without trial, was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico/27357/The-Mexican-Empire-1821-23 |title=History » Independence » The Mexican Empire, 1821–23 |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]

[[Benito Juárez]], elected as [[President of Mexico]] on 19 January 1858, suspended all repayments on Mexico's foreign debts (save those owed to the [[United States]]), leading France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in December 1861. Juárez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly to the interests of France. Archduke Maximilian, brother of the [[Emperor of Austria]], was elevated as [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico]], thereby re-establishing the Mexican monarchy, but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon's wishes, leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico. Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader of the country. As well, at the end of the [[American Civil War]], US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Backed by the Americans, ex-president Juárez mobilised to retake power, and defeated Maximilian at [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]] on 15 May 1867. The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed at the ''Cerro de las Campanas'' on 19 June 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico/27361/French-intervention |title=History » Independence » French intervention |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Miskito====
The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people of Central America were governed by the authority of a monarch, but one who shared his royal powers with a governor and a general. The origins of the monarchy are unknown; however, its sovereignty was lost when King Edward I of the Miskito Nation signed the [[Treaty of Friendship and Alliance]] with King [[George II of the United Kingdom]], putting the Miskito kingdom under the [[British protectorate|British protection]] and law. At the cessation of the [[American Revolutionary War]], King [[George III of the United Kingdom]], via the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], relinquished control of the Miskito's lands, though Britain continued an unofficial protectorate over the kingdom to protect Miskito interests against Spanish encroachments. After British interest in the region waned, [[Nicaragua]] dissolved and occupied the Miskito kingdom in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Rory| last=Carroll| title=Nicaragua's green lobby is leaving rainforest people 'utterly destitute'| date=26 November 2006| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/nov/26/famine.conservation| work=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=7 September 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the monarch thereafter becoming known as the Hereditary Chief.

====Taíno====
The [[Taíno people|Taíno]]s were an indigenous civilization spread across those islands today lying within the [[Bahamas]], [[Greater Antilles]], and the northern [[Lesser Antilles]]. These regions were divided into kingdoms (the island of [[Hispaniola]] alone was segmented into five kingdoms), which were themselves sometimes sub-divided into provinces. Each kingdom was led by a ''[[cacique]]'', or "chieftain", who was advised in his exercise of royal power by a council of priests/healers known as ''bohiques''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html| title=Caciques, nobles and their regalia| accessdate=9 November 2006| publisher=elmuseo.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009090513/http://elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html |archivedate = 9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line of succession, however, was [[matrilineal]], whereby if there was no male heir to become ''cacigue'', the title would pass to the eldest child, whether son or daughter, of the deceased's sister.&lt;ref name=Rouse&gt;{{cite book| last=Rouse| first=Irving| title=The Tainos: Rise and Decline of the people who greeted Columbus| year=1992| publisher=Yale University Press| location=New York| isbn=0-300-05696-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After battling for centuries with the [[Island Caribs|Carib]], the Taíno empire finally succumbed to disease and genocide brought by the Spanish colonisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sale| first=Kirkpatrick| title=The Conquest of Paradise| page=157| isbn=0-333-57479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580786/Taino| title=Taíno people| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia}}
After a number of failed attempts at colonising [[Tobago]], Duke [[Jacob Kettler]] of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland and Semigallia]] sent one more ship to the island, which landed there on 20 May 1654, carrying soldiers and colonists, who named the island ''[[Courland colonization of the Americas|New Courland]]''. At approximately the same time, Dutch colonies were established at other locations on the island, and eventually outgrew those of the Duchy of Courland in population. When the Duke was captured by Swedish forces in 1658, Dutch settlers overtook the Courland colonies, forcing the Governor to surrender. After a return of the territory to Courland through the 1660 [[Treaty of Oliwa]], a number of attempts were made by the next Duke of Courland (Friedrich Casimir Kettler) at re-colonisation, but these met with failure, and he sold New Courland in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.colonialvoyage.com/tobago.html| title=Dutch Portuguese Colonial History &gt; Dutch and Courlanders in Tobago| publisher=Colonialvoyage.com| accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
After [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] commissioned [[Jacques Cartier]] to search out an eastern route to [[Asia]], the city of [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today [[Nova Scotia]]. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the [[Great Lakes]] and down the [[Mississippi River]], as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the [[French Guiana|north eastern shore of South America]]; the [[New France|Viceroyalty of New France]] was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Emerson| first=Rupert| title=Colonialism and Decolonization| journal=Journal of Contemporary History| volume=4| issue=1| pages=3–16| date=January 1969| doi=10.1177/002200946900400101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Christopher| last=Hibbert| title=The Days of the French Revolution| year=1980| location=New York| publisher=Quill, William Morrow| url=https://books.google.com/?id=yr1z38HCkdAC&amp;dq=Hibbert+French+Revolution| isbn=0-688-03704-6| accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Georges| last=Lefebvre| title=The French Revolution: From Its Origins to 1793| year=1971| publisher=Columbia University Press| url=https://books.google.com/?id=I2oA5MtB0ZkC&amp;dq=Lefebvre+estates+general| isbn=0-231-08598-2| accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon several restorations of the monarchy, the royal presence in the Americas ended with the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]] in 1870.

====Russia====
{{main|Russian Empire}}
The first permanent Russian settlements in what is today the US state of [[Alaska]] were set down in the 1790s, forming [[Russian Alaska]], after [[Russian Czar|Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] called for expeditions across the [[Bering Strait]] in 1725,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kodiakisland.net/timeline.html| title=Alaska History Timeline| publisher=Kodiak Island Internet Directory| accessdate=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the region administered by the head of the [[Russian-American Company]] as the Emperor's representative. Another Russian outpost, [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]], was established in 1812 in what is now [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Nordlander| first=David J.| title=For God &amp; Tsar: A Brief History of Russian America 1741–1867| publisher=Alaska Natural History Association| location=Anchorage| year=1994| isbn=0-930931-15-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies, however, were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area, with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700. Fort Ross was sold in 1841, and in 1867, a deal was brokered whereby [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] sold his Alaskan territory to the United States of America for $7,200,000, and the official transfer took place on 30 October that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Farrar| first=Victor John| title=The Annexation of Russian America to the United States| publisher=Russell &amp; Russell| location=New York| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====

The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves came into being in the wake of Portugal's war with [[Napoleonic France]]. The Portuguese Prince Regent, the future King John VI, with his incapacitated mother, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and the Royal Court, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaped]] to the [[colony of Brazil]] in 1808.
With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls for the return of the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the elevation of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy.

====Spain====
{{main|Monarchy of Spain}}
Beginning in 1492 with the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] under the direction of [[Isabella I of Castile]], the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] amassed a large [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American empire]] over three centuries, spreading first from the [[Caribbean]] to [[Central America]], most of [[South America]], [[Mexico]], what is today the [[Southwestern United States]], and the Pacific coast of [[North America]] up to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartroli |first=Tomás |title=Presencia hispánica en la costa noroeste de América |publisher=Universidad de British Columbio |location=Vancouver |year=1968|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Angelina |last=Miró |title=Catalans a la costa oest del Canadà: Els catalans a la Colúmbia Britànica al s.XVIII |url=http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf |accessdate=19 December 2008 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030000815/http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/catalans_al_canada.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions formed the majority of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], and the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in each of which the Spanish monarch was represented by [[List of viceroys of New Spain|a viceroy]]. By the early 19th century, however, the Spanish sovereign's possessions in the Americas began a series of independence movements, which culminated in the Crown's loss of all its colonies on the mainland of North and South America by 1825. The remaining colonies of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] were occupied by the [[United States]] following the [[Spanish–American War]], ending Spanish rule in the Americas by 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico and the United States |last=Lee |first=Stacey |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7402-9 |page=777 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DSzyMGh8pNwC&amp;pg=PA777&amp;dq=spanish+empire+in+1899+spanish+american |date=October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{main|Monarchy of Sweden}}
For a period of time the French ceded sovereignty of the island of [[Saint Barthélemy]] to the Swedes but it was eventually returned. Saint Barthélemy (1785–1878) was operated as a porto Franco (free port). The capital city of [[Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy|Gustavia]] retains its Swedish name.

===Self-proclaimed monarchies===
[[File:James Strang daguerreotype (1856).jpg|thumb|125px|1856 [[daguerreotype]] of James Strang]]
These entities were never recognized ''de jure'' as legitimate governments, but still sometimes exercised a certain degree of local control or influence within their respective locations until the death of their "monarch":

====James J. Strang====
[[James Strang]], a would-be successor to the [[Latter Day Saints|Mormon]] prophet [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], proclaimed himself "king" over his [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|church]] in 1850, which was then concentrated mostly on [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in [[Lake Michigan]].  On 8 July of that year, he was physically crowned in an elaborate coronation ceremony complete with crown, sceptre, throne, ermine robe and breastplate.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, Robert P. "For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory...Briefly" ''American Heritage'' 21 (4).  The sceptre is preserved in the vault of the archives of the [[Community of Christ]] church in Independence, Missouri; the whereabouts of Strang's remaining regalia is a mystery.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he never claimed legal sovereignty over Beaver Island or any other geographical entity, Strang managed (as a member of the [[Michigan State Legislature]]) to have his "kingdom" constituted as a separate [[Manitou County, Michigan|county]], where his followers held all county offices, and Strang's word was law.  U.S. President [[Millard Fillmore]] ordered an investigation into Strang's colony, which resulted in Strang's trial in [[Detroit]] for [[treason]], trespass, [[counterfeiting]] and other crimes, but the jury found the "king" innocent of all charges.  Strang was eventually assassinated by two disgruntled followers in 1856, and his kingdom&amp;mdash;together with his royal regalia&amp;mdash;vanished.

====Joshua Norton====
[[Emperor Norton|Joshua Abraham Norton]], an Englishman who emigrated to [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1849, proclaimed himself "Emperor of These United States" in 1859, later adding the title "Protector of Mexico".  Though never recognized by the U.S. or Mexican governments, he was accorded a certain degree of deference within San Francisco itself, including reserved balcony seats (for which he was never charged) at local theatres, and salutes by policemen who passed him on the street.  Specially printed currency authorized by Norton was accepted as [[legal tender]] within several businesses in the city.  When Norton died in 1880, he was given a lavish funeral attended by over 30,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emperornorton.net/NortonI-Cowan.html Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Harden-Hickey ====
[[James Harden-Hickey]] was a self-proclaimed Prince, who attempted to establish the so-called [[Principality of Trinidad]] on [[Trindade Island|Trindade]] and the [[Martim Vaz Islands]] in the South Atlantic Ocean during the late nineteenth century.  Although initially garnering some newspaper attention, Hickey's claims were ignored or ridiculed by other nations, and the islands were eventually occupied by military forces from nearby [[Brazil]] which remain there to the present day.

The''' NEPTUNE Ocean Observatory''' project is part of [[Ocean Networks Canada]] which is a [[University of Victoria]] initiative. NEPTUNE is the world’s first regional-scale underwater ocean observatory that plugs directly into the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="ca3436" /&gt; NEPTUNE is the largest installation on the [[Ocean Networks Canada]] network of ocean observatories.  Since December 2009, it has allowed people to "surf" the [[seafloor]] while ocean scientists run deep-water experiments from labs and universities around the world. Along with its sister project, [[VENUS]], NEPTUNE offers a unique approach to ocean science. Traditionally, ocean scientists have relied on infrequent ship cruises or space-based satellites to carry out their research, while the NEPTUNE project uses a remotely operated crawler.&lt;ref name="ca3436"&gt;[http://www.neptunecanada.ca/news/index.dot?id=3436 $2 Million Supports Ocean Observatories] NEPTUNE Canada: News.

==Overview==
[[Image:NEPTUNE Canada overview map.jpg|left|NEPTUNE Canada Overview Map]]'''NEPTUNE''' is an acronym for '''N'''orth-'''E'''ast '''P'''acific '''T'''ime-series '''U'''ndersea '''N'''etworked '''E'''xperiments.  The '''North-East Pacific''' is home to the [[Juan de Fuca plate]]—smallest of Earth’s 12 [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Its small size and close proximity to the coast gives NEPTUNE Canada a unique opportunity to observe tectonic processes. NEPTUNE Canada is built to provide continuous observations for 25 years. The time-series data gathered will allow scientists to study long-term changes over the life of the project. Instruments comprising the undersea observatory will operate at depths ranging from 17 to 2,660 m. Hundreds of instruments have been connected to the Internet by way of [[shielded cable]]s carrying both power and [[Fiber-optic communication|fibre-optic communication]] lines. A database will archive and provide [[Network model|networked]] access to all archived data. Taking advantage of this platform, scientists collaborating with NEPTUNE are expected to conduct thousands of unique experiments over the life of the project.

== Status ==

*In 2007, NEPTUNE Canada laid approximately [http://www.neptunecanada.ca/images/NEPTUNELayout2007jun14largerscale_001.jpg 800 km] of power transmission and [[fibre optic]] communication cables over the northern part of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca tectonic plate]] off the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia]].  The [[University of Victoria]] hosts both the NEPTUNE Canada and [[VENUS]] projects along with the Data Management and Archiving System that is responsible for all data processing, from data acquisition to archiving to providing near real-time web access.
*The NEPTUNE project was selected as one of the five most significant science projects of the year in 2008 from ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/theworldin/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10105021&amp;d=2008  Visiting Neptune’s kingdom] by Geoffrey Carr, ''The World in 2008'', ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2008, the NEPTUNE project received and successfully tested the world's first “Internet-operated deep sea crawler,” created by a team of ocean scientists at Bremen's [[Jacobs University]], will help researchers measure conditions such as temperature, salinity, methane content and sediment characteristics at the seafloor. The crawler “crawls” on dual tractor treads, which allow a full range of forward, backward and turning movement. Including its titanium frame, drive motors, sealed electronics chambers, wiring, lights, HD video camera, and sensors, the unit's out-of-water weight is 275&amp;nbsp;kg. With syntactic foam flotation blocks attached, this is reduced to an in-water weight of 40&amp;nbsp;kg. One unique feature is its control interface, which plugs directly into the Web. Interested people will be able to tune in to a live sea floor crawl on the NEPTUNE website.  The crawler was named "Wally" (after the fictional Pixar robot [[WALL-E]]) and explored regions of the ocean floor containing [[methane clathrate]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/blogs/2009/09/27/Wally+Crawls+Again|title=Wally Crawls Again - NEPTUNE@Sea Blog - Ocean Networks Canada|website=wiki.oceannetworks.ca|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Late September 2008 NEPTUNE Canada's first fully instrumented instrument platform was deployed by [[ROPOS]] from the [[CCGS John P. Tully|Canadian Coast Guard Ship John P Tully]] in Saanich Inlet and connected to the [[VENUS]] Saanich Inlet node. This platform was recovered in early 2009 and reconfigured for deployment at [http://neptunecanada.ca/sensors-instruments/locations/endeavour.dot Endeavour Ridge] during the summer of 2010.
*A similar observatory will be installed off the west coast of the states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].  The [[University of Washington]] will lead the Regional Scale Nodes component of the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]'s [[Ocean Observatories Initiative]].
*July–October 2009, the main [http://neptunecanada.ca/infrastructure/network/index.dot#node science nodes] were installed along with 11 [http://neptunecanada.ca/sensors-instruments/instrument-platforms/ instrument platforms] and over 60 scientific instruments.
*8 December 2009, NEPTUNE Canada's official operational launch was celebrated with a [http://www.neptunecanada.ca/news/news-details.dot?id=20604 Go-live Event].
*March 2010, Robert Gagosian, president and chief executive officer of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership in Washington, D.C., and Martin Taylor, president and chief executive officer of Ocean Networks Canada (umbrella organization for both NEPTUNE Canada and [[VENUS]]), signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to work closely together as they manage and operate ocean observing systems.
*May 2010, instrument platforms were refurbished and new instruments installed during an installation and maintenance cruise aboard the [[CCGS John P. Tully|Canadian Coast Guard Ship John P Tully]].
*Fall 2010, new cables were laid and instruments installed as NEPTUNE Canada extended its network to the [[Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents]]. These installations were accomplished with the help of the crews of the [[R/V Thomas G. Thompson (T-AGOR-23)|RV Thomas G. Thompson]], the [[CCGS John P. Tully|Canadian Coast Guard Ship John P Tully]] and [[Ropos|CSSF/ROPOS]].
*These components are connected on a backbone of thick and insulated cable called a spur cable that has two separated lines for transmitting the data in opposite directions. The instruments transmit the data either clockwise or counter clockwise within a 2 by 2 Gbit/s data flow. Since the primary purpose of the system is data collection and analysis, the available instruments generate data of various size and nature. The collected data is then transmitted on the spur cable passing through all the routers that are on one of the best alternative paths of the data flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MARTONALTI|first=BURAK|author2=Yvonne Coady |author3=Sudhakar Ganti |author4=Yağız Onat Yazır |title=NEPTSim: Simulating Neptune Canada using Omnet++|date=August 2012|url=http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/bitstream/handle/1828/4203/Martonalti_Burak_MSc_2012.pdf?sequence=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Channels and Connections ==

In NEPTUNE Canada network traffic, there are 4 different type of network channels that are defined in the network description file based on the data provided. The first channel provides 10 Gbit/s data rate between UVIC [https://www.uvic.ca/ (University of Victoria)] DMAS [http://www.oceannetworks.ca/ (Data Management and Archive Station) ] and shore station in Port Alberni. This channel has the largest volume in the system, and is located in between the edge of the network of the system and the main receiver UVIC DMAS.

The shore station is linked to the first branching unit as followed with 5 other branching units that are also linked to other branching units. This solid connection spur cable|forms a ring-shaped SONET network that has two cables in order to control the network traffic in two directions. A 2 by 2 Gbit/s data channel is implemented on the spur cable. Furthermore, each branching unit is connected to a regional node station. And the connection between node stations and branching units provide 1 Gbit/s data rate using a fiber-optic cable. 6 Node stations split the back-haul into 6 separated regions and the network behavior in between each regions' devices is identical. Similar to the connections between node stations and branching units, node stations are linked to junction boxes with 1 Gbit/s data rate.

Junction boxes can be linked to both instruments and other junction boxes with different data channels. All the network channels transmit the data with 0.1 delay rate. Junction box to junction box and instrument to instrument connections are implemented with either 1 Gbit/s or 100 Mbit/s data rates. An important connection limit on the junction boxes is that more than 10 components cannot be connected to a single junction box. Instruments can also be linked to either junction boxes or any other instrument with either 1 Gbit/s data rate or 100 Mbit/s data channel. The instruments are the final spot of the each regional network branches. The data flows from the instruments where the edge of each regional branch is located towards UVIC [https://www.uvic.ca/ (University of Victoria)] DMAS [http://www.oceannetworks.ca/ (Data Management and Archive Station) ] by following a secure and the shortest path as configured by the network configurator used by NEPTSim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MARTONALTI|first=BURAK|author2=Yvonne Coady |author3=Sudhakar Ganti |author4=Yağız Onat Yazır |title=NEPTSim: Simulating NEPTUNE Canada Using OMNeT++|date=August 2012|url=http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/bitstream/handle/1828/4203/Martonalti_Burak_MSc_2012.pdf?sequence=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3878">The '''North Western Ghats montane rain forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of southwestern [[India]]. It covers an area of {{convert|30,900|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending down the spine of the [[Western Ghats]] range, from southernmost [[Gujarat]] through [[Maharashtra]], [[Goa]], and [[Karnataka]]. The montane rain forests are found above 1000 meters elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]].

Unlike the lowland forests, which are composed largely of [[deciduous]] trees, the montane rain forests are predominantly evergreen [[laurel forest]], dominated by trees of the laurel family ([[Lauraceae]]), including ''[[Litsea]]'', ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]'', and ''[[Cinnamomum]]''.

==Protected areas==
As of 1997, 13 protected areas had been designated, covering an area of 3,990 km², 13% of the ecoregion's area.&lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

On December 15, 2012, the Karnataka Wildlife Board recommended that [[Bisle Reserve Forest|Bisle]], Kaginahare, and Kanchankumari reserve forests north of Pushpagiri be included in Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary. The Ministry of Environment and Forests also supported the proposal. In May 2014 wildlife biologist Sanjay Gubbi reiterated the call to include these reserve forests in the protected area, and said that "a conspiracy to make money in the name of mini-hydel projects" was the reason for the Karnataka state government's refusal to redesignate these reserve forests as a wildlife sanctuary or national park.&lt;ref&gt;"Include more forest areas under Pushpagiri sanctuary."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20536">'''Novel ecosystems''' are human-built, modified, or engineered [[ecological niche|niches]] of the [[Anthropocene]]. They exist in places that have been altered in structure and function by human agency. Novel ecosystems are part of the [[human ecology|human]] [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[Ecological niche|niche]] (including [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]], and [[rural]]), they lack natural analogs, and they have extended an influence that has converted more than three-quarters of wild Earth. These anthropogenic [[biome]]s include technoecosystems that are fuelled by powerful [[energy sources]] (fossil and nuclear) including ecosystems populated with technodiversity, such as roads and unique combinations of soils called [[technosols]]. [[Vegetation association]]s on old buildings or along field boundary stone walls in old agricultural [[landscape]]s are examples of sites where research into novel [[ecosystem ecology]] is developing.

==Overview==

[[Human society]] has transformed the planet to such an extent that we may have ushered in a new epoch known as the ''[[anthropocene]]''. The ecological niche of the anthropocene contains entirely novel ecosystems that include technosols, technodiversity, [[anthrome]]s, and the [[#Technosphere|technosphere]].

Ellis (2008)&lt;ref name="Ellis08" /&gt; identifies twenty-one different kinds of anthropogenic biomes that sort into the following groups: 1) dense settlements, 2) villages, 3) croplands, 4) rangeland, 5) forested, and 6) wildlands. These anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes for short) create the technosphere that surrounds us and are populated with diverse technologies (or technodiversity for short). Within these anthromes the human species (one species out of billions) appropriates 23.8% of the global net primary production. "This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species."

Lane, 1996, "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p.4 https://books.google.com/books?id=QrwityQkdxkC&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] 1922 &lt;ref&gt;In 1922, Teilhard wrote in an essay with the title 'Hominization': "And this amounts to imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere a  human sphere, a sphere of reflection, of conscious invention, of conscious souls (the noosphere, if you will)" (1966, p. 63) It was a neologism employing the Greek word noos for "mind."  ( Teilhard de Chardin, "Hominization" (1923), "The Vision of the Past" pages 71,230,261 https://books.google.com/books?id=GnwPAQAAIAAJ )&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[Cosmogenesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tambov State Technical University: [http://www.tstu.ru/win/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm Russian Scientist V.I.Vernadsky], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is the first use of the term by [[Édouard Le Roy]], who together with [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Chardin]] was listening to lectures of [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] at [[Sorbonne]]. In 1936 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] presented on the idea of the Noosphere in a letter to  [[Boris Leonidovich Lichkov]] (though, he states that the concept derives from Le Roy).

===Technoecosystems===
The concept of technoecosystems has been pioneered by ecologists [[Howard T. Odum]] and Zev Naveh. Technoecosystems interface with and are competitive toward natural systems. They have advanced technology (or technodiversity) money-based [[market economies]] and have a large [[ecological footprint]]s.  Technoecosystems have far greater [[energy use|energy requirements]] than natural ecosystems, excessive [[water consumption]], and release [[toxic]] and [[eutrophication|eutrophicating]] chemicals.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt; Other ecologists have defined the extensive [[street network|global network of road system]]s as a type of technoecosystem.&lt;ref name="Lugoa00" /&gt;

===Technoecotypes===
"Bio-agro- and techno-ecotopes are spatially integrated in larger, regional landscape units, but they are not structurally and functionally integrated in the ecosphere. Because of the adverse impacts of the latter and the great human pressures on bio-ecotopes, they are even antagonistically related and therefore cannot function together as a coherent, sustainable ecological system."&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt;{{rp|136}}

'''Orcein''', also '''archil''', '''orchil''', '''lacmus''' and '''C.I. Natural Red 28''', are names for [[dye]]s extracted from several species of [[lichen]], commonly known as "orchella weeds", found in various parts of the world. A major source is the archil lichen, ''[[Roccella tinctoria]]''. [[Orcinol]] is extracted from such lichens. It is then converted to orcein by [[ammonia]] and air. In traditional dye-making methods, [[urine]] was used as the ammonia source. If the conversion is carried out in the presence of [[potassium carbonate]], [[calcium hydroxide]], and [[calcium sulfate]] (in the form of [[potash]], [[Agricultural lime|lime]], and [[gypsum]] in traditional dye-making methods), the result is [[litmus]], a more complex molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10520290410001671362| volume = 78| issue = 6| pages = 289–302| last = Beecken| first = H| author2 = E-M Gottschalk| author3 = U v Gizycki| display-authors = etal| title = Orcein and litmus| journal = Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry| date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacture was described by Cocq in 1812 &lt;ref&gt;Cocq M.

Orcein is not approved as a [[food dye]] (banned in Europe since January 1977), with [[E number]] E121 before 1977 and E182 after.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.additifs-alimentaires.net/E121.php?src_reg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm106626.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[CAS number]] is {{CASREF|CAS=1400-62-0}}.

It is a mixture of [[oxazine|phenoxazone]] derivates - hydroxyorceins, aminoorceins, and aminoorceinimines.

==Cudbear==
'''Cudbear''' is a [[dye]] extracted from orchil [[lichen]]s that produces colours in the [[purple]] range. It can be used to dye [[wool]] and [[silk]], without the use of [[mordant]].

Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of [[Scotland]]: production began in 1758, and it was [[patent]]ed in 1758, British patent 727.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chriscooksey.demon.co.uk/lichen/bp727.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lichen is first boiled in a solution of [[ammonium carbonate]]. The mixture is then cooled and [[ammonia]] is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3–4 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy. The lichen consumption soon reached 250 tons per year and import from Norway and Sweden had to be arranged.&lt;ref&gt;http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/stecit/stecit05.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Cudbear was the first dye to be invented in modern times, and one of the few dyes to be credited to a named individual.

A similar process was developed in France. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia, then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates out and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated out with [[calcium chloride]]. The resulting insoluble purple solid is known as '''French purple''', a fast lichen dye that was much more stable than other lichen dyes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32803">'''Ozone depletion and climate change''', or '''Ozone hole and global warming''' in more popular terms, are environmental challenges whose connections have been explored and which have been compared and contrasted, for example in terms of global regulation, in various studies and books.

There is widespread scientific interest in better regulation of [[climate change]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[air pollution]], as in general the human relationship with the biosphere is deemed of major [[Historiography|historiographical]] and political significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/928 2010, Review] of [[Joachim Radkau]], ''Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment'', {{ISBN|978-0521616737}}, by [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Already by 1994 the legal debates about respective regulation regimes on climate change, ozone depletion and air pollution were being dubbed "monumental" and a combined synopsis provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/climate-change-ozone-depletion-and-air-pollution Alexander Gillespie. Climate Change, Ozone Depletion And Air Pollution: Legal Commentaries Within The Context Of Science And Policy 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some parallels between atmospheric chemistry and anthropogenic emissions in the discussions which have taken place and the regulatory attempts which have been made. Most important is that the gases causing both problems have long lifetimes after emission to the atmosphere, thus causing problems which are difficult to reverse.  However, the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] and the [[Montreal Protocol]] that amended it are seen as success stories, while the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on anthropogenic climate change has largely failed. Currently efforts are being undertaken to assess the reasons and to use synergies, for example with regard to [[data reporting]] and policy design and further exchanging of information.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Oberthür, International Environmental Agreements July 2001, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 357-377, Linkages between the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols – Enhancing Synergies between Protecting the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate&lt;/ref&gt; While the general public tends to see global warming as a subset of ozone depletion, in fact ozone and chemicals such as [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) and other [[halocarbon]]s, which are held responsible for ozone depletion, are important [[greenhouse gas]]ses. Furthermore, natural levels of ozone in both the stratosphere and troposphere have a warming effect.

== Policy approach ==
{{main article|Politics of global warming|Montreal Protocol|Kyoto Protocol|}} 
[[File:Bob Watson.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Watson (scientist)|Sir Robert (Bob) Watson]] played an important role in both cases]]

There are both links and major differences between ozone depletion and global warming and the way the two challenges have been handled. While in the case of atmospheric ozone depletion, in a situation of high uncertainty and against strong resistance, climate change regulation attempts at the international level such as the Kyoto Protocol have failed to reduce global emissions.&lt;ref name = RG/&gt;&lt;ref name=cass/&gt;
The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] and the Montreal Protocol were both originally signed by only some member states of the [[United Nations]] (43 nations in the case of the Montreal Protocol in 1986) while Kyoto attempted to create a worldwide agreement from scratch. Expert consensus concerning [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] in the form of the [[Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion]] was reached long after the first regulatory steps were taken, and {{as of|2012|12|29|lc=y}}, all countries in the United Nations plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]] and the [[supranational union|supranational]] [[European Union]] had ratified the original Montreal Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1328&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA – PRESS RELEASES – Press Release – Environment: European Union hails universal ratification of the Montreal Protocol on protecting the ozone layer |publisher=Europa.eu |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries have also ratified the London, Copenhagen, and Montreal amendments to the Protocol. {{As of|2014|04|15}}, the Beijing amendments had not been ratified by two state parties.&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Ratification_status/ |title=Status of Ratification – The Ozone Secretariat |publisher=Ozone.unep.org |date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Vienna Convention, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. US manufacturer [[DuPont]] acted more quickly than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name="Shabecoff, Philip A1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Shabecoff, Philip |title=U.S. Report Predicts Rise in Skin Cancer with Loss of Ozone |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/us/us-report-predicts-rise-in-skin-cancer-with-loss-of-ozone.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 1986 |page=A1 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU shifted its position as well after Germany, which has a substantial chemical industry, gave up its defence of the CFC industry&lt;ref name = RG/&gt; and started supporting more regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK had tried to defend their CFC-producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]], ''Transnational Environmental Policy'', London: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-22423-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna Convention was installed before a scientific consensus on the ozone hole was established.&lt;ref name = RG&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]] [http://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_book/mpifg_bd_39.pdf "Technische Problemlösung, Verhandeln und umfassende Problemlösung", (Technical trouble shooting, negotiating and generic problem solving capability)] in ''Gesellschaftliche Komplexität und kollektive Handlungsfähigkeit'' (Complexity of society and collective ability to act), ed. Schimank, U. (2000). Frankfurt/Main: Campus, pp.&amp;nbsp;154&amp;ndash;82 [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp;jsessionid=1F12495443EF6AC95BFF12F29F3C4829?itemId=escidoc%3A1235032%3A2&amp;view=EXPORT book summary] at the [[Max Planck Gesellschaft]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, until the 1980s the EU, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]], NAS, [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]] and the British government had issued scientific reports with divergent conclusions.&lt;ref name = RG/&gt; [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Sir Robert (Bob) Watson]], Director of the Science Division at NASA, played a crucial role in the process of reaching a unified assessment.&lt;ref name = RG/&gt;

== Policy and consensus ==
Bob Watson successfully united the international science community in 1985 to act on the problem with the ozone hole, before a consensus existed.&lt;ref name = RG/&gt;

[[Aant Elzinga]] wrote in 1996 about the consensus, that the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has tried in the prior two reports a global consensus approach to climate action.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aant Elzinga]], "Shaping Worldwide Consensus: the Orchestration of Global Change", in Elzinga &amp; Landström eds. (1996) ''Internationalism and Science'': 223-255. {{ISBN|0-947568-67-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stephen Schneider]] and Paul N. Edwards, noted in 1997, that after the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]], the lobby group [[Global Climate Coalition]] and a few self-proclaimed “contrarian” scientists tried to discredit the conclusions of the report. They pointed out that the goal of the IPCC is to fairly represent the complete range of credible scientific opinion and if possible a consensus view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ent.arp.harvard.edu/sci/climate/journalclub/SanterComm.pdf|title=The 1995 IPCC Report: Broad Consensus or “Scientific Cleansing”?1|publisher=Harvard University|authors=Paul N. Edwards, Stephen H. Schneider|year=1997|journal=Ecofable/Ecoscience|pages=3–9|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Reiner Grundmann]] compared climate actions in Europe and the United States, he interpreted the inaction besides existing consensus, and noted,  ''Political agenda that drove US climate change policy. The high visibility of sceptical scientists in the media resonates with this'', and wrote that Germany started ambitious goals, reduced emissions, because ‘balanced reporting’ led to a bias in climate change coverage in advantage of sceptical arguments in the U.S., but not so much in Germany. Additionally, Grundmann pointed out that after warnings from scientists in 1986 the [[German Parliament]] commissioned the ''Enquetekommission ‘Vorsorge zum Schutz der Erdatmosphäre’'' (Precaution for the Protection of the Earth’s Atmosphere), to assess the situation, consisting of scientists, politicians and representatives of interest groups. Three years later the report made an impact with the assessment of the state of the art in climate research, an assessment of the threat of climate change itself as well as suggestions for clear emissions reduction targets, even though he argues there was no consensus, and attributed the success of the report to strong precautionary action, and that no scientific outsiders or climate change skeptics were involved.&lt;ref name=PAR&gt;{{cite web|format=pdf|url=http://stsclimate.soc.ku.dk/papers/grundmannclimatechangeandknowledgepolitics.pdf|title=Environmental Politics Climate Change and Knowledge Politics|author=Reiner Grundmann|pages=414–432|year=2007|doi=10.1080/09644010701251656|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115142/http://stsclimate.soc.ku.dk/papers/grundmannclimatechangeandknowledgepolitics.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/11/080/1108030.pdf|format=pdf|author=Bundestag.de|year=1990|title=Dritter Bericht der ENQUETE-KOMMISSION Vorsorge zum Schutz der Erdatmosphäre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A linear model of policy-making, based on a position that "the more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be", was not applied in the ozone case.&lt;ref name=CLT&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]] and [[Nico Stehr]], [http://csi.sagepub.com/content/58/6/897.abstract Climate Change: What Role for Sociology?

== Public opinion ==
{{main article|Public opinion on climate change}}
The two atmospheric problems have achieved significantly different levels of understanding by the public, including both the basic science and policy issues.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; People have limited scientific knowledge about global warming and tend to confuse it with&lt;ref&gt;Edward Boyesa and Martin Stanisstreeta, "Students' perceptions of global warming", International Journal of Environmental Studies, Volume 42, Issue 4, 1992, {{doi|10.1080/00207239208710804}}, pages 287-300&lt;/ref&gt; or see it as a subset of the ozone hole.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Sheldon Ungar, 2000 and various web sites such as [[Gavin Schmidt]]s realclimate complaint in [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/ozone-depletion-and-global-warming/Ozone depletion and global warming 2005] or the [http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ozone-hole-and-gw-faq.html UCS FAQ on the topic]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only on the policy level, ozone regulation fared much better than climate change in public opinion. Americans voluntarily switched away from aerosol sprays before legislation was enforced, while climate change has failed in achieving a broader scientific comprehension and in raising comparable concern.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;

The metaphors used in the CFC discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) resonated better with non-scientists and their concerns.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;  The ozone case was communicated to lay persons "with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the [[popular culture]]" and related to "immediate risks with everyday relevance", while the [[public opinion on climate change]] sees no imminent danger.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; The ozone hole was much more seen as a "hot issue" and imminent risk compared to global climate change,&lt;ref name="PAR" /&gt; as lay people feared a depletion of the ozone layer ([[ozone shield]]) risked increasing severe consequences such [[skin cancer]], [[cataract]]s,&lt;ref name="Dobson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| last1 = Dobson| title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmid = | pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d               }}&lt;/ref&gt; damage to plants, and reduction of [[plankton]] populations in the ocean's [[photic zone]]. This was not the case with global warming.&lt;ref name = RG/&gt;

== Personal risk assessment and knowledge ==
[[Image:Atmosphere layers-en.svg|thumb|right|upright|Layers of the atmosphere (not to scale). The Earth's ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere from approximately 20 to 30 kilometres (12 to 19 mi) above Earth.]]

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, assumes that while the quantity of specialized knowledge is exploding, in contrast scientific ignorance among lay people is the norm and even increasing. Public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of {{convert|2|C-change|0}} to {{convert|3|C-change|0}} over several decades do not resonate with people, for example in North America, who experience similar swings during a single day.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; As scientists define global warming as a problem of the future, a liability in the "attention economy", pessimistic outlooks in general and the attribution of extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed in the public arena (compare the [[Gore effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp 133-150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events&lt;/ref&gt; Even when [[James Hansen]] tried to use the [[1988–89 North American drought]] as a call to action, scientists kept stating, in line with the IPCC findings, that even extreme weather is not climate.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; While the greenhouse effect, ''per se'', is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone hole]] and other metaphors about ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties; both the ozone content of the upper atmosphere and its depletion are complicated to measure and the link between ozone depletion and rates of enhanced skin cancer is rather weak. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) resonated better with lay people and their concerns. 
{{"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged “shield” meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including “Hollywood affinities.” These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars&amp;nbsp;... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;
|author= Sheldon Ungar}}

The CFC regulation attempts at the end of the 1980s profited from those easy to grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. The fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], who had skin cancer removal from his nose in 1985 and 1987, was also of high importance.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar (2000) compares the similar important role of [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] for the public perception of AIDS.&lt;/ref&gt; In case of the public opinion on climate change, no imminent danger is perceived.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;

== Cost-benefit assessments and industry policy ==
{{main article|Economics of global warming}}

[[Cass Sunstein]] and others have compared the differing approach of the United States to the Montreal Protocol, which it accepted, and the Kyoto Protocol, which it rejected. Sunstein assumes that the [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit assessments]] of climate change action for the US were instrumental in the US' withdrawal from participation in Kyoto.&lt;ref name=cass&gt;[http://law.vanderbilt.edu/files/archive/Sunstein-2008.pdf Of Montreal and Kyoto: A Tale of Two Protocols] by Cass R. Sunstein 38 ELR 10566 8/2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Magraw]], also a lawyer, considers governmental motivations besides relative costs and benefits as being of higher importance.&lt;ref name=cass/&gt;  [[Peter Orszag]] and [[Terry Dinan]] took an insurance perspective and assume that an assessment which predicted dire consequences of climate change would be more of a motivation for the US to change its stance on global warming and adopting regulation measurements.&lt;ref name=cass/&gt;

The US chemical company [[DuPont]] had already lost some of their zeal in defending their products after a strategic manufacturing patent for [[Freon]] was [[Chlorofluorocarbon#Regulation and DuPont|set to expire in 1979]]. A citizen boycott of spray cans gained importance in parallel. Not by chance, the United States banned the use of CFCs in aerosol cans in 1978.&lt;ref name="Morrisette1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of Policy Responses to Stratospheric Ozone Depletion|journal=Natural Resources Journal|year=1989|first=Peter M.|last=Morrisette|volume=29|issue=|pages=793–820|id= |url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/003-006/003-006.html|accessdate=2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC-producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The European Community rejected proposals to ban CFCs in aerosol sprays for a long time. The EU shifted its position after Germany, which also has a large chemical industry, gave up its defence of the CFC industry&lt;ref name = RG/&gt; and started supporting moves towards regulation. After regulation was more and more enforced, DuPont acted faster than their European counterparts as they may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer, especially as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40&amp;nbsp;million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the US in the next 88 years.&lt;ref name="Shabecoff, Philip A1"/&gt; The identification and marketing of a 100% ozone-safe hydrocarbon refrigerant called "Greenfreeze" by the NGO Greenpeace in the early 1990s had a rapid significant impact in major markets of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, et al, 2002, "Forces Driving Environmental Innovation....", http://www.greenpeace.org/greece/Global/greece/report/2011/greenfreeze/6_Greenfreeze_story_2004_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace, "[http://www.ecomall.com/greenshopping/greenfreeze.htm GREENFREEZE: A REVOLUTION INDOMESTIC REFRIGERATION],"  &lt;/ref&gt; The climate change protocols were less successful. In the case of Kyoto, then secretary of the environment [[Angela Merkel]], prevented a possible failure by suggesting to use 1990 as starting date for emission reduction. In so far the demise of the Eastern European heavy industry allowed for a high commitment, but actual emissions kept on growing on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Purvis, [http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663319_1669897,00.html "Leaders &amp; Visionaries: Angela Merkel"], ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', Oct. 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various links between the two fields of human-atmospheric interaction. Policy experts have advocated for a closer linking of ozone protection and climate protection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=M.        | last1=Molina       | authorlink1=Mario Molina | first2=D.      | last2=Zaelke | first3=K.

[[Drew Shindell]] has used climate models to assess both climate change and ozone depletion. In his view, while research up to now has been more about the impact of CFC emissions on stratospheric ozone, the future will be more about the interaction between climate change and ozone feedback.&lt;ref name =shin/&gt;  Ozone is a greenhouse gas itself. Many [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting substances]] are also greenhouse gases, some agents of [[radiative forcing]] are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the short and medium term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Estrada, Francisco|year=2013|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n12/full/ngeo1999.html|title=Statistically derived contributions of diverse human influences to twentieth-century temperature changes|journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |pages=1050&amp;ndash;55 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1999 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increases in concentrations of these chemicals have produced 0.34&amp;nbsp;± 0.03&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of radiative forcing, corresponding to about 14% of the total radiative forcing from increases in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="spm_ozone" /&gt; Already the natural ozone variability in the stratosphere seems to be closely correlated with the 11-year solar cycle of irradiance changes and has, via a dynamic coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere, a significant impact on climate.&lt;ref name =shin&gt;Solar Cycle Variability, Ozone, and Climate, Drew Shindell et al., Solar Cycle Variability, Ozone, and Climate (Science, vol. 284. no. 5412, pp. 305 - 308, 9 April 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

As with carbon dioxide and methane, there are some natural sources of tropospheric chlorine, such as [[sea spray]]. Chlorine from [[salt spray|ocean spray]] is soluble and thus is washed by rainfall before it reaches the stratosphere. It is ''stratospheric'' chlorine that affects ozone depletion. Only [[methyl chloride]], which is one of the [[halocarbon]]s, has a mainly natural source,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is responsible for about 20% of the chlorine in the stratosphere; the remaining 80% comes from man-made sources. Chlorofluorocarbons, in contrast, are insoluble and long-lived, allowing them to reach the stratosphere. In the lower atmosphere, there is much more chlorine from CFCs and related [[haloalkane]]s than there is in hydrogen chloride from salt spray, and in the stratosphere halocarbons are dominant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ozone-depletion/stratcl ozone-depletion FAQ, Part II], section 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''protected areas of Nepal''' cover mainly forested land and are located at various altitudes in the [[Terai]], in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and in the mountains, thus encompassing a multitude of landscapes and preserving a vast [[biodiversity]] in the [[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]] and [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalayan]] ecozones.
Nepal covers {{convert|147181|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the central part of the Himalayas. Altitudes range from {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the south-eastern Terai to {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[Mount Everest|Sagarmatha]] within a short horizontal span. This extreme altitudinal gradient has resulted in 11&amp;nbsp;bio-climatic zones ranging from lower [[Tropical climate zone|tropical]] below {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to [[snow|nival]] above {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the High Himalayas, encompassing nine [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial ecoregions]] with 36&amp;nbsp;[[vegetation]] types. Botanists recorded 1,120&amp;nbsp;species of non-flowering plants and 5,160&amp;nbsp;species of flowering plants. Nepal ranks 10th in terms of richest flowering plant diversity in Asia. Zoologists recorded 181&amp;nbsp;mammal species, 844&amp;nbsp;bird species, 100&amp;nbsp;reptile species, 43&amp;nbsp;amphibian species, 185&amp;nbsp;freshwater fish species, and 635&amp;nbsp;butterfly species. In recognition of the magnitude of biodiversity the [[Government of Nepal]] has established a network of 20 [[protected area]]s since 1973, consisting of ten [[national park]]s, three [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]], six [[conservation area]]s and one [[Game reserve|hunting reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhuju, U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15244">'''Rayleigh waves''' are a type of [[surface acoustic wave]] that travel along the surface of solids. They can be produced in materials in many ways, such as by a localized impact or by [[Piezoelectricity|piezo-electric]] [[Interdigital transducer|transduction]], and are frequently used in [[non-destructive testing]] for detecting defects. Rayleigh waves are part of the [[seismic wave]]s that are produced on the [[Earth]] by [[earthquakes]]. When guided in layers they are referred to as [[Lamb waves]], Rayleigh–Lamb waves, or generalized Rayleigh waves.

Rayleigh waves are a type of [[surface wave]] that travel near the surface of solids. Rayleigh waves include both longitudinal and transverse motions that decrease exponentially in amplitude as distance from the surface increases. There is a phase difference between these component motions.&lt;ref name="Telford1990"/&gt;

The existence of Rayleigh waves was predicted in 1885 by [[Lord Rayleigh]], after whom they were named.&lt;ref&gt;http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s1-17/1/4.full.pdf "On Waves Propagated along the Plane Surface of an ElasticSolid", Lord Rayleigh, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; In [[isotropic]] solids these waves cause the surface particles to move in [[ellipse]]s in planes normal to the surface and parallel to the direction of propagation – the major axis of the ellipse is vertical. At the surface and at shallow depths this motion is ''retrograde'', that is the in-plane motion of  a particle is counterclockwise when the wave travels from left to right. At greater depths the particle motion becomes ''prograde''. In addition, the motion amplitude decays and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] changes as the depth into the material increases. The depth of significant displacement in the solid is approximately equal to the acoustic [[wavelength]]. Rayleigh waves are distinct from other types of surface or guided [[Acoustics|acoustic]] waves such as [[Love wave]]s or [[Lamb wave]]s, both being types of guided waves supported by a layer, or [[longitudinal waves|longitudinal]] and [[shear waves]], that travel in the bulk.

Rayleigh waves have a speed slightly less than shear waves by a factor dependent on the elastic constants of the material.&lt;ref name="Telford1990"/&gt; The typical speed of Rayleigh waves in metals is of the order of 2–5&amp;nbsp;km/s, and the typical Rayleigh speed in the ground is of the order of 50–300&amp;nbsp;m/s. For linear elastic materials with positive Poisson ratio (&lt;math&gt;\nu &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), the Rayleigh wave speed can be approximated as &lt;math&gt;c_R/c_S = \frac{0.862 + 1.14 \nu}{1+\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Freund1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. B. Freund|title=Dynamic Fracture Mechanics|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521629225|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rayleigh waves are confined near the surface, their in-plane amplitude when generated by a point source decays only as &lt;math&gt;{1}/{\sqrt{r}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance. Surface waves therefore decay more slowly with distance than do bulk waves, which spread out in three dimensions from a point source. This slow decay is one reason why they are of particular interest to seismologists. Rayleigh waves can circle the globe multiple times after a large earthquake and still be measurably large.

In seismology, Rayleigh waves (called "ground roll") are the most important type of surface wave, and can be produced (apart from earthquakes), for example, by [[wind wave|ocean waves]],  by explosions, by railway trains and ground vehicles, or by a sledgehammer impact.&lt;ref name="Telford1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Telford|first1=William Murray|last2=Geldart|first2=L.

=== Rayleigh wave dispersion ===

[[File:DispersionRayleighWave.jpg|right|thumb|Dispersion of Rayleigh waves in a thin gold film on glass.[http://kino-ap.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/index.html]]]

In isotropic, linear elastic materials described by Lame coefficients &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, Rayleigh waves have a speed given by solutions to the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta^3 -8 \zeta^2 + 8 \zeta (3-2\eta) - 16 (1-\eta) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \zeta = \omega^2 / k^2 \beta^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \eta = \beta^2/\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \rho \alpha^2 = \lambda + 2 \mu &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \rho \beta^2 = \mu &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Elasticity |edition=3rd|last=Landau |first=L.D. |authorlink=Lev Landau |author2=Lifshitz, E. M. |authorlink2= Evgeny Lifshitz  |year=1986 |publisher=Butterworth Heinemann |location=Oxford, England |isbn=0-7506-2633-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since this equation has no inherent scale, the boundary value problem giving rise to Rayleigh waves are dispersionless.
An interesting special case is the Poisson solid, for which &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \mu&lt;/math&gt;, since this gives a frequency-independent phase velocity equal to &lt;math&gt; \omega/k = \beta \sqrt{0.8453}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elastic constants often change with depth, due to the changing properties of the material. This means that the velocity of a Rayleigh wave in practice becomes dependent on the [[wavelength]] (and therefore [[frequency]]), a phenomenon referred to as [[Velocity dispersion|dispersion]]. Waves affected by dispersion have a different [[wave train]] shape.&lt;ref name="Telford1990"/&gt; Rayleigh waves on ideal, homogeneous and flat elastic solids show no dispersion, as stated above. However, if a solid or structure has a [[density]] or [[sound velocity]] that varies with depth, Rayleigh waves become dispersive. One example is Rayleigh waves on the Earth's surface: those waves with a higher [[frequency]] travel more slowly than those with a lower frequency. This occurs because a Rayleigh wave of lower frequency has a relatively long [[wavelength]]. The displacement of long wavelength waves penetrates more deeply into the Earth than short wavelength waves. Since the speed of waves in the Earth increases with increasing depth, the longer wavelength ([[low frequency]]) waves can travel faster than the shorter wavelength ([[high frequency]]) waves. Rayleigh waves thus often appear spread out on [[seismogram]]s recorded at distant earthquake recording stations. It is also possible to observe Rayleigh wave dispersion in thin films or multi-layered structures.

==Rayleigh waves in non-destructive testing==

Rayleigh waves are widely used for materials characterization, to discover the mechanical and structural properties of the object being tested – like the presence of cracking, and the related shear modulus. This is in common with other types of surface waves.&lt;ref name="ThompsonChimenti1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Donald O.|last2=Chimenti|first2=Dale E.|title=Review of progress in quantitative nondestructive evaluation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3etLzmHu6bQC&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=8 June 2011|date=1 June 1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-45597-1|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rayleigh waves used for this purpose are in the [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequency range.

They are used at different length scales because they are easily generated and detected on the free surface of solid objects. Since they are confined in the vicinity of the free surface within a depth (~ the wavelength) linked to the [[frequency]] of the wave, different frequencies can be used for characterization at different length scales.

==Rayleigh waves in electronic devices==

Rayleigh waves propagating at high ultrasonic frequencies (10–1000&amp;nbsp;MHz) are used widely in different electronic devices.&lt;ref name="Oliner1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliner|first=A.A.(ed)|title=Acoustic Surface Waves|year=1978|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540085750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Rayleigh waves, some other types of surface acoustic waves (SAW), e.g. [[Love waves]], are also used for this purpose. Examples of electronic devices using Rayleigh waves are [[Electronic filter|filter]]s, resonators, oscillators, [[sensors]] of pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. Operation of SAW devices is based on the transformation of the initial electric signal into a surface wave that, after achieving the required changes to the spectrum of the initial electric signal as a result of its interaction with different types of surface inhomogeneity,&lt;ref name="Biryukov1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biryukov|first1=S.V.|last2=Gulyaev|first2=Y.V.|last3=Krylov|first3=V.V.|last4=Plessky|first4=V.P.|title=Surface Acoustic Waves in Inhomogeneous Media|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-57767-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is transformed back into a modified electric signal. The transformation of the initial electric energy into mechanical energy (in the form of SAW) and back is usually accomplished via the use of [[piezoelectric]] materials for both generation and reception of Rayleigh waves as well as for their propagation.

== Rayleigh waves in geophysics ==

=== Rayleigh waves from earthquakes===

Because Rayleigh waves are surface waves, the [[amplitude]] of such waves generated by an earthquake generally decreases exponentially with the depth of the [[hypocenter]] (focus).  However,  large earthquakes may generate Rayleigh waves that travel around the Earth several times before dissipating.

In seismology longitudinal and shear waves are known as [[P-wave]]s and [[S-wave]]s, respectively, and are termed body waves. Rayleigh waves are generated by the interaction of P- and S- waves at the surface of the earth, and travel with a velocity that is lower than the P-, S-, and Love wave velocities.  Rayleigh waves emanating outward from the epicenter of an earthquake  travel along the surface of the earth at about 10 times the [[speed of sound]] in air (0.340&amp;nbsp;km/s), that is ~3&amp;nbsp;km/s.

Due to their higher speed, the P- and S-waves generated by an earthquake arrive before the surface waves.  However, the particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so the surface waves tend to cause more damage. In the case of Rayleigh waves, the motion is of a rolling nature, similar to an [[ocean surface wave]].  The intensity of Rayleigh wave shaking at a particular location is dependent on several factors:
[[File:Rayleigh wave direction.jpg|thumb|Rayleigh wave direction]]
* The size of the earthquake.
* The distance to the earthquake.
* The depth of the earthquake.
* The geologic structure of the crust.
* The [[focal mechanism]] of the earthquake.
* The rupture directivity of the earthquake.

Local geologic structure can serve to focus or defocus Rayleigh waves, leading to significant differences in shaking over short distances.

===Rayleigh waves in seismology===

Low frequency Rayleigh waves generated during [[earthquakes]] are used in [[seismology]] to characterise the [[Earth]]'s interior.
In intermediate ranges, Rayleigh waves are used in [[geophysics]] and [[geotechnical engineering]] for the characterisation of [[oil]] deposits. These applications are based on the geometric [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersion]] of Rayleigh waves and on the solution of an inverse problem on the basis of seismic data collected on the ground surface using active sources (falling weights, hammers or small explosions, for example) or by recording microtremors.
Rayleigh ground waves are important also for environmental noise and vibration control since they make a major contribution to traffic-induced [[ground vibrations]] and the associated structure-borne [[noise]] in buildings.

== Other manifestations ==

=== Animals ===

[[Low frequency]] (&lt; 20&amp;nbsp;Hz) Rayleigh waves are inaudible, yet they can be detected by many [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Humans should be able to detect such Rayleigh waves through their [[Pacinian corpuscle]]s, which are in the joints, although people do not seem to consciously respond to the signals. Some animals seem to use Rayleigh waves to communicate. In particular, some biologists theorize that [[elephant]]s may use vocalizations to generate Rayleigh waves. Since Rayleigh waves decay slowly, they should be detectable over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O’Connell-Rodwell |first=C.E.|first2 = B.T.|last2 =Arnason |first3 = L.A.|last3 =Hart |date= 14 September 2000 |title= Seismic properties of Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) vocalizations and locomotion |journal= J. Acoust. Soc. Am. |volume= 108|issue=6 |pages=3066–3072 |doi= 10.1121/1.1323460 |pmid=11144599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that these Rayleigh waves have a much higher frequency than Rayleigh waves generated by earthquakes.

After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], some people have speculated that Rayleigh waves served as a warning to animals to seek higher ground, allowing them to escape the more slowly traveling [[tsunami]]. At this time, evidence for this is mostly anecdotal. Other animal early warning systems may rely on an ability to sense [[infrasound|infrasonic]] waves traveling through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2004/12/surviving_the_tsunami.html|title=Surviving the Tsunami |last1=Kenneally  |first1=Christine |date= 30 December 2004  |website= http://www.slate.com/ |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schofield Equation''' is a method of estimating the [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) of adult men and women published in 1985.&lt;ref name="pmid4044297"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schofield WN |title=Predicting basal metabolic rate, new standards and review of previous work |journal=Hum Nutr Clin Nutr |volume=39 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=5–41 |date=1985 |pmid=4044297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key:

W = Body weight in kilograms

SEE = Standard error of estimation

The raw figure obtained by the equation should be adjusted up or downwards, within the confidence limit suggested by the quoted estimation errors, and according to the following principles:

Subjects leaner and more muscular than usual require more energy than the average.
Obese subjects require less.
Patients at the young end of the age range for a given equation require more energy.
Patients at the high end of the age range for a given equation require less energy.

Effects of age and body mass may cancel out: an obese 30-year-old or an athletic 60-year-old may need no adjustment from the raw figure.

To find actual energy needed per day (Estimated Energy Requirement), the base metabolism must then be multiplied by an activity factor. 
These are as follows:

*Sedentary people of both genders should multiply by 1.3. Sedentary is very physically inactive, inactive in both work and leisure.
*Lightly active men should multiply by 1.6 and women by 1.5. Lightly active means the daily routine includes some walking, or intense exercise once or twice per week. Most students are in this category.
*Moderately active men should multiply by 1.7 and women by 1.6. Moderately active means intense exercise lasting 20–45 minutes at least three time per week, or a job with a lot of walking, or a moderate intensity job.
*Very Active men should multiply by 2.1 and women by 1.9. Very active means intense exercise lasting at least an hour per day, or a heavy physical job, such as a mail carrier or an athlete in training.
*Extremely active men should multiply by 2.4 and women by 2.2. Extremely active means an athlete on an unstoppable training schedule or a very demanding job, such as working in the armed forces or shoveling coal.

These equations were published in 1989 in the dietary guidelines and formed the RDA's for a number of years. The activity factor used by the USDA was 1.6. In the UK, a lower activity factor  of 1.4 is used. The equation has now been replaced by the [[Institute of Medicine Equation]] in  September 2002 in the USA, however is still currently used by the FAO/WHO/UNU.

The '''solar power tower''', also known as 'central tower' power plants or '[[heliostat]]' power plants or power towers, is a type of [[solar furnace]] using a tower to receive the focused sunlight. It uses an array of flat, movable mirrors (called heliostats) to focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower (the target). Concentrated solar thermal is seen as one viable solution for renewable, pollution-free energy.

Early designs used these focused rays to heat water, and used the resulting [[steam]] to power a [[turbine]]. Newer designs using liquid [[sodium]] have been demonstrated, and systems using molten salts (40% [[potassium nitrate]], 60% [[sodium nitrate]]) as the [[working fluids]] are now in operation. These working fluids have high [[heat capacity]], which can be used to store the energy before using it to boil water to drive turbines. These designs also allow power to be generated when the sun is not shining.

== Cost ==

The US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) has estimated that by 2020 electricity could be produced from power towers for 5.47 cents per kWh.&lt;ref name="Avoiding Carbon Apocalypse Through Alternative Energy: Life After Fossil Fuels"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Lowry|title=Avoiding Carbon Apocalypse Through Alternative Energy: Life After Fossil Fuels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R09DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=2017|publisher=Springer|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Companies such as [[ESolar]] (backed by [[Google.org]]) are continuing development of cheap, low maintenance, mass producible heliostat components that will reduce costs in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20071127_green.html Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal November 27, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; ESolar's design uses large numbers of small mirrors (1.14&amp;nbsp;m²), which reduce costs for installing mounting systems such as concrete, steel, drilling, and cranes.

Improvements in working fluid systems, such as moving from current two tank (hot/cold) designs to single tank thermocline systems with quartzite thermal fillers and oxygen blankets will improve material efficiency and reduce costs further.

* Some concentrating solar power towers are air-cooled instead of water-cooled, to avoid using limited desert water&lt;ref name="brightsourceenergy.com"&gt;http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/faqs/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flat glass is used instead of the more expensive curved glass&lt;ref name="brightsourceenergy.com" /&gt;
* Thermal storage to store the heat in molten salt containers to continue producing electricity while the sun is not shining
* Steam is heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C to drive turbines that are coupled to generators which produce electricity
* Control systems to supervise and control all the plant activity including the heliostat array positions, alarms, other data acquisition and communication.

Generally, installations use from {{convert|150|ha|m2}} to {{convert|320|ha|m2}}.

== Environmental concerns ==
There is evidence that such large area solar concentrating installations can kill birds that fly over them. Near the center of the array temperatures can reach 550 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C which, with the solar flux itself, is enough to incinerate birds while further away feathers are scorched leading to the eventual death of the bird. Workers at the Ivanpah solar power plant call these birds “streamers,” as they ignite in midair and plummet to the ground trailing smoke. During testing of the initial standby position for the heliostats, 115 birds were killed as they entered the concentrated solar flux. After adjusting the standby position to not focus all the solar energy into a single point, during the following 6 months of operations, a total of 321 birds were killed.&lt;ref name="Kraemer"&gt;{{cite web

== Commercial applications ==

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in solar tower power technology, as is evident from the fact that there are several companies involved in planning, designing and building utility size power plants. This is an important step towards the ultimate goal of developing commercially viable plants. There are numerous examples of case studies of applying innovative solutions to solar power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pointfocus.com/ SOLAR POWER IN THE NEWS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novel applications ==
[[Image:Pit Power Tower.gif|thumb|Pit Power Tower concept in [[Bingham Canyon mine]]]]

The Pit Power Tower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altenergymag.com/emagazine.php?issue_number=09.02.01&amp;article=gwiazda Pit Power Tower - Alternative Energy News Feb 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US20050150225 Pit Power Tower US Patent]&lt;/ref&gt; combines a solar power tower and an aero-electric power tower&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy tower]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a decommissioned open pit mine. Traditional solar power towers are constrained in size by the height of the tower and closer heliostats blocking the line of sight of outer heliostats to the receiver. The use of the pit mine's "stadium seating" helps overcome the blocking constraint.

As solar power towers commonly use steam to drive the turbines, and water tends to be scarce in regions with high solar energy, another advantage of open pits is that they tend to collect water, having been dug below the water table. The Pit Power Tower uses low heat steam to drive the pneumatic tubes in a co-generation system. A third benefit of re-purposing a pit mine for this kind of project is the possibility of reusing mine infrastructure such as roads, buildings and electricity.

'''Tarapacáite''' is the mineral form of [[potassium chromate]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[potassium|K]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[chromium|Cr]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It forms bright yellow crystals and was discovered in 1878. It is named for the former Tarapacá Province, Peru; nowadays belonging to Chile. The boundaries between Peru, Bolivia and Chile were vague in the [[Atacama Desert]] before the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Its [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is Oficina Maria Elena, Maria Elena, [[Tocopilla Province]], Antofagasta Region, Chile. It is unlikely to occur anywhere except in highly arid conditions as it is easily soluble in water.&lt;ref name=Mindat /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Tarapacaite.shtml Webmineral.com - Tarapacaite]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/tarapacaite.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy (HOM - MSA) - Tarapacaite]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Seixas Solomons''' (1870–1947) was an explorer and early member of the [[Sierra Club]].  From 1892 to 1897 he explored and named the [[Mount Goddard]], [[Evolution Valley]] and [[Evolution Basin]] region in what is now northern [[Kings Canyon National Park]] in eastern California.  He was instrumental in envisioning, exploring, and establishing the route of what became the [[John Muir Trail]] from [[Yosemite Valley]] along the crest of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to [[Mount Whitney]]

the second son and the fifth of seven children&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Selina (b. 1862) became a writer and advocate for woman suffrage; Lucius Levy (b. 1863) became a lawyer and public speaker; Gertrude Marks (b. 1866) died at a young age; Adele Rosa (b. 1868) became a doctor; Leon Mendes (b. 1873) became a scholar; Frank Benjamin (b. 1875) died as an infant.&lt;/ref&gt; of Hannah Marks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/solomons-hannah-marks|title=Hannah Marks Solomon|work=American Jewish Women Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential San Francisco educator and civic worker and Gershom Mendes Seixas Solomons.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;His cousin was the poet [[Emma Lazarus]] (1849–1887), known for her verses inscribed on the [[Statue of Liberty]]. He was also related to [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], Associate Justice of the [[US Supreme Court]].&lt;/ref&gt; He had relocated to San Francisco from New York City during the Gold Rush, and founded [[Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco, California)|Congregation Emanu-El]] in 1854. He was also the first president of any West Coast lodge of [[B'nai B'rith]]. His great-grandfather was [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]] (1745–1816), the "Patriot Rabbi", the first native-born Rabbi in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=18OdlLqqdykC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;lpg=PT48&amp;dq=%22the+patriot+rabbi%22

He was also one of the incorporators of [[Columbia University]] and served as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomons later recalled that the idea that resulted in the John Muir Trail originated in his adolescence. "The idea of a crest-parallel trail came to me one day while herding my uncle's cattle in an immense unfenced alfalfa field near Fresno.  It was 1884 and I was 14." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winnett|first=Thomas|author2=Morey, Kathy |title=Guide to the John Muir Trail|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Berkeley, CA|year=2001|edition=Third|pages=front paper|isbn=0-89997-221-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
Solomons married three times. He married as his first wife, on March 29, 1901, at [[Dawson Creek]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], Rozella M. Gould of Dawson Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He married on January 8, 1909, in [[New York City]], as his second wife, Katherine Gray Church, born on May 6, 1881 in New York City the only daughter of Henry Seymour Church and Margaretta Josephine Gray. She died on February 7, 1971 in [[Cherryland, California|Cherryland]], [[Alameda County, California]].&lt;ref name="Raymond, Marcius D.64"&gt;Raymond, Marcius D., p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jordan372&gt;Jordan, 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Katherine's stepfather was Albert J. Bothwell, a  wealthy cattle baron and founder of the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] and considered, by some, to be the main instigator of the infamous Wyoming [[Johnson County War]].&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, a published writer and singer, was born into a family with deep New England roots that trace back to the Rev. Mr. [[Blackleach Burritt]],&lt;ref name="Dexter103-105"&gt;Dexter, pp. 103-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond, Marcius D.32"&gt;Raymond, Marcius D., pp. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and Governor [[Thomas Welles]].&lt;ref name="Dexter103-105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Descendants of Governor Thomas Welles of Connecticut, 1590-1658, and His Wife, Alice Tomes"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wpNYAAAAMAAJ |title=The Descendants of Governor Thomas Welles of Connecticut, 1590-1658, and His Wife, Alice Tomes|first=Donna H|last=Siemiatkoski|publisher=Gateway Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his second wife was committed to a mental institution, he married Yvonne Robinson who died in 1965. They had no children.

Theodore and Katherine were the parents of three children: Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony "Toni" Solomons (1911–2006),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;An unusually gifted student, Toni scored so high on intelligence tests that she was selected for a lifelong research project known as the [[Genetic Studies of Genius|Terman Genetic Studies of Genius]]. The study was started by [[Lewis Terman]] at [[Stanford University]]. After marrying and divorcing Benjamin O. Jackson, she began a relationship with [[Ed Ricketts]] in 1940 and became his common-law wife. Toni, who had attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], later worked as a personal assistant for [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning writer [[John Steinbeck]] and was the editor of ''[[The Log from the Sea of Cortez]]''. Beside Steinbeck, their circle of friends also included the writer and painter, [[Henry Miller]] and the mythologist, writer, and lecturer [[Joseph Campbell]]. She left Ricketts after the death of her daughter (by her first husband) Katherine Adele Jackson. She died on October 5, 1947 at the age of 12 of a brain tumor and only five months after the death of her father. She later married [[Benjamin Elazari Volcani]].&lt;/ref&gt; David Seixas Solomons (1913–1961), and Leon Henry Solomons (1915–1988). Eleanor was married to [[Israel]]i biologist [[Benjamin Elazari Volcani]].

They lived at a house he named the Flying Spur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =About the Spur| work =| publisher =The Flying Spur| year =2009| url =http://www.thespur.org/about.html| doi =| accessdate =2010-05-08}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he built on {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of land that juts out over the [[Merced River]] Canyon. It is located at {{convert|4600|ft|m}} in the [[Stanislaus National Forest]] adjacent to [[Yosemite National Park]].

==Explorations==
In his explorations, Solomons correctly determined the courses of the upper branches of the [[San Joaquin River]].  In 1892, accompanied by [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]] and Sidney I. Peixotto, he crossed from Mount Lyell by way of Rush Creek to the base of [[Mount Ritter]] and ascended the peak.  In 1895, Solomons took his most notable trip, accompanied by Ernest C. Bonner.  Ascending the South Fork of the San Joaquin they came to the group of mountains now designated the Evolution Group, named by Solomons. The highest of these he called [[Mount Darwin (California)|Mount Darwin]] (after the evolutionist [[Charles Darwin]]), and the others he named [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]], [[Thomas Fiske|Fiske]], [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], after famous evolutionists of the day.  Continuing their explorations, Solomons and Bonner ascended [[Mount Goddard]], then made their way down to Simpson Meadow via North Goddard Creek, and were the first to make this section known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shirley|last=Sargent|title=Solomons of the Sierra: the Pioneer of the John Muir Trail|year=1989|location=Yosemite|publisher=Flying Spur Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomons’ excursions in the next two years added details to the knowledge of Sierra topography, but his principal contribution was an accurate map which he drafted and presented to the Sierra Club in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sierra Club Bulletin|volume=I|pages=287–288|year=1896|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and memorials==
He died in Los Angeles, California on May 27, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi|title=California Death Records|publisher=The California Department of Health Services Office of Health Information and Research vital Statistics Section|access-date=2010-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101054826/http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi|archive-date=2012-01-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Solomons]] (13016') is named after him as well as the [[long-distance trail]] the [[Theodore Solomons Trail]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">In genetics, transgressive segregation is the formation of extreme phenotypes, or transgressive phenotypes, observed in segregated [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] populations compared to phenotypes observed in the parental lines.&lt;ref&gt;Nolte, Arne W.; H David Sheets (2005-06-29). "Shape based assignment tests suggest transgressive phenotypes in natural sculpin hybrids (Teleostei, Scorpaeniformes, Cottidae)". Frontiers in Zoology&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these trangressive (extreme) phenotypes can be either positive or negative in terms of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. If both parents' favorable alleles come together, it will result in a hybrid having a higher fitness than the two parents. The hybrid species will show more genetic variation and variation in gene expression than their parents. As a result, the hybrid species will have some traits that are transgressive (extreme) in nature. Transgressive segregation can allow a hybrid species to populate different environments/niches in which the parent species do not reside, or compete in the existing environment with the parental species.

==Causes==

'''Genetic'''

There are many causes for transgressive segregation in hybrids. One cause can be due to recombination of additive alleles. [[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] results in new pairs of alleles at two or more loci. These different pairs of alleles can give rise to new phenotypes if gene expression has been changed at these loci. Another cause can be elevated [[mutation rate]]. When mutation rates are high, it is more probable that a mutation will occur and cause an extreme phenotypic change. Reduced [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9375532 developmental stability] is another cause for transgressive segregation. Developmental stability refers to the capability of a genotype to go through a constant development of a phenotype in a certain environmental setting. If there is a disturbance due to genetic or environmental factors, the genotype will be more sensitive to phenotypic changes. Another cause arises from the interaction between two alleles of two different genes, also known as the [[Epistasis|epistatic effect]]. Epistasis is the event when one allele at a locus prevents an allele at another locus to express its product as if it is masking its effect. Therefore, epistasis can be related to gene over dominance caused by heterozygosity at specific loci.[2] What this means is that the heterozygote (hybrid) when compared to the homozygote (parent) is better adapted and therefore shows more transgressive, extreme phenotypes. All of these causes lead to the appearance of these extreme phenotypes and creates a hybrid species that will deviate away from the parent species niche and eventually create an individual "hybrid" species.

'''Environmental'''
 
Other than the genetic factors solely causing transgressive segregation, environmental factors can cause genetic factors to take place. Environmental factors that cause transgressive segregation can be influenced by human activity and [[climate change]]. Both human activity and climate change have the capability to force species of a specific [[genome]] to interact with other species with different genomes.

For example, if a bridge is built that connects two isolated areas to one another, a [[gene flow]] door would open. This open door will increase the interactions between different species with different genomes can create hybrid species that can potentially show transgressive phenotypes. Human activity can open the gene flow door by pursuing harmful actions such as cutting down forests and pollution. Climate change on the other hand can open the gene flow door by breaking climate and environmental barriers that were present before. This convergence between species can give rise to a hybrid species that will have more phenotypic variation when compared to the parent species. This increase in phenotypic variation has the potential for transgressive segregation to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hegarty, M. J. "Invasion of the hybrids." Molecular Ecology 21.19 (2012): 4669–4671.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of transgressive segregation==

In Kenya, there is an organism called [[Mycosphaerella graminicola|septoria tritici blotch]] (STB) that diminishes yield in wheat crop. The parent species of wheat had little resistance toward STB, but the hybrid species due to transgressive segregation showed a higher resistance toward STB and therefore a higher fitness. You can create a higher resistance to STB by crossing genes together that are efficient. In result, out of 36 crosses there were 31 that showed a higher mean fitness than the control, parent value. These 31 crosses indicate a higher resistance to STB. The crosses used were from other commercial wheat's that were high yielding which is advantageous because there is a lower chance of deleterious (unwanted traits) appearing and therefore an increase in beneficial traits. Transgressive segregation has been found to be useful to create a resistance toward this organism in order to increase the yield of wheat crop.&lt;ref&gt;Arama, P. F., J. E. Parlevliet, and C. H. Van Silfhout. "Trangressive segregation for resistance in wheat to sep toria tritici blotch." African Crop Science Journal8.3 (2000): 213–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieseberg used sunflowers to show the transgressive segregation of parental traits. ''[[Sunflower|Helianthus annuus]]'' and ''[[Helianthus petiolaris]]'' are the two parent groups for the hybrids. Ultimately there were three hybrid sunflower species. When compared to the fitness of the parents, the hybrids showed a higher tolerance in areas which the parent species would not be able to survive i.e. salt marsh, sand dunes, and deserts. Transgressive segregation allowed these hybrids to survive in areas that the parent would not be able to. Therefore, the hybrids were populated in areas where the parent species were not. This is due to hybrid species showing more [[gene expression]] (phenotypes) than their parents and also having some genes that are transgressive (extreme) in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzbach, Andrea E., Lisa A. Donovan, and Loren H. Rieseberg. "Transgressive character expression in a hybrid sunflower species." American Journal of Botany 88.2 (2001): 270–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing for transgressive segregation==

There are many ways to test if transgressive segregation occurred within a population. One common way to test for transgressive segregation is to use a [[Dunnett's test]]. This test looks at whether the hybrid species' performance was different from the control group by looking whether or not the mean of the control group (parent species) differs significantly from mean of the other groups. If there is a difference, that is an indication of transgressive segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen‐Morris, A. D., and R. G. Latta. "Fitness consequences of hybridization between ecotypes of Avena barbata: hybrid breakdown, hybrid vigor, and transgressive segregation." Evolution 60.8 (2006): 1585–1595.&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly used test is the use of [[Quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci (QTL)]] to assess transgressive segregation. Alleles with QTL that were opposed (either by overdomiance or underdominance) of the parental parent QTL indicate that transgressive segregation occurred. Alleles with QTL that was the same as the predicted parent QTL showed that there was no transgressive segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Tanksley, S. D. "QTL analysis of transgressive segregation in an interspecific tomato cross." Genetics 134.2 (1993): 585–596. (p.589)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

Transgressive segregation creates an opportunity for new hybrid species to arise that are more fit than their ancestors. As seen with the STB in Kenya and Rieseberg's sunflowers, transgressive segregation can be used to create a species that is more adaptable and resistant in areas where there is environmental stress. Transgressive segregation can be seen as [[genetic engineering]] in the way that the goal for each of these events is to create an organism that is more fit than the last.

'''Tungstite''' is a hydrous [[tungsten]] [[oxide]] mineral with formula: [[tungsten|W]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·[[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. It is a secondary mineral formed by the [[weathering]] of other tungsten containing minerals. It crystallizes in the [[orthorhombic]] system in translucent yellow to yellow green masses. It is clay-like with [[Mohs hardness]] of 2.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 5.5.

It was first described in 1868 for an occurrence near [[Trumbull, Connecticut]] at the [[Old Mine Park Archeological Site|Hubbard Tungsten Mine at Long Hill]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">Typical metorological year is a collation of selected [[weather]] data for a specific location, listing hourly values of [[solar radiation]] and meteorological elements for a one-year period. The values are generated from a data bank much longer than a year in duration. It is specially selected so that it presents the range of weather phenomena for the location in question, while still giving annual averages that are consistent with the long-term averages for the location in question.

TMY data is frequently used in building [[Computer simulation|simulation]], in order to assess the expected heating and cooling costs for the design of the building. It is also used by designers of solar energy systems including solar domestic hot water systems and large-scale solar thermal power plants. Since they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The source data are available for download from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, S. and W. Marion. User's Manual for TMY3 Data Sets, NREL/TP-581-43156. April, 2008. Golden, Colorado: National Renewable Energy Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

The first TMY collection was based on 229 locations in the US and was collected between 1948 and 1980. The second edition of the TMY is called "TMY2". It is based on 239 stations collecting data between 1961 and 1990. The TMY2 data include [[Precipitable water column]] (precipitable moisture), which is important in predicting [[radiative cooling]]. The third, and latest TMY collection (TMY3) was based on data for 1020 locations in the USA including Guam, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands, derived from a 1976-2005 period of record where available, and a 1991-2005 period of record for all other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, S. and W. Marion. User's Manual for TMY3 Data Sets, NREL/TP-581-43156. April, 2008. Golden, Colorado: National Renewable Energy Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial software packages supporting simulations using TMY data include [[TRNSYS]], PV*SOL&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.valentin.de/en&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and PVscout&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarschmiede.de/en&lt;/ref&gt; PVSyst. TMY data specific for specific locations will usually need to be paid for. On the other hand, an advanced, comprehensive, and free simulation package developed under funding from the US Department of Energy called [[EnergyPlus]] also reads TMY3 data files, and a large number of these are available at no cost from their website.

NREL provides access to TMY2 and TMY3 data sets and also uses these data sets in its online solar energy calculator PVWatts.
