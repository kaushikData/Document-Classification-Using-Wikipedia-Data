      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37118">'''[[Academic freedom]] in the Middle East''' is a contested and debated issue, which has caught regional and international attention. In the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]] region, in general, the authoritarian regimes have all showed a certain degree of opposition to every sort of freedom, academic one not excluded, regardless of the type of regime basis they had. Freedom for academicians to inquiry, research, teach and communicate ideas or report facts without being threatened or persecuted or with the possibility of losing their position, being censored or repressed is threatened. What contributes to academic freedom violations is also that they are essential elements for the regimes to maintain their power and in addition to this issue, interstate and civil wars as well as internal disorders and external intervention can damage educational structures and institutions. Additionally, as far as the regime is concerned, a security or national threat can be a pretest for suffocate or suspend academic research and debate. Restrictions on academic freedom also regards the topics of research, which are under significant constraints, although these might be highly interesting and worth researching.

==Background==
There are many organizations that deal with monitoring violations of academic freedom and report academicians' voices, through publishing letters directed to public figures and also directed to the international community.

===Scholars at Risk===
[[Scholars at Risk]] is an international network based in the United States, specifically at the University of Chicago. The aim of this organization is to support scholars and defend academic freedom and human rights all over the world. One of the projects of this network is the Academic Freedom Monitor.

====Reported cases from Academic Freedom Monitor====
The online website Academic Freedom Monitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with reporting violations related to academic freedom. It is based on robust sources of information, which come from independent actors and are, then, verified. According to the Academic Freedom Monitor, which reports cases since 2010 until now, there are different categories of violation regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.academicfreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the Middle East and Northern Africa, the AFM registers cases in: Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Kuwait, Yemen, Iraq, Palestine (OPT), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia.

==== Types of violations ====
Academic Freedom Monitor identifies different types of violations as following:
* Killings, violence or disappearances
* Wrongful imprisonment/detention
* Wrongful prosecution
* Restrictions on travel or movement
* Retaliatory discharge or loss of position/expulsion from study
* Other significant events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info/monitoring|title=Monitoring - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on Academic Freedom===
[[Middle East Studies Association of North America|The Middle East Studies Association (MESA)]] is an association which brings together scholars and informed people with an interested in the MENA region. This association is the promoter of the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' and has the aim to promote cooperation, communication and boost the learning regarding the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/about/index.html|title=About MESA|website=MESANA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fields it is dealing with regards academic freedom. This association has created a Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF), which aims to remove any obstacle regarding the exchange of knowledge and any restrictions on academicians coming also from governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|website=MESANA.org|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
=== History ===
Academic freedom in Turkey has been through a series of changes and fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Summak, M Semih. “Academic Human Rights and Freedoms in Turkey.” ''The Educational Forum'' 62, no. 1 (1997): 32–39. doi:10.1080/00131729708982678.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often irregular, inadequate and closely tied to the politics in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weiker, Walter F. “Academic Freedom and Problems of Higher Education in Turkey.” ''Middle East Journal'' 16, no. 3 (1962): 279–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balyer, Aydın. “Academic Freedom : Perceptions of Academics in Turkey Akademik Özgürlük : Türkiye ’ Deki Akademisyenlerin Algıları” 36, no. 162 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norris, Kristin E, Academic Freedom and University Autonomy: A comparative analysis of the Turkish higher education system. (2011). http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2486&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Education in Turkey#History|reform]] initiatives have been taken throughout Turkey's history which aim at restructuring governance of higher education and thus affecting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Doğan, Didem. “Academic Freedom from the Perspectives of Academics and Students: A Qualitative Study.” ''TeEği̇ti̇m VBi̇li̇m'' 41, no. 184 (2016): 25–32. doi:10.15390/EB.2016.6135.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reform initiative was in 1933, as Malche was invited by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to restructure [[Istanbul University|Istanbul University (Istanbul Darülfünun)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Üvey, Doðan|author2=Gökçe, Ayse Nur|title="The Role of Prof. Dr. Albert Malche in 1933 university reform in turkey." |journal=Acta - Congressus Historiae Pharmaciae|date=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F25595219FD4268916676FA70A746DE?doi=10.1.1.613.7020&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the reforms that made it to the law 2252 was according [[List of universities in Turkey|universities]] with more freedom. In 1946, the Law Number 4936 accorded universities with unprecedented rights, as academicians were seen as guardians of democracy second to the military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
The [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|Democratic Party]] in 1953 passed laws that would undermine the universities' control over their budget, retirement of academicians and their employment rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those attacks on academic freedom were aimed at confining professors from being involved in partisan politics resulting in several cases of suspensions of academicians and denial of promotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]] was seen as a promise for reversal of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|DP]]'s encroachment over university autonomy, as it recruited academicians in government offices, selected to write the constitution and other vital roles. However, the 1960 coup junta surprisingly dismissed 147 academicians who were not in agreement with some members of the junta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In 1973, higher education was restructured with the increased sovereignty of the Interuniversity Council (ÜAK), while at the same time universities were given complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== The Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ====
The current Higher Education Law was implemented in 1981 following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The law maintains that, “universities are judicial structures which are managed and supervised by the organs selected among them. University organs, academics and teaching assistants cannot be removed from their posts for no reason by authorities outside the university” (YÖK 2007).&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Higher Education. ''The Law on Higher Education 1981''. The Republic of Turkey: Official Gazette No: 17506, published in English by Ankara Üniversitesi Basimevi (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet academic freedom became too dependent on [[Council of Higher Education (Turkey)|The Council of Higher Education (YÖK)]] as the reform moved towards creating a more centralized system around the YÖK in matters regarding budgetary control, staff employment and student selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law defines the name, number and discipline of each faculty or vocational school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While universities can establish departments, their approval is subject to the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Egypt==
===History===
Egypt is one of the countries where [[academic freedom]] is not a right freely enjoyed. Since the start of the 1990s, academics in Egypt have faced several forms of repression and endured many violations such as judicial convictions, public condemnation, and physical violence from both private individuals and groups, mainly the Islamists, and government officials.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there are Egyptian state authorities using [[Egyptian National Police|police]], political appointees, and regulations and laws to control university life. On the other hand, Islamist militants are resorting to physical violence and public attacks to have a say in the content of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
All aspects of university life including the classroom, student activities, research, campus demonstrations were affected by government and private repression. The professors and students find themselves censored and enable to cross the “red lines” of politics, religion, and sex.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"/&gt;
Faculty appointments and promotions are controlled by the state. Student activities are limited once outside the classroom, and campus protests are often violently responded to. All these factors contribute to the deterioration of the academic freedom situation in Egypt and to the general decline of the educational environment.

====Sisi's era====
While Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|2014 Egyptian constitution]], issued under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]’s rule, ensures that “the state guarantees the independence of universities, scientific and linguistic academies” and that “it commits to providing university education in accordance with global quality criteria, and to developing free university education in state universities and institutes as per the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian state still violates its constitutional provisions through various repressive ways in an attempt to curb academic freedom. Article 23 of the constitution claims that “the state grants the freedom of scientific research and encourages its institutions.”{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, freedom of scientific research has often been interfered with and even hindered on various occasions by state authorities. [[Egyptian universities|Universities]] under Sisi’s rule have been described as “experiencing the lowest levels of academic freedom the country has ever known."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crane Linn, Emily. “Egypt’s Besieged Universities: The Country’s Scholars had better teach from President Sisi’s Textbook- or else.” Foreign Policy. 31 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many observers maintained that the violations against Egyptian academics under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|El-Sisi]]’s rule exceed those witnessed during [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] time. In academic year 2014, 761 student arrests and 281 student expulsions took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Moreover, the state sentenced to death a university professor for writing critical articles about the regime and accused him of “conspiring to undermine Egypt’s national security”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and arrested many others who dared to criticize the regime.
The state also monitors what ideas come in and not just the research that comes out. Several universities are canceling their study abroad programs or breaking off their cooperations with foreign universities. For example, Cairo’s [[Ain Shams University]] canceled its study abroad program to Turkey and [[Damanhour University]] stopped its cooperation with foreign institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, El-Sisi issued a decree banning any academic travel outside Egypt that does not have a prior [[State Security Investigations Service|State Security]] authorization. This way, the state would be able to control which conferences can be attended and what sources can be used. Even though this decree and many other violations are, according to the articles mentioned above, unconstitutional, they are still enforced.

===Violations===
There are various cases of academic freedom violations in Egypt. The following are just few of them. Professor Kholoud Saber had her scholarship abroad terminated by [[Cairo University]]. She was doing a doctoral research on a scholarship at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, that started on October 2015, when she was ordered to return to Egypt following a recommendation of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Egypt)|Ministry of Higher education]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Press Release: “Cairo’s University Decision Demonstrates the Erosion of University Independence and its Reliance on Dictates of Ministry of Higher Education, which acts as a Cover for Security Intervention in Universities.” 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Ohier, a French Master’s student, was arrested and later deported from Egypt. She was working on the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group banned by the government as it was accused of state defamation and espionage.&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She was not given any reason for her arrest by the Egyptian officials but she, reportedly, overheard police officers claiming “she had improper friends.”&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"/&gt;
On another instance, scholar and journalist Ismail Alexandrani was detained, on November 2015, upon his return Egypt from a workshop in Germany. The Egyptian embassy in Berlin had apparently advised the scholar, who happens to be “a vocal critic of human rights violations in Egypt and counterterrorism policy in the Sinai Peninsula,” not to turn up to the workshop titled “Deconstructing Islamist Egypt"&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Alexandrani’s arrival to Egypt, his passport was confiscated and he was questioned for over 19 hours before getting arrested “on charges of ‘joining and supporting a terrorist organization’ and ‘spreading false news liable to disturb public security and harm public interest."&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"/&gt;

===Giulio Regeni case===
One of the most widely covered stories in relation to the situation of academic freedom in Egypt was the case of the Italian PhD candidate [[Giulio Regeni]], a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK. Giulio Regeni was first found dead, in the outskirts of Cairo, a week after he was declared missing on January 25, 2016, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian uprising]], and his body demonstrated clear signs of torture and severe beating.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. "Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project."|date=2016|url=https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free_to_Think_2016.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholarsatrisk.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD candidate was investigating the [[Trade unions in Egypt|Egyptian labor movements]] at the [[American University in Cairo|American University of Cairo]] at the time of his murder. While government officials maintained that Regeni was kidnapped and murdered by a gang, international and Egyptian human rights activists claim that he was actually targeted for his research by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;
The murder of Giulio Regeni remains unsolved. 
The case of the researcher, and the continuing imprisonment of hundreds of scholars and thousands of students and the various restrictions on academic freedom signal that there is an actual “not improvement but, rather, a further tightening of control, and loss of autonomy and freedom in Egyptian higher education, as well as a shrinkiHing{{clarify|date=June 2017}} space for critical inquiry and discourse in Egypt generally."&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;

==Israel==
{{POV|date=March 2017}}

=== History ===
In the 1990s, Israeli academia was characterized by open-mindedness and pluralist vision of debated issues such as revisionist history on [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]] that was finding its way into the academic society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Second Intifada]] and its aftermath, these characteristics gradually vanished also due to the disappearance of [[Israeli Left|Israeli left]] parties, which in fact used to host a great part of Israeli academia and when leftish positions started to change, this influenced the academic environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Palestinian academia&lt;!-- This sub-section needs some attention. There are many statements made here that are not backed up with secondary sources. For this reason this section reads more like an academic paper than a Wikipedia article. Remember that it is necessary to write from as neutral a position as possible - so every statement you must ask yourself "would someone want to contest this claim?" and if yes ask yourself what you can do to back it up as much as possible. If you cannot find secondary sources for some of these ideas/statements than you need to remove them.   There are several instances in this sub-section where a secondary source is necessary to validate the statement - even if it an event, it must be validated with an external source.  --&gt; ===
In what it is considered by many international actors a situation of military occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories|title=Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories|website=Amnesty International USA|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/un-report-on-palestine-military-occupation-apartheid-torture-israeli-violations-are-deliberate-organised-and-institutionalised/5372212|title=UN Report on Palestine: Military Occupation, Apartheid, Torture – Israeli Violations are "Deliberate, Organised, and Institutionalised"|last=Falk|first=Richard|date=2014-03-07|website=Global Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its consequent policies of [[collective punishment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/palestinians-israel-collective-punishment-160929083644838.html|title='Bad Palestinians' under Israel's collective punishment|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denial of entrance&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;!-- A statement like this should be backed up with sources in order to demonstrate that it is not an opinion but actually 'fact'. Also it would be helpful if you could add more explanation when you write of 'collective punishments' and 'denial of entrance'. Remember that you are an expert on the topic, however other Wikipedia readers are not so these types of statements need some background information - even if you can provide sources and link it to another page that discusses this more thoroughly. --&gt;, such as checkpoints and the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|wall]] between [[Israel]] and [[West Bank]], in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]] access to education for Palestinians has thus been affected&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Laurie A.|year=2007|title=Middle East Studies and Academic Freedom: Challenges at Home and Abroad|url=|journal=International Studies Perspectives|volume=8|pages=385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again add a source to this claim. --&gt;. In fact, straight after the beginning of the [[first Intifada]], the ability for the students of West Bank Universities to study and carry on theirs studies have been limited, while later on, in 2006, a travel ban to get into Israel was issued for Palestinian students belonging to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ministers-demand-entry-into-israel-for-palestinian-students-1.202733|title=Ministers Demand Entry Into Israel for Palestinian Students|first1=Akiva|last1=Eldar|first2=Yoav|last2=Stern|date=18 October 2006|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedure go along with a series of entry and residence denials for researchers and students, both foreign passport holders and Palestinian-born, which have threatened the ability of carrying on a proper educational and research level in Palestinian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibush.co.il/downloads/Letter_from_University_Presidents.pdf|format=PDF|title=To Members of Global Civil Society and Academia|website=Kibush.co.il|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported various violations perpetrated by Israeli authorities on students, in the academic and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the exit permits. In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ takeover of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that left for their studies remained once again trapped when they returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained exit permits, students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in [[Erez]], with the justification of “security concerns”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/11/19/gaza-israel-blocks-670-students-studies-abroad|title=Gaza: Israel Blocks 670 Students from Studies Abroad|date=2007-11-19|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/02/us-challenge-israels-restrictions-gaza-students|title=US: Challenge Israel’s Restrictions on Gaza Students|date=2008-06-02|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the organization again stated how discrimination by Israeli authorities prevented many Palestinian students from the [[Gaza Strip]] to travel abroad or to the West Bank to get a better education&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;!-- where are your sources for this? --&gt;. Regarding the chances to travel abroad, in 2008, grants allocated for the Palestinians chosen to study in the United States were redirected because there was no way those students would be allowed by Israel to leave Gaza. For the inability to get visa, the grants destined to Gaza students were transferred to students in the West Bank. The organization has highlighted the necessity and the right for those students to access higher education abroad, since in the Gaza Strip the opportunity are quite limited. For instance, there is not a wide range of degrees, both undergraduate and master’s, in the four available universities. Moreover, there is a total absence of doctoral degrees, and lecturers and teachers from outside are hardly allowed by the Israeli government to enter and teach in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/01/letter-secretary-state-condoleeza-rice-gazan-students|title=Letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Gazan Students|date=1 June 2008|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=12 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This blockade is said to be a clear violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], because Israel’s obligation to guarantee the rights of the people under occupation, among which freedom of movement and right to education display, is inconsistent or not committed at all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; However, according to international law, Gaza is not occupied since Israel no longer has any military presence in Gaza and Gaza has its own, independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/11/13/why-gaza-is-not-remotely-occupied-i/|title=Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)|first=Eugene|last=Kontorovich|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=18 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of restrictions regarding [[academic freedom]] affects also Israeli scholars, such as [[Ilan Pappé|Ilan Pappe]], an Israeli Jew, who has been forced to resign for the [[University of Haifa]] in 2007 for his academic work and political positions, such as academic boycott of Israel. The scholar started researching on the history of the creation of the state of Israel and elaborated a revisionist historical perspective regarding 1948 war. He received along with his family death threats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma’an News]], in February 2014, he was asked about academic freedom in Israel and especially regarding his personal experience. This is what he stated:

“Freedom of academic expression in Israel is a bit like the idea of a Israel being a Jewish democracy. You take a universal concept -- everyone has the right to their opinion and everyone has the right to be part of a democracy -- only with one condition: that the universality does not include critique on Zionism and that the democracy would always ensure Jewish majority whatever the demographic and geographical realities are.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=664867|title=Interview: Ilan Pappe on academic freedom in Israel and BDS|website=Maan News Agency|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
=== History ===
During the years that followed the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian revolution]], hundreds of academicians and students were killed as a consequence of a highly violent campaign that aimed to repress academic freedom, silence dissent, and enforce uniformity of thought.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. “Iran’s Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''The Hill''. November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedoms of speech, association, and peaceful assembly of thousands of students and faculty members were breached through various methods of brutality, torture and detention. The reasons behind the arrests and torture ranged from “participating in illegal gatherings”, “propaganda against the system”, to “insulting the supreme leader or government officials.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other tens of thousands of students and faculty members were forced out of their education and careers and into exile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These assaults on academic freedom continued all throughout the 1980s and became a salient feature of the newly established republic. Paradoxically, it was in universities where the initial revolutionary ‘texts’, aimed to oust the Shah, were produced and circulated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, universities came to represent the de facto ‘spaces’ where open-ended critical discourse was taking place. Nevertheless, they became the primary target of attack after the fall of the monarchy and the rise of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Contemporary Era ====
A merciless{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} campaign of repression has been waged by the Iranian authorities against [[academic freedom]] during the last three decades. Academics and students were routinely detained, harassed and expelled from universities because of their beliefs, political affiliations and peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Amnesty International. “Persecution in Universities as Iran ‘squeezes the life out of’ academic freedom.” ''Amnesty.org.'' June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coercion and repressive methods was stepped up after the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The latter attempted to ‘Islamize’ the educational curriculum through purging it from secular and ‘Western’ influences. Furthermore, a large number of students and academics were barred from universities, following a policy of “starring” that punished those who do not conform to the state's political and social views. The government of President Ahmadinejad also introduced a quota system to limit the number of women in universities and measures to prevent them from enrolling in a list of courses considered more appropriate for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A firm iron grip was retained over academic institutions by the Iranian authorities to the degree of allowing intelligence bodies and state security to supervise disciplinary proceedings in universities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The next president who assumed office in 2013, [[Hassan Rouhani]]—considered by many as a ‘reformist’-, made some steps to permit the return of several banned academics and students to campuses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Nonetheless, the situation of academic freedom remained critical with hundreds of students still imprisoned and others newly arrested since the election of President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]]. By the end of the academic year under the administration of the latter, various restrictions breaching academic freedom and introduced during the time of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] remained in place.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Violations ===
Several international instruments, to which Iran is party and accepted, such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]), and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly guarantee the right to education to all people without discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Iran: Government Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''Human Rights Watch''. May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the rights of individuals to freedoms of association, expression, opinion, and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion, are further protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ([[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, students and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements of their rights based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security network.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Student activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted on a regular basis due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 election]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The case of Professor [[Homa Hoodfar]] ===
A Canadian-Iranian professor of anthropology from [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, [[Homa Hoodfar]], was detained in Iran on the 6th of June, 2016.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bothwell, Ellie. “Professor Imprisoned in Iran: Academic Freedom ‘Not a Western import’.” ''Times Higher Education News''. December 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interrogated for three months before being locked in a small cell in [[Evin Prison]] by the Iranian intelligence service.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Evin Prison|Evin prison]] in Iran is referred to as ‘Evin University’ due to the large number of intellectuals detained there.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] spent 112 days in prison for meddling in affairs of “feminism and security matters.” She was released in September 2016 on “humanitarian grounds” after Canada’s cooperation with officials from Oman, Switzerland and Italy to ensure her release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Canada worked with the latter countries because it cut its direct diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] later reported that even though she was not physically abused, the interrogations were severely psychologically distressing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The questioning would last from 9am to 7pm in a basement, where professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] would either be facing a wall or a mirror preventing her from seeing her interrogators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As examples of psychological abuse, the professor revealed that one day, during questioning, Iranian officials played a song from her husband’s funeral that took place two years before, after they had found a clip of it on her iPad. In another instance, they displayed a picture of “her mother standing at her father’s graveside.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Image:De Groot academic genealogy.svg|thumb|240px|An example of an academic genealogy, the supervisorial relationship between Dutch [[topology|topologist]] [[Johannes De Groot]] and his namesake, also a Dutch topologist descended from the senior De Groot via four different paths of academic supervision]]
An '''academic''', or '''scientific, [[genealogy]]''', organizes a [[family tree]] of scientists and scholars according to [[mentorship|mentoring]] relationships, often in the form of [[doctoral advisor|dissertation supervision]] relationships.

==Overview==
The '''academic lineage''' or '''academic ancestry''' of someone is a chain of professors who have served as academic mentors or [[academic advisor|thesis advisor]]s of each other, ending with the person in question. Many [[genealogy|genealogical]] terms are often recast in terms of academic lineages, so one may speak of '''academic descendants''', '''children''',  '''siblings''', etc.

However, not all links recorded in such databases are formal advisor-advisee relationships; for instance, the [[University of Cambridge]] did not require a formal doctoral thesis until 1919, and academic genealogies that include earlier Cambridge students tend to substitute an equivalent mentor.

Academic genealogies are particularly easy to research in the case of [[Spain]]'s [[PhD|Doctor degrees]], because until 1954 only [[Complutense University]] had the power to grant [[Doctorate]]s. This means that all holders of a [[Doctorate|Doctor degree]] in Spain can trace back their [[academic lineage]] to a [[Doctoral supervisor]] who was a member of Complutense's Faculty.

Academic genealogy may influence research results in areas of active research.  Hirshman et al. examined a controversial medical question, the value of maximal surgery for high grade [[glioma]], and demonstrated that a physician's medical academic genealogy can affect his or her findings and approaches to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''AgroParisTech''' (officially [[French language|French]] ''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l'environnement'', or ''Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences'')&lt;ref&gt;English naming according to [http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf English brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209013409/http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a French university-level institution, also known as a "[[Grande Ecole]]". It was founded on January 1, 2007, by the merger of three life sciences [[grandes écoles]].

Leader in life sciences and agronomy, AgroParisTech is one of the foremost and most prestigious Grandes Ecoles. AgroParisTech is one of the founding members of the [[Université Paris-Saclay]], which will be the largest European multidisciplinary campus. AgroParisTech will consequently be moving to the [[Paris-Saclay]] [[business cluster| business]] and [[research-intensive cluster| research-intensive]] cluster in 2018.

AgroParisTech is a member of the [[UniverSud Paris]] and the [[Paris Institute of Technology]] (or Paris Tech). The latter is a consortium of ten graduate institutes of science and engineering. AgroParisTech is also part of 'The Life and Environmental Science and Technology Hub' of the [[Paris]] region, together with [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[Cemagref]], [[AFSSA]], the [[Ecole nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort]], and the [[Versailles National School of Landscape architecture]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}


== History==
AgroParisTech is the merger of three graduate institutes of science and engineering located around [[Paris]]:
* ''[[Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon|Institut national agronomique Paris-Grignon]]'' (INA P-G), founded in 1826
* [[French National School of Forestry|''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'']] (ENGREF), founded in 1964
* ''[[École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Agricoles et Alimentaires|École nationale supérieure des industries agricoles et alimentaires]]'' (ENSIA), founded in 1893.

The public higher education system in France includes universities and other institutions called the “[[Grandes Ecoles]]”. The “Grandes Ecoles” are the best rated pathways for higher education in Engineering and Management. The vast majority of the chief executives in major French companies and of top managers in the French Administration are graduates from the “Grandes Ecoles”. The features are:
* A very selective admission process through which students are either admitted by a nationwide entrance exam (notably after two or three years of “[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|prépas]]”) or by the virtue of excellent academic records;
* 5 years (Master’s degrees) to 8 years (PhD and post-Master’s degrees) of higher education;
* The degree course at the “Grandes Ecoles” includes compulsory internships in laboratories and companies, in France or abroad
* The prestige of the “Grandes Ecoles” and  contacts with major enterprises provide an easy access to the job market.

==Organization==
AgroParisTech is organized into five departments:
* Agronomy, Forestry, Water and Environmental Science and Technology,
* Life Science and Health,
* Science and Engineering for Food and Bioproducts,
* Social science, Economics and Management,
* Modeling: Mathematics, Informatics and Physics

==Academic programs==
AgroParisTech offers different Masters:
* 3 different Masters of Engineering (MEng):
** [[Agronomy]]
** Food Science and Engineering
** Forestry
* 2 Masters of Science (MSc)
* 1 Master's program with 5 domains that cover most fields of Life Science and Technology
* one of 7 partner universities in the Master of Science in European Forestry program

It also offers:
* a wide range of Ph.D. programs.
* 1 Post-Master's degree for Management and Administration in environmental sciences and policies, proposed by [[ENGREF]], a post-graduate institute of [[AgroParisTech]].
* 9 Post-master professional certificates (one-year post graduate training)

==Research programmes==
AgroParisTech has:
* 39 research laboratories,
* 300 researchers

In education, '''authentic learning''' is an instructional approach that allows students to explore, discuss, and meaningfully construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world problems and projects that are relevant to the learner.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, S., Bransford, J., &amp; Pellegrino. (1999). ''How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice.'' Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a "wide variety of educational and instructional techniques focused on connecting what students are taught in school to real-world issues, problems, and applications. The basic idea is that students are more likely to be interested in what they are learning, more motivated to learn new concepts and skills, and better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood if what they are learning mirrors real-life contexts, equips them with practical and useful skills, and addresses topics that are relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school."&lt;ref&gt;Authentic Learning. (n.d.) The Glossary of Education Reform. Retrieved from http://edglossary.org/authentic-learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic instruction will take on a much different form than traditional teaching methods. In the traditional classroom, students take a passive role in the learning process. Knowledge is considered to be a collection of facts and procedures that are transmitted from the teacher to the student. In this view, the goal of education is to possess a large collection of these facts and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, K. (2006). ''The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic learning, on the other hand, takes a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach, in which learning is an active process. Teachers provide opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking, and reflections in real-world contexts. This knowledge construction is heavily influenced by the student's prior knowledge and experiences, as well as by the characteristics that shape the learning environment, such as values, expectations, rewards, and sanctions. Education is more student-centered. Students no longer simply memorize facts in abstract and artificial situations, but they experience and apply information in ways that are grounded in reality.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;Newmann, F., Marks, H., &amp; Gamoran, A. (1995). Authentic pedagogy: Standards that boost student performance. ''Issues in Restructuring Schools,'' 8, 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

There is no definitive description of authentic learning. Educators must develop their own interpretations of what creates meaning for the students in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Maina, F. (2004). Authentic learning: Perspectives from contemporary educators. ''Journal of Authentic Learning.'' Retrieved from https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/389/maina.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the literature suggests that there are several characteristics of authentic learning. It is important to note that authentic learning tasks do not have to have all the characteristics. They can be thought of as being on a spectrum, with tasks being more or less authentic. The characteristics of authentic learning include the following:
*Authentic learning is centered on authentic, relevant, real-world tasks that are of interest to the learners.
*Students are actively engaged in [[exploration]] and [[inquiry]]. 
*Learning, most often, is [[interdisciplinary]]. It requires integration of content from several disciplines and leads to outcomes beyond the domain-specific [[learning outcomes]].
*Learning is closely connected to the world beyond the walls of the classroom. 
*Students become engaged in complex tasks and [[higher-order thinking]] skills, such as analyzing, synthesizing, designing, manipulating, and evaluating information. 
*Learning begins with a question or problem, which cannot be constricting in that it allows the student to construct their own response and inquiry. The outcome of the learning experience cannot be predetermined.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Phyllis C.|last2=Soloway|first2=Elliot|last3=Marx|first3=Ronald W.|last4=Krajcik|first4=Joseph S.|last5=Guzdial|first5=Mark|last6=Palincsar|first6=Annemarie|title=Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning|journal=Educational Psychologist|date=1991|volume=26|issue=3&amp;4|pages=369–398|doi=10.1080/00461520.1991.9653139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Students produce a product that can be shared with an audience outside the classroom. These products have value in their own right, rather than simply for earning a grade. 
* The resulting products are concrete allowing them to be shared and critiqued; this feedback allows the learner to be reflective and deepen their learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Learning is student driven, with tutors, peers, teachers, parents, and outside experts all assisting and coaching in the learning process. 
*Learners employ [[instructional scaffolding]] techniques at critical times.
*Students have opportunities for social [[discourse]], [[collaboration]], and [[Human self-reflection|reflection]]. 
*Ample resources are available. 
*[[Educational assessment|Assessment]] of authentic learning is integrated seamlessly within the learning task in order to reflect similar, real world assessments. This is known as [[authentic assessment]] and is in contrast to traditional learning assessments in which an exam is given after the knowledge or skills have hopefully been acquired.

== Five standards ==

While there has been much attention given to educational standards for [[curriculum]] and [[Educational assessment|assessment]], "the standards for instruction tend to focus on procedural and technical aspects, with little attention to more fundamental standards of quality."&lt;ref name="Wehlage"&gt;Newmann, F. &amp; Wehlage, G. (1993). Five standards of authentic instruction. ''Educational Leadership,'' 50 (7), 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is not simply to adopt innovative teaching techniques but to give students the opportunity to use their minds well and to provide students with instruction that has meaning or value outside of achieving success in school. 

In order to address this challenge, a framework consisting of five standards of authentic instruction has been developed by Wisconsin's Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools. This framework can be a valuable tool for both researchers and teachers. It provides "a set of standards through which to view assignments, instructional activities, and the dialogue between teacher and students and students with one another."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt; 

Teachers can use the framework to generate questions, clarify goals, and critique their teaching. Each standard can be assessed on a scale of one to five rather than a categorical yes or no variable. "The five standards are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt;
*'''Higher-Order Thinking:''' This scale measures the degree to which students use higher-order thinking skills. Higher-order thinking requires students to move beyond simple recall of facts to the more complex task of manipulating information and ideas in ways that transform their meaning and implications, such as when students synthesize, generalize, explain, hypothesize, or arrive at some conclusion or interpretation.
*'''Depth of Knowledge:''' This scale assesses students' depth of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge is considered deep when students are able to "make clear distinctions, develop arguments, solve problems, construct explanations, and otherwise work with relatively complex understandings."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt; Rather than emphasizing large quantities of fragmented information, instruction covers fewer topics in systematic and connected ways which leads to deeper understanding. 
*'''Connectedness to the World:''' This scale measures the extent to which the instruction has value and meaning beyond the instructional context. Instruction can exhibit connectedness when students address real-world public problems or when they use personal experiences as a context for applying knowledge. 
*'''Substantive Conversation:''' This scale assesses the extent of communication to learn and understand the substance of a subject. High levels of substantive conversation are indicated by three features: considerable interaction about the subject matter which includes evidence of higher-order thinking, sharing of ideas that are not scripted or controlled, and dialogue that builds on participants' ideas to promote improved collective understanding of a theme or topic. 
*'''Social Support for Student Achievement:''' The social support scale measures the culture of the learning community. Social support is high in classes where there are high expectations for all students, a climate of mutual respect, and inclusion of all students in the learning process. Contributions from all students are welcomed and valued.&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt;

== Examples ==

There are several authentic learning practices in which students may participate. These are a few examples:
*'''Simulation-Based Learning:''' Students engage in [[simulations]] and [[role-playing]] in order to be put in situations where the student has to actively participate in the decision making of a project. This helps in "developing valuable communication, collaboration, and leadership skills that would help the student succeed as a professional in the field he/she is studying."&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, L. (2007). Authentic Learning Environments. Retrieved April 9, 2014 from http://etec.ctlt.ubc.ca/510wiki/Authentic_Learning_Environments.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning through simulation and role-playing has been used to train flight attendants, fire fighters, and medical personnel to name a few.  
*'''Student-Created Media:''' Student-created media focuses on using various technologies to "create videos, design websites, produce animations, virtual reconstructions, and create photographs."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; In addition to gaining valuable experience in working with a range of technologies, "students have also improved their reading comprehension, writing skills, and their abilities to plan, analyze, and interpret results as they progress through the media project."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;
*'''Inquiry-Based Learning:''' [[Inquiry-based learning]] starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios rather than simply presenting material to students. Students identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning is generally used in field-work, case studies, investigations, individual and group projects, and research projects. 
*'''Peer-Based Evaluation:''' In peer based evaluation students are given the opportunity to analyze, critique, and provide constructive feedback on the assignments of their peers. Through this process, they are exposed to different perspectives on the topic being studied, giving them a deeper understanding. 
*'''Working with Remote Instruments:''' Specialized software can provide students with opportunities they might not have otherwise. For example, "various software packages produce similar results that students working in a fully equipped lab might receive. By interpreting the software based results students are able to apply theory to practice as they interpret the data that would otherwise not be available to them."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; 
*'''Working with Research Data:''' Students collect their own data or use data collected from researchers to conduct their own investigations.
*'''Reflecting and Documenting Achievements:''' The importance of [[metacognition]] in the learning process is well-documented. Giving students the opportunity to reflect upon and monitor their learning is essential. [[Diary|Journals]], [[Artist's portfolio|portfolio]]s, and [[electronic portfolio]]s are examples of authentic learning tasks designed to showcase the student's work as well as give the student a means to reflect back on his/her learning over time.&lt;ref name="Lombardi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;
*'''Project-Based Learning:''' Begins with a problem or question that is the starting point for inquiry and which all products are created as a result of. Results in a single or series of products or artifacts that are created as a result or solution to the inquiry.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;

== Benefits ==

Educational research shows that authentic learning is an effective learning approach{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} to preparing students for work in the 21st century. By situating knowledge within relevant contexts, learning is enhanced in all four domains of learning: [[cognitive]] (knowledge), [[affective]] (attitudes), [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] (skills), and [[psychosocial]] (social skills). Some of the benefits of authentic learning include the following:
*Students are more motivated and more likely to be interested in what they are learning when it is relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school. 
*Students are better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood. 
*Students learn to [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilate]] and connect knowledge that is unfamiliar.
*Students are exposed to different settings, activities, and perspectives. 
*[[Knowledge transfer|Transfer]] and application of theoretical knowledge to the world outside of the classroom is enhanced. 
*Students have opportunities to collaborate, produce products, and to practice [[problem solving]] and professional skills.
*Students have opportunities to exercise professional judgments in a safe environment. 
*Students practice higher-order thinking skills.
*Students develop patience to follow longer arguments. 
*Students develop flexibility to work across disciplinary and cultural boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Benefits of Authentic Learning. (n.d.) Curtin University. Retrieved March 5, 2014 from https://otl.curtin.edu.au/teaching_learning_practice/student_centred/authentic.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic''''' (No. 57325/00) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning discrimination of [[Romani people|Romani]] children in the [[education in the Czech Republic|education system]] of the [[Czech Republic]].

==Facts and proceedings==

Most children from the Roma minority in [[Ostrava]] attended special schools with simplified curriculum, forming majority of their students.

The applicants — 18 Romani students, former and then-attendants of special schools, represented by the [[European Roma Rights Centre]] — submitted an application to ECtHR in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errc.org/db/02/D9/m000002D9.pdf Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court has declared in 2005 the application admissible in part on Article 14 (prohibition of [[discrimination]]), combined with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 ([[right to education]]) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The application in part concerning Articles 3 and 6 was declared inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errc.org/db/02/DC/m000002DC.pdf Admissibility decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chamber judgment==

In 2006, the Second Section of the Court has found no violation in the case, by six votes to one. Judge [[Jean-Paul Costa|Costa]] filed a concurring opinion, agreeing with the majority while saying that "I came to that conclusion only after some hesitation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/469e020e2.pdf Concurring opinion of Judge Costa, Para. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Cabral Barreto filed a dissenting opinion, finding a violation of Article 14, taken together with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1.

The applicants appealed to the Grand Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errc.org/db/02/D3/m000002D3.pdf Request for referral to the Grand Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand Chamber judgment==

In 2007, the Grand Chamber has found in the case a violation of Article 14, taken together with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, by 13 votes to 4. Judges [[Boštjan Zupančič|Zupančič]], Jungwiert, Borrego Borrego and Šikuta have filed dissenting opinions, finding no violation.

The '''Digital Curation Centre''' ('''DCC''') was established to help solve the extensive challenges of [[digital preservation]] and [[digital curation]] and to lead research, development, advice, and support services for higher education institutions in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rusbridge | first1 = C. | last2 = Buneman | first2 = P. | authorlink2 = Peter Buneman| last3 = Burnhill | first3 = P. | last4 = Giaretta | first4 = D. | last5 = Ross | first5 = S. | last6 = Lyon | first6 = L. | last7 = Atkinson | first7 = M. | authorlink7 = Malcolm Atkinson| chapter = The Digital Curation Centre: A Vision for Digital Curation | doi = 10.1109/LGDI.2005.1612461 | title = 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technology | pages = 31 | year = 2005 | url = http://eprints.erpanet.org/82/01/DCC_Vision.pdf| isbn = 0-7803-9228-0 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The original call to establish the DCC described its function as

:"...to provide a national focus for research into curation issues and expertise in the processes of digital archiving, preservation and management. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of users of the Centre's outputs." &lt;ref name="call"&gt;[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2003/09/funding_digcentre.aspx Revised ITT 6/03] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323112242/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2003/09/funding_digcentre.aspx |date=2012-03-23 }} Description of call and links to related documents, from JISC website archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists, researchers and scholars across the UK generate increasingly vast amounts of digital data, with further investment in digitization and purchase of digital content and information. The scientific record and the documentary [[cultural heritage|heritage]] created in digital form are at risk from [[Digital obsolescence|obsolescence]], from the fragility of [[digital media]], and from lack of the basics of good practice, such as adequate documentation for the data.

== Activities ==
Working with other practitioners, the DCC supports UK institutions who store, manage and preserve these data to help ensure their enhancement and their continuing long-term use. The DCC also provides a national focus for research and development into [[digital curation]] issues and to promote expertise and good practice, both national and international, for the management of all research outputs in digital format.

It provides information about tools developed by the DCC and others which support all parts of the digital curation lifecycle. It provides training in the use of tools and other aspects of digital curation. It provides online tools, such as the Data Management Planning tool, to support the creation and management of research data.

The DCC runs a number of regular events to support different aspects of its mission. The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) acts as a focus for research activity in digital curation as well as reports of practice. The Research Data Management Forum brings together practitioners from a wide range of backgrounds including government, publishers, researchers and funders, to focus on particular topics of common interest. The Data Management Roadshows aim to raise awareness amongst UK universities of the assistance that the DCC can offer with establishing or improving research data services.

== History ==
[[Jisc]] took a decision to establish the Digital Curation Centre some time in 2002, having funded a number of projects in the field of digital preservation. JISC's then digital preservation focus, Neil Beagrie, recognised that a number of the more compelling challenges required more than simple preservation of materials. The term [[digital curation]] was coined to refer to more active long-term management of digital material. The original call for bids to run the center was withdrawn in July 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2003/07/dcc.aspx Announcement of postponement of call JISC 6/03] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702123144/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2003/07/dcc.aspx |date=2011-07-02 }} from JISC website archive&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the UK's e-science programme to add funding for a 4-year research programme to complement the work on education and advocacy funded by JISC. The revised call &lt;ref name="call" /&gt; from July 2003 required bids by 2003-09-18 with an intention to establish the DCC early in 2004. The range of expertise required meant that the funders expected to see collaborative, multi-centre bids.&lt;ref name="call" /&gt; A number were shortlisted with the winning bid chosen on 2003-11-26. Led by the [[University of Edinburgh]] (involving its School of Informatics, the [[National e-Science Centre]] (NeSC), the [[EDINA]] national data centre and the AHRC Centre for the Studies in Intellectual Property and Technology Law) the winning consortium also included [[HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], [[UKOLN]] at the [[University of Bath]], and the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC).

The DCC began operations early in 2004, with a formal launch on 5 November of that year at Edinburgh's e-science institute. Although it was intended that the centre would be inaugurated by the Duke of Edinburgh, then the university's Chancellor, he instead had to attend the funeral of Princess Alice and his place was taken by Lord Sutherland of Houndwood.&lt;ref&gt;Email from Gill Maddy of NeSC to delegates, 2003-11-03T1104&lt;/ref&gt; The first Acting Director was Peter Burnhill, head of EDINA. He was succeeded by Chris Rusbridge from 2005-02-21 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DIGITAL-PRESERVATION;9018b86c.04 Announcement of Chris Rusbridge's appointment] Archives of JISCMAIL digital-preservation list&lt;/ref&gt; who served until 2010-04-19, when he was succeeded by Kevin Ashley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2010/03/dcc.aspx Appointment of Kevin Ashley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429120754/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2010/03/dcc.aspx |date=2011-04-29 }} JISC press release&lt;/ref&gt; The original Associate Directors were David Giaretta [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]], Liz Lyon [[University of Bath]], and [[Seamus Ross]] [[HATII]].

Following the initial 3-year grant, JISC has funded 2 further phases of work at the DCC commencing in 2007 and 2010. The latter continues until March 2013. Research funding from the e-science core program did not continue after the core program itself was wound up. The DCC has continued research and development activities funded by a wide range of grants from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment]] DRAMBORA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCARP"&gt;[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/scarp SCARP project page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602063858/http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/scarp |date=2011-06-02 }} From DCC website, 2011-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the DCC received additional funding from HEFCE's Universities Modernisation Fund (UMF) to implement salient recommendations from the UK Research Data Service report of 2010.

The '''Dutch Museum Association''' (Dutch: ''De Museumvereniging'') is an association of museums in the [[Netherlands]]. Over five hundred museums are affiliated with the association.

==History==
In 1926, the Museumvereniging was established as a meeting of museum directors in the Netherlands. In 2003, the [[Museumkaart]] foundation was integrated into the Dutch Museum Association organisation. In 2006, the Museumvereniging became an umbrella organisation for the Dutch museums organised into ten subject-specific areas. The [[Association of National Museums]], for example, is included within the Museumvereniging umbrella. [[Irene Asscher-Vonk]] is the first president of the Museumvereniging.

==Activities==
De Museumvereniging focuses on advocacy and professional development of its members and promotes museum visits. It facilitates the [[Stichting Museumregister Nederland]] (English: the Dutch Museum Register), which facilitates recognition of the status of these museums. The Dutch Museum Association also facilitates the Ethical Code Commission for Museums. 
Additionally, the Dutch Museum Association is responsible for the Foundation of the [[Museumkaart]]. Approximately 400 of the 500 Dutch Museum Association members are participants in the [[Museumkaart]] Foundation, meaning that they accept the [[Museumkaart]].  The Dutch Museum Association also organises the Dutch [[Museumweekend]].

==Members==

Many of the museums in [[Amsterdam]] are members of the Dutch Museum Association as well as the [[Official Museums of Amsterdam]]. Additionally, many of these museums are involved in the [[Museumkaart]] initiative of the Dutch Museum Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''Florence Hawley''' (September 17, 1906 – 1991) was one of the first [[anthropologist]]s to work extensively on [[dendrochronology]], or tree-ring dating. She conducted [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern [[North America]] in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of [[archaeological site]]s. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging them to think for themselves and work hard for what they wanted to achieve. Although faced with many challenges in her career, and discriminated against for being a woman, she persevered in her research and became a great influence both for her students and for other women in her field.&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The University of New Mexico |title=Florence Hawley Ellis Archives: Biographical Sketch |url=http://www.unm.edu/~toh/fhe/bio.html|date= May 14, 2010|accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Florence Hawley was born in [[Cananea Sonora]], [[Mexico]] where her father was chief [[chemist]] for a [[copper]] mine. In 1913, after the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]], her family moved to Miami, [[Arizona]]. She was introduced to archaeology at a young age from her father during his [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] of ruins around their home in southern Arizona. In 1936 Florence married archaeologist [[Donovan Senter]]; together they had a daughter named Andrea. In 1950, after a divorce from Senter, she married Bruce Ellis who was a historian. Their marriage lasted until the time of his death in 1985.&lt;ref name="parezo"&gt;Parezo, Nancy J., ed. Hidden Scholars: Women Anthropologist and the Native American Southwest. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1993. (211-213).&lt;/ref&gt; She began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1929, where she was introduced to dendrochronology in a class taught by [[A. E. Douglass]]. She began teaching at the University of New Mexico fall of 1934 until she retired in 1971.&lt;ref name="parezo"/&gt; It is possible that more professional anthropologists in the United States were taught by Hawley than by any other member of the profession.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Even after her retirement she remained active in field research up until her death in 1991. She continued to write and excavate. She was passionate about her work and even after a broken hip returned to the field during her recuperation to supervise. She broke new ground in her research by developing and applying innovative techniques of [[chemical analysis]], dendrochronology, [[ethnohistory]], and [[Ethnoarchaeology]].&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt;

==Education==

Hawley graduated with a B.A. from the [[University of Arizona]] in 1927 with a major in English and a minor in [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Daughters of the Desert: Women Anthropologists and the Native American Southwest, 1880-1980|last = Babcock|first = Barbara A.|publisher = University of New Mexico Press|year = 1988|isbn = 0826310877|location = |pages = 125|last2 = Parezo|first2 = Nancy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She received her M.A. in anthropology the next year. She completed her Ph.D. in anthropology at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after teaching at the University of Arizona. She used her excavations from [[Chetro Ketl]] for her dissertation, which was on the dated prehistory of Chetro Ketl. She applied the new techniques of dendrochronology and stratigraphic dating of the archaeological deposits to more fully understand the history and evolution of Chetro Ketl.&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt;

==Employment history==

Hawley began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the [[Great Depression]], and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year's leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job teaching at the [[University of New Mexico]] in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own.&lt;ref name="parezo"/&gt; She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to be teaching more courses than anyone else in the anthropology department. Hawley always brought new theoretical approaches as well as her own ideas into focus while teaching. Her students knew they were expected to organize and comprehend data, in addition to become familiar with the bibliographical material.&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt; She continued to work and to teach students in the field after her retirement.

==Honors==

Hawley strove for equality for men and women in not only [[economy|economic]] but also professional recognition. She contributed to this through participating in the "Women's Movement". Because of her superiority in her research as well as teaching, and her persistence to the idea of equality, she was honored at the "Daughters of the Desert" symposium as a leader among the women anthropologist who have worked in the Southwest. Hawley served as President of the [[American Society for Ethnohistory]] in 1969 and in 1987 she was honored as one of 45 distinguished women featured in a traveling [[Smithsonian]] exhibit named "Daughters of the Desert". The University of New Mexico acknowledged her accomplishments by granting her an honorary Doctorate of Letters in 1988. The Ghost Ranch of Abiquiu, where she conducted her work in the 1980s, housed her extensive library in a large museum complex that bears her name.&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt;

==Research==

Florence Hawley applied the training she received from A. E. Douglass's dendrochronology class to tree ring analysis in the [[Chaco Canyon]] [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s where she worked with the University of [[New Mexico]] field program in the summers of 1929, 1930, and 1931. She conducted [[ceramic]] analyses with materials from [[Chetro Ketl]] and other sites in the area, and her ceramic chronologies were independently confirmed by tree ring dates.&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;Nash, Stephen Edward. Time, Trees, and Prehistory: Tree Ring Dating and the Development of North American Archaeology 1914-1950. Utah Press: 1999 (213-243)&lt;/ref&gt; From the Late 1950s through the 1960s she directed a summer archaeological field schools through the University of New Mexico. One of the most prominent discoveries was that of [[San Gabriel de Yunge]], the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, which dated from 1600, found near [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|San Juan Pueblo]].&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt; Her work on dendrochronology helped provides a baseline for southwestern chronologies and her work constituted a technical expertise which is still largely in demand.&lt;ref name="parezo"/&gt; Hawley also conducted dendrochronological research in eastern North America, conducting some of the first such work in the region. She began her tree-ring research in the Midwest around the 1933 - 1934 academic year. She collected tree - ring specimens or inspected samples of archaeological wood from the University of Chicago's excavations in southern [[Illinois]]. In 1937, she continued her Midwestern dendrochronological fieldwork and collected 1000 living-tree [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s in eight different states in an effort to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. In 1941, Hawley published Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage&lt;ref name="nash"/&gt; where she presented the major problems she and her team faced: they were working with new species, they were working across a huge area, there was a shortage in old growth timber because of the extensive tree cutting, and the wood was not preserved well because of the damp mound sediments.&lt;ref name="nash"/&gt;

==Key excavations==

Florence Hawley participated in many field excavations, including her work at the Chetro Ketl site in Chaco Canyon. After her retirement she continued to offer field training to interested students, which was based around the Ghost Ranch of Abiquiu.&lt;ref name="university-new-mexico"/&gt; In 1934 she and her crew worked in western Kentucky and the Wickliffe mounds as well as in the Norris Basin in Tennessee collecting living- tree specimens, charcoal, and modern specimens. She also did work in the Mississippi Valley, as well as many Midwestern states.&lt;ref name="nash"/&gt;

==Theatre==
Gallimaufry was founded in 2004 by Steve Josephson. Since its inception, the company has produced 13 fully staged musicals, 5 plays, 11 dance events, 14 musical concerts and many other special events.

===Scared Money===
In April 2009, Gallimaufry presented the world premiere of a new play called Scared Money. The play was written by Sherwood Kiraly. Sherwood recently wrote the screenplay for the film [[Diminished Capacity]], which starred [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Alan Alda]]. His new play is a comedy about six people searching for hidden Santa Anita Pick Six Racetrack ticket worth $714,000. The title derives from an old saying "Scared money never wins", meaning that you shouldn't gamble money you're afraid to lose.

== Dance ==

===Dance Days===
Dance days consist of free master classes followed by a free performance on Laguna's "Main Beach". Past master classes have ranged from rhythm tap, modern and hip-hop to Afro-Caribbean, Indian and Latin Jazz. Past dance day performances have included the inspirational and explosive [[Lula Washington Dance Theatre]] [http://www.lulawashington.com/], Erin Landry, the "spirited grace" of Backhaus Dance [http://www.bcdcdance.com/bcdc/home.htm], the "b-boying, poppin', lockin'" of [[JabbaWockeeZ]], who became the first winners on the MTV series [[America's Best Dance Crew (season 1)|America's Best Dance Crew]], the "choreographic intricacy and artistry" of Sean Greene, the premiere of Karama Adesco's ALIVE Contemporary Dance Company, San Francisco's "lively and sensuous" Company Chaddick [http://www.companychaddick.org/], the contemporary drumming sounds of TAIKOPROJECT [http://www.taikoproject.com/], the comic genius of Dudley Brooks' comedy dance troupe "Run for Your life" from San Francisco [http://www.runforyourlife.org/], the beguiling the evocative Indian choreography of Ramaa Bharadvaj &amp; The Angahara Ensemble which also included a Tahitian ensemble [http://www.ramaadance.com/].

===Gallimaufry &amp; Greene===
Gallimaufry &amp; Greene is the brainchild of Executive Artistic Director, Steve Josephson. Josephson, the creator of the company’s “Dance Days” and “Songs in the Sand” series, as well as the Executive Director of the inaugural caDance Festival, has built this new company around famed dancer and choreographer, Sean Greene. The new contemporary dance company received its world premiere on April 18, 2007, as part of Gallimaufry's Arts Festival. The company has performed "The Rite to Fall", "Angels" and "A Night at the Movies", which they also took overseas to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] Festival.

===Jump Rhythm Jazz Project===
In April 2008, Gallimaufry presented Jump Rhythm Jazz Project [http://www.jrjp.org/], the [[Emmy Award|Emmy award]] winning dance company from Chicago. The group is made up of rhythmically explosive dancer-singer-actors that celebrate jazz. It was founded in 1990 by Billy Siegenfeld, who continues to choreograph for the company and perform as an ensemble member. He received a 2006-2007 Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Achievement for Individual Excellence On Camera/Performer for his work in the multiple-Emmy-Award-winning documentary Jump Rhythm Jazz Project: Getting There.

===Pericles Redux===
In October 2008, Gallimaufry brought a dance troupe straight from the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] Festival to perform on Main Beach. The troupe is called the 'Not Man Apart' Physical Theatre Ensemble, and the show was called [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]] Redux [http://www.notmanapart.com/PR.php], a reconstruction of Shakespeare's romantic odyssey. The show pushed the boundaries between theatre and dance, and was met with rave reviews, both in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Laguna Beach]].

==Music==

===Ridiculous Medley===
Created in 2006, The Ridiculous Medley is a new vocal performance group that performs for special events, community functions, parties, fundraisers and corporate events. Under the direction of Meredith Woodson-Hubbard, the Ridiculous Medley has already performed for the CHOC Queen of Hearts Guild [http://www.lagunabeach.com/choc/index.html] fundraiser as well as several community events.

===Lagunatunes===
Gallimaufry was affiliated with the Laguna Beach community choir called "Lagunatunes". The choir performs two concerts a year, one during the holiday season and one in early spring. These concerts are performed at the Artists' Theatre.

== Arts Projects ==
Gallimaufry is part of the Laguna Beach Alliance for the Arts.

===The Generation GAP===
The Generation GAP is a self-producing teen theatre company. The group focuses on learning all aspects of theatre, including producing, directing, performing, designing, managing, project managing and fundraising. Teens ages 12–18 plan, raise money, produce, design, cast, direct and perform in shows, and in the process learn all the ins and outs of how to run a theatre company. Generation GAP's most recent production was the musical "Little Women."

===Edinburgh Fringe Festival===
[[Image:Harlem.jpg|right|thumb|The poster for "Harlem Renaissance", which Gallimaufry took overseas to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] Festival]]
In the summer of 2007, Gallimaufry Performing Arts took two shows overseas to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the world's largest art's festival. Both shows performed in the renowned [[C venues]]. The group revived their production of [[Sordid Lives]] and a revamped version of Harlem Renaissance. [[Jonelle Allen]] received rave reviews for her performance as [[Florence Mills]] and the show was chosen as a "Pick of the Fringe" by [[The Gilded Balloon]].
&lt;br /&gt;In 2008, the dance troupe Gallimaufry and Greene performed their show, "A Night at the Movies", at the Fringe.

===Laguna Beach New Play Festival===
In 2008, Gallimaufry joined with the Orange County Playwrights' Alliance [http://www.ocplaywrights.org/] to conduct a playwright competition. They found both full-length and one-act plays that centered around Halloween. Eight plays were chosen and they were performed the first weekend of November at the Forum Theatre.

===Songs in the Sand Series===
Since 2006, Gallimaufry has been presenting concert versions of classic shows on the sands of Main Beach in Laguna. These concerts are free to the public and feature a full orchestra. The first in this series was [[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]], followed by [[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]] and [[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]. The most recent production was a series of songs from [[Fiddler on the Roof]], [[My Fair Lady]] and [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]].

===The Arab, The Jew &amp; The Chicken===
In October 2008, Gallimaufry brought a Middle Eastern sketch comedy quartet to Laguna to perform their show. The show was entitled The Arab, The Jew &amp; The Chicken. It was a hit at the 2008 [[Edinburgh Fringe]] Festival, and their performance in Laguna was their international debut. The show was written and performed by Arab, Israeli, Jewish and Muslim actors and it focused on conflict, identity and everyday life in the Middle East.

The '''German Church School''' (GCS) is a social project of the [[Protestant]] [[German language|German Speaking]] Congregation in the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Addis Ababa]]. Their origins go back to the year 1966.

The school is the first, and up to now only, integrative educational 
program in Ethiopia, in which blind and seeing children are taught jointly.

A few [[relief]] organizations support the project. In the main the school is carried financially through the Protestant German Speaking
Congregation in Ethiopia and private donors in [[Europe]] and the United States.

The instruction at the school is reserved exclusively for Ethiopian 
children of the poorest families from that the slum areas in the 
vicinity of the Church grounds. The staff of the school are completely 
Ethiopian men and women.

In the year 2004, the school was visited by the former [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Federal Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]] and [[Eva Köhler]], the wife of the former [[Germany|German]] [[President of Germany|President]] [[Horst Köhler]], who praised the German Church School and the 
decades of work of the Protestant German Speaking Congregation in 
Ethiopia, which has membership in the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD).

The financing of the work of the school is covered through personal 
[[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ships (donations for support of specific children) and private 
fosterships (donations for specific projects) as well as various 
undesignated donations and subsidies from relief organizations.

'''Hellenic Studies''' (also '''Greek Studies''') is an interdisciplinary scholarly field that focuses on the language, literature, history and politics of post-classical [[Greece]]. In university, a wide range of courses, expose students to a viewpoints that help them understand the historical and political experiences of [[Byzantine Greece|Byzantine]], [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman]] and [[history of modern Greece|modern Greece]]; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; and the era's distinguished literary and artistic traditions.

==History==

"Hellenic" refers to a period in Ancient Greek history between 507 [[BCE]] (the date of the first [[democracy]] in [[Athens]]) and 323 BCE (the death of [[Alexander the Great]]).
This period is also referred to as the age of [[Classical Greece]] and should not be confused with The Hellenistic World, which designates the period between Alexander's death and the [[Roman Empire]]'s conquest of Greece (323/146/31 BCE). The Hellenic World of [[ancient Greece]] consisted of the Greek mainland, [[Crete]], the islands of the [[Greek archipelago]] and the coast of [[Asia Minor]] primarily (though mention is made of cities within the interior of Asia Minor and, of course, the colonies in southern Italy). This is the great Golden Age of Greece and, in the popular imagination, resonates as 'ancient Greece'.

The great law-giver, [[Solon]], having served as [[Archon]] of Athens for 22 years, retired from public life and saw the city, almost immediately, fall under the dictatorship of [[Peisistratus]]. Though a dictator, Peisistratus understood Solon's wisdom, carried on his policies and after his death, his son [[Hippias]] continued this tradition (though maintaining a dictatorship that favored the aristocracy). His younger brother was assassinated (inspired, according to [[Thucydides]], by a love affair gone wrong and not, as later thought, politically motivated) Hippias then became wary of the Athenians, instituted a rule of terror and was finally overthrown by the army under [[Kleomenes I]] of [[Sparta]] and [[Cleisthenes]] of Athens. Cleisthenes reformed the Athenian constitution and established democracy in the city during 507 BCE. He also followed Solon's lead, but instituted new laws that decreased the artistocracy's power, raised the status of the common people and attempted to join the separate tribes of the mountain, the plain and the shore into one, unified people under a new form of government. According to [[Will Durant]], "The Athenians themselves were exhilarated by this adventure into sovereignty...they knew the zest of freedom in action, speech and thought; and from that moment they began to lead all Greece in literature and art, even in statesmanship and war".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This foundation of democracy, of a free state consisting of men who "owned the soil that they tilled and who ruled the state that governed them", stabilized Athens and provided the groundwork for the Golden Age.

The list of thinkers, writers, doctors, artists, scientists, statesmen and warriors of the Hellenic World important contributions to [[western civilization]]: The statesman Solon, poets [[Pindar]] and [[Sappho]], playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], [[Aeschylus]] and [[Aristophanes]], the orator [[Lysias]], historians [[Herodotus]] and Thucydides, philosophers [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Protagoras of Abdera]], [[Empedocles of Acragas]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Xenophanes]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], writer and general [[Xenophon]], physician [[Hippocrates]], sculptor [[Phidias]], statesman [[Pericles]], generals [[Alcibiades]] and [[Themistocles]] and many more lived during this period. The Golden Age, according to the poet [[Shelley]], "is undoubtedly...the most memorable in the history of the world" for the accomplishments and advancements made by the people of that time. Herodotus considered his own age as lacking in many ways and looked back to a more ancient past for a paradigm of a true greatness. The writer [[Hesiod]], an 8th-century BCE contemporary of [[Homer]], claimed precisely the same thing about the age Herodotus admired and called his own age "wicked, depraved and dissolute" and hoped the future would produce a better breed of man for Greece.

Major [[city-states]] and sacred places of pilgrimage in the Hellenic World were [[Argos]], Athens, [[Eleusis]], [[Corinth]], [[Delphi]], [[Ithaca]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Thrace]] and [[Mount Olympus]], the home of the gods. The gods played an important part in the lives of the people; so much so that one could face execution for questioning - or even allegedly questioning - their existence, as in the case of Protagoras, Socrates and Alcibiades (the Athenian statesman [[Critias]], sometimes referred to as `the first atheist', only escaped condemnation because he was so powerful). Great works of art and beautiful temples were created for the worship and praise of the various gods and goddesses of the Greeks such as the [[Parthenon of Athens]], dedicated to the goddess [[Athena Parthenos]] (Athena the Virgin) and the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] (listed as an Ancient Wonder) at Olympia (both works to which Phidias contributed). The [[temple of Demeter]] at Eleusis was the site of the famous [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and is considered the most important rite in ancient Greece. In his works, ''The Iliad'' and ''The Odyssey'', immensely popular and influential in the Hellenic World, Homer depicted the gods and goddesses as intimately involved in the lives of the people. The deities were regularly consulted in domestic matters as well as affairs of state. The [[Oracle at Delphi]] was considered so important at the time that people from all over the known world came to Greece to ask advice or favors from the god. It was considered vital to consult with the supernatural forces before embarking on any military campaign.

Among the famous battles of the Hellenic World were the [[Battle of Marathon]] (490 BCE), the [[Battle of Thermopylae|Battles of Thermopylae]] and [[Battles of Salamis|Salamis]] (480 BCE), [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] (479 BCE,) and the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BCE) where the forces of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] [[Philip II of Macedon|King Philip II]] commanded, in part, by his son Alexander, defeated the Greek forces and unified the Greek city-states. After Philip's death, Alexander conquered the world of his day, becoming Alexander the Great. His campaigns brought Greek culture, language and civilization to the world and, after his death, left the legacy that came to be known as the Hellenistic World.

The '''Integrated and Environmental Plant Management Association (IEPMA)''' is mainly an educational association, with an annual conference held in January in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]] as one of its main focuses. The Conference draws participants from throughout [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]]–with speakers from government (municipal, provincial, and federal), universities, colleges, and industry. Participants in these conferences can gain CEC’s (Continuing Education Credits) toward renewal of the BC Pesticide Applicator Certificate.

The IEPMA was originally constituted to represent professional pesticide applicators in British Columbia. Through the years, however, its membership has become more diverse, and now also includes landscape consultants and representatives from commercial nurseries, school districts, golf courses, and various departments of municipal governments.

The forerunner of the IEPMA was the Environmental Standards Association, formed in 1983 in Kelowna. The association was reconstituted in [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia]] in 1992 as the IEPMA, with Dudley Gordon as its first President.

[[communication]]  with people of other [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal.

''Health &amp; Social Care In The Community'', ''24''(6), e117-e130. doi:10.1111/hsc.12293&lt;/ref&gt; Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lustig, M. W., &amp; Koester, J. (2003). ''Intercultural competence: Interpersonal communication across cultures'' (4th ed.). Boston : Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Basics==
It's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liu, S. (2014) that allow a person understand another person from another culture. Becoming intercultural: exposure to foreign cultures and intercultural competence through [[travel]] and [[tourism]]. ''China Media Research'', ''10''(3), 7+. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m. (2010). Inclusive Cultural Empathy for Successful Global Leadership. ''American Psychologist'', ''65''(8), 841-854. doi:10.1037/a0020916&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015). When an Intercultural Business Negotiation Fails: Comparing the Emotions and Behavioural Tendencies of Individualistic and Collectivistic Negotiators. ''Group Decision &amp; Negotiation'', ''24''(3), 537-561. doi:10.1007/s10726-014-9420-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maali, B. M., &amp; Al-Attar, A. (2017).

** Decisions are based on the benefits of the group rather than the individual;
** Strong loyalty to the group as the main social unit;
** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Cultures value tradition, personal stability, maintaining "face," and reciprocity during interpersonal interactions;
** People expect quick results after actions;
** Historical events and beliefs influence people's actions in the present;
** Monochronic cultures are Canada, Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, and U.S.A.
* Long-term or Polychronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
** Cultures value persistence, thriftiness,and humility;
** People sacrifice immediate gratification for long-term commitments;
** Cultures believe that past results do not guarantee for the future and are aware of change;
** Polychronic cultures are China, Japan, Brazil, and India.

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;
* the [http://idiinventory.com/ Inter-cultural Intercultural Developmental Inventory]
* the [[Cultural Intelligence]] (CQ) Measurement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cq-portal.com/index.php|title=Cultural Intelligence Portal|website=www.cq-portal.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [http://www.tamas.com/index.php?q=node/21 Multicultural Personality Questionnaire]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halim|first=Haslina|last2=Bakar|first2=Hassan Abu|last3=Mohamad|first3=Bahtiar|date=2014-11-06|title=Expatriate Adjustment: Validating Multicultural Personality Trait among Self-initiated Academic Expatriates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814057334|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|series=The International Conference on Communication and Media 2014 (i-COME’14) - Communication, Empowerment and Governance: The 21st Century Enigma|volume=155|pages=123–129|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.10.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004). Studying abroad: the role of college students' goals on the development of cross-cultural skills and global understanding. ''College Student Journal'', 38(3). Retrieved July 9, 2007, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lessard-Clouston |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Towards an understanding of culture in L2/FL education |journal=Ronko: K.G. studies in English |volume=25 |pages=131–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lievens |first=F. |last2=Harris |first2=M. |last3=Van Keer |first3=E. |last4=Bisqueret |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Predicting cross-cultural training performance: The validity of personality, cognitive ability, and dimensions measured by an assessment center and a behavior description interview |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=476–489 |pmid=12814296 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B.

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012). ''The ICCA™ Facilitator's Manual'' London: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is The ICCA?|url=http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx|work=Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal|publisher=GloBus Research Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

{{Slavery}}
'''International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition''', [[August 23]] of each year, the day designated by [[UNESCO]] to memorialize the [[transatlantic slave trade]].

That date was chosen by the adoption of resolution 29 C/40 by the Organization's General Conference at its 29th session. Circular CL/3494 of July 29, 1998, from the Director-General invited Ministers of Culture to promote the day. The date is significant because, during the night of August 22 to August 23, 1791, on the island of [[Saint Domingue]] (now known as [[Haiti]]), an [[Haitian Revolution|uprising began]] which set forth events which were a major factor in the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of the transatlantic [[slave trade]].

UNESCO Member States organize events every year on that date, inviting  participation from young people, educators, artists and intellectuals. As part of the goals of the intercultural UNESCO project, "[[The Slave Route Project|The Slave Route]]", it is an opportunity for collective recognition and focus on the "historic causes, the methods and the consequences" of [[slavery]]. Additionally, it sets the stage for analysis and dialogue of the interactions which gave rise to the transatlantic trade in [[human beings]] between [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[the Americas]] and the [[Caribbean]].

==Activity within different nations==
The International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition was first celebrated in a number of countries, in particular in [[Haiti]] on August 23, 1998 and [[Senegal]] on August 23, 1999. A number of cultural events and debates were organized.

===France===
In 2001 the Museum of Printed Textiles (Musée de l'impression sur étoffes) in [[Mulhouse]], [[France]], conducted a fabric workshop entitled "Indiennes de Traite" (a type of [[Calico (textile)|calico]]) used as currency in trade for [[Africans]].

===United Kingdom===

====Liverpool====

==History==

The conservatory was founded in June 2011 by Marcus Ratka, Joe Valentin and Andy Bartosh. In November 2011 the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture amended regulation on study support for students in conservatories. This in turn gave students in conservatories equal status to other students in Austria when applying for and receiving financial support as part of the Austrian Student Support Act. The JAM MUSIC LAB was first granted public status in March 2012 and therefore officially acknowledged by the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture. Permanent public status was awarded to the conservatory in June 2014. In January 2017 the institute received accreditation as "JAM MUSIC LAB - Private University for Jazz and Popular Music" and became the 13th Private University in Austria and the 3rd that focuses on music and arts.

The '''Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board''' ('''JAMB''') is a [[Nigerian]] entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/04/ojerinde-re-appointed-jamb-registrar/|title=Ojerinde re-appointed JAMB registrar|date=9 April 2012|work=Vanguard News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board conducts entrance [[Test (assessment)|examinations]] for prospective undergraduates into [[Nigeria]]n universities. The board is also charged with the responsibility to administer similar examinations for applicants to Nigerian public and private monotechnics, [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]], and colleges of educations.

'''K12 Inc.''' is a [[for-profit education]] company that sells [[Online and offline|online]] schooling and [[curriculum|curricula]]. K12 is an [[education management organization]] (EMO) that provides online education designed as alternatives alternative to traditional "bricks and mortar" education for public school students from kindergarten to 12th grade.&lt;ref name="saul"&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephanie Saul |title=Profits and Questions at Online Charter Schools |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publicly traded K12 is the largest EMO in terms of enrollment.&lt;ref name=emo&gt;{{cite web

K12 and similar for-profit online schools have been criticized for graduation rates less than half the average of all public schools.&lt;ref name="npr150202"/&gt;

== History ==

===Finance===
The company was founded by former banker Ronald J. Packard.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Initial investors in the company included [[Michael R. Milken]] and [[Lowell Milken]] of education company Knowledge Universe, who along with the Milken Family Foundation, invested $10 million.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; [[Andrew Tisch]] of the [[Loews Corporation]] and [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation]] also contributed venture capital.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;  It became a [[publicly traded company]] on December 13, 2007.&lt;ref name=nyse&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New York Stock Exchange|url=https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lrn.html|accessdate=October 8, 2012|title=K12 Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===

[[William Bennett]], [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] under [[Ronald Reagan]] was hired as the company's first chairman of the board, serving until 2005.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bill Bennett: The Education of an E-School Skeptic|journal=[[Businessweek]]|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2001-02-13/bill-bennett-the-education-of-an-e-school-skeptic|date=February 13, 2001|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the [[School District of Philadelphia|Philadelphia Board of Education]] called for the termination of a $3M science curriculum contract with K12 after Bennett said, "if you wanted to reduce crime&amp;nbsp;... you could abort every black baby in the country and your crime rate would go down. That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down."&lt;ref name="socolar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenotebook.org/editions/2005/winter/hot.htm |title=Hot debate about revoking K12’s science contract|author=Paul Socolar|publisher=The Notebook.com |date= Winter 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett subsequently resigned from the K12 board and his part-time position with K12. The contract was not revoked, but was not renewed at the end of the contract term.&lt;ref name="notebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenotebook.org/summer-2009/091052/contract-k12-science-curriculum-lapses|title=Anonymous - Contract with K12 for science curriculum lapses|last=|first=|date=Summer 2006|website=|publisher=The Notebook.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100301560.html|title=Bennett Quits K12 Board After Remarks|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 4, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Packard resigned in 2014 to start [[Pansophic Learning]].

On February 13, 2018, Stuart Udell resigned from his role as CEO of K12. Nate Davis, the previous CEO, replaced Udell as the current CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/k12-ceo-resigns-after-refusing-to-accept-role-changes-at-online-education-company-2018-02-13|title=K12 CEO resigns after refusing to accept role changes at online-education company|last=Owens|first=Jeremy C.|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offerings==
===Education management===
K12 is a for-profit education management organization (EMO). In this sector, K12 does not operate physical schools, but provides online curriculum to home-schooled children and other schools.&lt;ref name = "pf121007"/&gt; K12 was the largest EMO in the US in 2011–2012.&lt;ref name = "ip171110"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter School Operators|url=http://www.in-perspective.org/pages/operators|publisher=In Perspective|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K12's for-profit rival [[EdisonLearning]] has also moved away from physical schoolhouses to virtual offerings.

K12 offers its on-line curriculum at three levels:
*To states and districts as a home-schooling alternative to brick-and-mortar schools&lt;ref name = "pf121007"/&gt;
*To school districts as a supplement to classroom teaching&lt;ref name ="be180111"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/south-county-public-school-leaders-pitched-blended-learning-model,529282|title='Blended learning' model pitched to several Southern Berkshire school leaders|work=The Berkshire Eagle|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To parents individually as a private, on-line, homeschooling alternative&lt;ref name = "wapo220122"/&gt;

In 2015, 526 virtual schools in the United States enrolled 278,511 students.&lt;ref name="nepc170411"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Molnar|first1=Alex|title=Virtual Schools in the U.S. 2017|date=April 11, 2017|publisher=National Education Policy Center|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/virtual-schools-annual-2017|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Charter management===
K12 competes with non-profit educational organizations known as charter management organizations (CMOs) that typically run brick-and-mortar schools. Other large non-profits are [[Imagine Schools]] (55 schools), [[Knowledge Is Power Program|KIPP]] (209 schools), and Cosmos.  Multi-state EMOs and CMOs control about a third of the charter school market.&lt;ref name = "ip171110"/&gt;  K12 provides full-service solutions to online non-profit CMOs including Agora and Insight in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="pe170518"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt;  The company manages state-funded virtual charter schools and hybrid schools in twenty-nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=layton&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/virtual-schools-are-multiplying-but-some-question-their-educational-value/2011/11/22/gIQANUzkzN_print.html|title=Virtual schools are multiplying, but some question their educational value|publisher=Washington Post
|last=Layton |first=Lyndsey |author2=Emma Brown |date=November 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, K12 was CMO (and charter holder) for schools enrolling 44,559 students.&lt;ref name="jw2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodworth|first1=James L|title=Charter Management Organizations 2017|url=https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=Center for Research on Education Outcomes|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

==Curricula==
K12’s product line includes courses for pre-K, elementary, middle, and high school grades, online learning platforms, and educational software.  K12 sells a range of packages, from turn-key online school systems to individual courses for students.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt;

The K-8 curriculum includes core subject areas: math, science, language arts, history, art, music, and world languages. The majority of lessons in the early grades are offline using textbooks, printed materials, and hands-on activities.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt; The learning coach (typically a parent or guardian) is expected to spend three to five hours each day monitoring students' progress, logging attendance, and facilitating lessons. Short answer or multiple choice assessments are given at the end of most lessons in K-8 and are administered and recorded by the learning coach.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2011/02/09/02elearning.h04.html |title=Full-Time E-Learning Not Seen as Viable Option for Many

At the high school level (grades 9-12), students complete all coursework online. Less parental involvement is expected.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; In high school, teachers monitor student's progress and grade tests and assignments.&lt;ref name=differences&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k12.com/schools-programs/high-school-program/how-it-differs-from-k8 |title=How K12 high school differs from K–8
|publisher=K12 |accessdate=October 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to core and comprehensive courses, students can choose remedial, Honors, Credit Recovery and Advanced Placement options.&lt;ref name=highschool&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.k12.com/courses/high-school-courses/high-school-course-list |title=High school course list

|title=Keeping Pace with K-12 Online &amp; Blended Learning |publisher=Evergreen Education Group |accessdate=November 1, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the K-8 grades, high school courses take place mostly online. Students attend live online classes and have more communication with teachers, via e-mail, phone, and online conferences.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hundley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20120823-virtual-schooling-offers-tuition-free-education-but-its-not-for-everyone.ece |title= Virtual schooling offers tuition-free education, but it’s not for everyone
|last=Hundley |first=Wendy |date=August 23, 2012 |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |publisher=Dallas Morning News
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In all cases, the school assigns a state-certified teacher to assist the coach and student.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt; The cost to a sponsoring agency depends on the teacher-student ratio selected. K12 offered the Commonwealth of Virginia three plans: a teacher-student ratio of forty, fifty, or sixty to one.&lt;ref name="nyt111212"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Stephanie|title=Profits and Questions at Online Charter Schools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html|accessdate=22 January 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher interaction is accomplished through virtual classroom environments using [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard Collaborate]], telephone, and face-to-face meetings and events.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt; In hybrid schools, students complete the same curriculum but attend a physical building and participate in classes with other students and teachers.&lt;ref name=layton/&gt;

==Branding==
K12 offers itself through a variety of brands.

===State and district sponsored homeschooling===
K12 develops identities for specific opportunities.  In [[Union County, Tennessee]], it has operated '''Tennessee Virtual Academy''' since 2011.&lt;ref name="tt150421"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balakit|first1=Melanie|title=Push fails to keep Tennessee Virtual Academy open|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2015/04/21/tennessee-virtual-academy-makes-final-push-stay-open/26136201/|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=The Tennessean|date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt150612"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balakit|first1=Melanie|title=Court: TN Virtual Academy can remain open|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2015/06/12/court-rules-tennessee-virtual-academy-can-remain-open/71150790/|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=The Tennessean|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, it operates '''Insight Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School'''.&lt;ref name="pe170518"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodall|first1=Martha|title=Court sides with proposed cyber charter backed by K12 Inc.|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/Court-sides-with-proposed-cyber-charter-backed-by-K12-Inc.html|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=Philadelphia Enquirer|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuel Education ===
In April 2014, K12 Inc. established wholly owned subsidiary, '''Fuel Education'''.&lt;ref name="ew140402"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/04/02/27rebrand_ep.h33.html|title=K12 Inc.

==School assessment==
The [[National Education Policy Center]] regularly conducts studies of the performance of K12 and other for-profit virtual schools including [[Connections Academy]] (a subsidiary of [[Pearson Education]]).&lt;ref name="npr150202"&gt;{{cite news|last1=KAMENETZ|first1=ANYA|title=Virtual Schools Bring Real Concerns About Quality|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/02/02/382167062/virtual-schools-bring-real-concerns-about-quality|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=NPR All Things Considered|date=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have not been encouraging.&lt;ref name="nepc1503"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barbour|first1=Michael K.|title=VIRTUAL SCHOOLS IN THE U.S. 2015: POLITICS, PERFORMANCE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/rb-virt-2015-2-research_0.pdf|publisher=National Education Policy Center|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at Western Michigan University and the National Education Policy Center found that only a third of K12’s schools achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), which is required for public schools by the federal [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB) legislation.&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt; According to the Times, "By almost every educational measure, the Agora Cyber Charter School [a school run by K12] is failing." In Pennsylvania, 42% of Agora students tested at grade level or better in math, compared with 75% of students statewide. 52% of Agora students tested at grade level or better in reading, compared with 72% statewide.&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt; Nonetheless, Agora brought K12 $72 million in the 2011 school year&amp;nbsp;– more than 10% of K12's revenue.&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt;  Agora terminated its contract with K12 in 2014.&lt;ref name="pe160524"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodall|first1=Martha|title=Pa. seeks financial, contract info from Agora Cyber Charter|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/education/20160524_Pa__seeks_financial__contract_info_from_Agora_Cyber_Charter.html|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Enquirer|date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that such statistics are undermined by the fact that a significant proportion of newly enrolled students begin several grade levels behind because of an alleged failure of brick and mortar schools.&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt; Education reformers such as [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]], have further stated that AYP is not an accurate measure of a school’s performance and estimated that under NCLB, as many as "82 percent of America's schools could be labeled 'failing'".&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press and politicians have been equally critical. A 2012 [[PolitiFact.com]] article noted K12's poor performance in Tennessee.&lt;ref name = "pf121007"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/07/andy-berke/chattanooga-senator-slaps-virtual-school-company-r/|date = October 7, 2012| last1 = McMillin|first1= Zack | title = Chattanooga senator slaps virtual school company for “results at bottom of the bottom"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' investigated K12 and concluded that the company squeezes profits from public school funding by raising enrollment, increasing teacher workload, and lowering standards.&lt;ref name="saul"/&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' raised similar issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2145">'''''Língua Geral''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈlĩɡwɐ ʒeˈɾaw|br}}, ''General Language'') is the name of two distinct [[lingua franca]]s, spoken in [[Brazil]]: the ''[[Língua Geral Paulista]]'' (''tupi austral'', or Southern Tupi), which was spoken in the region of São Paulo but is now extinct, and the ''língua geral amazônica'' (''tupinambá'') of the Amazon whose modern descendant is [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]].

Both were simplified versions of the [[Tupi language]], the native language of the [[Tupi people]]. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonizers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, and faced with an indigenous population that spoke many languages, they sought a means to establish effective communication among the many groups. The two languages were used in the [[Jesuit Reductions]], the Jesuit missions in Brazil and by early colonists; and came to be used by [[Slavery in Brazil|black slaves]] and other Indian groups.

'''Miksike MentalMath''' is a project for students to improve their [[mental calculation]] skill. The project consists of online [[JavaScript]]-based mental training and competing platform and competitions that are held on national and international levels. The project was developed by Kalev Põldsaar of [[Estonia]].

== Participation ==
The project is held in five countries: Estonia, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Slovenia]]. Students from each must register to website pointing their schools to be able to take a part in competitions. The age groups are primary 1–3 grade(form), basic 4–6, boys 7–12, girls 7–12, boys 13 and over, girls 13 and over.

== Tasks ==
Training consists of various tasks: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, mixed tasks, gap-filling and comparison. Almost every task has three parts: natural numbers, integers, ratios (since 2010). More complex tasks are grouped into [[Triathlon|triathlons]] and [[Pentathlon|pentathlons]]. The pentathlon consists of five tasks and 45 minutes are allowed to calculate them. Pentathlon is used at international championships.

At every task (addition, subtraction and so on) it is given 40 seconds every six levels at normal mode. Sprint mode covers 190 seconds for the student to answer five examples in a row correctly to level up. Higher levels are more difficult to solve, but they give many more points.

== International competitions ==
An international competition of Miksike MentalMath is held every year at the end of spring. Each year there compete more than one hundred students. The competition is held in a different country each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="944">'''Music Colleges''' were introduced in 2004 as part of the [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] in [[England]]. The system enables [[Secondary education#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|secondary schools]] to specialise in certain fields, in this case, [[music]]. Schools that successfully apply to the [[Specialist Schools Trust]] and become Music Colleges will receive extra funding from this joint private sector and government scheme. Music Colleges also act as a local point of reference for other schools and businesses in the area, with an emphasis on promoting music within the community.

The '''National Council for Educational Technology''' provided advice and support for schools and colleges in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland on [[educational technology]], in particular the use of computers for teaching and learning.

The [[Department for Education and Science]] merged the [[Council for Educational Technology]] and the [[Microelectronics Education Support Unit|MESU]] in 1989. The civil servant Noel Thompson, who promoted this change, became its first Chief Executive. It carried out evaluations of new technologies such as CD-ROMs, laptop computers and researched the effectiveness of different methods and techniques.  It promoted the use of educational technology through publications, events, TV programmes.

==Structure and Governance==
NCET was a charitable trust funded by government and formally a [[Non-Departmental Public Body]].  It had a Council (acting as the organisation's Board of Directors), whose Chairman and Chief Executive were responsible to the Secretaries of State of the Education Departments in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.  Its work was outlined in an annual priorities letter from the Department and a senior civil servant and HMI sat on its Board.

==People==

===Chief Executives===
The Chief Executive was employed by the NCET Council to run the organisation and deliver its programme of work.
* Noel Thompson 1989-91	
* Graham Walters (acting) 1991	 	 
* Margaret Bell 1992-1997
* Mike Littlewood (acting) 1997	 	 
* Owen Lynch 1997

===Chairmen===
The Chairmen were unpaid, except for their expenses, they chaired the Council and met with Ministers to agree the work of the organisation. 
* Don Gratton 1989-90 - was a BBC Executive
* Margaret Parkes 1990-92 - Lady Parkes chaired the original Technology National Curriculum Working Party	 	
* John Richards 1992-95 
* Heather Du Quesnay 1995-97 was Director of Education for Lambeth  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/ncet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations==
With the increased resource being provided to schools for educational technology the NCET took on a role of piloting and evaluating new technologies.  NCET’s role was to provide appropriate evaluative evidence to them to ensure that this money was well spent.  It also looked to help grow viable and appropriate commercial markets for IT products and through a number of NCET managed pilots and procurements it stimulated specific areas, for example, the introduction of CD-ROMs into schools.  Similar initiatives of varying scales and technologies including portable computers for teachers, communications technologies, multimedia desktop computers, satellite technologies and integrated learning systems all contributed to keeping UK schools up to date with the changing pace of the technology during the 1990s.

==Research==
As well as providing equipment and materials it was also part of NCET's brief to collate and disseminate research and case study evidence on the impact of IT on learning and educational institutions and to produce support materials for them.  This included support for the Education Department's Superhighways Initiative from 1995-7 which ran 22 projects-supported by £12 million from commercial sponsors-that focus on the application of electronic communications in schools and colleges.

==Publications==
Managing IT
Inspecting IT

==NCET-TV==
NCET-TV was a series of educational TV programmes aimed at helping the UK's teachers gain relevant IT skills.  As part of BBC 2's The Learning Zone, the programmes will be transmitted on the first Wednesday of each month at 4.00am.

==Renaming to form Becta==
Dennis Stevenson was asked by Tony Blair in 1996 to look at the use of computers in schools.  He set up an independent enquiry, a panel of experts who took evidence from a wide range of bodies and individuals and published his report&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson D. (1997) 'Information and Communications Technology in UK Schools, An Independent Enquiry' March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1997, just in time for the forthcoming election. Following the election Dennis Stevenson advised the UK Government that NCET could be a useful organisation, but it needed to be more closely aligned to government and should be restructured. The organisation was renamed the [[Becta|British Educational Communications Technology Agency]] (Becta), restructured and given the task of developing  "The National Grid for Learning"  (NGfL).

{{Other uses}}A '''nerd''' is a person seen as overly [[intellectual]], [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]], [[introvert|introverted]] or lacking [[social skills]]. Such a person may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, little known, or non-[[mainstream]] activities, which are generally either highly technical, abstract, or relating to topics of [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]], to the exclusion of more mainstream activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Nerd?r=75&amp;src=ref&amp;ch=dic "Nerd | Define Nerd at Dictionary.com"], "Dictionary.com, LLC" 2011, accessed May 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;nerd, n. [[Oxford English Dictionary]] online. Third edition, September 2003; online version September 2011.

Originally derogatory, the term "nerd" was a stereotype, but as with other pejoratives, it has been [[Reappropriation|reclaimed]] and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity.

==Etymology==
The first documented appearance of the word ''nerd'' is as the name of a creature in [[Dr. Seuss]]'s book ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950), in which the narrator Gerald McGrew claims that he would collect "a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a [[Seersucker]] too" for his imaginary zoo.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;&lt;ref name="English Language 1212"&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition, p. 1212, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston – New York – London, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Seuss|Geisel, Theodor Seuss]], ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'', p. 47, Random House Books for Young Readers. New York, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[slang]] meaning of the term dates to 1951.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{OEtymD|nerd}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for ''[[wikt:drip#Noun|drip]]'' or ''[[square (slang)|square]]'' in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'' 'Jelly Tot, Square Bear-Man!' (1951-10-8), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, usage of the term had spread throughout the United States, and even as far as Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Marsh in Special Collections at the [[Swarthmore College]] library as reported in [http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/lists_archive/Humanist/v04/0074.html Humanist Discussion Group] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131223744/http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/lists_archive/Humanist/v04/0074.html |date=2008-01-31 }} (1990-6-28) Vol. 4, No. 0235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow, Scotland, ''Sunday Mail'' (1957-02-10).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}} At some point, the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude.&lt;ref name="English Language 1212"/&gt;

An alternate spelling,&lt;ref&gt;''The many spellings of Nurd'', Fall 1970 (revised [http://polyglotinc.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-many-spellings-of-nurd-or-is-it-nerd.html online] 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; as ''nurd'' or ''gnurd'', also began to appear in the mid-1960s or early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Slang: A Quarterly Glossary of Slang Expressions Currently In Use'' (1971). Vol. V, No. 4, Spring 1971, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Philip K. Dick]] claimed to have coined the "nurd" spelling in 1973, but its first recorded use appeared in a 1965 student publication at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI).&lt;ref&gt;Personal Correspondence (1973-9-4) reported on [http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/NerdMail.html#PKDick the web]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RPI ''Bachelor'' (1965), V14 #1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral tradition]] there holds that the word is derived from ''knurd'' (''[[drunk]]'' spelled backward), which was used to describe people who studied rather than partied. The term ''gnurd '' (spelled with the "g") was in use at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) by 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''More Mathematical People'' (D.J. Albers, J.L. Alexanderson and C. Reid), p. 105 (1990). Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "nurd" was also in use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as early as 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V90/PDF/V90-N57.pdf |work=The Daily Reamer, Volume 69, No. 20 |page=6 |date=February 3, 1971 |title=Johnson honors Nurd for saving Institute |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}}

According to ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word is an alteration of the 1940s term "''nert''" (meaning "stupid or crazy person"), which is itself an alteration of "[[wikt:nut|nut]]" (nutcase).{{refn|name=Harper}}

The term was popularized in the 1970s by its heavy use in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Happy Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Nerd stereotype==
Because of the nerd stereotype, many smart people are often thought of as nerdy. This belief can be harmful, as it can cause high-school students to "switch off their lights" out of fear of being branded as a nerd,&lt;ref name="In Praise"&gt;{{cite news |last= Anderegg |first=Mr |title= In Praise of Nerds |url= http://www.economist.com/node/10493332 |work= The Economist |date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause otherwise appealing people to be considered nerdy simply for their intellect. It was once thought that intellectuals were nerdy because they were envied. However, [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] stated in his essay, "Why Nerds are Unpopular", that intellect is neutral, meaning that you are neither loved nor despised for it. He also states that it is only the correlation that makes smart teens automatically seem nerdy, and that a nerd is someone that is not socially adept enough. Additionally, he says that the reason why many smart kids are unpopular is that they "don't have time for the activities required for popularity."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Paul|title=Why Nerds are Unpopular|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nerd 11.jpg|thumb|A child dressed up as a stereotypical nerd]]
Stereotypical nerd appearance, often lampooned in [[caricature]]s, can include very large [[glasses]], [[dental braces|braces]], [[malocclusion|buck teeth]], severe [[acne]] and [[Trousers|pants]] worn high at the waist. Following suit of popular use in emoticons, Unicode released in 2015 its "Nerd Face" character, featuring some of those stereotypes: 🤓 (code point U+1F913).  In the media, many nerds are males, portrayed as being physically unfit, either [[overweight]] or [[:wikt:skinny|skinny]] due to lack of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lori Kendall. "OH NO! I'M A NERD!": Hegemonic Masculinity on an Online Forum. ''Gender Society''. '''14''': 256. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Eglash. Race, Sex, and Nerds. ''Social Text''. '''20:''' 49 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested by some, such as linguist [[Mary Bucholtz]], that being a nerd may be a state of being "hyperwhite" and rejecting [[African-American culture]] and slang that "cool" white children use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/magazine/29wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin|title= Who’s a Nerd, Anyway? |accessdate=2007-07-28 |author=Benjamin Nugent|date=July 29, 2007|work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' movie franchise (with multicultural nerds), and the introduction of the [[Steve Urkel]] character on the television series ''[[Family Matters]]'', nerds have been seen in all races and colors as well as more recently being a frequent young Asian or Indian male stereotype in North America. Portrayal of "nerd girls", in films such as ''[[She's Out of Control]]'', ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' and ''[[She's All That]]'' depicts that smart but nerdy women might suffer later in life if they do not focus on improving their [[physical attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gateward|first=Frances K.|author2=Murray Pomerance|title=Sugar, spice, and everything nice: cinemas of girlhood|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8143-2918-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywsajx7jqAMC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=nerd+girl|accessdate=2009-07-23|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a 2010 study published in the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication'' indicated that [[Asian Americans]] are perceived as most likely to be nerds, followed by [[White American]]s, while non-White [[Hispanics]] and [[Black Americans]] were perceived as least likely to be nerds. These stereotypes stem from concepts of [[Orientalism]] and [[Primitivism]], as discussed in Ron Eglash's essay ''Race, Sex, and Nerds'': ''From Black Geeks to Asian American Hipsters''.&lt;ref&gt;Eglash, R. 'Race, Sex, And Nerds: FROM BLACK GEEKS TO ASIAN AMERICAN HIPSTERS'. ''Social Text'' 20.2 71 (2002): 49–64. Web. 11 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the stereotypical behaviors associated with the "nerd" stereotype have correlations with the symptoms of [[Asperger's Syndrome]] or other autism-spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;https://aspergers101.com/high-functioning-autism-vs-asperers-syndrome/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nerd pride==
The rise of [[Silicon Valley]] and the American [[computer]] industry at large has allowed many so-called nerdy people to accumulate large fortunes. Many stereotypically nerdy interests, such as [[superhero]] and [[science fiction]] works, are now popular culture hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woyke|first=Elizabeth|title=Celebrity Nerds Come Out|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/19/celebrity-geeks-gadgets-tech-personal-cx_ew_0919celeb.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Forbes|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some measures of nerdiness are now allegedly considered desirable, as, to some, it suggests a person who is intelligent, respectful, interesting, and able to earn a large salary. Stereotypical nerd qualities are evolving, going from awkwardness and [[social ostracism]] to an allegedly more widespread acceptance and sometimes even celebration of their differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cringely|first=Robert|title=Triumph of the Nerds: A History of the Computer|url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/timeline/micro.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], researcher, self-proclaimed nerd and director of nerd documentary ''[[Traceroute (film)|Traceroute]]'', reflects on the emergence of nerds and nerd culture:
{{quote|I think that the figure of the nerd provides a beautiful template for analyzing the transformation of the disciplinary society into the control society. The nerd, in his cliche form, first stepped out upon the world stage in the mid-1970s, when we were beginning to hear the first rumblings of what would become the Cambrian explosion of the information society. The nerd must serve as comic relief for the future-anxieties of Western society. [...] The germ cell of burgeoning nerdism is difference. The yearning to be understood, to find opportunities to share experiences, to not be left alone with one's bizarre interest. At the same time one derives an almost perverse pleasure from wallowing in this deficit. Nerds love deficiency: that of the other, but also their own. Nerds are eager explorers, who enjoy measuring themselves against one another and also compete aggressively. And yet the nerd's existence also comprises an element of the occult, of mystery. The way in which this power is expressed or focused is very important.|Johannes Grenzfurthner, interviewed by Thomas Kaestle, ''[[Boing Boing]]'', 14 April 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html|title=The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest: Johannes Grenzfurthner talks about Traceroute|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|first=Thomas|last=Kaestle|date=14 April 2016|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1984 film ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' [[Robert Carradine]] worked to embody the nerd stereotype; in doing so, he helped create a definitive image of nerds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Singer | first = Jon | title = Carradine hits the jackpot as Lewis Skolnick | magazine = Lumino | date = 2005-08-28 | url = http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/341/10/ | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Many, however, seem to share Radloff's view, as "nerd pride" has become more widespread in the years since. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor [[Gerald Sussman]], for example, seeks to instill pride in nerds:
{{quote|My idea is to present an image to children that it is good to be intellectual, and not to care about the peer pressures to be anti-intellectual. I want every child to turn into a nerd – where that means someone who prefers studying and learning to competing for social dominance, which can unfortunately cause the downward spiral into social rejection.|Gerald Sussman, quoted by Katie Hafner, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 August 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/business/woman-computer-nerd-and-proud.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Woman, Computer Nerd – and Proud|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Katie|last=Hafner|date=29 August 1993|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The popular computer-related news website [[Slashdot]] uses the [[tagline]] "News for nerds. Stuff that matters." The Charles J. Sykes quote "Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one" has been popularized on the Internet and incorrectly attributed to [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Mikkelson | first = Barbara | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = David P. | title = Some Rules Kids Won't Learn in School | year = 2000 | url = http://www.snopes.com/language/document/liferule.asp | accessdate = 2007-07-22 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

An episode from the animated series ''[[Freakazoid]]'', titled "Nerdator", includes the use of nerds to power the mind of a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]-like enemy. Towards the middle of the show, he gave this speech. :
{{quote|...most nerds are shy ordinary-looking types with no interest in physical activity. But, what they lack in physical prowess they make up in brains. Tell me, who writes all the best selling books? Nerds. Who makes all the top grossing movies? Nerds. Who designs computer programs so complex that only they can use them? Nerds. And who is running for high public office? No one but nerds. ... Without nerds to lead the way, the governments of the world will stumble, they'll be forced to seek guidance from good-looking, but vapid airheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZHichaemV4|title=YouTube|author=|date=|work=youtube.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Danish reality TV show ''[[FC Zulu]]'', known in the internationally franchised format as ''[[FC Nerds]]'', established a format wherein a team of nerds, after two or three months of training, competes with a professional [[association football|soccer]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=FC Zulu|date=2004-09-13|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424637/episodes?season=1&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_1|accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators consider that the word is devalued when applied to people who adopt a [[sub-cultural]] pattern of behaviour, rather than being reserved for people with a marked ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westcott|first=Kathryn|title=Are 'geek' and 'nerd' now positive terms?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20325517|work=News Magazine|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally being predominately an American stereotype, Nerd culture has grown across the globe and is now more acceptable and common than ever. Australian events such as Oz Comic-Con (a large comic book and [[Cosplay]] convention, similar to [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]) and Supernova, are incredibly popular events among the culture of people who identify themselves as nerds. In 2016, Oz Comic-Con in [[Perth]] saw almost 20,000 cos-players and comic book fans meet to celebrate the event, hence being named a "professionally organised [[Woodstock]] for geeks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-01/fans-embrace-comic-con-perth/7293654|title=Fantasy fans to flock Perth Oz Comic-Con spectacle|date=2016-04-01|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
Individuals who are labeled as "nerds" are often the target of bullying due to a range of reasons that may include physical appearance or social background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paul Graham has suggested that the reason nerds are frequently singled out for bullying is their indifference to popularity or social context, in the face of a youth culture that views popularity as paramount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, research findings suggest that bullies are often as socially inept as their academically better-performing victims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Christie|date=2010-07-10|title=Bully or Victim?

'''Paint Nite''' is a company in the [[paint and sip industry]], with headquarters in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]. Founded in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201502/paul-keegan/art-stars.html|title=How Paint Nite Started a Party-Planning Revolution|date=2015-01-15|website=Inc.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paint Nite offers live, nightly painting events accompanied by wine or cocktails.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paintnite.com/about-us|title=about Paint Nite|last=|first=|date=|website=Paint Nite|publisher=|access-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events are held in local bars and restaurants. Local artists, licensed as Paint Nite hosts, guide guests step-by-step as they create a personalized painting. Events typically last two hours and guests take home their artwork.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Paint Nite was founded in 2012 by Daniel Hermann and Sean McGrail. Daniel Hermann was born in Boston and grew up in Newton, Massachusetts. He started his first business at 21. He still owns this laundry pick-up delivery service, which operates in six states. He attended the University of Wisconsin and [[Babson College]] for his MBA.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sramanamitra.com/2014/07/30/bootstrapping-a-fun-social-business-paintnite-ceo-dan-hermann-part-1/|title=Bootstrapping a Fun Social Business: Paint Nite CEO Dan Hermann (Part 1)|date=2014-07-30|website=Sramana Mitra|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sean McGrail attended [[George Washington University]] from 1990–1994 where he received a BA in psychology, marketing and fine arts. He previously has worked for PARTNERS+simons and Genzyme Biosurgery.

The idea of Paint Nite occurred to the duo when they attended a birthday party that served beer and wine in a painting studio. They concluded that having painting events in a local bar instead of a studio would reduce overhead costs.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Using a licensing model which enabled local artists to work the painting events, Hermann and McGrail founded Paint Nite with $7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2015/02/social-painting-startup-paint-nite-raises-13m-in.html|title=Social painting startup Paint Nite raises $13M in funding - ''Boston Business Journal''|website=Boston Business Journal|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paint Nite has raised $13 million in equity funding. The funding came from [[Highland Capital Partners]]. Since 2012, Paint Nite and the paint and sip industry in general have grown rapidly. The company now generates $50 million in annual revenue. In August 2015 the company announced [https://beta.finance.yahoo.com/news/paint-nite-celebrates-two-million-130000224.html two million tickets sold worldwide].

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.finance.yahoo.com/news/paint-nite-celebrates-two-million-130000224.html|title=Paint Nite Celebrates Two Million Tickets Sold|website=beta.finance.yahoo.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and business model== 
Paint Nite is self-financed. Its customers purchase tickets to the events in advance. The upfront cash can be used to further grow the business and purchase supplies based on sales. Hermann noted this is why the company has grown rapidly.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Paint Nite is based on a licensing model. Licensees and the artists that host the painting events use the Paint Nite brand to run their business. This differs from the franchise model where income and upfront costs are required. The venue that hosts the event generates income from alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paintnite.com/work-with-us/venues|title=Become a Paint Nite Venue|last=|first=|date=|website=Paint Nite|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
==Marketing and advertising==
Paint Nite’s customer base is 90 percent female, between the ages of 21 and 45.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; McGrail noted that social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been key components in Paint Nite’s success. People tagging themselves in social media have accounted for about 35 percent of ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/paint-nite--startup-gives-masterclass-in-using-social-media-and-a-smart-online-presence-to-grow-very-fast-192711573.html|title=Paint Nite: Startup gives masterclass in using social media and a smart online presence to grow very fast|website=Small Business|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity==
In 2014, for Paint Nite’s two-year anniversary [[New England Patriots]] tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]], also known as “Gronk,” attended a Paint Nite event held at Ned Devine’s Irish Pub in Boston. Gronkowski’s painting was auctioned off for the National Brain Tumor Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/03/31/rob-gronkowski-helps-celebrate-two-years-paint-nite/om2wXEwpO54OwFzDKjVqlK/story.html|title=Rob Gronkowski helps celebrate two years of Paint Nite - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paint Nite made its nationwide television debut in September 2014 when cast mates from BRAVO TV’s reality show, ''The Singles Project'' attended a Paint Nite event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/the-singles-project/articles/brianflirty-date/|title=The Singles Project|website=www.bravotv.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2015, book author and freelance journalist [http://www.thejoelstein.com/ Joel Stein] documented his experience at a Paint Nite event in a feature article written for ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', where Stein gave credit to Paint Nite for “Saving the American Bar”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/how-paint-nite-is-saving-the-american-bar|title=How Paint Nite Is Saving the American Bar|last=Reprints|first=Joel Stein thejoelstein|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SaganWalk.Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Planet Walk]]
The Sciencenter's '''Sagan Planet Walk''' is a walkable [[solar system model|scale model]] of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The model scales the entire Solar System—both planet size and distances between them—down to one five billionth of its actual size. Consisting of eleven obelisks situated along a {{Convert|1.18|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} path through the streets of downtown Ithaca, the Planet Walk leads from the [[Sun]] at [[Ithaca Commons|Center Ithaca]] to Pluto at the [[sciencenter|Ithaca Sciencenter]]. 

The exhibition was originally created in 1997 in memory of Ithaca resident and [[Cornell]] Professor [[Carl Sagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.sciencenter.org/SaganPW/|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Sciencenter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205135839/http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} to include a representation of [[Alpha Centauri]], the Sun's closest neighboring star, at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|Imiloa Astronomy Center at the University of Hawaii]]. The addition of the Alpha Centauri Obelisk made it the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the inner planets and Sun were removed as part of extensive construction being done to the [[Ithaca Commons]], but have since been replaced. In 2015, a grant was approved to further expand the exhibition by installing an exoplanet [[Kepler-37d]] station on the Moon {{Convert|238900|mi|km|abbr=out|sp=us|disp=flip}} away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tompkinscountyny.gov/files/tourism/4_15_15_STPB_agenda_PACKET_full.pdf|title=Tompkins County Strategic Tourism Planning Board|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2015|website=Tompkins County NY|publisher=|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual models==
The scaled size of the Sun is given by a {{Convert|27.8|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter circular frame repeated at the top of each {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} tall obelisk. Centered within each sun-sized frame, the proportional size of each planet is represented by a small sphere affixed in a glass window. All of the original planet locations were chosen not only for accuracy to scale but also to highlight local landmarks and public spaces within Ithaca. However, since the original installation of the Planet Walk the public library has moved to a new location, leaving Saturn no longer attached to a local landmark. Additionally, as of 2016-2017, the original planets in plexiglass at each station have been replaced by simple yellow disks with the planet simply represented by a relatively-sized hole.  Some attendant moons are now represented by tiny holes in the disks.

===The Sun===
The Sun Obelisk is located in the center of the [[Ithaca Commons]], a pedestrian shopping area in the heart of downtown Ithaca. The round window representing the size of the Sun at this station is roughly the size of a basketball and, in this obelisk only, contains no glass. All the subsequent obelisks in the Solar system model have Sun-sized glass windows containing their respective planets for the sake of comparison.

===The Inner Planets===
The obelisks for the four inner planets are all contained within the commons area stretching north towards Seneca Street. Mercury is situated to scale about {{Convert|12.7|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away from the Sun, Venus another {{Convert|10|yd|m|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away, Earth another {{Convert|9.3|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away, and Mars another {{Convert|17.1|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away. This keeps the four inner planets within eyesight of the Sun, yet the representations of each planet appear quite small within their glass windows, and can even be somewhat hard to see. The contrast between the size of the Sun and the size of the inner planets coupled with the visible distance between them illustrate the vastness and emptiness of space.

=== The Asteroid Belt ===
[[File:SaganWalk.4.5.AsteroidBelt.jpg|thumb|right|The Asteroid Belt]]
Once leaving the inner planets, a visitor to the Planet Walk turns west along Seneca Street to continue towards Jupiter. Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt. The obelisk representing the asteroid belt was added several years after the initial installation. Its display contains the only public, unguarded meteorite in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nocella|first=Michael|title=When Big Is Walkable: Sciencenter’s Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.ithaca.com/visit_ithaca/article_cd5c7c46-b57f-11e1-8585-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter===
The Jupiter Obelisk sits at the corner of Seneca and Cayuga streets, outside the downtown Dewitt Mall, and not far from the famed [[Moosewood Restaurant]]. The model of Jupiter within the glass window is the first planet representation on the walk that is easily visible, demonstrating how much bigger than the inner planets it is.

===Saturn===
To reach the Saturn Obelisk, visitors turn north and continue along Cayuga street. At the corner of Cayuga and Court street, Saturn's obelisk sits outside the former location of the [[Tompkins County Public Library]]. The rings of Saturn are clearly visible within the circular window.

===Uranus===
Visitors continue northward along Cayuga street from Saturn, reaching the obelisk for Uranus just across Cascadilla Creek at the entrance to Thompson Park.

===Neptune and the Carl Sagan Bridge===
[[File:SaganWalk.8.5.Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Carl Sagan Bridge with planet symbols]]
From Uranus, visitors follow Willow Avenue northwest and cross the Carl Sagan bridge at Adams street to reach the Neptune Obelisk. The Carl Sagan Bridge, built in 2000, features nine circular windows adorned with the signs of the nine planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=David|title=Cornell undergrads salute Sagan and technology by building bridge from new, lightweight material|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/petrina.fibers.deb.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisk for Neptune is located just across the bridge in Conley Park.

===Pluto and the Sciencenter===
The Planet Walk was conceived and built prior to Pluto losing its planetary status in 2006, and the model includes the Pluto Obelisk, which is located just outside the Sciencenter on First street.

===Alpha Centauri===
The model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} in 2012 to include [[Alpha Centauri]], the star closest to the Sun. The Alpha Centauri Obelisk is exhibited at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|‘Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawai‘i]] at the [[University of Hawaii]] in Hilo, Hawaii. This extension made the Sagan Planet Walk the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''seminar''' is a form of [[academic]] instruction, either at an [[academic institution]] or offered by a commercial or professional organization.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate. This is often accomplished through an ongoing [[Socratic method|Socratic dialogue]]&lt;ref&gt;Socratic Method-Problem Method Dichotomy: The Debate Over Teaching Method Continues, CG Hawkins-Leon. ''BYU Educ. &amp; LJ'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and [[debate]]s can be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Dialogic discussion and the siddharth seminar. L Billings, J Fitzgerald. ''American Educational Research Journal'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''seminar'' is derived from the Latin word ''seminarium'', meaning "seed plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Seminary |title= Seminary definition (dictionary.com)|accessdate= 2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

At North American [[university|universities]], the term "seminar" refers to a course of intense study relating to the student's major. Seminars typically have significantly fewer students per professor than normal courses, and are generally more specific in topic of study. Seminars can revolve around term papers, exams, presentations, and several other assignments. Seminars are almost always required for university graduation. Normally, participants must not be beginners in the field under discussion at US and Canadian universities. Seminar classes are generally reserved for upper-class students, although at UK and Australian universities seminars are often used for all years. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the [[methodology]] of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work.

In some European universities, a ''seminar'' may be a large lecture course, especially when conducted by a renowned thinker (regardless of the size of the audience or the scope of student participation in discussion). Some non-English speaking countries in Europe use the word ''seminar'' (e.g. German ''Seminar'', Slovenian ''seminar'', Polish ''seminarium'') to refer to a university class that includes a term paper or project, as opposed to a lecture class (e.g. German ''Vorlesung'', Slovenian ''predavanje'', Polish ''wykład''). This does not correspond to English use of the term. In some academic institutions, typically in scientific fields, the term "preceptorial" is used interchangeably with "seminar".&lt;ref&gt;A consideration of preceptorial medical education in the United States. WS Wiggins. ''Academic Medicine'', 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2001/outline8_2001.html "The Nature of Time--Cosmology Seminar" Sommers, Aaron]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''seminar'' is also used to describe a research talk, often given by a visiting researcher and primarily attended by academics, research staff, and postgraduate students. Seminars often occur in regular series, but each seminar is typically given by a different speaker, on a topic of that speaker's choosing. Such seminars are not usually a part of a course of study and are therefore not usually associated with any assessment or credit. The term ''colloquium'' is often used interchangeably with seminar in this sense.

'''Shared Lives''', which is also known as '''Adult Placement''' in some areas, is a UK form of support and accommodation for adults with need wherein approved individuals or families open their lives to aid older or [[disability|disabled]] persons.

Over 10,000 Shared Lives carers in the UK provided care to people with a wide range of disabilities, illnesses and support needs, including people with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], people with [[mental disorder|mental health problems]], older people, care leavers (government [[Ward (law)|ward]]s aging out of care), disabled children becoming young adults, parents with learning disabilities and their children, and [[ex-offender]]s. Shared Lives carers are recruited, trained, approved, monitored and paid by one of the UK’s 150 regulated Shared Lives schemes.

The goal of Shared Lives is to match the individuals in need of service with others who will be compatible to them to act as 'extended family'. While generally the individual in need of support will move into the home of the carer, sometimes service is provided in their own homes, as day support, as breaks for unpaid family carers, as home from hospital care and as a stepping stone for someone who wants to get their own place.

==Users==
According to a [[Care Quality Commission]] report for 2009-2010, more than 10,788 people in England used Shared Lives. While the Care Quality Commission showed minor increases from the prior year, [[Information Centre]] statistics collated through different methodology showed a 36% increase in the same period. 13% of users were over 65, with the vast majority (76%) consisting of persons between 18 and 64 with learning disability. Mental health problems (7%) and physical disabilities (3%) were less represented.

Use of Shared Lives is also increasing in Wales, with a 30% rise to 303 households in 2008-2009,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} while use in Scotland doubled between 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alzscot.org/download-file/index.php?file=dis72.pdf | title = Dementia in Scotland | publisher = Alzheimer Scotland | format=PDF | date = April 2011 | accessdate = 6 May 2012 | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Shared Lives Schemes in the UK are regulated under:

== Shared Lives Plus ==
Shared Lives Plus ([http://www.sharedlivesplus.org.uk www.sharedlivesplus.org.uk]) is the UK network for family-based and small-scale ways of supporting adults to live independently and to contribute to their families and communities. Its members are Shared Lives carers and workers, [[Homeshare]] programmes and micro-enterprises, which include a range of very small community-based services that share adult placement values and ethos.

[[NHS England]] announced the allocation of £1.75 million to support to 6 to 10 [[Clinical commissioning group]]s to develop Shared Lives schemes which:

* Help to move people with learning disabilities out of medical institutions
* Offer live-in mental health support instead of hospital treatment
* Provide ‘step down’ services for people who have had health crises
* Support people with dementia

Shared Lives Plus is to support this programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to bankroll development of Shared Lives support for adults in England|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2016/04/14/nhs-bankroll-development-shared-lives-support-adults-england/|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=Community Care|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slovak [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Commission]] was created in 1994 by a treaty between the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia Country Profile|url=http://cies.org/country/slovak%20republic.htm|accessdate=10 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317002002/http://www.cies.org/country/slovak%20republic.htm|archivedate=17 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a non-profit organization based in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  The Fulbright Commission aims to foster mutual cultural understanding through educational exchange between the United States and the Slovak Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovak Republic|url=http://fulbright.state.gov/fulbright/regionscountries/whereare/europe-and-eurasia/slovak-republic|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this, Fulbright helps students, scholars and professionals interested in studying abroad in the United States or Slovakia through its scholarship programs, fellowship programs,  and its [[EducationUSA]] advising center.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  Since the formation of the Commission, over 180 American students and scholars have studied in Slovakia while over 220 Slovak students and scholars have studied in the United States.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

== Scholarship and Fellowship Opportunities in the Slovak Republic ==

The Slovak Fulbright Commission offers many opportunities for study, research and English Teaching for U.S. students in [[Slovakia]].

=== Fulbright U.S. Student Program ===

The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers fellowships for U.S. graduating college seniors, graduate students, young professionals, and artists to study abroad for one academic year.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovak Republic|url=http://fulbright.state.gov/fulbright/regionscountries/whereare/europe-and-eurasia/slovak-republic#grants|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2012-2013 academic year, only two grants per year are available under this program.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovak Republic|url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/112|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to receive full consideration for a fellowship, students must have knowledge of the Slovak language commensurate with their proposed project, a letter of affiliation from a Slovak host institution, and a completed application including three letters of recommendation.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;

=== Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship Program (ETA) ===

The Fulbright ETA Program, an element of the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, places U.S. students as English teaching assistants in schools or universities overseas, thus improving foreign students’ English language abilities and knowledge of the United States while increasing their own language skills and knowledge of the host country.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt;  ETAs may also pursue individual study/research plans in addition to their teaching responsibilities.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt; For the 2012-2013 application cycle, 19 applications were received for 8 ETA positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETA Grant Applications|url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/news_story.html?id=122#&amp;panel1-2|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program ===

The Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program sends American scholars and professionals abroad to lecture and/or conduct research in a wide variety of academic and professional fields.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt;

== Opportunities for Slovak Citizens in the U.S. ==

There are many opportunities available for Slovak students and scholars within the United States. For students, 
The Fulbright Foreign Student Program enables graduate students, young professionals, and artists from abroad to research and study in the United States for one year or longer.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt; For scholars, available programs include 
the Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program, the Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence Program (SIR) and the Fulbright European Union Scholar-in-Residence (EUSIR) Program.&lt;ref name="bare_url_b" /&gt;

== EducationUSA Advising Center ==

The Slovak Fulbright Commission also hosts an EducationUSA Advising Center at its location in central Bratislava. [[EducationUSA]] is a global network of more than 400 advising centers supported by the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] at the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EducationUSA|url=http://educationusa.state.gov/|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bratislava, the center provides individual admissions and test preparation consulting for students, including free library and computer access.&lt;ref name="bare_url_c"&gt;{{cite web|title=EducationUSA Bratislava|url=http://www.educationusa.info/Fulbright-Bratislava|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advising center also organizes presentations and seminars on study opportunities in the U.S. for Slovak high school and university students as well as representatives of Slovak academia.&lt;ref name="bare_url_c" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3022">'''Tiv Ol''' was a [[Cambodia]]n teacher and communist politician. Tiv Ol joined the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea|Khmer People's Revolutionary Party]] (which later evolved into the Workers Party of Kampuchea/Communist Party of Kampuchea) in autumn 1959.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tiv Ol was the leading figure in a grouping of radical teachers on [[Phnom Penh]].&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 1963, Tiv Ol was included in the list of 34 'subversive' leftists, published by [[Prince Sihanouk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 202, 242&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of 1965-1967 Tiv Ol also a prominent member of the [[Khmer-Chinese Friendship Association]].&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arkiv"&gt;http://www.marxistarkiv.se/indokina/kambodja/kiernan-kampucheas_kp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the Tiv Ol-led group of leftist teachers began to shift to the countryside, to escape state repression. Tiv Ol himself left the capital in November 1967, and made his way to the clandestine CPK Party Centre. [[Vorn Vet]] later claimed to have been the organizer of this exodus.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;

Around 1970, Tiv Ol was appointed the chief of the CPK party organization in [[Kratié (city)|Kratie]]. After communist forces took control over the area, Tiv Ol organized the re-opening of the local school and hospital as well as initiating some [[agrarian reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiv Ol, like others in the CPK Eastern Zone, represented a sector within the party which held ambivalent views on the relation between Vietnamese and Cambodian communists. In 1973 Tiv Ol expressed that Vietnam was an ally of the Cambodian liberation, but an unreliable ally. In 1974 Tiv Ol visited [[Hanoi]]. During his stay in Hanoi, he wrote a poem saluting [[Indochina|Indochinese]] unity. The poem was published in a Vietnamese magazine. It is said that the publication had angered [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Tiv Ol fell victim of a purge of the core of the Khmer-Chinese Friendship Association. He was arrested on June 6, and later executed.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arkiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiernan, Ben]]. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. [[London]]: Verso, 1985. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tiv Ol was married to Leng Sim Hak, a fellow teacher.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

One of the proponents and sponsors of [[Romanian nationalism]] in [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s [[Bessarabia Governorate]], as well as among the Romanian communities of [[Austria-Hungary]], he was also a champion of self-help and of [[cooperative farming]]. He inherited or purchased large estates, progressively dividing them among local peasants, while setting up local schools and churches for their use. An erudite and traveler, he abandoned his career in law to focus on his agricultural projects and cultural activism. For the latter work, he became an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]].

Having backed the nationalist papers ''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'' and ''[[Cuvânt Moldovenesc (newspaper)|Cuvânt Moldovenesc]]'', Stroescu was drawn into the more elitist cell of the nationalist movement, centered on the parts of the ''[[zemstva]]'' and [[gentry assembly]]. He was thus honorary president of the [[National Moldavian Party]] shortly after the [[February Revolution]] but, with [[Vladimir Hertza]], drifted away from the core of the movement to set up his own aristocratic branch. He became an absentee member of ''[[Sfatul Țării]]'' during the existence of a [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] and its [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Romania]]. In 1919–1920, he served in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and was for a few weeks its [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|''de facto'' President]]. Rallying with the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]], Stroescu became critical of the unification process, decrying government abuses in Bessarabia, and also objected to the [[Land reform in Romania|1920s land reform]]. He died shortly after in [[Bucharest]], having also served in the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], and was granted a [[state funeral]].

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
The Stroescus were a family of ethnic Romanian aristocrats and shepherds from [[Moldavia]]: the family patriarch Ioan Stroescu had the Moldavian [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] title of ''[[jitnicer]]'' in the late 17th century. His grandson, Gavriil, was a ''[[șătrar]]''; Ienache, Gavriil's son, reverted to pastoralism, and owned ranches in [[Iași County]].&lt;ref name="bezv163"&gt;Bezviconi (1943), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; His own two sons Vasile (1795–1875) and Ioan moved between Moldavia and Bessarabia, which, following the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|1812 Treaty of Bucharest]], had been absorbed into the Russian Empire. Vasile owned ten estates on either side of the border, split between Iași and [[Hotin County|Hotin]] counties. The Stroescus were all inducted into [[Russian nobility]] in 1828 and [[Grant of arms|granted arms]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi (1943), pp. 69, 163&lt;/ref&gt; From his marriage to Profira Manoil Guțu (1808–1856), Vasile Sr had three sons—Mihail (1836–1889), Gheorghe (1840–1922), Vasile Jr.&lt;ref name="bezv163"/&gt; The couple also had four daughters, married off to aristocrats of Russian, [[Greeks in Moldova|Greek]], or [[Poles in Moldova|Polish Bessarabian]] descent: Ana Kazimir, Maria Druganov, Elena Martos, and Ecaterina Șumanski.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi (1943), pp. 108, 123, 133, 163&lt;/ref&gt; The latter's husband was [[Clemente Șumanski]], [[Mayor of Chișinău|Mayor of Kishinev]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="bezv163"/&gt;

Vasile Jr was born on November 11, 1845, in [[Trinca, Edineţ|Trinca]], a Hotin County village (now in [[Edineț District]], [[Moldova]]). He attended the Bessarabian Lyceum of [[Chișinău|Kishinev]], then the school of [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamenets-Podolskiy]] and [[Odessa]]'s [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Later, he studied law at the universities of [[Moscow State University|Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]], and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]].&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, p. 23; Constantin (2010), p. 240; Iliev, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The latter awarded him a [[doctorate of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Iliev, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; An erudite, Stroiescu reportedly spoke all Slavic languages, German, French, English and Italian, in addition to his native Romanian.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; Upon graduation, he traveled throughout Europe, including in the [[Kingdom of Romania]], and also visited the Western colonies in Africa.&lt;ref name="icpântea240"&gt;Constantin (2010), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; This was a passion shared by his older brother Mihail, who was once shipwrecked in the Pacific, and later wrote memoirs of his adventures.&lt;ref&gt;Colesnic, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasile was appointed a judge at the [[Khotyn|Hotin]] city tribunal in 1867,&lt;ref&gt;Basciani, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; becoming colleagues with writer [[Alexandru Hâjdeu]].&lt;ref name="icpântea240"/&gt; Following his father's death, he withdrew from the legal profession altogether, making [[Brînzeni]] his main residence.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; There, he began his trade as a gentleman farmer, peasant educator, and amateur agronomist, while maintaining a lively interest in historical research.&lt;ref name="icpântea240"/&gt; After receiving his inheritance, Stroescu owned 9,000 [[hectare]]s (22,000 [[acre]]s), but later came to purchase 16,000 more hectares (some 4,000 acres) of land, with several manors, ranches, and stables,&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; making him one of the richest people in the region.&lt;ref name="b&amp;b23"&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his properties he auctioned off, using the money to finance his philanthropy, or divided between the peasant ''[[Obshchina|obshchiny]]'', with Stroescu as a pioneer of [[cooperative farming]] and cooperative forestry.&lt;ref name="icpântea240"/&gt; He personally verified his plowmen's techniques and corrected their mistakes. As noted by Brînzeni native [[Ion Buzdugan]], he was "modest and balanced", but also "ruthless with those who squandered his wealth."&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; Fellow activist [[Pan Halippa]] noted that Stroescu was a "real democrat" and "true Christian", who "never married and lived modestly." "This man", Halippa claims, "used his great managerial competence to please those living on his estate. He [...] helped everyone own a proper home grange, acting a statesman ought to. [...] If only those ministers who call themselves democrats and socialists could know how the great Bessarabian Romanian Vasile Stroescu used to live!"&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; By 1918, Stroescu only had some 8,000 hectares left to his name, spread about between Trinca, [[Bădragii Vechi]], [[Pociumbeni|Druța]] and [[Zăbriceni]].&lt;ref name="clark296"&gt;Clark, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist sponsor===
As noted by historian [[Iurie Colesnic]], Stroescu and [[Nicolae Ștefan Casso]] stood among those boyars who reverted [[Russification]] or [[Moldovenism]], "neutralizing the influence" of pro-imperial adversaries such as [[Alexander N. Krupensky]].&lt;ref&gt;Colesnic, pp. 573, 576–577&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu built of refurbished several schools in Bessarabia, founded hospitals in his native village and in [[Brătușeni]], and became ''[[ktitor]]'' of [[Metropolis of Bessarabia|Bessarabian Orthodox]] churches in Trinca, [[Pociumbăuți]], [[Șofrîncani]], and [[Zăicani]].&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icpântea240"/&gt; In 1899, he offered to sponsor state schools, provided that they be allowed to teach classes in Romanian. This proposal was simply disregarded by government.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; With the liberalization made possible by the [[Revolution of 1905]], Stroescu began participating in conspiratorial meetings of the Romanian elite in Kishinev, exchanging ideas with Halippa, [[Nicolae Alexandri]], [[Ion Inculeț]], [[Nicolae Bivol]], [[Alexis Nour]], [[Ion Pelivan]], and [[Paul Gore (historian)|Paul Gore]], where they first discussed the prospect of Romania and Bessarabia uniting.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 82–83, 85&lt;/ref&gt; As Pelivan notes, he and [[Emanuil Gavriliță]] tried to persuade Stroescu to finance a magazine for the Romanian-speaking populace, but the landowner "seemed rather skeptical".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1906 he sponsored Halippa in setting up a democratic-and-nationalist newspaper, ''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'', eventually shut down by the Russian authorities in March 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 14–15; Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 42–43, 354, 600–601. See also Rutkowski, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910, Stroescu had expatriated himself to Switzerland, and was living in [[Davos Platz]].&lt;ref name="unirea1410"/&gt; His charity work continued to have a profound effect among the Romanian communities of [[Transylvania]], in [[Austria-Hungary]], where Stroescu notably founded the boarding house serving the [[Archdiocese of Arad|Diocese of Arad]], as well as "tens of churches, schools and hospitals".&lt;ref name="bezv163"/&gt; Although a patron of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]], he was critical of the church's claim to have preserved Romanian identity, noting that its nationalist discourse was a recent "invention of the parsons, to emphasize their own merits".&lt;ref&gt;Rom., "''Cultele în România''", in ''Glasul Minorităților'', Nr. 7–9/1925, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He saw Orthodoxy as equal to its rival [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]], arguing that "a religious difference cannot divide us", since "Romanians of both religions behave one to the other as true Christians and therefore as brethren".&lt;ref name="unirea1410"/&gt; As such, in 1910 Stroescu allied himself with the Greek Catholics to tackle the effects of [[Magyarization]], donating 100,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] to the cultural fund in [[Blaj]].&lt;ref name="unirea1410"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stan, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

Other estimates suggest that his sponsorship of schools, including Orthodox ones, ran at 950,000 Kronen in 1913—500,000 of these were channeled through [[Partenie Cosma]],&lt;ref&gt;Ilie, pp. 253, 255. See also Andruș, pp. 589–590&lt;/ref&gt; and 200,000 more through the [[Archdiocese of Sibiu|Archbishopric of Sibiu]], while 100,000 went to the creation of a girls' school in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, p. 26. See also Stan, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution also included a Stroescu Fund at [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]] and various payments to the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbur, p. 162. See also Andruș, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; In Romanian-ruled [[Western Moldavia]], he fitted primary schools from a special fund, which ran at 200,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]], and, in 1906–1908, put up 300,000 lei for the building of a [[Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, p. 26; Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michailu V. Stroesco.png|thumb|250px|Stroescu's brother (and fellow philanthropist) Mihail Vasilievici]]
In May 1910, as recognition of his activities, and in particular for his work with the Blaj foundations, Stroescu was elected an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]]. This appointment left him indifferent, as he considered his deeds "only natural".&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; He declared himself "at my country's disposal, with all this mind God gave me, from all my heart and with my entire wealth".&lt;ref name="dglb162"&gt;Galbur, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; According to Halippa and Pelivan, his focus fell on Transylvania and elsewhere only because censorship and repression prevented him from openly financing nationalism in his native province.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), p. 183; Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 77, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Another account is that he was felt called into action by the anti-Magyarization writings of [[Ioan Slavici]].&lt;ref name="b&amp;b24"&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, his philanthropic activity was preceded by that of his late brother Mihail, who, as early as 1882, had set up ten model schools in Romania-proper, after having failed to create a Romanian studies department at [[Odessa University|Novorossiya University]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 111, 122, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted for founding a school in [[Stolniceni, Edineț|Stolniceni]],&lt;ref name="bezv163"/&gt; Mihail had set up a rural hospital at Bekir, eventually splitting his wealth between ASTRA, the Romanian vocational schools of [[Brașov]], and his tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 122, 159, 263, 278. See also Andruș, pp. 588–589&lt;/ref&gt;

The family's renewed contributions have led various authors to refer to Vasile as Transylvania or Bessarabia's "[[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]".&lt;ref name="unirea1410"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andruș, p. 589; Bezviconi (1943), p. 163; Colesnic, p. 573; Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 14, 16, 87; Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 513; Iliev, p. 255; Suveică, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvanians such as [[Justinian Teculescu]] dedicated him verse of praise; others believed that he was not a real man, but a fictional character created by the Romanian state to hide its direct involvement in Austro-Hungarian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Stan, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu also sponsored individual Bessarabians to pursue their education abroad, as he did with physician and fellow Romanian nationalist [[Elena Alistar]],&lt;ref&gt;Basciani, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and founded an eponymous Stroescu Help Club for the [[Romanian Americans]] of [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbur, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Between June 1910 and August 1911, he paid for Nour to publish a Russian-language paper, ''Bessarabets'',&lt;ref&gt;Ion Constantin, "Alexis Nour, agent al Ohranei", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 2011, p. 30. See also Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; and, after 1913, financed the newspaper ''[[Cuvânt Moldovenesc (newspaper)|Cuvânt Moldovenesc]]'', published by Halippa and Alexandri,&lt;ref&gt;Ciobanu, p. 66; Constantin (2010), p. 216; Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 16, 151, 183, 290; Rutkowski, p. 140. See also Basciani, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; also helping peasants with their subscriptions.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;

By 1912, Stroescu was living in [[Lausanne]], but still appeared incognito to celebrate the golden jubilee of [[Petru Maior]] Society in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vasile de Stroescu a participat incognito la serbările jubiliare ale societății 'Petru Maior'. Douăsprezece mii de coroane societății 'Petru Maior'", in ''Românul (Arad)'', Nr. 93/1912, p. 3. See also Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 512–513&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was expressing his disenchantment with his Transylvanian colleagues. His letters to his fund's beneficiaries often included "drastic reprimands."&lt;ref name="b&amp;b24"/&gt; In early 1913, he published a piece in the newspaper ''Românul'' of Arad, attacking Romanian banks for paying [[dividend]]s higher than 5%, and their clients for accepting them; the difference, he argued, could go toward sponsoring culture. Responding to this "judicious and unusually categorical" critique, the economist Ion Mateiu suggested that the reduction demanded by Stroescu was needlessly abrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Mateiu, "Soarta școalelor noastre. Constatări și propuneri", in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 9/1913, pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu, who donated 50,000 Kronen to settling disputes between ASTRA and the popular banks, and then to the creation of alternative [[credit union]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Șandru, "Cooperația română de credit până la Marea Unire", in ''Buletin Științific'', Vol. 16, 2007, pp. 87, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; found sympathy with the writing team at ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', which basked in his critique of "our petty bourgeoisie [and] its plutocratic ideals".&lt;ref&gt;"Însemnări. Articolul d-lui Stroescu", in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 9/1913, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Through ASTRA, he also distributed his brochure ''Statutele și îndrumările pentru băncile poporale'' ("Statutes and Guiding for the People's Banks").&lt;ref&gt;Bârseanu &amp; Simu, pp. 561–562&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bihar County]] bankers objected to such initiatives, seeing Stroescu as an unfair competitor to their business.&lt;ref name="roand590"&gt;Andruș, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution and union===
By 1914, Stroescu's relations with the Austro-Hungarian authorities were noticeably strained. His sponsoring of a Christmas 1913 folk party in [[Beiuș]] almost ended with the prosecution of its organizer, Nicolae Coroiu.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Moisa, "Între mica și marea istorie. Nicolae Coroiu: un destin sub vremurile primului război mondial", in ''Revista Crisia'', Vol. 45, Issue 1, 2015, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of World War I caught Stroescu on the Russian side, ending all his work in Transylvania; the government of [[István Tisza]] listed him as a "public menace", suspected of wanting to incite a Romanian rebellion in Transylvania.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; He returned to Odessa in 1914, and managed to persuade the authorities to release his protegée Alistar, who had been arrested for sedition.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 168, 344, 608&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1916, Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entered the war]], siding with Russia against Austria-Hungary and the other [[Central Powers]]. Following the [[February Revolution]], which inaugurated an episode of social rebellion and national emancipation throughout Russia, the Stroescus were targeted by Russian revolutionaries. Gheorghe's former manor in [[Bălceana]] was ransacked by deserters from the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Front]], who burned down his manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Colesnic, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; and so were other country homes owned by the family.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The Brânzeni estate was spared: the peasants there, having already set up a network for trafficking Romanian books into Bessarabia,&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; also formed a self-defense unit which protected their shared wealth.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;

Vasile was at [[Soroca]], where he signed a manifesto for Bessarabian self-determination, officially backed by the ''[[zemstvo]]'' and the [[gentry assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciobanu, pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt; He then took part in the establishment of Bessarabia's own [[National Moldavian Party]] (PNM), formed on {{OldStyleDate|March 30|1917|March 17}}. This came only after protracted negotiations with a Transylvanian refugee, [[Onisifor Ghibu]], who was perplexed that Bessarabians "hardly understood the importance of having a political party [...] that would militate for the national cause." Stroescu held on to an apolitical stance, replying that "he was ready to give as much as he had, but only for cultural enterprises, because politics, he said, was a dirty activity."&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Petrescu, "Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans", in [[Balázs Trencsény]], Dragoș Petrescu, Cristina Petrescu, Constantin Iordachi, Zoltán Kántor (eds.), ''Nation-Building and Contested Identities: Romanian and Hungarian Case Studies'', p. 169. Budapest &amp; Iași: Regio Books &amp; [[Polirom]], 2001. {{ISBN|963-00-8714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Kishinev in early 1917, he met the Transylvanian activist Hortensia Goga, who described him as "healthy and content, [...] seems not to be preoccupied by anything except his own person."&lt;ref&gt;Mihai M. Drecin, "Russian Images and Impressions in the Correspondence Between the Refugee Hortensia Cosma-Goga and Octavian Goga (January–April 1917)", in Ioan Bolovan, Rudolf Gräf, Harald Heppner, Oana Mihaela Tămaș (eds.), ''World War I – The Other Face of the War'', p. 146. Cluj-Napoca: Romanian Academy Centre for Transylvanian Studies &amp; Presa Universitară Clujeană, 2016.  {{ISBN|978-606-8694-61-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the PNM, representing the more right-wing and nationalist politicians in the Governorate, proposed Bessarabian autonomy and the creation of a national legislature, ''[[Sfatul Țării]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Basciani, pp. 78–79; Clark, pp. 131–134; Rutkowski, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu, as the "Grand Old Man" of nationalism, was the PNM's honorary leader, with Paul Gore as the executive president and Halippa as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 133. See also Basciani, p. 78; Ciobanu, pp. 69–70; Constantin (2010), p. 240; Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 16–17, 107; Rutkowski, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he and Halippa attended the Soldiers' Congress in Odessa, which affirmed its support for "autonomous Bessarabia" and a federated [[Russian Republic]]. The uniformed procession paid him homage by parading in front of London Hotel, where he was staying.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 86–87. See also Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 513–514&lt;/ref&gt; In June of the same year, as the gentry assembly formed a Society for Assisting Popular Education and the Study of National Customs, Stroescu became honorary chairman; Gore and [[Vladimir Hertza]] were its "active presidents".&lt;ref&gt;Colesnic, pp. 576–577&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[October Revolution]] and Russia's disintegration, ''Sfatul Țării'' was established and Stroescu nominally stood in the [[Sfatul Țării election, 1917|regional election]]. At the time, Pelivan argues, Stroescu was "a great nationalist, but less of a democrat", and alienated from his constituents because "(since 1900) he lived mostly abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Halippa, Stroescu and Hertza were trying to set up a distinct PNM for the boyars: "their action did not lead to much [...], although we revolutionaries never objected to them being elected to ''Sfatul Țării'' [...], since we believed that all intellectual forces needed to be consulted in political matters".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Charles Upson Clark]] claims that he even served for a while as the legislature's president,&lt;ref name="clark296"/&gt; during Bessarabia's brief existence as a nominally independent [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]]. However, Stroescu is known to have been seriously ill from September 1917 to the early months of 1919, leaving for England and France, and only championed the [[union of Bessarabia with Romania]] from afar.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;

In March 1918, when ''Sfatul Țării'' was visited by the [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Prime Minister]] [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] and voted in favor of union, Stroescu was in Paris. This was an uncertain period, with him in [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory while Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|capitulated to the Central Powers]]. At the time, Stroescu wrote his will, with Pelivan as his [[executor]]. It called for redistributing his land (much of it already taken over by the ''zemstvo''), or, alternatively, donating it to the Romanian state; in exchange, he only demanded that peasants receive education in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 296–297; Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 123, 160&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1927 by Clark, this document reflected the "comfortable old Russian patriarchal atmosphere", and was already outdated by the pace of "militant equalization"—although the dream of Romanian education was eventually fulfilled by the state itself, with its mandatory literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly President and dissenter===
On September 1, 1918, returning to Paris, Stroescu joined [[Vasile Lucaciu]] and [[Ioan Cantacuzino]] in creating a National Romanian Action Committee for promoting the cause of [[Greater Romania]] in Allied countries.&lt;ref name="comitfig"/&gt; He later attached himself to [[Take Ionescu]]'s National Committee for Romanian Unity.&lt;ref name="b&amp;b23"/&gt; Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November Armistice]], Marghiloman was deposed and Romania, Bessarabia included, reentered the war. In December, this step ensured the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Transylvanian union]], with the new borders awaiting international recognition at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Throughout the following months, to Marghiloman's worry, Western powers seemed to favor placing Bessarabia, in whole or in part, under a [[League of Nations mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, pp. 322–323&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian general election, 1919|national election of November 1919]], Halippa enlisted Stroescu as a candidate for his [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] (PȚB), which resulted in him representing [[Orhei County (Romania)|Orhei County]] in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]. Stroescu shared his ticket with historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], although the latter was not a PȚB man.&lt;ref&gt;Suveică, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; As recalled by Halippa, he ran simultaneously (and won) in three other electoral precincts—Hotin, [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca]], and [[Bălți County (Romania)|Bălți]];&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to other sources, also in [[Tighina County (Romania)|Tighina County]] and [[Lăpușna County (Romania)|Lăpușna]].&lt;ref name="dglb162"/&gt;

On November 20,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 268; Marghiloman, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; as an homage to his work in promoting the Romanian cause,&lt;ref&gt;Suveică, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu was also selected to preside upon Greater Romania's first parliamentary session, effectively as the Assembly's honorary [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|President]]. Praised by Iorga for its composition and style,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; the speech forewarned: "With a habit that has become second-nature, we scour the scene to find ways in which we may partake in the fruit of other people's labor. No, Gentlemen, this will no loger do! We must labor ourselves and commit to providing for ourselves. [...] In this life of ours we must maintain clean thoughts and clean hands."&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; This drew attention from Marghiloman's [[Progressive Conservative Party (Romania)|Progressive Conservatives]], disgraced for their sympathy for the Central Powers. Marghiloman was drawn to Stroescu's anti-corruption hints, namely that "the new administrations of Bessarabia should keep their hands clean."&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, pp. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt;

Replaced within a few months by Iorga, Stroescu had also become a critic of the Romanian administration, speaking at the Assembly rostrum about the deteriorating situation of his native province and the [[state of siege]] it was placed under. On February 10, 1920, he took a stand against [[Ion Inculeț]], the PȚB Minister for Bessarabia, accusing him of tolerating "oppression in savage fashion", and concluding, to his colleagues' dismay, that "the situation was better under the old Russian régime."&lt;ref&gt;''The Roumanian Occupation...'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; This pitted him against the mainstream of his party, and also against Iorga. Despite shows of support from the [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]] benches and some PȚB deputies, Iorga suspended the session, accusing Stroescu of having "insult[ed] all the past and the future of the nation"; he was supported in this by Marghiloman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Roumanian Occupation...'', pp. 191, 193, 207&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary, Iorga summarized the incident: "Stroescu insulted from the rostrum this country as one of exploiters and awful clerks. I asked him to step down."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroescu was also censured by Inculeț, who dismissed his speech as "café gossip" and a landowner's malcontent,&lt;ref&gt;''The Roumanian Occupation...'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Bessarabian gentry as a whole reacted with "profound egotism" to [[Land reform in Romania|the proposed land reform]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Chasles, "La Succession de Russie", in ''Revue des Sciences Politiques'', Vol. XLV, January–March 1922, pp. 584–585&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Stroescu's position was endorsed by the daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', which referred to Inculeț as a "[[satrap]]" who simply ignored criticism, and called Iorga's moderating stance "absurd diplomacy". The paper also denounced Inculeț's suggestion that those dissatisfied with his administration, Stroescu included, could opt to move to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Roumanian Occupation...'', pp. 191–195&lt;/ref&gt; In March, according to the same Iorga, Stroescu voted "discreetly" against land reform, and then spoke out against the majority of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historians Sorina and Ioan Bolovan, "Stroescu kept apart from the demagoguery, careerism and pettiness of political intrigues."&lt;ref name="b&amp;b23"/&gt; In August 1923, partly as a protest against government arbitrariness, he participated in the founding of a League for Human Rights, with such members as [[Constantin Costa-Foru]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]], [[Victor Eftimiu]], [[Grigore Iunian]], [[Ioan Pangal]], [[Istrate Micescu]], [[Ilie Moscovici]], [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], [[Radu D. Rosetti]], and [[Ștefan Voitec]]. He was elected its first president, with Costa-Foru serving as his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], ''Socialismul în România. 1835 – 6 septembrie 1940'', pp. 382–386. Bucharest: Dacia Traiana, [n. y.]&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of government was followed with interest in [[White émigré]] circles, where it was believed that a restored Russian monarchy should include Bessarabia. On their behalf, [[Alexander N. Krupensky]] suggested that Stroescu, "an honest man in spite of his accepting to be 'elected' by the Roumanian Government as one of the Bessarabian deputies", openly spoke on topics that Iorga and other establishment politicians wanted kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;''The Roumanian Occupation...'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet Russia, which advanced its own claim to Bessarabia, propagandist [[Christian Rakovsky]] also used Stroescu's words against Romanian nationalist claims in his 1925 exposé, ''Rumynia i Bessarabia''.&lt;ref&gt;Suveică, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
With his final donation of land, Stroescu renounced his manor in Brînzeni to set up an agricultural and technical school.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; His prewar fund for ASTRA's public libraries, comprising 25,000 Kronen in 1914,&lt;ref name="roand590"/&gt; was supplemented by the [[Directory Council of Transylvania|Transylvania's Directing Council]] and put to use in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Bârseanu &amp; Simu, pp. 560, 578&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death in [[Bucharest]] on April 14, 1926, Stroescu served in [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], representing a Transylvanian constituency.&lt;ref name="icpântea240"/&gt; His funeral service was held on April 17 at the Orthodox White Church on [[Calea Victoriei]], and witnessed orations by priest [[Ioan Lupaș]], who was also the incumbent [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Minister of Health]], and by [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch]] [[Miron Cristea]]; the following day, a [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] was held at [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu|Sibiu Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, pp. 24–25, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroescu was awarded a [[state funeral]] at [[Bucharest]]'s Sfânta Vineri Cemetery.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi (1943), p. 163; Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, pp. 26–27; Constantin (2010), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb there was later decorated with a bust by the Moldavian [[Mihai Onofrei]],&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', pp. 33, 260. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and a Bucharest street was renamed after him.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; The funeral itself was attended by his former colleague and rival Iorga. He noted delegates of all those who had been helped by the deceased—the church, the Bessarabian Peasantists, and the nationalists—but also that the establishment itself was absent. In his obituary, Iorga referred to Stroescu as a "great charitable man and generous benefactor".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Oameni cari au fost'', Vol. III, p. 215. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Other obituaries appeared during the following week. They included front-page editorials in ''[[Universul]]'', ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', ''[[Telegraful Român]]'', ''Cuvântul Ardealului'' and (penned by Ghibu) ''Biruința'', with additional coverage in ASTRA's ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bolovan &amp; Bolovan, pp. 24–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroescu's activity was first explored methodically in an essay by Alexandru Ciulcu, published by ''[[Viața Basarabiei]]'' magazine in 1940. Just months later, Bessarabia fell under a [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]], during which Ciulcu himself was killed by the [[NKVD]].&lt;ref&gt;Colesnic, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Stroescu's memory was repressed in the resulting [[Moldavian SSR]] and, later, in [[Communist Romania]]. Nationalized, the Brînzeni manor was turned into a psychiatric clinic.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; During the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1960s, Halippa and the Bessarabian community in Bucharest tried to commemorate their former leader, but were reportedly prevented to do so by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1968, Halippa managed to invoke Stroescu and bring up the issue of his being "forgotten", with a formal address to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Negrei (2009), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; Such work was partly continued in America by a nephew of Stroescu's, the journalist Gheorghe Ștefan Donev (1909–1993).&lt;ref name="dglb162"/&gt;

The repressive trend was reversed following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]: in 2013, a [[Palace of the Parliament]] hall was renamed in his honor,&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt; but, as historian Sever Dumitrașcu noted, no Transylvanian school once funded by his money ever accepted to acknowledge him in the same fashion.&lt;ref name="mi256"&gt;Iliev, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; In independent [[Moldova]], the lyceum in Brînzeni took his name.&lt;ref name="mi256"/&gt; A Moldovan Vasile Stroescu Foundation was created, a memorial plaque was put up in 1996 at Trinca, and efforts have been made to establish a memorial house in Brînzeni.&lt;ref name="ipboier"/&gt;

Supporters wear purple to celebrate diversity and young people from the LGBTIQA+ community.

The Day is organised by Wear it Purple, a student run, not-for-profit organisation, providing presentations and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.nswtf.org.au/august-5-2013/features-2/workshops-support-wear-it-purple-day/|title=Workshops to support Wear it Purple Day|website=education.nswtf.org.au|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is celebrated on the last Friday in August each year in Australia and was launched in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/sexuality/agenda/article/2016/08/23/wear-it-purple-support-rainbow-youth-why-we-all-should-take-part|title=Wear it Purple to support rainbow youth: why we all should take part|newspaper=Topics|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-10-15/campaign-launched-to-support-gay-youth/2299240|title=Campaign launched to support gay youth|date=2010-10-15|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous years have celebrated the day in September or October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/new-south-wales-news/wearing-success-with-pride/32847|title=Wearing success with pride - Star Observer|website=www.starobserver.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was co-founded by Katherine Hudson and Scott Williams,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourworld.anz.com/global-cultures/katherine-hudson|title=Inspiring locals - Katherine Hudson|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Hudson was in high school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=LGBTI activist on show|last=Drapalski|first=Megan|date=6 July 2016|work=Wentworth Courier|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Williams was in the first year of university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/queer-young-thing/4914376|title=Queer young things wearing purple|last=Adler|first=Dylan|date=29 August 2013|work=ABC Life Matters|last2=Ellis|first2=Jayde|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.2ser.com/component/k2/item/5010-wear-it-purple-day|title=Wear It Purple Day - 2SER - Real Radio 107.3 FM|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson graduated from [[Burwood Girls High School]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Purple reigns in Burwood|last=Barr|first=Eliza|date=1 September 2015|work=Inner West Courier|dead-url=|access-date=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later a site of controversy due to the Wear it Purple Day events involving screening the [[Gayby Baby]] film.

Wear it Purple Day was created in response to the suicide of New Jersey teen [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/feature/wear-it-purple-empowering-rainbow-youth-11770.html|title=Wear it purple: empowering rainbow youth|last=Busby|first=Cec|date=25 August 2013|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2017|work=Gay News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolism ===
Hudson states that she ''“...saw purple as a way of bringing people together from all different backgrounds and creating one thing…a symbol of unity..."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Williams found that working with Wear it Purple has given him a more positive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/marriage-equality-about-human-dignity|title=Marriage equality is about human dignity|date=2016-09-06|newspaper=Green Left Weekly|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alleged "rainbow hijacking" at Kambala School ====

In the time since the ban, some school leaders have supported Wear it Purple Day, but shied away from having their school featured in a press release about the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Jane|last2=Gardiner|first2=Veronica|year=June 2016|title=Supporting gender and sexual diversity in high schools: building conversations for LGBTQI human rights in the English classroom|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/32105/1/supporting%20gender%20and%20sexual%20diversity%20in%20high%20schools.pdf|journal=|publisher=Murdoch University Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre|volume=|pages=4|isbn=978-1-921877-16-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gayby Baby film (2015) ===
{{Main|Gayby Baby}}
Film director Maya Newell offered Gayby Baby to be screened in schools ahead of the film's official release for Wear it Purple Day 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/30/maya-newell-2015-gayby-baby-we-learned-some-things-need-to-get-ugly-for-change|title=Maya Newell on 2015 and Gayby Baby: 'We learned some things need to get ugly for change'|last=Tan|first=Monica|date=2015-12-29|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Producer Charlotte Mars noted that the hybrid-cinema release and school screenings linked with their faith that Australian independent films can make a lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Short cuts|last=Maddox|first=Garry|date=6 August 2015|work=The Age|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newell presented an event about the film at her alumnus, Burwood Girls High School (also attended by co-founder of Wear it Purple Day, Katherine Hudson). Up to 50 Australian schools including 20 in NSW had organised a simultaneous broadcast of the film on Wear it Purple Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Schools hit with film ban|last=Bagshaw|first=Eryk|date=27 August 2015|work=Newcastle Herald|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the film received a NSW statewide ban by Education Minister [[Adrian Piccoli]], even though he had not viewed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baird, Piccoli cut same sex movie without watching it|last=Bagshaw|first=Eryk|date=28 August 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to ban screenings was condemned and labelled as "cruel rubbish" by [[Daniel Andrews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Daniel Andrews attacks NSW government over Gayby Baby 'rubbish'|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=27 August 2015|work=The Guardian|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Victorian State Premier). [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] (then an Australian Human Rights Commissioner) said that while ''"Wearing a colour one day a year probably seems trite. But, for the students privately dealing with issues around their sexual orientation or gender identity, it is a beacon of hope. Without a word being mentioned it sends a clear message that there are people who support you."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gays and parents both have rights|last=Wilson|first=Tim|date=27 August 2015|work=Daily Telegraph|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's ban resulted in extensive news coverage and protests to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/gayby-baby-formal-protests-over-school-screening-had-reached-mike-bairds-office/news-story/d649eb89fe247da6f38eefcdd21305d1|title=Gayby Baby formal protests over school screening had reachec Mike Baird's office|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=31 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greens Member for Newtown [[Jenny Leong]] said that the positive initiative of the film screening should not be blocked, and suggested the ban was in response to the headlines in the Daily Telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lotl.com/News/Greens-slam-Piccolis-Gayby-Baby-ban-593/|title=Greens slam Piccoli’s ‘Gayby Baby’ ban|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Khan]] countered that rather than being a ban of the film, it was an "opt-out arrangement" with the option to screen the film during non-lesson times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A "ban" on the showing in NSW public schools of a documentary|last=|first=|date=28 August 2015|work=Northern Daily Leader|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wear it Purple Day co-founder Katherine Hudson told ABC radio that although the Wear it Purple Day campaign had received support from the Government over the years, that in a sense, the ban deligitimized the Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-27/blocking-film-about-same-sex-parents-shows/6728056|title=Blocking film about same-sex parents shows intolerance|last=Edwards|first=Michael|date=27 August 2015|website=ABC Australia|publisher=ABC|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prefects of Burwood Girls High School issued a statement on their Facebook page reiterating their dismay at the media coverage, and their support for equality and acceptance for all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/burwood-girls-high-school-prefects-penny-sharpe-and-jodi-mckay-respond-to-gayby-baby-backlash/news-story/2bcff8761472c9565fa0c6702f592f71?sv=7885adad42a006899d6a8058bf498821|title=Burwood Girls High School prefects, Penny Sharpe and Jodi McKay respond to Gayby Baby backlash|last=Barr|first=Eliza|date=28 August 2015|work=Inner West Courier|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2017|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the original planned time of the film's screening, Burwood Girls students continued with usual school subjects, but protested by wearing purple pom-poms in their hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Purple rain: true colours shine after ban|last=Bagshaw|first=Eryk|date=29 August 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Baird]] (New South Wales State Premier) stated that the ban was not about the film's content, but focused on Burwood Girls High School using classtime to show the film for Wear it Purple Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-03/mike-baird-very-distressed-over-gayby-baby-furore/6747650|title=Mike Baird 'very distressed' over Gayby Baby furore|date=2015-09-03|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Schools barred from showing gay film|last=|first=|date=28 August 2015|work=China Daily|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Brenna Harding]] has said that ''"...the message of Wear It Purple — of support to young LGBTI people and kids with same-sex parents — was in danger of being drowned out..."'' by the banning of the film [[Gayby Baby]] and associated events at some Australian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/puberty-blues-star-slams-gayby-baby-school-ban/140320|title=Puberty Blues star raised by lesbian mums slams Gayby Baby school "ban" - Star Observer|website=Star Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Penny Wong]] similarly stated that Wear it Purple Day was designed to show LGBTI young people that they are supported, but that rather than addressing bullying, people reverted to sensationalist controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2F4040288%22|title=Transcript of interview with Laura Jayes: Sky News To the Point: 27 August 2015: China-Australia Free Trade Agreement; Gayby Baby; marriage equality; Tony Abbott's royal commission|last=Jayes|first=Laura|date=27 August 2015|website=Parliament of Australia Information|publisher=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the NSW Government asked film producer Charlotte Mars to amend text in a promotional email, regarding the wording around their support for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/gayby-baby|title=Banned "Gayby Baby" Film To Be Shown In Schools|last=Reporter|first=Lane Sainty BuzzFeed News|last2=Australia|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Volume of complaints ====

Documents later obtained under freedom of information laws showed that the Department of Premier and Cabinet received 55 congratulatory messages on the ban, which were outnumbered by 85 complaints about the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/gayby-baby-complaints-against-ban-outnumber-complaints-against-film-20151104-gkqesx.html|title=Gayby Baby: Complaints against ban outnumber complaints against film|last=Bagshaw|first=Eryk|date=2015-11-04|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend Mark Powell alleged that the Wear it Purple Day organisation was operating against the Education Department guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3211310/Education-Minister-Adrian-Piccoli-steps-stop-public-schools-NSW-showing-gay-parenting-documentary-parents-Burwood-Girls-High-School-complained.html|title=Minister steps in to stop ALL NSW schools showing gay parenting doco|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the volume of complaints was not recorded accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Purple has become the colour of thought control|last=Powell|first=Mark|date=3 September 2015|work=Daily Telegraph|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Department initially advised reporters at The Guardian that they had not received complaints,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/26/sydney-school-received-no-complaints-from-parents-about-gayby-baby-film?CMP=soc_567|title=Sydney school received no complaints from parents about Gayby Baby film|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2015-08-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later recanted on this statement to reporters at The Daily Telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Parents objected to gay film's screening|last=McDougall|first=Bruce|date=28 August 2015|work=Daily Telegraph|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Laundy]], whose electorate covers Burwood, stated that he had been inundated with calls from parents and community representatives, expressing concern about the planned film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gay film banned from state school classrooms|last=McDougall, Wood|first=Bruce, Alicia|date=27 August 2015|work=Daily Telegraph|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coffee shop signage (2015) ===
In 2015, [[Dubbo]] coffee shop owner Karen Payne has faced negativity from a customer for her business signage celebrating Wear It Purple Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/3351276/54-v-44-dubbo-business-owner-celebrating-the-end-of-an-error/|title=54 v 44 = :) : Dubbo business owner celebrating the 'end of an error'|last=RUMING|first=ORLANDER|date=2015-09-16|newspaper=Daily Liberal|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict from flyers (2012) ===
Students at Craigieburn Secondary College distributed supportive flyers for Wear it Purple Day in 2012, as part of Craigieburn's Same-Sex Attracted Friendly Environment (SSAFE) group. A teacher confiscated and removed some of the flyers, and a student was verbally supported by a peer. The school removed the flyers from the walls, but Principal Julie Robertson stated that this was because the group had not sought permission for the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Conflict over gay 'flyers'|last=Zevenbergen|first=Stephanie|date=18 September 2012|work=Hume Weekly|dead-url=|via=Factiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official website blocking (2010) ===
After the Wear it Purple website was launched in December 2010, the Department of Education and Training filter blocked it from being viewed on Government school computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lotl.com/News/Wear-it-Purple-launches-website/|title=Wear it Purple launches website|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1616">{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}[[Image:Woodenologo.png|right|thumb|158px|Logo]]The '''Wooden O Symposium''' is a cross disciplinary conference exploring Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Studies, through the study and performance of the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. Scholars from many disciplines present papers that offer insights and new ideas springing from the era of William Shakespeare.   His plays are replete with the language, thoughts and arts of the Renaissance and Western culture and represent an inexhaustible source for creative ideas and research.

==Shakespeare Study==
The symposium is hosted by [[Southern Utah University]], home of the Tony Award-winning [[Utah Shakespearean Festival]]. A major focus of the scholarly event is the interface between scholarship and performance and how the pursuit of one area can enrich and inform the other.

The Festival is noted for the Adams Memorial Theater, a beautiful open air performance space modeled after Shakespeare's own [[Globe Theatre]], the original "[[wooden O]]."

==Schedule==
This academic conference takes place every year in [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], [[Utah]] and runs the first Monday through Wednesday of August.
