On 27 August 2017, [[Beachy Head]] and beaches including [[Birling Gap]], in the English county of [[East Sussex]] were evacuated following a suspected chemical leak. Visitors reported ill effects after the appearance of a "mist", and  233 people were treated at Eastbourne General Hospital, initially with a full chemical decontamination.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel|last=Roberts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/beachy-head-chemical-incident-chlorine-suspected-leak-stinging-bank-holiday-a7915721.html|title=Police investigate suspected 'chemical incident' at Beachy Head after 50 people complain of stinging eyes and throats|publisher=Independent Print Limited|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 August 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827215804/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/beachy-head-chemical-incident-chlorine-suspected-leak-stinging-bank-holiday-a7915721.html|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-41070002|title=Birling Gap beach: 150 treated after chemical 'mist'|date=28 August 2017|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827233842/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-41070002|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses reported that no matter how many times they washed their eyes, they were stinging and drying up regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beach evacuated as toxic mist blows in|last=Adams|first=Callum|work=The Times|date=28 August 2017|page=7|issue=72313|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst it was unclear what the gas actually was, [[chlorine]] was blamed initially. [[East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service]] stated that "due to the symptoms and situation described", the gas was unlikely to be chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/29/investigators-believe-toxic-cloud-on-sussex-coast-came-from-ship|title=Toxic cloud on Sussex coast may have come from ship, say sources|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=29 August 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829185125/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/29/investigators-believe-toxic-cloud-on-sussex-coast-came-from-ship|archivedate=29 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous chemical emission clouds have drifted across from industrial units in Northern France, however, the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA) have stated that in this incident such a scenario was unlikely due to weather models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birling Gap beach: Shipwreck 'could be to blame for mist'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-41130937|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=BBC News|date=1 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902005140/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-41130937|archivedate=2 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCA said that one line of investigation was a possible leak from a disturbed shipwreck, with the [[SS Mira (UK ship)|SS ''Mira'']], a 3,700-tonne [[World War I|First World War]] armed tanker sunk by a German mine on 11 October 1917, suggested as one potential source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7953">'''The Al Baydha Project''', in rural, [[Hejaz|western Saudi Arabia]], is a [[land restoration]], poverty-alleviation, and heritage preservation program, based on principles of [[permaculture|permacultural]] and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|hydrological]] design.  Located roughly 50 kilometers (20 miles) south of [[Mecca]], in [[Makkah Province]], Al Baydha is an area characterized by the rocky, arid, [[foothills]] of the [[Hijaz Mountains]]. [[Bedouin]] tribes are the major residents of this region.&lt;ref&gt;https://permacultureglobal.org/projects/286-al-baydha-project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2010/11/18/permaculture-in-mecca/|title=Permaculture in Mecca - The Permaculture Research Institute|date=18 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2009, and led by permaculturist Neal Spackman&lt;ref&gt;http://permacultureglobal.org/users/1234-neal-spackman&lt;/ref&gt; and Co-Founder Mona Hamdy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_8EfVXP1KE|title=In Dialogue with: Mona Hamdy @ NOVUS 2016|first=|last=kharecom|date=23 January 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thnk.org/people-of-thnk/person/mona-hamdy/|title=Mona Hamdy - THNK School of Creative Leadership|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Baydha has begun to see practical and [[restoration ecology|ecological]] results ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it4ru0HvrfE shown here]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2011/01/14/permaculture-at-the-al-baydha-project-in-saudi-arabia-neal-spackman-video-1/|title=Permaculture at the Al-Baydha Project in Saudi Arabia - Neal Spackman, Video 1 - The Permaculture Research Institute|date=14 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, Al Baydha's emphasis is on creating an economy for the inhabitants of Al Baydha that is socially, culturally, environmentally, and economically sustainable. The project's main objective is to create financial and social independence for the inhabitants by training, educating and employing them in the infrastructure and capacity building activities undertaken by the Al Baydha Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wondros.com/5d/albaydha/&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Baydha's environmental goal is the reversal of desertification. This is accomplished largely via [[rainwater harvesting]], through utilization of rock [[terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] and [[gabion]]s (or small [[check dam]]s), as well as catchment of [[surface runoff|runoff]] into [[swale (landform)|swale]] lines.  These support [[afforestation]] of [[drought tolerance|drought-resistant]] trees, such as [[date palm]]s, in the [[natural landscape]].  Another focus of the program is on slowing down [[flash flood]]s in the highlands, and, over time, converting them into seasonal streams or [[wadi]]s, as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdlI-7HO2vI shown here].  In the long-term future, Al Baydha hopes to transform the region into a [[savanna|savanna ecosystem]], in part, by means of [[assisted natural regeneration]], [[conservation grazing]], and the effects of [[evapotranspiration]] and atmospheric [[moisture recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2012/11/09/planting-days-are-here-al-baydha-saudi-arabia/|title=Planting Days Are Here!

In 2016, the Al Baydha Project received a commendation from HRH Prince [[Khaled Al Faisal]] for innovative work undertaken by the inhabitants of Al Baydha as a model of national excellence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qREss_eycV0|title=لقاء الامير خالد الفيصل في برنامج المختصر|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in humanitarianism, sustainability, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.net/ar/programs/mbc-news/articles/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88--%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%87---%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B0.html|title=الرئيسية - MBC.net|website=www.mbc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Wadi Rum Consultancy|similar project]], overseen by permaculturist [[Geoff Lawton]] (who advised on the design of Al Baydha), has already achieved success in [[Wadi Rum]], in southern [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2014/02/01/desert-oasis-4-years-jordan/|title=From Desert to Oasis in 4 Years|date=1 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astragalus hamosus MHNT.BOT.2007.40.117.jpg|thumb|''Astragalus hamosus'' - [[MHNT]]]]

'''''Astragalus''''' is a large genus of about 4,200 species of [[herb]]s and small [[shrub]]s, belonging to the [[legume]] family [[Fabaceae]] and the [[subfamily]] [[Faboideae]]. It is the [[List of the largest genera of flowering plants|largest genus of plants in terms of described species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/4135449 |jstor=4135449 |title=History and Concepts of Big Plant Genera |journal=Taxon |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=753–76 |year=2004 |last1=Frodin |first1=David G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genus is native to temperate regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Common names include '''milkvetch''' (most species), '''[[locoweed]]''' (in North America, some species)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootcellar.us/wildflowers/astrag.htm |title=''Astragalus'' (Locoweed) flowers |publisher=Rootcellar.us |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''goat's-thorn''' (''A. gummifer'', ''A. tragacanthus''). Some pale-flowered [[Vicia|vetches]] are similar in appearance, but vetches are more [[vine]]-like.

==Ecology==
''Astragalus'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including many case-bearing moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''[[coleophora cartilaginella|C. cartilaginella]]'', ''[[coleophora colutella|C. colutella]]'', ''[[coleophora euryaula|C. euryaula]]'', and ''[[Coleophora onobrychiella|C. onobrychiella]]'' feed exclusively on ''Astragalus'', ''[[coleophora astragalella|C. astragalella]]'' and ''[[coleophora gallipennella|C. gallipennella]]'' feed exclusively on the species ''[[Astragalus glycyphyllos]]'', and ''[[coleophora hippodromica|C. hippodromica]]'' is limited to ''[[Astragalus gombo]]''.

==Traditional uses==
The natural gum [[tragacanth]] is made from several species of ''Astragalus'' occurring in the [[Middle East]], including ''A. adscendens'', ''A. gummifer'', ''[[Astragalus brachycalyx|A. brachycalyx]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Astragalus+membranaceus ''Astragalus membranaceus'' - Moench]. Plants for a Future.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRIN"&gt;{{GRIN|id=433295|name=''Astragalus brachycalyx'' Fisch.|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A. tragacanthus''.  Also ''[[Astragalus propinquus]]'' (syn. ''A. membranaceus'') has a history of use as a [[herbal medicine]] used in systems of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/astragalus-000223.htm |title=''Astragalus'' &amp;#124; University of Maryland Medical Center |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Persian medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Zargary, A. Medicinal plants. 5th Edition.Tehran: Tehran University Publications 1990; pp.&amp;nbsp;312–314.&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional Chinese medicine A. membranaceus has been used to reinforce [[qi]] and strengthen the superficial resistance, and promote the discharge of pus and the growth of new tissue.&lt;ref name=pmid25083916&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2014.07.018 |pmid=25083916 |pmc=4212005 |title=Natural product agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ): A review |journal=Biochemical Pharmacology |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=73–89 |year=2014 |last1=Wang |first1=Limei |last2=Waltenberger |first2=Birgit |last3=Pferschy-Wenzig |first3=Eva-Maria |last4=Blunder |first4=Martina |last5=Liu |first5=Xin |last6=Malainer |first6=Clemens |last7=Blazevic |first7=Tina |last8=Schwaiger |first8=Stefan |last9=Rollinger |first9=Judith M |last10=Heiss |first10=Elke H |last11=Schuster |first11=Daniela |last12=Kopp |first12=Brigitte |last13=Bauer |first13=Rudolf |last14=Stuppner |first14=Hermann |last15=Dirsch |first15=Verena M |last16=Atanasov |first16=Atanas G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Biotechnology firms are working on deriving a [[telomerase]] activator from ''Astragalus''. The chemical constituent [[cycloastragenol]] (also called TAT2) is being studied to help combat [[HIV]], as well as infections associated with chronic diseases or aging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/01/01/Herbal_chemical_helps_combat_HIV/UPI-75921230846928/ |title=Herbal chemical helps combat HIV |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |publisher=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Institutes of Health]] states: "The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that astragalus, either alone or in combination with other herbs, may have potential benefits for the immune system, heart, and liver, and as an adjunctive therapy for cancer".&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;[http://nccih.nih.gov/health/astragalus/ Astragalus], [[NCCAM]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the UCLA AIDS Institute focused on the function of cycloastragenol in the aging process of immune cells, and its effects on the cells' response to viral infections. It appears to increase the production of [[telomerase]], an enzyme that mediates the replacement of short bits of DNA known as [[telomere]]s, which play a key role in cell replication, including in cancer processes.&lt;ref name=pmid18981163&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.181.10.7400 |pmid=18981163 |pmc=2682219 |title=Telomerase-Based Pharmacologic Enhancement of Antiviral Function of Human CD8+ T Lymphocytes |journal=The Journal of Immunology |volume=181 |issue=10 |pages=7400–6 |year=2008 |last1=Fauce |first1=S. R |last2=Jamieson |first2=B. D |last3=Chin |first3=A. C |last4=Mitsuyasu |first4=R. T |last5=Parish |first5=S. T |last6=Ng |first6=H. L |last7=Ramirez Kitchen |first7=C. M |last8=Yang |first8=O. O |last9=Harley |first9=C. B |last10=Effros |first10=R. B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplement use==
Extracts of ''[[Astragalus propinquus]]'' ( syn. ''A. membranaceus'') are marketed as life-prolonging extracts for human use. A proprietary extract of the dried root of ''A. membranaceus'', called [[TA-65]], "was associated with a significant age-reversal effect in the immune system, in that it led to declines in the percentage of senescent cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells after six to twelve months of use".&lt;ref name=pmid20822369&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2010.1085 |pmid=20822369 |pmc=3045570 |title=A Natural Product Telomerase Activator As Part of a Health Maintenance Program |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=45–56 |year=2011 |last1=Harley |first1=Calvin B |last2=Liu |first2=Weimin |last3=Blasco |first3=Maria |last4=Vera |first4=Elsa |last5=Andrews |first5=William H |last6=Briggs |first6=Laura A |last7=Raffaele |first7=Joseph M }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are mixed data regarding ''Astragalus'', its effects on telomerase, and cancer. For example, although 80% of cancer cells utilize telomerase for their proliferation—a factor that might theoretically be exacerbated by ''Astragalus''—the shortening of telomeres (resulting from such factors as stress and aging and possible contributors to malignancy) might also be mitigated by ''Astragalus''. Thus, short telomeres result in chromosome instability, and the potential for telomere lengthening as a protection against cancer is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-879-9_7 |chapter=Role of Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer |title=Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer |pages=171–80 |year=2009 |last1=Hiyama |first1=Keiko |last2=Hiyama |first2=Eiso |last3=Tanimoto |first3=Keiji |last4=Nishiyama |first4=Masahiko |isbn=978-1-60327-306-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, scientists recently reported that cancer cells may proliferate precisely because of the lack of differentiation occurring via damaged or shortened telomere length. They propose that "forced" elongation of telomeres promotes the differentiation of cancer cells, probably reducing malignancy, which is strongly associated with a loss of cell differentiation.

==Side effects and toxicology==
''Astragalus'' may interact with medications that suppress the [[immune system]], such as [[cyclophosphamide]].&lt;ref name=NCCAM/&gt; It may also affect [[blood sugar]] levels and [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=NCCAM/&gt; Some ''Astragalus'' species can be toxic. For example, several species native to North America contain the [[alkaloid]] [[swainsonine]], which may cause "locoism" in livestock.&lt;ref name=NCCAM/&gt; The toxicity of ''Astragalus'' taxa varies.&lt;ref name=arpt&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1573(199709)11:6&lt;411::AID-PTR132&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |title=A review of the pharmacology and toxicology of ''Astragalus'' |journal=Phytotherapy Research |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=411–8 |year=1997 |last1=Rios |first1=J. L |last2=Waterman |first2=P. G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ornamental use==
Several species, including ''A. alpinus'' (bluish-purple flowers), ''A. hypoglottis'' (purple flowers), and ''A. lotoides'', are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s in gardens.

A '''backwater valve''' is a [[backflow prevention device]] used to prevent outbound water through a dwelling's drain pipes from re-entering -- "[[Backflow|back flowing]]"—into a home. The valve contains a flap that allows water to exit the home, but closes to prevent  the back flow into the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.ca/residents/Sewers-Flooding/Basement-Flooding-Causes/Pages/Backwater-Valve.aspx|title=Backwater Valve|website=www.london.ca|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backwater valves commonly activate when a city's sewer lines are unable to handle a large amount of falling precipitation; this puts homes that are tied into the storm lines at risk of having water back flow into them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is A Backwater Valve?|url=http://www.absolutedp.com/2016/what-is-a-backwater-valve|publisher=Absolute Draining &amp; Plumbing|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a big difference between backwater valves and backflow preventers:

* A backwater valve prevents raw [[sewage]] from backing up into your home through your [[toilet]]s, [[shower]]s, etc.
* A [[backflow preventer]] deals with protecting a potable water source from being contaminated by a reverse flow of foul water (ex: isolating your toilet's flush cistern and water supply from the toilet bowl water itself).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13508">'''Bromelain''' is an [[enzyme]] extract derived from the [[plant stem|stem]]s of [[pineapple]]s, although it exists in all parts of the fresh plant and fruit. The extract has a history of [[folk medicine]] use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a [[meat tenderizer]].

The term "bromelain" may refer to either of two [[protease]] [[enzyme]]s extracted from the plants of the family [[Bromeliaceae]], or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.

Although tested in a variety of [[folk medicine]] and research models for its possible efficacy against diseases, the only approved [[clinical significance|clinical application]] for bromelain was issued in 2012 by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for a [[topical medication]] called ''[[NexoBrid]]'' used to remove dead tissue in severe skin [[burn]]s.&lt;ref name=nexobrid/&gt;

Bromelain extract is a mixture of protein-digesting (proteolytic) enzymes and several other substances in smaller quantities. The proteolytic enzymes are [[sulfhydryl]] proteases; a free sulfhydryl group of a [[cysteine]] [[amino acid]] [[side chain]] is required for function. The two main enzymes are:

* [[Stem bromelain]] – {{EC number|3.4.22.32}}
* [[Fruit bromelain]] – {{EC number|3.4.22.33}}

==History==
Pineapples have a long tradition as a medicinal plant among the natives of South and Central America. The first isolation of bromelain was recorded by the Venezuelan chemist Vicente Marcano in 1891 by [[fermentation in food processing|fermenting]] the fruit of pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Vicente Marcano (in Spanish) Quote from Google translate: "New theory about the phenomenon of fermentation": "See also the bromeliad (for Annana Bromelia L.) pineapple, which is responsible for many phenomena of fermentation of the fruit. This finding, while not making Marcano, was actually made by him, as later confirmed by Dr. RH Chittenden, of Yale University, who argues that "the bromeliad was discovered by a Venezuelan scholar named Vicente Marcano."| url=http://www.pdvsa.com/lexico/pioneros/marcano.htm| date=1997| publisher=Pioneers of Venezuela, PDVSA-Intevep| access-date=2007-03-04| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330052133/http://www.pdvsa.com/lexico/pioneros/marcano.htm| archive-date=2007-03-30| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, [[Russell Henry Chittenden]], assisted by [[Elliott P. Joslin]] and Frank Sherman Meara, investigated the matter more completely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chittenden | first1 = RH | first2 = Elliott P | last2 = Joslin | first3 = Frank Sherman | last3 = Meara | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VtNVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA281 | title = On the ferments contained in the juice of the pineapple (''Ananassa sativa''): together with some observations on the composition and proteolytic action of the juice|journal=Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=1892|volume=8|pages=281–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called it 'bromelin'. Later, the term 'bromelain' was introduced and originally  applied to any [[protease]] from any member of the plant family [[Bromeliaceae]].

==Sources==
Bromelain is present in all parts of the pineapple plant (''Ananas'' sp.),&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt; but the stem is the most common commercial source,&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbp/&gt; presumably because usable quantities are readily [[extract]]able after the fruit has been harvested.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;

==Production==
Produced mainly in parts of the world where pineapples are grown, such as [[Thailand]] or [[Malaysia]], bromelain is [[extraction (chemistry)|extracted]] from the peel, stem, leaves or waste of the pineapple plant after processing the fruit for juice or other purposes.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arshad ZI, Amid A, Yusof F, Jaswir I, Ahmad K, Loke SP | title = Bromelain: an overview of industrial application and purification strategies | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 98 | issue = 17 | pages = 7283–97 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24965557 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-014-5889-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fbp"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fbp.2011.12.006 |title=Pineapple wastes: A potential source for bromelain extraction |journal=Food and Bioproducts Processing |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=385–91 |year=2012 |last1=Ketnawa |first1=Sunantha |last2=Chaiwut |first2=Phanuphong |last3=Rawdkuen |first3=Saroat | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The starting material is blended and pressed through a filter to obtain a [[supernatant]] liquid containing the soluble bromelain enzyme.&lt;ref name=fbp/&gt; Further processing includes purification and concentration of the enzyme.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Other plant proteases==
Other plant proteases include [[papain]] (from the [[papaya]]), [[actinidin]] (from the [[kiwi fruit]]), and [[ficin]] (from the [[ficus|fig]]). --&gt;

==Temperature stability==
After an hour at 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F), 83% of the enzyme remains active, while at 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F), practically 100% remains active.&lt;ref name="Jutamongkon"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://kasetsartjournal.ku.ac.th/kuj_files/2010/A1010081847262467.pdf|title=Effect of Temperature on the Stability of Fruit Bromelain from Smooth Cayenne Pineapple|vauthors=Jutamongkon R, Charoenrein S|journal=Kasetsart Journal: Natural Science|volume=44|pages=943–8|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129015814/http://kasetsartjournal.ku.ac.th/kuj_files/2010/A1010081847262467.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8 minutes at &amp;nbsp;80&amp;nbsp;°C (176&amp;nbsp;°F) is sufficient to almost completely inactivate the enzyme.&lt;ref name="Jutamongkon" /&gt; The proteolytic activity of concentrated bromelain solutions remains relatively stable for at least 1 week at room temperature, with minimal inactivation by multiple freeze-thaw cycles or exposure to the digestive enzyme trypsin.&lt;ref name=pmid15710346&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale LP, Greer PK, Trinh CT, James CL | title = Proteinase activity and stability of natural bromelain preparations | journal = International Immunopharmacology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 783–93 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15710346 | doi = 10.1016/j.intimp.2004.12.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Meat tenderizing and other uses===
[[File:Durkee Seasoned Meat Tenderizer.jpg|thumb|right|A jar of Durkee meat tenderizer containing bromelain.]]
Along with [[papain]], bromelain is one of the most popular proteases to use for meat [[tenderizing]].&lt;ref name="jfst"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaurasiya RS, Sakhare PZ, Bhaskar N, Hebbar HU | title = Efficacy of reverse micellar extracted fruit bromelain in meat tenderization | journal = Journal of Food Science and Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 3870–80 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26028772 | pmc = 4444899 | doi = 10.1007/s13197-014-1454-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromelain is sold in a powdered form, which is combined with a [[marinade]], or directly sprinkled on the uncooked meat.&lt;ref name="jfst"/&gt;

Cooked or canned pineapple does not have a tenderizing effect, as the enzymes are [[Lability|heat-labile]] and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] in the cooking process. Some prepared meat products, such as meatballs and commercially available marinades, include pineapple and/or pineapple-derived ingredients.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;

Although the quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, specific [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] can yield sufficient quantities for [[home|domestic]] and industrial processing, including uses in [[baking]], [[browning (food process)|anti-browning]] of cut fruit, [[textiles]] and [[cosmetics]] manufacturing.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfst"/&gt;

===Potential medical uses===
{{Main|Bromelain (pharmacology)}}
{{See also|Proteases (medical and related uses)}}
A concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain is approved in Europe for the [[debridement]] (removal of dead tissue) of severe [[burn]] wounds under the trade name ''[[NexoBrid]]''.&lt;ref name="nexobrid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002246/human_med_001582.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 |title=NexoBrid: concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain |publisher=European Medicines Agency |date=January 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromelain has not been scientifically proven to be effective in treating any other diseases and it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of any disorder. In the United States, the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA, 1994) allows the sale of bromelain-containing dietary supplements even though efficacy has not been confirmed. Bromelain is a known [[allergen]].&lt;ref name=pmid14996077&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raison-Peyron N, Roulet A, Guillot B, Guilhou JJ | title = Bromelain: an unusual cause of allergic contact cheilitis | journal = Contact Dermatitis | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–9 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14996077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been studies which positively correlated the use of bromelain with reduction of symptom severity in osteoarthritis,&lt;ref name=pmid12587686&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker AF, Bundy R, Hicks SM, Middleton RW | title = Bromelain reduces mild acute knee pain and improves well-being in a dose-dependent fashion in an open study of otherwise healthy adults | journal = Phytomedicine | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 681–6 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12587686 | doi = 10.1078/094471102321621269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15710346"/&gt; "[t]he majority of the studies have methodological issues that make it difficult to draw definite conclusions", as none definitively established efficacy, recommended dosage, long term safety, or adverse interaction with other medications.&lt;ref name="ncbiReview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brien S, Lewith G, Walker A, Hicks SM, Middleton D | title = Bromelain as a Treatment for Osteoarthritis: a Review of Clinical Studies | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 251–257 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15841258 | pmc = 538506 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/neh035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

Bromelain may be useful as an antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory in the treatment of cardiovascular disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman B | title = Bromelain: an anti-inflammatory agent | journal = Angiology | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 508–10 | date = November 1962 | pmid = 13992714 | doi = 10.1177/000331976201301103 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/000331976201301103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent reviews on the topic suggest that it may have other beneficial properties for therapeutic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pavan R, Jain S, Kumar A | title = Properties and therapeutic application of bromelain: a review | journal = Biotechnology Research International | volume = 2012 | pages = 976203 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23304525 | pmc = 3529416 | doi = 10.1155/2012/976203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic enzyme therapy (consisting of combinations of proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain, trypsin, [[chymotrypsin]], and papain) has been investigated in Europe to evaluate the efficacy in breast, colorectal, and plasmacytoma cancer patients.&lt;ref name=pmid19116226&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beuth J | title = Proteolytic enzyme therapy in evidence-based complementary oncology: fact or fiction? | journal = Integrative Cancer Therapies | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–6 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19116226 | doi = 10.1177/1534735408327251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromelain may be effective as an [[adjunct therapy]] in relieving symptoms of acute [[rhinosinusitis]] in patients not treated with [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, US National Institutes of Health|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/bromelain|title=Bromelain|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17011407&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo R, Canter PH, Ernst E | title = Herbal medicines for the treatment of rhinosinusitis: a systematic review | journal = Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = 496–506 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17011407 | doi = 10.1016/j.otohns.2006.06.1254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromelain is also claimed as a tooth plaque removal enhancer in toothpastes.&lt;ref name="pmid24965557"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">[[File:Aqueduc chateau Maintenon.jpg|thumb|Remaining arches of the aqueduct through the gardens of the [[château de Maintenon]] (2012).]]

The '''Canal de l'Eure''', made necessary by the insufficient water supply for the [[Palace of Versailles|Château de Versailles]] and the water features of its [[Gardens of Versailles|gardens]], was designed for [[Louis XIV of France]] by his military engineer [[Vauban]], based on preliminary surveys by [[Philippe de La Hire]]. The population of the [[Versailles (city)|town of Versailles]] multiplied by a factor of ten during the first decade or so of the court's residence. Having exhausted all the nearer water sources, [[François-Michel le Tellier|Louvois]], at the king's command, organized the planning of this "'''Canal Louis XIV'''", which was never in fact intended to be navigable. Its length was over 80 kilometers.

Waters of the [[Eure]] were diverted somewhat downstream from [[Pontgouin]] and were led to the Etang de la Tour, today in the department of [[Yvelines]]. The ruinously expensive project, worked on from 1685 to 1690, was never completed. Passing through the gardens of the [[château de Maintenon]], purchased by [[Madame de Maintenon]] in 1675, its arches ranging in three colossal tiers, nevertheless seemed to [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] "a work worthy of the Caesars".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, tr.,''The Memoirs of François René Châteaubriant'' 1902:238&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3002">'''Cannabis in Luxembourg''' is illegal for recreational use, but possession of personal amounts is decriminalized and medical use has been legalized. Prosecution depends on the amount of cannabis one possesses. Since 2001, prison penalty has been substituted by a monetary fine ranging from 250 to 2,500 [[Euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2001/0611705/0611705.pdf#page=2 |work = Excerpt of the "Mémorial A" of the Luxembourgish legislation |title = Art. 7 and Art. 8 refer to the usage of narcotics }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Decriminalization==
In April 2001, Luxembourg updated its prior 1973 law, and reclassified cannabis as a Category B controlled substance, meriting only a fine for a first offense, effectively decriminalizing personal possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report on the State of the Drugs Problem in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTkcKtEEN5YC|year=2011|publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|isbn=978-92-9168-470-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bewley-Taylor2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David R.

In November 2018, the government announced that it will legalise the recreational use of cannabis, while an exact timetable has yet to be defined.&lt;ref&gt;https://luxtimes.lu/luxembourg/35768-cannabis-to-be-made-legal-for-recreational-use-in-luxembourg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical cannabis==
In November 2017, the Minister of Health announced a two-year pilot program under which Luxembourgers would be able to obtain cannabis extracts and cannabinoids for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lequotidien.lu/a-la-une/cannabis-medical-lexemple-de-lallemagne/ Cannabis médical : l'exemple de l'Allemagne&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://delano.lu/d/detail/news/cannabis-medicinal-purposes-pilot-project/160906 Cannabis for medicinal purposes pilot project - Delano - Luxembourg in English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, lawmakers unanimously approved a bill to legalize the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pritchard |first1=Heledd |title=Cannabis for medical use legalised in Luxembourg |url=https://luxtimes.lu/luxembourg/34274-cannabis-for-medical-use-legalised-in-luxembourg |accessdate=July 8, 2018 |work=Luxembourg Times |date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Avinash |title=Luxembourg Is Latest EU Country to Legalise Medical Cannabis |url=https://www.talkingdrugs.org/luxembourg-is-latest-eu-country-to-legalise-medical-cannabis |accessdate=July 8, 2018 |work=Talking Drugs |date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cannabis is listed as one of the agricultural products of Yemen during the [[Rasulid dynasty]] (1229-1454).&lt;ref name="Mackintosh-Smith2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Mackintosh-Smith|title=Yemen: The Unknown Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2QjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT151|date=3 June 2014|publisher=The Overlook Press|isbn=978-1-4683-0998-0|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6011">'''Care Opinion''', formerly Patient Opinion, is a not for profit organisation founded by Dr Paul Hodgkin in 2005 which offers patients an opportunity to offer feedback about their experience of health and social care. It is based in [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five minutes with ... the founder of Patient Opinion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/dec/13/paul-hodgkin-founder-patient-opinion|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There are similar organisations in Australia and Ireland.  It changed its name in April 2017.

It is largely, but not exclusively, web based. Organisations which subscribe to the service pay for feedback directed to appropriate places in their organisation.  There are no charges to patients. Subscribing organisations are chiefly part of the [[National Health Service]]. It  is now used by over 90% of [[NHS trust]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choose your Best Health and Social Care Product or Service|url=http://www.digitalbydefaultnews.co.uk/2015/05/22/choose-your-best-health-and-social-care-product-or-service/|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Digital by default news|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the Scottish government, which encouraged health boards to engage with the website with £160,000 funding in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patient Opinion website for rating NHS care endorsed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21836067|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=BBC|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It offer patients opportunities:
*to give feedback on their health services
*to easily see what others are saying
For health care providers it enables them: 
*to hear – and respond to – patient concerns and thank-yous
*to compare their ratings with others

When compared with other feedback mechanisms in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], such as the [[Friends and Family Test]] it offers much more detailed information, and the potential for dialogue, as organisations are encouraged to respond to patient stories, take action where necessary, and report back on what was done. About two thirds of stories receive a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Munro|first1=James|title=How the NHS should listen and act on patient complaints|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/nov/05/nhs-listen-act-patient-complaints|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the advantage of being independent.

In 2006 about 1,500 opinions and ratings were posted on the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Munro|first1=James|title=Patient Opinion|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/democracy-involvement-and-accountability-in-health/the-new-deal-on-patient-and-public-involvement/patient-opinion/|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, during the debate about the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] the organisation analysed the 11,000 accounts of healthcare experiences posted on the site over the previous five years focused on the most critical postings to find where patients felt the NHS needs to improve.  Staff attitudes generated the biggest criticism. Only 3% perceived ‘choice of provider’ as a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Lansley listen to Patient Opinion?|url=http://leftfootforward.org/2011/03/will-andrew-lansley-listen-to-patient-opinion/|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Left Foot Forward|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All [[NHS Scotland#Health Boards|Scottish health boards]] respond to experiences shared on the website and since it was introduced in 2011, more than 100 changes have been made to services across Scotland in response to this feedback including changes to facilities, signage and food services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More funding announced to contribute to improving the NHS|url=http://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2015/04/more-funding-announced-to-contribute-to-improving-the-nhs/|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=Edinburgh Reporter|date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a system of ‘tag bubbles’ which enable searches of the data linked to particular aspects of care.  This revealed that patients had high opinions of physiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Physios come out top on Patient Opinion|url=http://www.csp.org.uk/news/2016/07/22/physios-come-out-top-patient-opinion|accessdate=5 May 2017|publisher=Chartered Society of Physiotherapy|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the BBC’s [[Newsnight]] programme found half of 100 reviews of the [[Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust]] on Patient Opinion had been written by staff. The trust claimed that staff were writing on behalf of vulnerable patients – such as the elderly or those with learning difficulties – who would otherwise have been unable to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Staff pretended to be patients in reviews of their own hospitals: NHS workers caught giving five-star ratings and positive feedback on websites |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2584854/Staff-pretended-patients-reviews-hospitals-NHS-workers-caught-giving-five-star-ratings-positive-feedback-websites.html|accessdate=16 June 2015|publisher=Daily Mail|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Society for Quality and Safety in Healthcare is operating a similar website which in its first five weeks received 27 detailed stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New patient experience website ‘could save money for the health service’|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/new-patient-experience-website-could-save-money-for-the-health-service-282943.html|accessdate=16 June 2015|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Concetta M. Tomaino, D.A., MT-BC, LCAT''' (born July 30, 1954), is a music therapist in the field of [[music therapy]] for individuals suffering the effects of [[stroke]] or other [[brain trauma]] or are afflicted with such degenerative neurological diseases as [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]] or [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]]. Tomaino is the executive director and co-founder of the [[Institute for Music and Neurologic Function]] and senior vice president for music therapy at [[CenterLight Health System]], formerly Beth Abraham Family of Health Services.

== Biography ==
Born and raised in [[New York City]] (the daughter of a green-grocer and what was then called a [['stay-at-home' Mom]]),  Concetta Tomaino made her connection to music early, adopting the [[trumpet]] as her instrument of choice (as it remains to this day, though it is joined by the [[piano]] and [[accordion]], her main choice for therapy).  The first girl in her family to attend college, Concetta enrolled at Long Island’s [[Stony Brook University]] in 1972 as a biology major, but, by her junior year, a continuing passion for music moved her to change her major to music.

Forming a synaptic-like connection between music and medicine, Concetta turned her energies to [[music therapy]], creating independent study courses because there was no music therapy program at Stony Brook.  Concetta Tomaino graduated from [[Stony Brook University]] in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance and minors in psychology and sciences and an abiding interest in the emerging field of music therapy.

By 1980, Concetta Tomaino had joined Beth Abraham as the only music therapist (then part of the facilities department of recreation) and began to notice patients in the dementia unit responding positively and in some cases with remarkable speed, to music.  She delved deeper into the neurological underpinnings as it became clear that music therapy had more to offer patients than a mere diversion from their everyday existence.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:sacks tomaino.jpg|thumb|Dr. Concetta M. Tomaino, world-renowned neurologist and author Dr. Oliver Sacks, and actor Dustin Hoffman at the 2006 Music Has Power Awards presented by the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function.]] --&gt;It was at Beth Abraham in 1980 that she became acquainted with the eminent and acclaimed visiting neurologist in long-term care, Dr. [[Oliver Sacks]].  The author of a breakthrough book called “[[Awakenings]]” (later made into a movie starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Robin Williams]]), Tomaino found a valuable ally in Dr. Sacks when it came to championing the benefits of music therapy.  Indeed, in his newest book “[[Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain]]” (Knopf, 2007) Dr. Sacks recounts case-examples of their long collaboration, adding that Connie Tomaino "has been my co-worker and adviser in all matters musical for more than twenty-five years.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;"

In addition to her  contributions with Dr. Sacks (including his 1995 volume [[An Anthropologist on Mars]]), Dr. Tomaino’s work has been featured in such other books as A Matter of Dignity by Andrew Potok, [[The Mozart Effect]] by Don Campbell, Sounds of Healing by Mitchell Gaynor, M.D. and Age Protectors (Rodale Press) and covered by television programs and networks as the BBC and such CBS News’ staples as 60 Minutes and 48 Hours.

Concetta Tomaino earned a Masters and Doctor of Arts in Music Therapy from [[New York University]] in 1998.

== Awards and affiliations ==
A past president of the American Association for Music Therapy, Dr. Tomaino is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, most notably the Award of Accomplishment from Music Therapists for Peace at the United Nations; the Touchstone Award from the organization Women In Music, and the Zella Bronfman Butler Award (from the UJA-Federation of New York and the J.E. and Z.B. Butler Foundation) for “outstanding work on behalf of individuals with physical, developmental or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozart-science.at/index.php?id=76&amp;det=1&amp;p_id=291&amp;from_id=&amp;L=1 Mozart &amp; Science 2006 Speakers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071108191852/http://www.mozart-science.at/index.php?id=76&amp;det=1&amp;p_id=291&amp;from_id=&amp;L=1 |date=2007-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; " She was honored with the Music Has Power Award in 2004 for her outstanding contributions to the field of music therapy and for her vision, leadership, research, and service to the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function.&lt;ref&gt;Past Music Has Power Honorees, Institute for Music and Neurologic Function {{cite web |url=http://www.bethabe.org/Past_MHP_Honorees187.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217103359/http://www.bethabe.org/Past_MHP_Honorees187.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 America.gov, the website of the [[U.S. Department of State]]’s Bureau of International Information Programs, listed Dr. Tomaino as one of the innovators that help reshape reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amlife.america.gov/amlife/innovation/innovators.html Innovators Help Reshape Reality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303214710/http://amlife.america.gov/amlife/innovation/innovators.html |date=2008-03-03 }}. America.gov. Retrieved on 2008-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her responsibilities as executive director of the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function and senior vice president for music therapy at Beth Abraham Family of Health Services, Dr. Tomaino is a member of the faculty of the Brookdale Center on Aging and the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] and serves on the visiting faculty of [[Berklee College of Music]] and [[Shenandoah University]].

Previously, she sat on the Certification Board of Music Therapists, the Journal of Music Therapy, and was a member of the advisory boards for the Center for Alternative Research at the Kessler Institute, and the International Journal of the Arts.  She was also a Super Panelist participant in the GRAMMY in the Schools program and worked as an adjunct clinical supervisor for several music therapy programs in the New York area.

== Other interests ==
Outside of music therapy  Dr. Tomaino enjoys spending time with her two daughters along with such leisurely pursuits as gardening, astronomy, painting (watercolors are the preferred medium) and performing in local symphonies and wind ensembles with her husband, music teacher and triple-threat brass player, Walter Barrett.

The '''Croatian Health Insurance Fund''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski zavod za zdravstveno osiguranje}} or '''HZZO''') is a [[quasi-public]] body that administers the [[universal health care]] system in [[Croatia]]. Established in 1993, the HZZO is the country's national social [[health insurance]] fund and its primary source of health financing. In 2017, 4.24 million people received health insurance coverage through HZZO.&lt;ref name="AR2017"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The HZZO is overseen by a director and a board of directors, appointed by the Croatian government on the recommendation of the [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Minister of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vončina |first1=Luca |last2=Džakula |first2=Aleksandar|last3=Mastilica |first3=Miroslav |year=2007 |title=Health care funding reforms in Croatia: a case of mistaken priorities |journal=Health Policy |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=144–157  |url=http://medlib.mef.hr/226/1/Voncina_L_et_al_Health_care_funding_rep_226.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2006.02.016}} p. 4. &lt;/ref&gt; These directors represent the insured population, the Ministry of Health, the [[Ministry of Finance (Croatia)|Ministry of Finance]] and independent [[general practitioner]]s.&lt;ref name="2006-19"&gt;Vončina,  Jemiai, Merkur ''et al.''

All health care providers that receive public funds are required to negotiate annual contracts with the HZZO that set prices and payment plans.&lt;ref name="CroatMedJ3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vončina | first1 = L. | last2 = Strizrep | first2 = T. | last3 = Bagat | first3 = M. | last4 = Pezelj-Duliba | first4 = D. | last5 = Pavić | first5 = N. | last6 = Polašek | first6 = O. | doi = 10.3325/cmj.2012.53.66 | title = Croatian 2008–2010 health insurance reform: Hard choices toward financial sustainability and efficiency | journal = Croatian Medical Journal | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–76 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22351581| pmc =3284176 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Compulsory health insurance contributions form 76% of the fund's income.  About a third of the population - those in employment - are liable to pay full contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Health Systems and Policy Monitor|url=http://www.hspm.org/countries/croatia30062014/countrypage.aspx|accessdate=10 February 2016|work=Croatia|issue=Vol 16 no 3|publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Constitution of Croatia]], adopted in December 1990, declared that health care is a human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vulic |first1=Spaso |last2=Healy |first2=Judith |year=1999 |title=Health Care Systems in Transition: Croatia |publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/75150/E68394.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2013}} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1993, the HZZO was created by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in order to consolidate the fragmented and decentralized health care system which had been inherited from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Vončina, Jemiai, Merkur ''et al.'' (2006). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vončina, Džakula, Mastilica (2007). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 law recognized patient choice as a principle through a mandatory [[Payroll tax#Croatia|payroll tax]] of 15%&lt;ref name="CroatMedJ3" /&gt; and allowing the use of private supplementary plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actuaries.org/EVENTS/Congresses/Cancun/associations_reports/health_reports/hr_croatia.pdf |title=Model for private health insurance in Croatia |last1=Letica |first1=Gordana |last2=Račić |first2=Tatjana |date=2002 |publisher=27th [[International Congress of Actuaries]] |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Care Law of 1993 also guaranteed patients rights which includes access to information about their health, and the ability to refuse examination and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bosanac|first1=Sanja Babić |last2=Borovečki |first2=Ana |last3=Fišter |first3=Kristina |year=2008 |title=Patients' rights in the Republic of Croatia – between the law and reality |journal=Medicinski Glasnik |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |publisher=Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton |url=http://www.ljkzedo.com.ba/medglasnik/vol51/M8_7.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2013}} p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, the Ministry of Health under [[Ana Stavljenić-Rukavina]] issued a policy statement entitled "The Strategy and Plan for the Reform of the Health Care System and Health Insurance of the Republic of Croatia." Noting that such factors as the [[Aging of Europe|country's aging]] and the generous benefits established since 1993 threatened the fund's sustainability,&lt;ref&gt;Vončina, Jemiai, Merkur ''et al.''

These services include [[diagnostic test]]s and [[prescription drug]]s. It also created a voluntary insurance policy that would complement the mandatory coverage each citizen received.&lt;ref&gt;Vončina, Jemiai, Merkur ''et al.'' (2006). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  After 2002, citizens were no longer allowed to opt out of the public insurance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vončina |first1=Luca |last2=Jemiai |first2=Nadia |last3=Merkur |first3=Sherry |last4= Golna |first4= Christina |last5=Maeda |first5= Akiko |last6=Chao |first6= Shiyan |last7= Džakula |first7=Aleksandar |year=2006 |title=Croatia: Health System Review |journal=Health Systems in Transition |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=1–108 |publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/96445/E90328.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2013}} p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Health''' ({{lang-ga|An Roinn Sláinte}}) is a [[Department of State (Ireland)|department]] of the [[Government of Ireland]]. The department's mission is to "support, protect and empower individuals, families and their communities to achieve their full health potential by putting health at the centre of public policy and by leading the development of high quality, equitable and efficient health and personal social services." The department is led by the [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]], who is assisted by three [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Ministers of State]].

The department attracts much controversy particularly due to the [[Health Service Executive|HSE]]. [[Brian Cowen]], the former [[Taoiseach]] referred to it as "[[Angola]]" clarifying "just when you've cleared one [[land mine]] another goes off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishhealth.com/index.html?level=4&amp;id=4514|title=Heath – review of the year|author=Bowers, Fergal|work=''IrishHealth.com''|date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departmental team==
The official headquarters and ministerial offices of the department are in Miesian Plaza, Lower Baggot Street, [[Dublin 2]]. The departmental team consists of the following:

*[[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]]: [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]], [[Teachta Dála|TD]]
**[[Minister of State for Disability Issues]]: [[Finian McGrath]], TD
**[[Ministers of State of the 32nd Dáil|Minister of State for Health Promotion and the National Drugs Strategy]]: [[Catherine Byrne (Irish politician)|Catherine Byrne]], TD
**[[Ministers of State of the 32nd Dáil|Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People]]: [[Jim Daly (politician)|Jim Daly]], TD

==History==
The department was created by the [[Ministers and Secretaries Acts|Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1946]]. This took effect in 1947 with [[James Ryan (Irish politician)|James Ryan]] as the first Minister. Prior to this, the [[Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government|Department for Local Government and Public Health]] was responsible for Health.

==Structure==
The role of the department and departmental team is to support the minister and the democratic process by:

*Formulating policy underpinned by an evidence-based approach and providing direction on national health priorities ensuring that quality and value for money are enhanced through the implementation of an evidence-based approach underpinned by monitoring and evaluation. 
*Protecting the interests of patients and consumers and supporting practitioners and professionals to practice to the highest standards by providing a prudent and appropriate regulatory framework. 
*Providing effective stewardship over health resources by demanding accountability for achieving outcomes including financial, managerial and clinical accountability, and by providing the frameworks, including enhanced service planning at national level to improve the overall governance of the health system. 
*Fulfilling the state's obligations in relation to the EU, [[WHO]], [[Council of Europe]] and other international bodies and the continued implementation of the co-operation agenda decided by the North-South Ministerial Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33394">'''Electronic prescribing''' ('''e-prescribing''' or '''e-Rx''') is the computer-based electronic generation, transmission, and filling of a [[medical prescription]], taking the place of paper and faxed prescriptions. E-prescribing allows a [[physician]], pharmacist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant to use digital prescription software to [[Data transmission|electronically transmit]] a new prescription or renewal authorization to a community or mail-order [[pharmacy]]. It outlines the ability to send error-free, accurate, and understandable prescriptions electronically from the [[healthcare provider]] to the pharmacy. E-prescribing is meant to reduce the risks associated with traditional prescription script writing. It is also one of the major reasons for the push for [[electronic medical records]]. By sharing medical prescription information, e-prescribing seeks to connect the patient's team of healthcare providers to facilitate knowledgeable decision making.&lt;ref&gt;MedRunner Inc.

* Patient identification
* Generating a complete active medication list, possibly incorporating electronic data received from an insurance provider
* Access to patient historical data
* Prescribe or add new medication and select the pharmacy where the prescription will be filled.
* Work with an existing medication within the practice, this can involve viewing details of a medication, remove a medication from the active medication list, change dose, etc., for a medication or renew one or more medications
* Printing prescriptions
* Electronically transmitting prescriptions to a transaction hub
* Conducting all safety checks using an integrated [[decision support system]], known as a Drug Utilization Review.  Safety checks include: automated prompts that offer information on the drug being prescribed, potential inappropriate dose or route of administration, drug-drug interactions, allergy concerns, or warnings of caution
* Flagging availability of lower cost, therapeutically appropriate alternatives (if any)
* Providing information on formulary or tiered formulary medications, patient eligibility, and authorization requirements received electronically from the patient's insurance provider
* System integration capabilities (e.g., connection with various databases, connection with pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager systems)
* Educational capabilities (e.g., patient education, provider feedback)

[[File:Electronic Prescribing, How it works.jpeg|thumb|High-level dataflow diagram outlining the roles and processes involved in electronic prescribing]]

The basic components of an electronic prescribing system are the:&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;
# Prescriber - typically a physician
# Transaction hub
# Pharmacy with implemented electronic prescribing software
# Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)

The PBM and transaction hub work closely together. The PBM works as an intermediate actor to ensure the accuracy of information, although other models may not include this to streamline the communication process.

In addition to pharmacies, medical tests can also be prescribed.

=== Prescriber ===

The prescriber, generally a clinician or healthcare staff, is defined as the electronic prescribing system user and sign into the system through a verification process to authenticate their identity.&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;

The prescriber searches through the database of patient records by using patient-specific information such as first and last name, date of birth, current address etc. Once the correct patient file has been accessed, the prescriber reviews the current medical information and uploads or updates new prescription information to the medical file.&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;

===Transaction hub===

The transaction hub provides the common link between all actors (prescriber, pharmacy benefit manager, and pharmacy). It stores and maintains a master patient index for quick access to their medical information as well as a list of pharmacies.&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;

When the prescriber uploads new prescription information to the patient file, this is sent to the transaction hub. The transaction hub will verify against the patient index. This will automatically send information about this transaction to the PBM, who will respond to the hub with information on patient eligibility, formulary, and medication history back to the transaction hub. The transaction hub then sends this information to the prescriber to improve patient management and care by completing and authorizing the prescription. Upon which, the prescription information is sent to the pharmacy that the patient primarily goes to.&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;

===Pharmacy===

When a pharmacy receives the prescription information from the transaction hub, it will send a confirmation message. The pharmacy also has the ability to communicate to the prescriber that the prescription order has been filled through the system. Further system development will soon allow different messages such as a patient not picking up their medication or is late to pick up medication to improve patient management.&lt;ref name="How does e-prescribing work"/&gt;

===Imaging===

When an imaging center receives the prescription, the imaging center will then contact the patient and schedule the patient for his/her scan.  The advantage of ePrescribing radiology is that oftentimes when a patient is handed a paper script, the patient will lose the prescription or wait to call and schedule.  This can be disastrous for patients with severe underlying conditions.  The imaging center will call and schedule the patient as soon as the referral arrives.  There are mobile ePrescribing portals as well as web portals that handle this well, and there are advantages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rxportyl.com/advantages/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Compared to paper-based prescribing, e-prescribing can improve health and reduce costs because it can:&lt;ref name="ama-assn.org"/&gt;
* Reduce prescribing and dispensing errors
* Decrease the work needed to execute a prescription
* Speed receipt of prescribed drugs
* Avoid more adverse drug interactions and reactions
* More reliably offer to substitute less expensive drug alternatives by checking the [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] of the insurance provider in the doctor's office
* Improve medication compliance (taking the prescribed medications on time) by reducing lost and unfilled prescriptions and minimizing patient costs
* Reduce the incidence of [[drug diversion]] (drug abuse) by alerting providers and pharmacists of duplicative prescriptions for [[controlled substances]].&lt;ref name=hhs /&gt;

Safety improvements are highly desirable; in 2000, the Institute of Medicine identified medication errors as the most common type of [[medical error]] in health care, estimating that this leads to several thousand deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = To err is human: building a safer health system | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=JInZiZnUyicC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | author = Institute of Medicine | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving patient safety and quality of care===

Illegibility from handwritten prescriptions is eliminated, decreasing the risk of medication errors while simultaneously decreasing risks related to liability.  Oral miscommunications regarding prescriptions can be reduced, as e-prescribing should decrease the need for phone calls between prescribers and dispensers.  Causes of medication errors include mistakes by the pharmacist incorrectly interpreting illegible handwriting or ambiguous nomenclature, and lapses in the prescriber's knowledge of desired dosage of a drug or undesired interactions between multiple drugs. Electronic prescribing has the potential to eliminate most of these types of errors. Warning and alert systems are provided at the point of care. E-prescribing systems can enhance an overall medication management process through clinical decision support systems that can perform checks against the patient's current medications for drug-drug interactions, drug-allergy interactions, diagnoses, body weight, age, drug appropriateness, and correct dosing.  Based on these algorithms, the system can alert prescribers to contradictions, adverse reactions, and duplicate therapies.  The computer can also ensure that clear and unambiguous instructions are encoded in a structured message to the pharmacist, and [[decision support systems]] can flag lethal dosages and lethal combinations of drugs.&lt;ref name=hhs&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |title=The Benefits of Electronic Prescribing |url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2007/12/t20071204c.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916200221/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2007/12/t20071204c.html |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  E-prescribing allows for increased access to the patient's medical records and their medication history. Having access to this information from all health care providers at the time of prescribing can support alerts related to drug inappropriateness, in combination with other medications or with specific medical issues at hand.

===Reducing time spent on phone calls and call-backs to pharmacies===

According to estimates, almost 30 percent of prescriptions require pharmacy callbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Medicare Program; E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program; Proposed Rule. 70 FR 6256, February 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This translates into less time available to the pharmacist for other important functions, such as educating consumers about their medications.  In response, E-prescribing can significantly reduce the volume of pharmacy call-backs related to illegibility, mistaken prescription choices, formulary and pharmacy benefits, decreasing the amount of time wasted on the phone.  This ultimately impacts office workflow efficiency and overall productivity in a positive manner.

===Reducing time spent faxing prescriptions to pharmacies===

Both prescribers and pharmacists can save time and resources spent on faxing prescriptions through a reduction in labor costs, handling costs, and paper expenses waste due to unreliability.

===Automating the prescription renewal request and authorization process===
With e-prescribing, renewal authorization can be an automated process that provides efficiencies for both the prescriber and pharmacist.  Pharmacy staff can generate a renewal request (authorization request) that is delivered through the electronic network to the prescriber's system.  The prescriber can then review the request and act accordingly by approving or denying the request through updating the system.  With limited resource utilization and just a few clicks on behalf of the prescriber, they can complete a medication renewal task while enhancing continuous patient documentation.

===Increasing patient convenience and medication compliance===

It is estimated that 20% of paper-based prescription orders go unfilled by the patient, partly due to the hassle of dropping off a paper prescription and waiting for it to be filled.  By elimination or reducing this waiting period, e-prescribing may help reduce the number of unfilled prescriptions and hence, increasing medication adherence.  Allowing the renewal of medications through this electronic system also helps improve the efficiency of this process, reducing obstacles that may result in less patient compliance.  Availability of information on when patient's prescriptions are filled can also help clinicians assess patient adherence.

===Allowing greater prescriber mobility===

Improved prescriber convenience can be achieved when using mobile devices, that work on a wireless network, to write and renew prescriptions.  Such mobile devices may include laptops, PDAs, tablet computers, or mobile phones.  This freedom of mobility allows prescribers to write/renew prescriptions anywhere, even when not in the office.

===Improving drug surveillance/recall ability===

E-prescribing systems enable embedded, automated analytic tools to produce queries and reports, which would be close to impossible with a paper-based system.  Common examples of such reporting would be: finding all patients with a particular prescription during a drug recall, or the frequency and types of medication provided by certain health care providers.

==Limitations==

Although e-prescribing has the ability to streamline workflow process and increase the system's efficiency, challenges and limitations that may hinder the widespread adoption of e-prescribing practices include:&lt;ref name="ama-assn.org"/&gt;

* Financial Cost and Return on Investment (ROI) - The costs associated with purchasing, implementing, supporting and maintaining such a system may be beyond the means of most small clinical practices, and noted to be one of the greatest implementation barriers.  Health care workers who are responsible for medical prescription, especially those in small practices, inner-city areas, or remote rural settings, may bear more than their fair share of the cost associated with e-prescribing.  This is in response to the various other stakeholders that may reap the benefits from such a system, without having to financially support it, disseminating their risk substantially.  Clinical practices therefore need to invest significantly in both hardware and software, with varying costs based on system specifications (stand alone system or entire EHR system).  Even clinics that receive free e-prescribing systems may face financial costs pertaining to management of the interface, customization due to flexibility, training, maintenance, and upgrades. On top of this, the clinic must also take into consideration the lost time and efficiency during the transition period of implementation. As a result, large urban areas may see the greatest ROI when compared to those in rural areas.
* Change management - Many underestimate the challenges pertaining to change management when transitioning from paper-based prescriptions to e-prescribing.  This is especially true in busy practices where healthcare providers and associated staff are accustomed to their current management system, in which case change management becomes extremely important.  Potentially difficult and time-consuming analysis may be needed to understand how to change workflow around the management of prescriptions with the introduction of an electronic system. The change also requires pharmacists to increase their awareness of new types of errors associated with e-prescribing, in order to best target their activities to reduce clinical risk. As a result, steps must be taken to ensure effective planning, training, support, and continuous quality improvement for successful transition.
* Hardware and software selection - Choosing the right hardware platform and software applications can be a rather daunting task for practices, especially in regards to small and busy settings.  Many have limited access to expert information technology personnel/staff, leading them to struggle with how to get started, appropriate vendor selection, cost and function negotiations, and most importantly, long term support to ensure continuous functionality and meaningful use.
* Erroneous alerts - The inability to effectively use clinical decision support systems due to the erroneous triggering of pop-up alerts with ill-defined software is also a great limitation.  Under such circumstances, many opt to turn the notifications off, disabling one of the system's most beneficial aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, J. M., Gerland, A., Reed, M. C., &amp; Fahlman, C. (2007). Physicians’ experiences using commercial e-prescribing systems. Health affairs, 26(3), 393-404.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integrity of data input - Accidental data entry errors such as selecting the wrong patient or clicking on the wrong choice in a menu of dosages may occur. Software vendors can reduce errors by continually reviewing user feedback and follow best practices in [[user interface design]].
* Security and privacy - As with many eHealth solutions, privacy of patient information stored in electronic format may lead to the possibility of novel errors, such as inadvertently divulging [[protected health information]] on the Internet through inadequate security practices. Instances of negligence may also arise, where employees may forward prescriptions to organizations outside its intended use.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, M. C., &amp; Keen, S. (2007). An Electronic Subscription Prescription. Intellectual property &amp; Technology Law Journal , 19 (10), 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another security issue that needs to be addressed up front is the verification of electronic signatures, in ensuring the medical integrity of the prescriptions received by pharmacists.  Hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies are counselled to be protected with firewalls, use strict computer permission settings, and remain vigilant toward signs of an intrusion.
* System downtime - Periods of system downtime may arise, either due to network-related issues, hardware failure, or loss of electricity.  The inability to use electronic prescribing when the system is not accessible is of great concern, and must be addressed with the discussion of fall-back procedures and mechanisms when such situations arise.
* Patient Access Lost - In the event of a development beyond the control of the patient, such as a software malfunction in the health care provider's office, the patient can no longer ask the care provider for a paper script to take to a pharmacy (in New York; other states to follow suit) in order to obtain needed medicines. This leaves the patient at the mercy of technicians or other undiscoverable workers.

==By country==

===Australia===
Electronic prescription in Australia is currently provided by two service providers, MediSecure and eRx. Both services can be integrated into many of the existing clinical and pharmacy prescribing software systems. Since December 2012, they have become interoperable allowing bilateral transfer of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.org.au/topics/e-health/electronic-transfer-of-prescriptions-etp|title=Electronic transfer ofprescriptions- ETP|publisher=NPS Medicinewise|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/228974/NPS-MedicineWise-eTP-Information-sheet.pdf|title=Electronic transfer ofprescriptions- ETP (Frequently asked questions)|publisher=NPS Medicinewise|accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/news/latest-news/accc-to-give-green-light-to-erx-medisecure-deal "ACCC to give green light to eRx/MediSecure deal"] Pharmacy News, 14 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===

Private companies started working with electronic prescriptions. On 2017 July [http://easypres.com easypres.com] launched Bangladesh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prothomalo.com/technology/article/1262856/%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%97%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%93%E0%A7%9F%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0|title=রোগীর ব্যবস্থাপত্র লেখার সফটওয়্যার|work=প্রথম আলো|access-date=2018-06-03|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; first cloud-based electronic prescription and patient management software for Doctors in Bangladesh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bytes/two-nrbs-the-mission-digitise-the-healthcare-system-bangladesh-1536856|title=Two NRBs on the mission to digitise the healthcare system of Bangladesh|date=2018-02-19|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Within a year, more than thousand doctors registered for the software out of 83 thousand registered MBBS doctors in Bangladesh for this Digital prescription writing software. High court of Bangladesh issued a rule that doctors need to write the prescription in readable format meaning they need to use software of ALL caps later while writing prescription. This software also stores the medical history of patients and doctors can access these data easily from anywhere using the Internet.

=== Canada ===
On March 22, 2016, the [[Government of Canada]] allocated funds to [[Canada Health Infoway]] to develop an e-prescribing service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2016|url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2016/docs/plan/ch5-en.html#_Toc446106796|website=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infoway is working with Health Canada, the provinces and territories and industry stakeholders to create PrescribeIT, a multi-jurisdiction e-prescribing service. Infoway will create, operate and maintain the service, along with its partners. The service will be financially self-sustaining and is designed to be scaled across the country and will enable prescribers to electronically transmit a prescription to a patient’s pharmacy of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PrescribeIT|url=https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/solutions/e-prescribing/prescribeit|website=Canada Health Infoway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians, nurse practitioners and other prescribers will be able to use the system either through their existing electronic medical record or through a standalone application. Health Canada included supporting better prescribing practices, including e-prescribing, as part of its Action on Opioid Misuse plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Canada's Action on Opioid Misuse|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/substance-abuse-toxicomanie/misuse-plan-abus-index-eng.php|website=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently in Canada, it was the position of Health Canada that, to allow for e-prescribing, amendments to Part C of the Food and Drugs Regulations made under the Food and Drugs Act, regulations made under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possibly regulations made under Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act would be required. After further review, Health Canada has concluded that there are currently no regulatory impediments to moving ahead with electronically generated and transmitted prescriptions and that these are permissible to the extent that they achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. Provinces and territories wishing to proceed with e-prescribing are obligated to ensure that electronic prescriptions meet existing regulatory requirements and achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. For example, there must be evidence of a genuine practitioner/patient relationship, and in the case of controlled substances, pharmacists filling prescriptions must verify prescriptions are signed by the practitioner before selling or providing drugs containing controlled substances to a patient. Health Canada has collaborated with Canada Health Infoway on the development of a technical document entitled Ensuring the Authenticity of Electronic Prescriptions, in order to provide advice about how to ensure the authenticity of electronic signatures.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/ehealth-esante/e_presc-ord_elec-eng.php |title=Policy Statement on E-Prescribing |publisher=Health Canada |accessdate=2011-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114131503/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/ehealth-esante/e_presc-ord_elec-eng.php |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{editorial|date=March 2013}}
The use of electronic prescription has been designated as an important strategic policy to improve health care in Europe. The aim of the European Union is to have a cross-border electronic healthcare system in Europe which will enable EU citizens to obtain e-Prescriptions anywhere in Europe. The Scandinavian countries are leading Europe in deploying e-Prescription. Electronic prescriptions were introduced in Estonia in January 2010&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9rTZM2kj78&lt;/ref&gt; and by mid-2013, 95% of all prescriptions in the country were being issued electronically.&lt;ref&gt;http://e-estonia.com/components/e-prescription&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries which use the prescription process routinely are Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;https://recip-e.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/paper-mn-2014-12-08b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgs.mef.gov.it/VERSIONE-I/Attivit--i/Spesa-soci/Il-Sistema-Tessera-Sanitaria/Ricetta-elettronica-SSN/&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland, Greece, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The European Union is pushing for more cross border health data exchange. Despite favourable attitudes towards cross border e-Prescriptions, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation in clinical practice. There are varying interpretations and implementations of data protection and confidentiality laws in the 27 member states. Infrastructures are not in place to support the system and stakeholders in some jurisdictions are reluctant to embrace e-health due to the high cost and the lack of security of the systems. Member states have varying degrees of health care policy, privacy enforcement and laws concerning data protection, telecommunication services and digital signature with regards to e-Prescription. Interoperability of different systems is only a partial solution. Security and enforcement of privacy must also be equally enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, P. (2013), "E-Prescription across Europe". Health and Technology, 3 (1), pp. 1-15. {{doi|10.1007/s12553-012-0037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India some private hospitals started using electronic prescription. But a major step was taken by government of West Bengal in August 2014 when they started the process of issuing e-prescriptions instead of hand-written instructions in top government hospitals.
The biggest advantage of the system is that a patient has all his medical data stored in the server of state health department which can be referred to in future.
In the private sector number companies have initiated to build software to support Electronic Prescription in India. ERXPAD.COM is one among the pioneer player offer cloud based electronic prescription software ( erx) in India.

=== Russia ===
With the development and implementation of electronic technologies in Russian healthcare system, electronic prescription became part of the project called [[EMIAS]]. [[EMIAS]] is the digital system designed to increase the quality and access of the medical aid in the public health facility. The project was designed and being implemented as part of «Digital city» program in execution of the Moscow Government's order from April 7, 2014 (as Moscow government amended on 21.05.2013 № 22-PP). &lt;br /&gt;
The system offers special portal [[Emias.Info]], that provides appointment service to the patients and client area with different services including e-Prescription. Government social program allows getting pharmaceutical products for free or with the discount, depending on the category of the citizen.

===United Kingdom===
About 420 million repeat prescriptions are generated in the UK each year - about 200 for each general practitioner each week. They account for about 80% of the cost of medication in primary care. Paper based Repeat Dispensing Services were introduced by the [[NHS]] in 2005, and in 2009 it became possible to use the NHS Electronic Prescription Service for this purpose. In 2017 awareness of the scheme among patients was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Half 'unaware of electronic NHS prescriptions'|url=http://www.altonherald.com/article.cfm?id=116725&amp;headline=Half%20%27unaware%20of%20electronic%20NHS%20prescriptions%27&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2017|accessdate=16 January 2017|publisher=Alton Herald|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2017 Keith McNeil, [[NHS England]]'s chief clinical information officer demanded that NHS hospitals should be moved rapidly onto electronic prescribing in the light of research showing it would cut serious prescribing errors by more than half.  There was no information about the extent to which it is happening in hospitals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McNeil: Trust boards not looking at e-prescribing 'need to be sacked'|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/mcneil-trust-boards-not-looking-at-e-prescribing-need-to-be-sacked/7020868.article|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After successful pilots in London and the East Midlands it was agreed in April 2018 that electronic prescribing should be introduced in all urgent care settings in England, including [[NHS 111]] and other [[Out-of-hours service]]s so that dispensed medication can be ready for collection at a pharmacy when patients arrive. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electronic prescribing to be rolled out across urgent care settings in England|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204632.article?|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, the [[HITECH Act]] promotes adoption of this technology by defining e-prescribing as one meaningful use of an [[electronic medical record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/06/15/bica0615.htm|title=Prepare to meet "meaningful use" EMR requirement|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards for transmitting, recording, and describing prescriptions have been developed by the [[National Council for Prescription Drug Programs]], in particular the [[SCRIPT (medicine)|SCRIPT]] standard, which describes data formats.  Elsewhere in the world, health care systems have been slower to adopt e-prescribing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?docid=163558282|title=E-PRESCRIPTION: IMPENDING ACCEPTANCE IN EUROPE|publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan|accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption of e-prescribing technology has accelerated in the United States, in large part, due to the arrival of Stage 2 of meaningful use. One of the Stage 2 core measures is: "Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically (e-Rx.)" In order to meet this measure, practices must prescribe and transmit at least 50 percent of permissible prescriptions electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/meaningful-use-stage-2-crib-sheet "Meaningful Use Stage 2 Crib Sheet"] Physicians Practice, September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data released in May 2012 by [[Surescripts]], a company which operates the nation's largest health information (e-prescribing) network, roughly 317,000 office-based physicians now e-prescribe in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/e-prescribing/safe-e-prescribing-primer-practices "Safe E-Prescribing: A Primer for Practices"] Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent report released by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT in June 2012 finds that 48 percent of U.S. physicians use e-prescribing systems. National growth in e-prescribing over the period September 2008 through June 2012 increased over 40 percent, with individual states increasing adoption anywhere from 28 percent to 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/us_e-prescribingtrends_onc_brief_4_nov2012.pdf "State Variation in E-Prescribing Trends in the United States"] Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Data Brief No. 4, November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endotheliitis''' is an [[immune response]] within [[endothelium]] in blood vessels, in which they become [[Inflammation|inflamed]].  The condition can cause [[oedema]] of the surrounding tissue, including the [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]], and can cause [[iritis]] and pain.  If it is within the [[cornea]], it can result in permanent loss of vision.  The condition can be caused by a number of factors, such as [[mumps]] and [[cytomegalovirus]] under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1195788-overview Herpes Simplex]" [[EMedicine]], Retrieved 27 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xiaodong Zheng, Masahiko Yamaguchi, Tomoko Goto1, Shigeki Okamoto and Yuichi Ohashi "[http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/377 Experimental Corneal Endotheliitis in Rabbits]" 2000 ''Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirti "[http://journals.lww.com/corneajrnl/Abstract/2004/05000/Mumps_Induced_Corneal_Endotheliitis.17.aspx Mumps-Induced Corneal Endotheliitis]" 2004 ''Cornea''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

The company was founded by Jas Bagniewski (ex-senior management of [[Groupon]] UK and ex-head of [[Zalando]] UK),&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt; James Fryer (previously of Zen Bedrooms), Kuba Wieczorek (ex director at [[Channel 4]] Creative and head of sports marketing at Channel 4), Joe Moore (formerly at [[Deloitte]]), Felix Lobkowicz (ex-VP [[Rocket Internet]] and ex-head of Zalando UK) and Abid Ismail (ex-CEO of Axelos, part of Capita Plc, and ex-assistant director at Ernst and Young M&amp;A).&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/top-new-businesses-of-2015-eve/|title=12 days of start-ups: eve|publisher=Startups.co.uk|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/startups-100/2016/10-eve-sleep/|title=Eve Sleep|website=Startups|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eve Sleep manufactures one single type of mattress&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homeli.co.uk/eve-mattress-with-typographic-designs/|title=Eve Mattress with Typographic Designs|website=Homeli}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a three-layer technology incorporating [[memory foam]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; It also sells [[pillow]]s and [[bed sheet]]s.

Eve sells online and reduces its shipping costs by rolling the mattress into a box&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt; which allows it to sell its product for a third of the price of a traditional premium mattress.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt;

The company sold more than 11,000 mattresses in its first year with a [[revenue|turnover]] of more than £3.5&amp;nbsp;million, averaging monthly growth of 25%.&lt;ref name="standard.co.uk"/&gt;

== History ==

In the 2010s, mattress company startups such as Eve began to emerge with a new [[business model]] to meet consumer and [[market demand]]s.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/01/leesa-sleep-mattress/|title=Mattress wars heat up: Leesa raises $9 million|website=Fortune|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-mattresses-professionals-1443640077|title=The new mattresses professionals|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new companies have a limited selection of products&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; made from a few key components&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; at a fraction of the high street costs.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk1"/&gt; They are set on simplifying the [[decision process]] for customers, offering generous trial periods, quick [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] and [[social media marketing]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/casper-mattress-startup_us_564c9928e4b06037734bd61d|title=This Mattress Startup Wants To Change The Way You Think About Sleep|website=HuffPost|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jas Bagniewski was already in the mattress industry, along with James Fryer. They sold over $2&amp;nbsp;million worth of mattresses in one day on a [[Groupon]] flash sale in 2011.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"/&gt; The company went on to sell 75,000 mattresses online in 18 countries.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt; The idea for Eve grew from their experience and through years of product testing, customer feedback and reviews.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt;

Eve Sleep was founded by Bagniewski (ex-senior management of [[Groupon]] UK and former-head of [[Zalando]] UK), James Fryer (formerly of Zen Bedrooms), Kuba Wieczorek (ex director at Channel 4 Creative and head of sports marketing at [[Channel 4]]), Joe Moore (formerly at [[Deloitte]]), Felix Lobkowicz (ex-VP [[Rocket Internet]] and ex-head of Zalando UK) and Abid Ismail (ex-CEO of Axelos, part of Capita Plc, and ex-assistant director at Ernst and Young M&amp;A), in October 2014, in London.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk1"/&gt;The company was officially launched in February 2015.&lt;ref name="companydb.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetimes.co.uk"/&gt;

== Product ==
[[File:Eve Sleep mattress -1.jpg|thumb|The Eve Sleep mattress]]
Eve Sleep sells one mattress that is "suitable for everybody".&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt; The "one size fits all" mattress, which is manufactured exclusively in the UK, measures 10 inches deep and is composed of a three layer foam technology.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt;

The mattress combines a high-density foam base, a mid layer of high-resilience comfort memory foam and a "next-generation" [[memory foam]] top layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/eve-sleep-in-house/1402990#|title=Eve "Sleep" by in-house|publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top layer moulds itself to the sleeper's body providing comfort,&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt; the base foam layer provides support.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt; The layered design ensures [[breathability]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"/&gt;

Bed names and size specifications vary in different countries. The mattress exists in all [[bed size|standard sizes]] in UK (single, double, king, super king...) and in US (single, twin, twin XL, full, king and California king), and fits all IKEA frames.&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thetimes.co.uk"/&gt; The company also manufactures custom-sized mattresses on demand.

The mattress features a knitted two way stretch fabric cover in white with a distinctive yellow side panel.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt;

The mattress also comes in special editions featuring typographical designs,&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt; such as Wordsworth, [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]], [[Treasure Island]], [[Huckleberry Finn]] and selected quotes on the theme of mornings.&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt;

The mattress is vacuum packed and folded into a box, and can be easily delivered and moved up [[staircase]]s, unlike traditional mattresses. When unpacked, the mattress recovers its original shape and is ready to sleep on within hours.&lt;ref name="homeli.co.uk"/&gt; This method also cuts the delivery cost.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wallstreet-online.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/7265933-eve-revitalises-the-mattress-industry|title=Eve revitalizes the mattress industry|website=Wallstreet Online|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eve Sleep's products are designed and made on demand in the UK&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standard.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/10/eve-sleep/|title=U.K. Mattress Startup Eve Picks Up Backing From Octopus Investments|website=Techcrunch|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United States&lt;ref name="sleepsherpa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sleepsherpa.com/eve-mattress-review/|title=Eve Mattress Review|website=Sleep Sherpa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company claims to make ''"the world's most comfortable mattress"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefinancetimes.co.uk/news-analysis/35675/The-mattress-deal-that-lets-Eve-customers-sleep-easier|title=The mattress deal that lets Eve customers sleep easier|website=The Finance Times|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''"the perfect mattress"''&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk2"/&gt; at the third of the price of an equivalent high street mattress.&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/eve-sleep-jas-bagniewski/|title=Eve Sleep: Jas Bagniewski|website=Startups magazine|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="startups.co.uk1"/&gt;

The company also sells [[pillow]]s and [[bed sheet]]s.

'''Florence Winger Bagley''' (born January 7, 1874 – died 1952) was a 19th-century [[Americans|American]] [[psychologist]].&lt;ref name="Feminist Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Psychology|date=2006|publisher=MD Publications Pvt Ltd.|isbn=978-8175330955|pages=320|last1=Dua|first1=Aarti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagley's work focused on the research of Fechner's color rings and color aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives From Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0415920396|location=New York|pages=67|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was listed in the first biographical compilation of American scientists.&lt;ref name="AmMenSci1906"&gt;{{cite book|title=American men of science: A Biographical Directory|date=1906|publisher=Science Press|edition=First|location=New York|last1=Cattell|first1=James McKeen|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Early life and education==
Florence Bagley was born in [[Clay Lick, Pennsylvania]]. She was the daughter of Margaret (née Irwin) and Joseph W Winger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Womans whos who 1914-15" /&gt; Bagley studied at the University of Nebraska and received her A.B. degree in 1895 and A.M. degree in 1898.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then moved to [[Cornell University]] in 1898, again as a Fellow in Psychology, holding the Susan Linn Sage Fellowship in Philosophy and Ethics. She completed her doctoral research in 1901 but did not complete writing her dissertation.&lt;ref name="Feminist Psychology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProctorEvans2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Proctor|first1=Robert W|last2=Evans|first2=Rand|title=E. B. Titchener, Women Psychologists and the Experimentalists|journal=American Journal of Psychology|date=Winter 2014|volume=127|issue=4|pages=501–526}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her work was published under the guidance of her supervisor, [[Edward B. Titchener]].&lt;ref name="Fechners_colors_1902"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1902|title=An investigation of Fechner's colors|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=14|issue=4|pages=488–525|last1=Bagley|first1=Florence Winger}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recognized with membership in [[Sigma XI]] from Cornell and was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]].&lt;ref name="Womans whos who 1914-15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's who's who of America, 1914-15|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Woman%27s_who%27s_who_of_America,_1914-15.djvu/53|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Bagley's research in the field of Psychology occurred during her time at the University of Nebraska and Cornell University. However, her professional positions were all unofficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bagley's research interests were the aesthetics of color. She investigated the optical illusion of colors appearing to the viewer when a disc with black and white sectors is spun ([[Fechner color|Prevost-Fechner-Benham Subjective Colors]]). She conducted a systematic analysis of the response, first described by [[Fechner]]. Her work defined that a low rate of rotation was required for this subjective effect.&lt;ref name="symposium1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Thomas M|last2=Bartley|first2=S Howard|last3=Bourassa|first3=Charles M|last4=Ball|first4=Richard J|title=Symposium on Alternation of Response|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|date=1971|volume=84|pages=3–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Bagley's work "An Investigation of Fechner's Colors" was published in The American Journal of Psychology.&lt;ref name="Fechners_colors_1902" /&gt; 
==Personal life==
During her time at Cornell, Bagley met her husband, [[William Bagley (educator)|William Chander Bagley]], who was also in the doctoral program. William completed his degree in 1900 and moved out West for work. Bagley remained at Cornell for another year. However, she did not complete her doctoral degree before leaving for her wedding. The two got married in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] on August 14, 1901.&lt;ref name="Womans whos who 1914-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Untold Lives: The First Generation of American Women Psychologists|last=Scarborough|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-231-05155-7|location=New York|pages=163–164|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1901 her husband obtained a post as principal of Meramec Elementary School in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], and she moved there with him. She gave birth to their first daughter in May 1902. In September, her husband wrote a letter to E.B. Titchener in which he expressed Florence's desire to finish her degree and her willingness to attempt in the future. However, she gave birth to three more children and became busy with the domestic duties as a wife and mother.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family subsequently moved several times and in 1914 she was recorded as living in [[Dillon, Montana]] and was described as a writer.&lt;ref name="Womans whos who 1914-15" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">'''Fooding''' is a brand of a restaurant guide and gastronomic events that was founded in 2000. A [[portmanteau|contraction]] of the words "food" and "feeling", the Fooding aims (in the words of [[Frédéric Mitterrand]]) to “defend a less-intimidating gastronomy for those who want to cook and nourish themselves in an unstuffy fashion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/le-fooding-fete-ses-10-ans-et-ses-chefs_937012.html|title=Le Fooding fête ses 10 ans et ses chefs|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neologism]] appeared for the first time in 1999 in a Nova Mag article by French journalist and food critic, Alexandre Cammas. It has since become the brand of an annual restaurant guide (in print, online, and smartphone application) and of often charitable international culinary events.

==The concept==

According to [[Adam Gopnik]] in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' piece, the Fooding is to cuisine what the French New Wave was to French Cinema. The hidden goal was to Americanize French food without becoming American, just as the New Wave, back in the fifties and sixties, was about taking in Hollywood virtues without being Hollywoodized—taking in some of the energy and optimism and informality that the French still associate with American movies while reimagining them as something distinctly French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik?currentPage=4|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fooding's mission across its editorial activities and events is to liberate cuisine from the traditional codes and conventions that confine it, to give chefs the possibility of expressing themselves more fully, and to give contemporary eaters a true taste of the times. Through opening this “freer channel in the gastronomic universe”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhotellerie-restauration.fr/journal/restauration/2010-11/Le-Fooding-celebre-ses-10-ans.htm|title=Abonnement à L'Hôtellerie Restauration|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fooding emphasizes “the appetite for novelty and quality, rejection of boredom, love of fun, the ordinary, the sincere, and a yearning to eat with the times”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RX37xIhpNBUC&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mangeur hypermoderne (Le)|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially established by Cammas along with fellow journalist and food critic Emmanuel Rubin, the Fooding was supported by [[Jean-François Bizot]] (founder of [[Actuel]] and [[Radio Nova (France)|Radio Nova]]), as well as by Bruno Delport, the director of Novapress. Since 2004, it has been under the support of Marine Bidaud, associate director of the Fooding.

==The guide==

As an independent food guide, Fooding pays the bills for its reviewers, proving this by posting meal receipts on its website. It also refuses to give ad space to the restaurants it reviews in an attempt to remain financially separate. These are the essential conditions, says Cammas, for preserving freedom of expression and taste. In 2012, Cammas published an opinion piece in ''[[Le Monde]]'', discussing the above conditions and defending the [[Michelin Guide]]’s ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/03/05/le-guide-michelin-doit-se-liberer-de-l-influence-des-grands-chefs_1651980_3232.html Le Monde, 05/03/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though written entirely in French, the ''Tips in English'' allow Anglophones to follow the guide as well. The 2013 Fooding Guide, launched this November, now includes a section on favorite restaurants around the world.

==The paper guide==

The first editions of the Fooding guide (2000–2004) were released as special editions of [[Nova Magazine]]: ''Guide Fooding : 1000 adresses pour saliver Paris'' (''The Fooding Guide: 1000 restaurants to drool over in Paris''). In 2003 and 2004, two ''Fooding &amp; Style'' special issues were published as a supplement to Nova Magazine. In 2004, Nova Magazine stopped publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20041207.OBS3123/nova-mag-c-est-fini.html|title=Nova Mag , c'est fini|date=7 December 2004|work=nouvelobs.com|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, its special editions. In November 2005, the Paris Fooding Guide relaunched as a supplement to ''[[Libération]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/hors-serie/0101548670-fooding-le-guide-2006|title=Fooding Le guide 2006|work=liberation.fr|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Louis Dreyfus. In December 2005, the website launched with the online edition of the Paris Guide. The France Fooding Guide was published for the first time in 2006, again in partnership with ''[[Libération]]''. As such, lefooding.com became a national guide.
In 2006 and 2007, the Fooding Guide followed Louis Dreyfus to the [[Nouvel Observateur]],&lt;ref name="e-marketing"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.e-marketing.fr/Breves/Le-guide-Fooding-rejoint-MediaObs-20727.htm |title=Le guide Fooding rejoint MediaObs (Fooding guide meets MediaObs)|journal=Vision Marketing|date=27 March 2007|publisher=e-marketing.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he took up the post of general director. The 2008 France Guide then became a special edition of the Novel Observateur during summer 2007 with the subtitle ''370 restaurants bien de chez nous – Guide vacances été 2007'' (''370 of our restaurants – Summer vacation guide 2007''). The 2008 Paris Guide came out in September 2007 with the subtitle ''400 restaurants pour embrasser le goût de l’époque'' (''400 restaurants that embrace the taste of the times''). In 2008, a few months after the death of Jean-François Bizot, the Fooding office moved in with the Inrockuptibles at the invitation of Frédéric Allary. In November 2008, for the first time in its history, the France Fooding Guide was published autonomously, under the exclusive direction of Alexandre Cammas and Marine Bidaud.

==Le Fooding App==

Launched at the end of October 2010, Le Fooding’s iPhone app was originally available for free until December 31, 2010. The application was downloaded 80,000 times in two months. Since January 1, 2011, the France Guide iPhone app has been available as a paid application (€3.59). It was described in GQ as “the application reserved for gentlemen”. In January 2013, the app was ranked 19th overall in top paid apps and 1st in the Food and Drink category.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.applicationiphone.com/top100/payant/)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Le Fooding Guide app for Android was released on Google Play (€3.59). In 2014, the app is available in English and in a Premium version, which also includes the hotel guide.&lt;ref&gt;(http://fwx.foodandwine.com/secrets/5-cool-hotels-france-le-fooding-s-essential-new-app)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Le Fooding Guide Writers==

Along with Alexandre Cammas (founder) and Yves Nespoulous (editor-in-chief),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefooding.com/la-tribu/ The Tribe [a list of contributors to the Le Fooding Guide&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a large group of authors, journalists, food writers, writers, “bons vivants”, bloggers and multi-talented people regularly contribute to the different editions of The Guide. These contributors include several emblematic figures of gastronomy and lifestyle, including [[:fr:Julie Andrieu|Julie Andrieu]], [[:fr:Sébastien Demorand|Sébastien Demorand]], Trish Deseine, [[:fr:Frédérick Ernestine Grasser Hermé|Frédérick Ernestine Grasser-Hermé]], Dominique Hutin, Emmanuel Rubin (cofounder of Fooding Week in 2000 and former partner in Le Fooding Bureau)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Elle-a-Table/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Dossier-Elle/Fooding-people-22191/EMMANUEL-RUBIN-22208|title=EMMANUEL RUBIN|work=elle.fr|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.slate.fr/source/27089/andrea-petrini Andrea Petrini]. François-Régis Gaudry (journalist at L’Express, France Inter and Paris Première) said on his blog that he bylined his first gastronomy article for Le Fooding Guide in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lexpress.fr/styles/restaurant/about/ L'Express [About François-Régis Gaudry&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many other collaborators made their debut as professional food lovers with Le Fooding Guide: Marie Aline, [http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/keda-black-globe-croqueuse_473928.html Kéda Black], Danièle Gerkens, Jérome Lefort, [http://www.dailyneuvieme.com/Francois-Lemarie-la-fine-bouche-du-9e_a2258.html Francois Lemarie], Elvira Masson, Julia Sammut (former associate at Le Fooding Bureau), [[Victoire Loup]] and Hugo de St Phalle.

==Controversies==
Even though most foreign observers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Le Fooding contributes to the reinvention of the French culinary and event scene on an international scale, this is not always the case in France. Jean-Luc Petitrenaud in VSD wrote that Le Fooding is “a ridiculous trend for a few Parisian journalists looking for fame” (VSD, Winter 2004). Supporters of more traditional cuisine count several French journalistic institutions among Le Fooding’s main detractors. A now-famous debate between the journalist Paul Wermus (anti-Fooding) and Alexandre Cammas during Paul Amar’s TV program, Revu et Corrigé, is regularly featured in TV blooper shows.&lt;ref name="france5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videos.france5.fr/video/iLyROoafYlj6.html|title=Les Vidéos &amp;#124; Revoir les emissions en videos et streaming &amp;#124; France 5|publisher=videos.france5.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2010, during the 10-year anniversary celebration of Le Fooding, then-current French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand surprised the world of gastronomy by presenting Le Fooding Award to a Brittany chef. A couple of days later, journalists Colette Monsat and François Simon questioned him in the November 19, 2010 issue of le Figaro, saying “You preach the values of traditional (French) cuisine but at the same time are an avid supporter of Le Fooding, which you praised this week for its playful, less formal approach to gastronomy.” The Minister responded, “You can love Rembrandt and Basquiat. By appreciating Basquiat, one comes to have a taste for Rembrandt, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/jaime-pot-feu-bouchees-reine-191110-23251|title= J’aime le pot-au-feu et les bouchées à la reine |author=Colette Monsat et François Simon|date=19 November 2010|work=Madame Figaro|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''Golfer's vasculitis''', '''exercise-induced vasculitis''' and '''hiker's rash''', are names proposed by different medical researchers for a form of [[vasculitis]] resulting in a purpuric [[rash]] (bleeding from underlying [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]).&lt;ref name="pmid15670170"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=RI|author2=Opie, J |author3=Nixon, R |title=Golfer's vasculitis.|journal=The Australasian Journal of Dermatology|date=Feb 2005|volume=46|issue=1|pages=11–4|doi=10.1111/j.1440-0960.2005.00127.x|pmid=15670170}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often experienced in the lower legs caused by excessive exercise in hotter temperatures. It is more common among older people.

It is called 'Golfer's' due to the large amount of walking done in [[golf]], as well as it being a sport more popular among older people, resulting in greater incidence of the condition.

A '''health department''' or '''health ministry''' is a part of [[government]] which focuses on issues related to the general [[health]] of the [[citizenry]]. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]], such as [[State (administrative division)|states]], [[county|counties]] and [[city|cities]], often also operate a health department of their own. Health departments perform [[food inspection]]s and other health related inspections (the person who performs this job is often called a [[public health inspector]]), [[vaccination]] programs, free [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] and [[HIV]] tests, tobacco enforcement and cessation programs, and other [[medical]] assistance programs. Health departments also compile [[statistics]] about [[health issues]] of their area.The role of a health department may vary from one country to the other, but their primary objective is always the same; safeguarding and promoting health. In 1986, several of the world's national health departments met to establish an international guideline by which health departments operate. The meeting was in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada, and hence the guidelines established are known as the [[Ottawa Charter]]. The Ottawa Charter was designed to 'achieve Health for All'.

"Health department" can also refer to a [[university]] health [[academic department|department]].

==Around the world==
{{See also|List of health departments and ministries}}

Most [[executive (government)|executive]] governments in the world are divided into departments or [[ministry (government department)|ministries]]. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for coordinating health programs in the country.In Canada, health Canada or Santé Canada (French) is the agency in charge of healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html|title=Health Canada|website=canada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the People's Republic of China, the China Health Ministry initially oversees healthcare before it was dissolved, majority of its functions have now been integrated into the new agency called the National Health Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.nhfpc.gov.cn/|title=Welcome to the website of the National Health Commission of the PRC|website=en.nhfpc.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nigeria, the Federal Ministry of Health supervises the health departments and agencies most of which are located in Abuja the country's capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.ng/ |title=Federal Ministry of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.com.ng/health-department-directory/ |title=Health Department |publisher=Public Health Nigeria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs and services===
With over 100 programs and services, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to "protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/programs/index.html/|title=Programs &amp; Services|first=Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs|last=(ASPA)|date=29 January 2015|website=HHS.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; These federal programs consist of social service programs, [[civil rights]] and healthcare privacy programs, disaster preparedness programs, and health related research. HHS offers a variety of social service programs geared toward persons with low income, [[Disability|disabilities]], military families, and senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/programs/social-services/index.html/|title=Social Services|first=Digital Communications Division (DCD), Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs|last=(ASPA)|date=26 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Healthcare rights are defined under HHS in the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]]) which protect patient's privacy in regards to medical information.

===Federal, state and local departments===

There are three tiers of health departments, the federal level, state level and local level. In relation with state and local government, the federal government provides states with funding to ensure that states are able to retain current programs and are able to implement new programs. The coordination between all three levels is critical to ensure the programs being implemented are well structured for each level. The health department at state level needs to safeguard good relations with legislators as well as governors in order to acquire legal and financial aid to guarantee the development and enhancements of the programs. Assemblies are set up to guide the relationships between state and local heath departments. The state sets up the regulations and health policies whereas the local health departments are the ones implementing the health policies and services.

=== Grants and contracts ===
The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) acts as the most extensive grant funding agency in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/grants/grants/index.html|title=Grants|first=Division of Grants, Office of Grants and Acquisition Policy and Accountability (OGAPA), Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources|last=(ASFR)|date=30 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several grants are delivered to non-government agencies, the majority of HHS federal grants are administered to states, territories, and tribes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficiaries of federal funds are prohibited from lobbying government officials for legislative influence or additional funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/grants/grants/grants-policies-regulations/lobbying-restrictions.html|title=Lobbying Restrictions on Grant Recipients|first=Office of Grants and Acquisition Policy and Accountability (OGAPA), Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources|last=(ASFR)|date=29 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HHS and the [[National Institutes of Health]], are accountable to Congress for conducting research that is amenable to both federal and state regulatory policies and a cost-effective budget.&lt;ref&gt;https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/nihgps.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; HHS uses grants to finance and encourage government research interests. Additionally, HHS routinely sets fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts with private companies in order to obtain products and services for government operations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.psc.gov/docs/default-source/acquisition/federal-contracting-highlights-aligned_wmilestonesprocessflow_v6.pdf?sfvrsn=2&lt;/ref&gt; HHS aims to issue these contracts with adherence to federal contract laws, HHS acquisition policies, and local operating procedures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== United States approach to laws and regulations affecting local, state, and federal health departments  ==

=== History ===
There is some dispute at the local level as to the claim of being the first to establish a local board or health department.  For example, The city of [[Petersburg, Virginia]] claims it established the first permanent board of health in 1780;&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Department of Health. Go to Virginia Department of Health. http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/three-rivers/history/. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] claims it is established the first US health department in 1793,&lt;ref&gt;About The Baltimore City Health Department. Baltimore City Health Department. https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/20. Published March 30, 2016. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] followed 1794, claiming its Board of Health as “one of the first”;&lt;ref&gt;Agency History. Philadelphia Department of Public Health. http://www.phila.gov/phils/docs/inventor/graphics/agencies/A080.htm. Published April 24, 2000. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Boston, Massachusetts]] claims in 1799 it established the first board of health and the first health department, with Paul Revere named as the first health officer.&lt;ref&gt;Our History. Boston Public Health Commission. http://www.bphc.org/aboutus/our-history/Pages/our-history.aspx. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, [[Louisiana]] was the first state to create a state board of health in 1855,&lt;ref&gt;History. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners. http://www.lsbme.la.gov/content/history. Published 2014. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; but it functioned primarily to influence regulations in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;Everard W. New Orleans Health Department Records, City Archives. New Orleans Public Library. http://nutrias.org/inv/health.htm. Published December 10, 2001. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Massachusetts was the first to establish a state board that functioned throughout its state with statewide authority in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;State Board of Health of Massachusetts: a brief history of its organization and its work, 1869-1912 : material compiled mainly from the reports of the Board : Massachusetts. Dept. of Public Health Streaming. Internet Archive. https://archive.org/details/stateboardofheal00mass. Published January 1, 1970. Accessed September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the national level, a simple National Board of Health functioned from 1879-1883,&lt;ref&gt;Michael JM. The National Board of Health: 1879–1883. Public Health Reports. 2011;126(1):123-129. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001811/&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1939 that another federal agency that operated to manage public health on a national level was established, going from a federal agency called the Federal Security Agency that had health functions such as the [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), and the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).  In 1953, that agency was reorganized and its health functions were elevated to a cabinet-level position to establish the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW), which was renamed in 1980 to become the current and modern [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).

====Current laws and regulations at each level of government====
HHS notes the laws and regulations that it carries out on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA). Laws &amp; Regulations. HHS.gov. https://www.hhs.gov/regulations/index.html. Published March 18, 2016. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Every state also has a health department to which HHS has given a description and hyperlink for each state health department.&lt;ref&gt;State Health Departments. Healthfinder.gov. https://healthfinder.gov/FindServices/SearchContext.aspx?show=1&amp;topic=820. Published September 17, 2017. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other levels of government within each state are varied. For example, the [[California Department of Public Health]] (CDPH) has within it a health department in each of its 58 subdivisions called counties, but in only three cities.&lt;ref&gt;Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). Research. [http://astho.org/Research/State-and-Local-Public-Health-Relationships State and Local Public Health Relationships.] Published May 2012.

[[Guinea]] faces a number of ongoing health challenges.

== Health infrastructure ==
Guinea has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldis.org/healthsystems/userfees/background.htm |title=User fees for health: a background |accessdate=28 December 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061128203803/http://www.eldis.org/healthsystems/userfees/background.htm |archivedate = 28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in health indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10173105&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea |accessdate=28 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographic research conducted in rural and urban areas of the Republic of Guinea explored perceived distinctions between biomedical and traditional health practices and found that these distinctions shape parental decisions in seeking infant health care, with 93% of all health expenditure taking place outside the state sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leach|first=M|title=New therapeutic landscapes in Africa: Parental categories and practices in seeking infant health in the Republic of Guinea|journal=Social Science and Medicine|date=May 2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2157–2167|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/new-therapeutic-landscapes-in-africa-parental-categories-and.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.039|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the Guinean government announced the establishment of an air solidarity levy on all flights taking off from national soil, with funds going to [[UNITAID]] to support expanded access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.&lt;ref&gt;UNITAID. [http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html ''Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.''] Accessed 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea is among the growing number of countries and development partners using market-based transactions taxes and other [[innovative financing]] mechanisms to expand financing options for health care in resource-limited settings.

Lacking a sufficient response from the international community during the Ebola outbreak, the health infrastructure was augmented through laboratories and hospital facilities through non-governmental actors such as [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]], [[UC Rusal]], or the [[Ebola Private Sector Mobilisation Group]] (EPSMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/press-release/guinea-mobilization-against-ebola-epidemic|title=Guinea: Mobilization Against Ebola Epidemic|date=2014-03-31|work=MSF USA|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Ebol-and-the-Private-Sector-oxfam.pdf|title=Ebola and the Private Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxfam|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uc-rusal-opens-a-modern-epidemiology-centre-in-guinea-288999071.html|title=UC RUSAL Opens a Modern Epidemiology Centre in Guinea|last=RUSAL|first=UC|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health status ==
=== Life expectancy ===
The 2014 CIA estimated average life expectancy in Guinea was 59.60 years.&lt;ref name=iuonoa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook Life Expectancy|publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ebola ===
{{See|2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak}}

[[File:Ebola Map from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in summer 2014 (animated).gif|thumb|350px|A situation map of the [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|Ebola outbreak]] as of 18 June 2014.]]
In 2014 there was an outbreak of the [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|Ebola virus in Guinea]]. In response, the health ministry banned [[Bushmeat|the sale and consumption of bats]], thought to be carriers of the disease. Despite this measure, the virus eventually spread from rural areas to Conakry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 28 March 2014 |title= Ebola: Guinea outbreak reaches capital Conakry |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774343 |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Guinea}}

An estimated 170,000 adults and children were infected at the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_GIN.pdf |title=Status of HIV/AIDS in Guinea, 2005 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |year=2005 |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organisation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/GlobalAtlas/predefinedReports/EFS2006/EFS_PDFs/EFS2006_GN.pdf |title=Epidemiological Fact Sheets: HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections, December 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |date=December 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053159/http://www.who.int/GlobalAtlas/predefinedReports/EFS2006/EFS_PDFs/EFS2006_GN.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance surveys conducted in 2001 and 2002 show higher rates of HIV in urban areas than in rural areas. Prevalence was highest in [[Conakry]] (5%) and in the cities of the [[Forest Guinea]] region (7%) bordering [[Côte d’Ivoire]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/guinea_05.pdf|title=Health Profile: Guinea|publisher=[[USAID]]|date=March 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113214710/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/guinea_05.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2008}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV is spread primarily through multiple-partner [[heterosexual]] intercourse. Men and women are at nearly equal risk for HIV, with young people aged 15 to 24 most vulnerable. Surveillance figures from 2001–2002 show high rates among commercial sex workers (42%), active military personnel (6.6%), truck drivers and bush taxi drivers (7.3%), miners (4.7%), and adults with tuberculosis (8.6%).&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Several factors are fueling the HIV/[[AIDS]] epidemic in Guinea. They include unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, illiteracy, endemic poverty, unstable borders, refugee migration, lack of civic responsibility, and scarce medical care and public services.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

===Malnutrition===
Malnutrition is a serious problem for Guinea. A 2012 study reported high chronic malnutrition rates, with levels ranging from 34% to 40% by region, as well as acute malnutrition rates above 10% in Upper Guinea’s mining zones. The survey showed that 139,200 children suffer from acute malnutrition, 609,696 from chronic malnutrition and further 1,592,892 suffer from anemia. Degradation of care practices, limited access to medical services, inadequate hygiene practices and a lack of food diversity explain these levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/eb/wfpdoc062106.pdf |title=Enquête nationale nutrition-santé,basée sur la méthodologie SMART, 2011-2012 |accessdate=12 May 2014 |year=2012 |format=PDF |publisher=World Food Programme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal and child healthcare===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Guinea is 680. This is compared with 859.9 in 2008 and 964.7 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 146 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 29. In Guinea the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 1 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 26.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State of the World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In ovo''' is Latin for '''in the egg'''. In medical usage it refers to the growth of live virus in chicken egg embryos for vaccine development for human use, as well as an effective method for vaccination of poultry against various [[Avian influenza]] and [[Coronavirus|coronaviruses]]. During the [[Incubator (culture)|incubation period]], the virus replicates in the cells that make up the [[chorioallantoic membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricks CA, Avakian A, Bryan T, Gildersleeve R, Haddad E, Ilich R, King S, Murray L, Phelps P, Poston R, Whitfill C, Williams C. In ovo vaccination technology. Adv Vet Med. 1999;41:495-515.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/influenza/Flu_vacc_manuf_tech_report.pdf|title=http://who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/influenza/Flu_vacc_manuf_tech_report.pdf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of In ovo method ==

In human vaccine development, the main advantage is rapid propagation, and high yield, of viruses for vaccine production. This method is most commonly used for growth of influenza virus, both [[attenuated vaccine]] and [[inactivated vaccine]] forms. It is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] in managing influenza pandemics because it is high-yield and cost effective. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In poultry, In ovo vaccination improves hatchability and efficient protection against [[Avian influenza]] (AI), [[Newcastle disease]] (ND) and [[Coronavirus|Coronaviruses]] (Av-CoV). Seroconversion rates of chickens vaccinated as embryos ranged from 27% to 100% with ND vaccination and 85% to 100% for AI vaccination. The birds are protected before delivery to a commercial operation such as a farm, thus preventing the spread of Avian viruses. &lt;ref&gt;Yibin Cai12, Haichen Song3, Jianqiang Ye12, Hongxia Shao12, Rangarajan Padmanabhan124, Troy C Sutton12 and Daniel R Perez12*. Improved hatchability and efficient protection after in ovo vaccination with live-attenuated H7N2 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. Virology Journal 2011, 8:31 do&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone H, Mitchell B, Brugh M. In ovo vaccination of chicken embryos with experimental Newcastle disease and avian influenza oil-emulsion vaccines. Avian Dis. 1997 Oct-Dec;41(4):856-63&lt;/ref&gt; 

== In Ovo Vaccination in Poultry ==

In ovo vaccination is carried out by machines. These machines perform a number of actions to ensure good vaccination of the chick inside the egg. Benefits of In ovo vaccination include avoidance of bird stress, controlled hygienic conditions, and earlier immunity with less interference from maternal antibodies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/23983/inovo-vaccination-benefits-for-small-hatcheries/|title=In-Ovo Vaccination: Benefits for Small Hatcheries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated pest management''' ('''IPM'''), also known as '''integrated pest control''' ('''IPC''') is a broad-based approach that integrates practices for economic control of [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s. IPM aims to suppress pest populations below the economic injury level (EIL). The UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] defines IPM as "the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AGP - Integrated Pest Management | url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/core-themes/theme/pests/ipm/en/ |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entomologist]]s and [[ecologist]]s have urged the adoption of IPM pest control since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=knipling&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knipling | first1 = EF | year = 1972 | title = Entomology and the Management of Man's Environment | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Entomology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 153–167 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1972.tb01618.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPM allows for safer pest control.{{clarify|reason=safer than what?|date=April 2013}}

The introduction and spread of [[invasive species]] can also be managed with IPM by reducing risks while maximizing benefits and reducing costs.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = M.

== History ==

Shortly after World War II, when synthetic [[insecticide]]s became widely available, entomologists in California developed the concept of "supervised insect control".&lt;ref name=Smith&amp;Smith&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.F.|author2=Smith, G.L.|title=Supervised control of insects: Utilizes parasites and predators and makes chemical control more efficient|journal=California Agriculture|date=May 1949|volume=3|issue=5|pages=3–12|url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca305p3-71369.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430102123/http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca305p3-71369.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, entomologists in the US [[Cotton Belt (region)|Cotton Belt]] were advocating a similar approach. Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and natural-enemy populations. This was viewed as an alternative to calendar-based programs. Supervised control was based on knowledge of the ecology and analysis of projected trends in pest and natural-enemy populations.

Supervised control formed much of the conceptual basis for the "integrated control" that University of California entomologists articulated in the 1950s. Integrated control sought to identify the best mix of chemical and biological controls for a given insect pest. Chemical insecticides were to be used in the manner least disruptive to biological control. The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.

IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all tactics. Controls such as pesticides were to be applied as in integrated control, but these now had to be compatible with tactics for all classes of pests. Other tactics, such as host-plant resistance and cultural manipulations, became part of the IPM framework. IPM combined entomologists, [[plant pathologist]]s, [[nematologist]]s and weed scientists.

In the United States, IPM was formulated into national policy in February 1972 when President [[Richard Nixon]] directed federal agencies to take steps to advance the application of IPM in all relevant sectors. In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] established an interagency IPM Coordinating Committee to ensure development and implementation of IPM practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acosta|first=EW|title=The History of Integrated Pest Management (IPM)|year=1995–2006|publisher = BioControl Reference Center |url=http://www.biconet.com/reference/IPMhistory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perry Adkisson]] and [[Ray F. Smith]] received the 1997 [[World Food Prize]] for encouraging the use of IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/laureates/19871999_laureates/1997_smith_and_adkisson/ |title=1997: Smith and Adkisson |publisher=The World Food Prize Foundation |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

IPM is used in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], forestry, human habitations, [[preventive conservation]] and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management.

== Principles ==

An American IPM system is designed around six basic components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title=Integrated Pest Management (IMP) Principles|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/ipm.htm |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Acceptable pest levels'''—The emphasis is on ''control'', not ''eradication''. IPM holds that wiping out an entire pest population is often impossible, and the attempt can be expensive and unsafe. IPM programmes first work to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls if those thresholds are crossed.  These thresholds are pest and site specific, meaning that it may be acceptable at one site to have a weed such as [[white clover]], but not at another site. Allowing a pest population to survive at a reasonable threshold reduces selection pressure. This lowers the rate at which a pest develops resistance to a control, because if almost all pests are killed then those that have [[Pesticide resistance|resistance]] will provide the genetic basis of the future population. Retaining a significant number of unresistant specimens dilutes the prevalence of any resistant genes that appear. Similarly, the repeated use of a single class of controls will create pest populations that are more resistant to that class, whereas alternating among classes helps prevent this.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* '''Preventive cultural practices'''—Selecting varieties best for local growing conditions and maintaining healthy crops is the first line of defense. Plant [[quarantine]] and 'cultural techniques' such as [[crop  sanitation]] are next, e.g., removal of diseased plants, and cleaning pruning shears to prevent spread of [[infection]]s. Beneficial [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] are added to the potting media of [[horticultural]] crops vulnerable to root diseases, greatly reducing the need for [[fungicide]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* '''Monitoring'''—Regular observation is critically important. Observation is broken into inspection and identification.{{sfn|Bennett|Owens|Corrigan|2010}} Visual inspection, insect and spore traps, and other methods are used to monitor pest levels. Record-keeping is essential, as is a thorough knowledge of target pest behavior and reproductive cycles. Since insects are cold-blooded, their physical development is dependent on area temperatures. Many insects have had their development cycles modeled in terms of [[Growing degree-day|degree-days]]. The degree days of an environment determines the optimal time for a specific insect outbreak. Plant pathogens follow similar patterns of response to weather and season.
* '''Mechanical controls'''—Should a pest reach an unacceptable level, mechanical methods are the first options. They include simple hand-picking, barriers, traps, vacuuming and [[tillage]] to disrupt breeding.
* '''[[Biological pest control|Biological controls]]'''—Natural biological processes and materials can provide control, with acceptable environmental impact, and often at lower cost. The main approach is to promote [[beneficial insects]] that eat or parasitize target pests. [[Biological insecticide]]s, derived from naturally occurring [[microorganism]]s (''e.g.''—[[Bacillus thuringiensis|''Bt'']], [[entomopathogenic fungi]] and [[entomopathogenic nematode]]s), also fall in this category. Further 'biology-based' or '[[Ecologic pesticides and herbicides|ecological]]' techniques are under evaluation.
* '''[[Pesticide application|Responsible use]]'''—Synthetic [[pesticides]] are used as required and often only at specific times in a pest's life cycle. Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (''e.g.''—[[nicotine]], [[pyrethrum]] and insect [[juvenile hormone]] analogues), but the [[toxophore]] or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Applications of pesticides must reach their intended targets. Matching the application technique to the crop, the pest, and the pesticide is critical. The use of low-volume spray equipment reduces overall pesticide use and labor cost.

An IPM regime can be simple or sophisticated. Historically, the main focus of IPM programmes was on agricultural insect pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPM Guidelines|url=http://www.umass.edu/umext/ipm/publications/guidelines/index.html|publisher=UMassAmherst—Integrated Pest Management, Agriculture and Landscape Program|accessdate=13 March 2012|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312110559/http://www.umass.edu/umext/ipm/publications/guidelines/index.html|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds and other pests that interfere with management objectives for sites such as residential and commercial structures, [[lawn]] and [[Grass|turf]] areas, and home and [[community garden]]s.

== Process ==

IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic, ecological and social consequences&lt;ref name=Sandler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandler|first=Hilary A.|title=Integrated Pest Management|journal=Cranberry Station Best Management Practices|year=2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations. The IPM process starts with monitoring, which includes inspection and identification, followed by the establishment of economic injury levels.  The economic injury levels set the economic threshold level.  That is the point when pest damage (and the benefits of treating the pest) exceed the cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Pest Control, Mallis, Arnold, 10th edition, Hedges, Stoy, Editor. pp.1499-1500&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also be an action threshold level for determining an unacceptable level that is not tied to economic injury.  Action thresholds are more common in structural pest management and economic injury levels in classic agricultural pest management. An example of an action threshold is one fly in a hospital operating room is not acceptable, but one fly in a pet kennel would be acceptable.  Once a threshold has been crossed by the pest population action steps need to be taken to reduce and control the pest.  Integrated pest management employ a variety of actions including cultural controls, including physical barriers, biological controls, including adding and conserving natural predators and enemies to the pest, and finally chemical controls or pesticides.  Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation and integration of multiple techniques makes IPM appropriate for [[organic farming]] (excluding synthetic  pesticides). These may or may not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI)&lt;ref&gt;Organic Materials Review Institute, "The OMRI Product List," http://www.omri.org/OMRI_about_list.html approved product list.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in organic farming and [[organic gardening]] are generally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.&lt;ref name=pot&gt;Pottorff LP. [http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4DMG/VegFruit/organic.htm Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening]. Colorado State University Cooperative Extension.&lt;/ref&gt; For conventional farms IPM can reduce human and environmental exposure to [[hazard]]ous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs.

Risk assessment usually includes four issues: 1) characterization of biological control agents, 2) health risks, 3) environmental risks and 4) efficacy.&lt;ref name=consoli&gt;{{cite book|first1=Fernando L. |last1=Consoli|first2=José Roberto Postali |last2=Parra|first3=Roberto Antônio |last3=Zucchi|title=Egg Parasitoids in Agroecosystems with Emphasis on ''Trichogramma''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtlhlYFH9RgC|date=28 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9110-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistaken identification of a pest may result in ineffective actions. E.g., plant damage due to over-watering could be mistaken for [[fungal infection]], since many fungal and viral infections arise under moist conditions.

Monitoring begins immediately, before the pest's activity becomes significant. Monitoring of agricultural pests includes tracking soil/planting media fertility and water quality. Overall plant health and resistance to pests is greatly influenced by [[pH]], [[alkalinity]], of dissolved mineral and oxygen reduction potential. Many diseases are waterborne, spread directly by irrigation water and indirectly by splashing.

Once the pest is known, knowledge of its lifecycle provides the optimal intervention points.&lt;ref name=Metcalf&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Insect Pest Management|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=266|first1=Robert Lee |last1=Metcalf|first2=William Henry |last2=Luckmann&lt;!-- |accessdate=13 March 2012 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, weeds reproducing from last year's seed can be prevented with mulches and pre-emergent herbicide.

Pest-tolerant crops such as [[soybeans]] may not warrant interventions unless the pests are numerous or rapidly increasing. Intervention is warranted if the expected cost of damage by the pest is more than the cost of control. Health hazards may require intervention that is not warranted by economic considerations.

Specific sites may also have varying requirements. E.g., white clover may be acceptable on the sides of a tee box on a [[golf course]], but unacceptable in the [[fairway (golf)|fairway]] where it could confuse the field of play.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University Turf Pest Management Correspondence Course, Introduction, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible interventions include mechanical/physical, cultural, biological and chemical. Mechanical/physical controls include picking pests off plants, or using netting or other material to exclude pests such as [[bird]]s from [[grape]]s or [[rodent]]s from structures. Cultural controls include keeping an area free of conducive conditions by removing waste or diseased plants, flooding, sanding, and the use of disease-resistant crop varieties.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;  Biological controls are numerous. They include: conservation of natural predators or augmentation of natural predators, [[sterile insect technique]] (SIT).&lt;ref name=Klassen /&gt;

Augmentation, inoculative release and inundative release are different methods of biological control that affect the target pest in different ways. Augmentative control includes the periodic introduction of predators.&lt;ref name=linda&gt;{{cite book|first1=Linda |last1=Thomson |first2=David |last2=Bennett |first3=DeAnn |last3=Glenn |first4=Ary |last4=Hoffman |title=Developing Trichogramma as a Pest Management Tool |editor1=Opender Koul|editor2=G.

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an area-wide IPM program that introduces sterile male pests into the pest population to trick females into (unsuccessful) breeding encounters, providing a form of [[birth control]] and reducing reproduction rates.&lt;ref name=Klassen&gt;{{cite book|title=Sterile Insect Technique: Principles and Practice in Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=4–28|author=W.

Robinson|chapter=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological controls mentioned above only appropriate in extreme cases, because in the introduction of new species, or supplementation of naturally occurring species can have detrimental ecosystem effects. Biological controls can be used to stop invasive species or pests, but they can become an introduction path for new pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babendreier|first=Dirk|title=Biological Invasion: Pros and Cons of Biological Control|journal=Ecological Studies|year=2007|volume=193|issue=7|pages=403–414|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36920-2_23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical controls include [[horticultural oil]]s or the application of insecticides and herbicides. A [[green pest management]] IPM program uses pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring materials.

Pesticides can be classified by their modes of action. Rotating among materials with different modes of action minimizes pest resistance.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;

Evaluation is the process of assessing whether the intervention was effective, whether it produced unacceptable side effects, whether to continue, revise or abandon the program.{{sfn|Bennett|Owens|Corrigan|2010|p=12}}

== Southeast Asia ==

The [[Green Revolution]] of the 1960s and '70s introduced sturdier plants that could support the heavier grain loads resulting from intensive fertilizer use. Pesticide imports by 11 [[Southeast Asia]]n countries grew nearly sevenfold in value between 1990 and 2010, according to FAO statistics, with disastrous results. Rice farmers become accustomed to spraying soon after planting, triggered by signs of the leaf folder moth, which appears early in the growing season. It causes only superficial damage and doesn't reduce yields. In 1986, Indonesia banned 57 pesticides and completely stopped subsidizing their use. Progress was reversed in the 2000s, when growing production capacity, particularly in China, reduced prices. Rice production in Asia more than doubled. But it left farmers believing more is better—whether it's seed, fertilizer, or pesticides.&lt;ref name=s1308&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Normile | first1 = D. | title = Vietnam Turns Back a 'Tsunami of Pesticides' | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.737 | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6147 | pages = 737–738 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23950527| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brown planthopper]], ''Nilaparvata lugens'', the farmers' main target, has become increasingly resistant. Since 2008, outbreaks have devastated rice harvests throughout Asia, but not in the Mekong Delta. Reduced spraying allowed natural predators to neutralize planthoppers in Vietnam. In 2010 and 2011, massive planthopper outbreaks hit 400,000 hectares of Thai rice fields, causing losses of about $64 million. The Thai government is now pushing the "no spray in the first 40 days" approach.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

By contrast early spraying kills frogs, spiders, wasps and dragonflies that prey on the later-arriving and dangerous planthopper and produced resistant strains. Planthoppers now require pesticide doses 500 times greater than originally. Overuse indiscriminately kills beneficial insects and decimates bird and amphibian populations. Pesticides are suspected of harming human health and became a common means for rural Asians to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

In 2001, scientists challenged 950 Vietnamese farmers to try IPM. In one plot, each farmer grew rice using their usual amounts of seed and fertilizer, applying pesticide as they chose. In a nearby plot, less seed and fertilizer were used and no pesticides were applied for 40 days after planting. Yields from the experimental plots was as good or better and costs were lower, generating 8% to 10% more net income. The experiment led to the "three reductions, three gains" campaign, claiming that cutting the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticide would boost yield, quality and income. Posters, leaflets, TV commercials and a 2004 radio soap opera that featured a rice farmer who gradually accepted the changes. It didn't hurt that a 2006 planthopper outbreak hit farmers using insecticides harder than those who didn't. [[Mekong Delta]] farmers cut insecticide spraying from five times per crop cycle to zero to one.

The Plant Protection Center and the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) have been encouraging farmers to grow flowers, [[okra]] and beans on [[rice paddy]] banks, instead of stripping vegetation, as was typical. The plants attract bees and a tiny wasp that eats planthopper eggs, while the vegetables diversify farm incomes.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

Agriculture companies offer bundles of pesticides with seeds and fertilizer, with incentives for volume purchases. A proposed law in Vietnam requires licensing pesticide dealers and government approval of advertisements to prevent exaggerated claims. Insecticides that target other pests, such as ''[[Scirpophaga incertulas]]'' (stem borer), the larvae of moth species that feed on rice plants allegedly yield gains of 21% with proper use.&lt;ref name=s1308/&gt;

'''Irwin Altman''' (born July 16, 1930 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), is a [[list of social psychologists|social psychologist]] who earned his B.A. degree from [[New York University]] in 1951, his M.A. degree from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1954 and his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1957. He is active in many groups and associations including the [[International Association of Applied Psychology]], [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[American Association of University Professors]], [[Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues]], [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]], [[Society of Personality and Social Psychology]], [[Association for the Study of Man-Environment Relations]], [[Environmental Design Research Association]], and the [[Western Psychological Association]]. He is currently an emeritus faculty member at the [[University of Utah]], [[Salt Lake City]].

==Social penetration theory==
{{main|Social penetration theory}}

Altman is famous for his work with Taylor resulting in the [[social penetration theory]], which generally states that as relationships develop, communication moves from relatively shallow, non-intimate levels to deeper, more personal levels. If conversation is pleasant and rewarding, people will offer more information about themselves to each other that covers more areas of their life and is more sensitive to them.

==Environmental psychology==
Altman also did work in the field of [[environmental psychology]]. He believes there is a strong relationship between environmental psychology and social psychology and that the two disciplines have much to offer each other. Altman's Human Behavior and the Environment series added volumes on intellectual traditions (Altman &amp; Christensen 1990), place attachment (Altman &amp; Low 1992), and women and the environment (Altman &amp; Churchman 1994). Much of his work following his Social Penetration Theory looked at human behavior and interactions with the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">The '''Kraus–Weber test''' (or '''K–W test'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=K–W Test |url=http://theleanberets.com/approved-resources/k-w-test/ |publisher=Lean Berets |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fitness test devised by [[Hans Kraus]] and Sonja Weber of New York Presbyterian Hospital.

The Kraus–Weber test involved six simple movements&lt;ref name=livestrong&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/476026-kraus-weber-exercises/ |title=Kraus–Weber Exercises |first=William |last=Lynch |publisher=livestrong.com |date=2017-09-11 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took 90 seconds to administer. Some early studies using this test were performed by [[Bonnie Prudden]]. In 1940s and 1950s, she applied this test to students in her conditioning classes. To her surprise the new students failed the test at 58% while the students who had been in the program failed at only 8%. Over a period of seven years, Prudden and her volunteers tested 4,458 children between the ages of 6 and 16 in the United States. The failure rate was 56.6%. While climbing in Europe, Prudden and Kraus arranged to test children in Europe. In Italy, Austria and Switzerland, the children tested exhibited an eight percent failure rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prudden|first=Bonnie|title=Expert Tells Why U.S. Children Below Foreign Physical Standards|newspaper=The Springfield Daily News|date=April 28, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Prudden and Kraus began writing papers for medical and physical education journals concerning their findings on ''Hypokinetic Disease: Role of Inactivity in Production of Disease'' and various media outlets began to pick up the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraus|first=Hans|author2=Bonnie Prudden|title=Comparison of Fitness of Danish and American School Children|journal=Research Quarterly, American Association for Health, Education and Recreation|year=1961|volume=32|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, armed with statistics and a personal invitation to the Eisenhower White House, Bonnie Prudden presented her findings on the fitness level of American public school children compared to that of their peers in Europe. This became known as ''The Report that Shocked the President''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyle|first=Robert|date=15 August 1955|title=The report that shocked the president|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42737/32/1|journal=Sports Illustrated|publisher=|volume=|pages=30–32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Ron |title=Kraus–Weber Test History &amp; Bonnie Prudden |url=http://theleanberets.com/kraus-weber-test-history-bonnie-prudden/ |publisher=Lean Berets |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Shape of the Nation''.

The six exercises involved in the test are:&lt;ref name=livestrong/&gt;
# A simple sit-up with knees bent and feet planted
# A sit-up with legs extended and not bent
# Raising feet while lying on the back
# Raising head, chest and shoulders off the ground while lying on the stomach
# Raising legs off the ground while lying on the stomach
# With knees straight, bending forward to touch the floor

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">'''Manual handling of loads''' (MHL), '''manual material handling''' (MMH) involves the use of the human body to lift, lower, fill, empty, or carry loads.&lt;ref name=mmh&gt;Cheung, Zin, Rick Hight, Ken Jackson, Jitan Patel, and Fran Wagner, (2007). [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-131/ Ergonomic Guidelines for Manual Material Handling] DHHS Publication 2007-131. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The load can be animate (a person or animal) or inanimate (an object). Most manufacturing or distribution systems require some manual handling tasks. Though decreasing lately, the rate of workers in the [[EU-25]] that report carrying or moving heavy loads, is still high (34.5%), reaching 38.0% in the [[EU-10]]. When performed incorrectly or excessively, these tasks may expose workers to physical risk factors, fatigue, and injury.&lt;ref name=mhia&gt;Material Handling Industry of America, (2001). [http://www.mhia.org/industrygroups/cicmhe/publications Publications &amp; resources: 2001 progress in material handling practice] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080422220606/http://www.mhia.org/industrygroups/cicmhe/publications |date=2008-04-22 }}. Retrieved October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  A variety of MMH techniques and tools exist to alleviate these potential problems.&lt;ref name=spine&gt;Triano, John J., and Nancy C. Selby, (2006, September 27). Manual material handling to prevent back injury. Retrieved October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK all organisations have a duty to protect employees from injury from manual handling activities and this is outlined in The Manual Handling Operations (MHO) Regulations 1992. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/manual-handling Manual Handling 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manual handling hazards==
Any job that involves heavy labor or manual material handling may include a high risk for injury on the job. Manual material handling entails lifting, but also usually includes climbing, pushing, pulling, and pivoting, all of which pose the risk of [[Back injury|injury to the back]].&lt;ref name=spine /&gt; MMH work contributes to a large percentage of a 1.1 million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported annually in the United States. Musculoskeletal disorders often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs. Potentially injurious tasks may involve bending and twisting, repetitive motions, carrying or lifting heavy loads, and maintaining fixed positions for a long time. MMH under these conditions can lead to damaged muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels.&lt;ref name=mmh /&gt;
Remember your health comes first, it is temporary so make good use of it.

==Safe manual handling techniques==
Ergonomic intervention in manual handling can decrease injuries and increase worker productivity.&lt;ref name=mmh /&gt;

===Lifting===
Lifting containers can strain the lumbar vertebrae when done improperly. Ergonomic lifting techniques involve keeping loads close to the body and near the person's [[Center of mass|center of gravity]], using diagonal foot positions, and moving loads at waist height rather than directly from the floor.

===Climbing===
When climbing with a load, safe material handling includes maintaining contact with the ladder or stairs at three points (two hands and a foot or both feet and a hand). Bulky loads would require a second person or a mechanical device to assist.&lt;ref name=spine /&gt;

===Pushing and pulling===
Manual material handling may require pushing or pulling. Pushing is generally easier on the back than pulling. It is important to use both the arms and legs to provide the leverage to start the push.&lt;ref name=spine /&gt;

===Pivoting===
When moving containers, handlers are safer when pivoting their shoulders, hips and feet with the load in front at all times rather than twisting their back. The lower back is not designed to torque or for repetitive twisting.&lt;ref name=spine /&gt;

      <comment>In ancient Greek all "atom" meant was indivisible, so when they say that atoms make up the world it means that there is some level of granularity beyond which you cannot subdivide. It was thought that we had found that with what we now call atoms, but as it turns out that was not the case. As such, "the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible" isn't appropriate because atom meant something different then.</comment>

This formulation ("Polish and naturalized-French") has been found to be the best way to reflect Curie's connections to both of these countries.--&gt; [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who conducted pioneering research on [[radioactivity]]. She was the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first woman]] to win a [[Nobel Prize]], the first person and only woman to [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|win twice]], the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the [[Nobel Prize#Family laureates|Curie family legacy]] of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the [[Panthéon]] in Paris.

She was born in [[Warsaw]], in what was then the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], part of the [[Russian Empire]]. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine [[Flying University]] and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister [[Bronisława Dłuska|Bronisława]] to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with her husband [[Pierre Curie]] and with physicist [[Henri Becquerel]]. She won the 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

Her achievements included the development of the theory of ''radioactivity'' (a term that she coined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/4.html|title = The Discovery of Radioactivity|date = |accessdate = |website = [[Berkeley Lab]]|publisher = |last = |first = |quote = The term radioactivity was actually coined by Marie Curie […].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/nobelprize_info/curie-edu.html|title = Marie Curie and the radioactivity, The 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics|date = |accessdate = |website = nobelprize.org|publisher = |last = |first = |quote = Marie called this radiation radioactivity – "radio" means radiation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), techniques for isolating radioactive [[isotope]]s, and the discovery of two elements, [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of [[neoplasm]]s were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institutes in Paris]] and [[Curie Institute (Warsaw)|in Warsaw]], which remain major centres of medical research today. During [[World War I]], she developed mobile radiography units to provide [[X-ray]] services to [[field hospital]]s.

Skłodowska Curie", in the infobox.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was granted to "Marie Sklodowska Curie" [[:File:Marie Skłodowska-Curie's Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911.jpg]].&lt;/ref&gt; never lost her sense of [[national identity|Polish identity]]. She taught her daughters the [[Polish language]] and took them on visits to Poland.&lt;ref name="goldsmith"/&gt; She named the first [[chemical element]] that she discovered in 1898 ''polonium'', after her native country.{{efn|Poland had been partitioned in the 18th century among Russia, Prussia and Austria, and it was Maria Skłodowska Curie's hope that naming the element after her native country would bring world attention to Poland's lack of independence as a sovereign state. [[Polonium]] may have been the first chemical element named to highlight a political question.&lt;ref name="independence"/&gt;}}

Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a [[sanatorium]] in [[Sancellemoz]] ([[Haute-Savoie]]), France, of [[aplastic anemia]] from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Zz7Q-zZ4onc|"The Genius of Marie Curie: The Woman Who Lit Up the World"}} (a 2013 [[BBC]] documentary).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
[[File:Sklodowski Family Wladyslaw and his daughters Maria Bronislawa Helena.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Władysław Skłodowski with daughters ''(from left)'' Maria, [[Bronisława Dłuska|Bronisława]], [[:pl:Helena Skłodowska-Szaley|Helena]], 1890]]
Maria Skłodowska was born in [[Warsaw]], in [[Congress Poland]] in the [[Russian Empire]], on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, ''née'' Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; The elder siblings of Maria ([[nickname]]d ''Mania'') were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed ''Zosia''), [[:pl:Józef Skłodowski (lekarz)|Józef]] (born 1863, nicknamed ''Józio''), [[Bronisława Dłuska|Bronisława]] (born 1865, nicknamed ''Bronia'') and [[:pl:Helena Skłodowska-Szaley|Helena]] (born 1866, nicknamed ''Hela'').&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Radiance: The Epic Rise and Dramatic Fall of the Atomic Era|last=Nelson|first=Craig|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4516-6045-6|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTcGAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=bronislawa%20bronya&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the [[January Uprising]] of 1863–65).&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Maria's paternal grandfather, [[:pl:Józef Skłodowski|Józef Skłodowski]], had been a respected teacher in [[Lublin]], where he taught the young [[Bolesław Prus#Early years|Bolesław Prus]],&lt;ref name="robert1"/&gt; who would become a leading figure in Polish literature.&lt;ref name="undoubtedly"/&gt;

Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]]'' for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)"/&gt; He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt; Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt; She died of [[tuberculosis]] in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt; Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of [[typhus]] contracted from a boarder.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt; Maria's father was an [[atheist]]; her mother a devout Catholic.&lt;ref name="Barker2011" /&gt; The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie" /&gt;

When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; After a collapse, possibly due to [[Depression (mood)|depression]],&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt; she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine [[Flying University]] (sometimes translated as ''Floating University''), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)" /&gt;
[[File:Maria Sklodowska et sa sœur Bronislawa en 1886.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Maria Skłodowska (left) with sister [[Bronisława Dłuska|Bronisława]], ca. 1886]]
Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; In connection with this, Maria took a position as [[governess]]: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in [[Szczuki, Masovian Voivodeship|Szczuki]] with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, [[Kazimierz Żorawski]], a future eminent mathematician.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]], he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the [[Curie Institute, Warsaw|Radium Institute]] that she had founded in 1932.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert2"/&gt;

At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few months earlier had married [[Kazimierz Dłuski]], a Polish physician and social and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; All that time she continued to [[Autodidacticism|educate herself]], reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the [[Museum of Industry and Agriculture]] at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]] 66'', near [[Warsaw Old Town|Warsaw's Old Town]].&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt; The laboratory was run by her cousin [[Józef Boguski]], who had been an assistant in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Polish Girlhood (1867–1891)1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teachers"/&gt;

===New life in Paris===
In late 1891, she left Poland for France.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a [[garret]] closer to the university, in the [[Latin Quarter]], and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the [[University of Paris]], where she enrolled in late 1891.&lt;ref name="robert3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; She subsisted on her meager resources, suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt;

Skłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Professor [[Gabriel Lippmann]]. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris, and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt;{{efn|Sources vary concerning the field of her second degree. [[Tadeusz Estreicher]], in the 1938 ''[[Polski słownik biograficzny]]'' entry, writes that, while many sources state she earned a degree in mathematics, this is incorrect, and that her second degree was in chemistry.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;}}

Skłodowska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the [[Society for the Encouragement of National Industry]] (''Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale'' [http://www.industrienationale.fr/]).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris" /&gt; That same year [[Pierre Curie]] entered her life; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together.&lt;ref name="Williams331" /&gt; Pierre Curie was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry, the ''[[École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris]]'' (ESPCI).&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor [[Józef Wierusz-Kowalski]], who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre Curie had access to.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris" /&gt; Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Skłodowska where she was able to begin work.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris" /&gt;

Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for one another.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris" /&gt; Eventually Pierre Curie proposed marriage, but at first Skłodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country. Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Skłodowska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; She was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]] [[Sexism in academia|because she was a woman]].&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; A letter from Pierre Curie convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a [[Ph.D]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; At Skłodowska's insistence, Curie had written up his research on [[magnetism]] and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; A contemporary quip would call Skłodowska, "Pierre's biggest discovery."&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; On 26 July 1895 they were married in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] ([[Seine (department)|Seine]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janinetissot.fdaf.org/jt_curie_marie.htm|title=Marie Curie|author=les Actus DN|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither wanted a religious service.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; Curie's dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris"/&gt; They shared two pastimes:  long bicycle trips, and journeys abroad, which brought them even closer. In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

=== New elements ===
[[File:Pierre and Marie Curie.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and Marie Curie in the laboratory]]
In 1895, [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] discovered the existence of [[X-ray]]s, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; In 1896, [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that [[uranium]] salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike [[phosphorescence]], did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt;

She used an innovative technique to investigate samples.  Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the [[electrometer]], a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; She [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of [[molecule]]s but must come from the [[atom]] itself.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert4"/&gt;

In 1897, her daughter [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] was born. To support her family, Curie began teaching at the [[École Normale Supérieure]].&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; They were unaware of the deleterious effects of [[Radioactive contamination|radiation exposure]] attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris 2"/&gt;

Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, [[pitchblende]] and [[torbernite]] (also known as chalcolite).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert5"/&gt; She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element [[thorium]] was also radioactive.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;

{{blockquote|The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.&lt;ref name="robert6"/&gt;}}
[[File:Marie Pierre Irene Curie.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Curie|Pierre]], [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]], Marie Curie]]
She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her [[scientific priority|priority]]. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ''[[Académie des Sciences]]'' the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to [[Silvanus Thompson]]. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Académie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]].&lt;ref name="robert7"/&gt; Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt;

At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: "The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." She later would recall how she felt "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt; On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt;

In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named "[[polonium]]", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain [[partitions of Poland|partitioned among three empires]] ([[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], and [[German Empire|Prussian]]).&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named "[[radium]]", from the [[Latin]] word for "ray".&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Discovery of Radioactivity"/&gt; In the course of their research, they also coined the word "[[radioactivity]]".&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;

To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element [[bismuth]], and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to [[barium]], and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential [[crystallization]]. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of [[radium chloride]] was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams332"/&gt; She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a [[half-life]] of only 138 days.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;

Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to [[radium]], diseased, [[tumor]]-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Sklodowska Curie", ''[[Encyclopedia of World Biography]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, Detroit, Gale, 2004, pp. 339–41.

In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure, and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn1996"/&gt; In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

===Nobel Prizes===
[[File:Marie Curie 1903.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1903 [[Nobel Prize]] portrait]]
In December 1903, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; At first the committee had intended to honor only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician [[Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler]], alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="psb112" /&gt;

Curie and her husband declined to go to [[Stockholm]] to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the [[University of Geneva]], which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn1996"/&gt; Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2"/&gt;

In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, [[Ève Curie|Ève]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2"/&gt; She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.&lt;ref name="goldsmith"/&gt;

On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the [[Rue Dauphine]] in heavy rain, he was struck by a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] and fell under its wheels, causing his skull to fracture.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Curie was devastated by her husband's death.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad"/&gt; On 13 May 1906 the  physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and to offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2"/&gt; She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (''Institut du radium'', now [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]], ''Institut Curie''), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the [[Pasteur Institute]] and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2" /&gt; The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux]], director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;
[[File:1911 Solvay conference.jpg|thumb|right|At First [[Solvay Conference]] (1911), Curie (seated, second from right) confers with [[Henri Poincaré]]; standing, fourth from right, is [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]; second from right, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; far right, [[Paul Langevin]]]]
In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the [[curie]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2"/&gt; Nevertheless, in 1911 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] failed, by one&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; or two votes,&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; to elect her to membership in the Academy.  Elected instead was [[Édouard Branly]], an inventor who had helped [[Guglielmo Marconi]] develop the [[wireless telegraph]].&lt;ref name="goldsmith9"/&gt;  It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, [[Marguerite Perey]], became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy.

Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward [[xenophobia]]—the same that had led to the [[Dreyfus affair]]—which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; Her daughter later remarked on the French press' hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honor, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honors such as her Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

In 1911 it was revealed that in 1910-11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist [[Paul Langevin]], a former student of Pierre Curie's,&lt;ref name="robert10"/&gt; a married man who was estranged from his wife.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.&lt;ref name="goldsmith11"/&gt; When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, [[Camille Marbo]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt;
[[File:Marie Skłodowska-Curie's Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911.jpg|thumb|1911 Nobel Prize diploma]]
International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honored her a second time, with the 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; This award was "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt; She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains [[Linus Pauling#Nobels|alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each]]. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912 she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, [[Hertha Ayrton]]. She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt;

In 1912, the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]] offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt; She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-bio.html|title=Marie Curie-biographical|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Nobel Prize.org|access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the [[French Army]], and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War"/&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Marie Curie - Mobile X-Ray-Unit.jpg|thumb|Curie in a mobile X-ray vehicle]]
During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Coppes-Zantinga, A. R 1998"&gt;Coppes-Zantinga, A. R. and Coppes, M. J.

In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium emanation", a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as [[radon]], to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War"/&gt;

Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the [[Banque de France|French National Bank]] refused to accept them.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt;  She did buy [[war bonds]], using her Nobel Prize money.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; She said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am going to give up the little gold I possess.  I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.&lt;ref name="Coppes-Zantinga, A. R 1998" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;She was also an active member in committees of [[Poles in France|Polonia in France]] dedicated to the Polish cause.&lt;ref name="emigracja" /&gt; After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, ''Radiology in War'' (1919).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2" /&gt;

===Postwar years===
In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–95).&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium. [[Marie Mattingly Meloney|Mrs. William Brown Meloney]], after interviewing Curie, created a ''Marie Curie Radium Fund'' and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Sklodowska Curie in America, 1921"/&gt;

In 1921, U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]] received her at the White House to present her with the 1&amp;nbsp;gram of radium collected in the United States.&lt;ref name="Madame Curie's Passion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt; Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a [[Legion of Honour]] award, but she refused.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pasachoff1996"/&gt; In 1922 she became a fellow of the [[French Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=amudeu/&gt;

Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] and her son-in-law, [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]].&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 2" /&gt; Eventually it became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories, the others being the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], with [[Ernest Rutherford]]; the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna]], with [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]]; and the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]], with [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]].&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chemistry International&amp;nbsp;– Newsmagazine for IUPAC"/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Sklodowska-Curie statue, Warsaw.JPG|thumb|upright|1935 statue, facing the Radium Institute, [[Warsaw]]]]
Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt; A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died at the [[Sancellemoz]] sanatorium in [[Passy, Haute-Savoie]], from [[aplastic anemia]] believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iuniverse"/&gt;

The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt; She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket,&lt;ref name="ShipmanWilson2012"/&gt; and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the [[Radioluminescence|faint light]] that the substances gave off in the dark.&lt;ref name="The Vertigo Years: Europe, 1900–1914"/&gt; Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to [[cataract]]s) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Denise Grady (6 October 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/science/a-glow-in-the-dark-and-a-lesson-in-scientific-peril.html A Glow in the Dark, and a Lesson in Scientific Peril] ''[[The New York Times]]''; accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was interred at the cemetery in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]], alongside her husband Pierre.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the [[Panthéon, Paris]]. She became the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthéon on her own merits.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In 2015, two other women were also interred on their own merits.&lt;ref&gt;Angelique Chrisafis (27 May 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/french-president-hollande-honours-female-resistance-heroes-in-pantheon France president François Hollande adds resistance heroines to Panthéon] ''[[The Guardian]]''; accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/marie-curies-100-year-old-notebook-is-still-too-radioac-1615847891|title=Marie Curie's century-old radioactive notebook still requires lead box|first=Adam Clark|last=Estes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even her cookbook is highly radioactive.&lt;ref name="everything"/&gt; Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.&lt;ref name="everything"/&gt; In her last year, she worked on a book, ''Radioactivity'', which was published posthumously in 1935.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Lublin UMCS Pomnik Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue, [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]], [[Lublin]], Poland]]
The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; Cornell University professor [[L. Pearce Williams|{{nowrap|L. Pearce}} Williams]] observes:{{blockquote|The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.&lt;ref name="Williams332"/&gt;}}

If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in [[Françoise Giroud]]'s ''Marie Curie: A Life'', which emphasizes Curie's role as a feminist precursor.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

She was known for her honesty and moderate life style.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp;– Student in Paris 2"/&gt; She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.&lt;ref name="robert8"/&gt; She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her.&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; She and her husband often refused awards and medals.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

==Awards, honours, and tributes==
[[File:Panthéon Pierre et Marie Curie.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and Marie Curie, [[Panthéon, Paris]]]]
As one of the most famous women scientists to date, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of [[popular culture|pop culture]].&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-36"/&gt; In a 2009 poll carried out by ''[[New Scientist]]'', she was voted the "most inspirational woman in science". Curie received 25.1 per cent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place [[Rosalind Franklin]] (14.2 per cent).&lt;ref name="Most inspirational woman scientist revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie voted greatest female scientist"/&gt;

Poland and France declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie, and the [[United Nations]] declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; An artistic installation celebrating "Madame Curie" filled the [[Jacobs Gallery]] at [[San Diego]]'s [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name="Madame Curie art"/&gt; On 7 November, [[Google]] celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie’s 144th Birthday Google Doodle"/&gt; On 10 December, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie's second [[Nobel Prize]] in the presence of [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland|Princess Madeleine of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Princess Madeleine attends celebrations to mark anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize"/&gt;

Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|multiple sciences]].&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Facts"/&gt; Awards that she received include:

In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the [[Panthéon, Paris]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The [[curie]] (symbol '''Ci'''), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie or both of them).&lt;ref name="How the Curie Came to Be"/&gt; The element with atomic number 96 was named [[curium]].&lt;ref name="Curium"/&gt; Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: [[curite]], [[sklodowskite]], and [[cuprosklodowskite]].&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt; The [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions]] fellowship program of the [[European Union]] for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie Curie Actions |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/documents/documentation/publications/eu-marie-curie-actions-fellowships-innovative-science-becomes-success-publication_en.pdf |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=10 September 2012 |page=5 |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604030857/http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/documents/documentation/publications/eu-marie-curie-actions-fellowships-innovative-science-becomes-success-publication_en.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the [[Lwów Polytechnic]] (1912),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebirminghampress.com/2012/07/coventry-professors-honorary-degree-takes-him-in-footsteps-of-marie-curie/ |title=Coventry professor’s honorary degree takes him in footsteps of Marie Curie |website=Birmingham Press |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Poznań University]] (1922), [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]] (1924), and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] (1926).&lt;ref name="cosm"/&gt; In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the [[Iota Sigma Pi]] women scientists' society.&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iotasigmapi.info/awards/professionalawards.html|title=Professional Awards|publisher=Iota Stigma Pi: National Honor Society for Women in Chemistry|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her name is included on the ''[[Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations]]'', erected in [[Hamburg]], Germany in 1936.&lt;ref name="MMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningradiology.com/museum/humilityhome.html|title=Museum of Modern Imaging|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous locations around the world are named after her. In 2007, [[Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris Métro)|a metro station in Paris]] was renamed to honour both of the Curies.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; Polish nuclear research [[Maria reactor|reactor Maria]] is named after her.&lt;ref name="IEA – reaktor Maria"/&gt; The [[7000 Curie]] asteroid is also named after her.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; A [[KLM]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] (registration PH-KCC) is named in her honour.&lt;ref name="Picture of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft"/&gt;

Several institutions bear her name, starting with the two Curie institutes: the [[Curie Institute, Warsaw|Maria Skłodowska–Curie Institute of Oncology]], in Warsaw and the ''[[Curie Institute (Paris)|Institut Curie]]'' in Paris. She is the patron of [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]], in [[Lublin]], founded in 1944; and of [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] (Paris VI), France's pre-eminent science university. In Britain, [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]] was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]]. [https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/SearchResultHandler.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=207994 Marie Curie (charity), registered charity no. 207994].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two museums are devoted to Marie Curie.  In 1967, the [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie Museum]] was established in Warsaw's "[[Warsaw New Town|New Town]]", at her birthplace on ''ulica Freta'' (Freta Street).&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Her Paris laboratory is preserved as the [[Musée Curie]], open since 1992.&lt;ref name="curie"/&gt;

Several works of art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish President [[Ignacy Mościcki]], unveiled a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute. During the 1944 [[Second World War]] [[Warsaw Uprising]] against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; In 1955 [[Jozef Mazur]] created a stained glass panel of her, the [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion]], featured in the [[University at Buffalo]] Polish Room.&lt;ref name="buffalo"/&gt;

A number of biographies are devoted to her. In 1938 her daughter, [[Ève Curie]], published ''Madame Curie''. In 1987 [[Françoise Giroud]] wrote ''Marie Curie: A Life''. In 2005 [[Barbara Goldsmith]] wrote ''Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie''.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; In 2011 [[Lauren Redniss]] published ''Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, a Tale of Love and Fallout''.&lt;ref name="Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, a Tale of Love and Fallout"/&gt;

[[Greer Garson]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] starred in the 1943 U.S. Oscar-nominated film, ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', based on her life.&lt;ref name="leg"/&gt; More recently, in 1997, a French film about Pierre and Marie Curie was released, ''[[Les Palmes de M. Schutz]]''. It was adapted from a play of the same name. In the film, Marie Curie was played by [[Isabelle Huppert]].&lt;ref name="Les-Palmes-de-M-Schutz – Trailer – Cast – Showtimes – NYTimes.com"/&gt;

Curie is the subject of the play ''False Assumptions'' by [[Lawrence Aronovitch]], in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/03/26/mixing-science-with-theatre Mixing Science With Theatre] – Ottawa Sun, March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Curie has also been portrayed by Susan Marie Frontczak in her play ''Manya: The Living History of Marie Curie'', a one-woman show performed in 30 US states and nine countries, by 2014.&lt;ref name="Main, Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/science/famous-image-marie-curie-isnt-marie-curie|title=This Famous Image Of Marie Curie Isn't Marie Curie|publisher=Popular Science www.popsci.com|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=15 November 2014|author=Main, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curie's likeness also has appeared on banknotes, stamps and coins around the world.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; She was featured on the Polish late-1980s 20,000-''[[złoty]]'' [[banknote]]&lt;ref name="Council1997" /&gt; as well as on the last French 500-[[₣|franc]] note, before the franc was replaced by the euro.&lt;ref name="Letcher2003"/&gt; Curie themed postage stamps from [[Mali]], the [[Republic of Togo]], [[Zambia]], and the [[Republic of Guinea]] actually show a picture of Susan Marie Frontczak portraying Curie in a 2001 picture by Paul Schroeder.&lt;ref name="Main, Douglas"/&gt;

On the first [[centenary]] of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an [[allegory|allegorical]] mural was painted on the [[façade]] of her Warsaw [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie Museum|birthplace]]. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the elements that she would discover as an adult: [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. Also in 2011, a new [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie Bridge, Warsaw|Warsaw bridge]] over the [[Vistula]] was named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vistal.pl/realizacje/mosty-realizacje/most-marii-curie-sklodowskiej-polska-realizacja/ |title=Most Marii Skłodowskiej-Curie, Polska » Vistal Gdynia |website=www.vistal.pl |access-date=2017-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329160957/http://www.vistal.pl/realizacje/mosty-realizacje/most-marii-curie-sklodowskiej-polska-realizacja/ |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murdoch Cameron.jpg|thumb|Murdoch Cameron]]
'''Murdoch Cameron''' (31 March 1847 – 28 April 1930) was [[Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Glasgow)|Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1894 to 1926. He was a pioneer of the Caesarean section under modern antiseptic conditions, becoming world famous after the success of his first [[Caesarean section]] at [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] in 1888. He was honorary President of the first international Congress on Obstetrics and Gynaecology, held in [[Brussels]], in 1892. He was also a founding father of the new Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital (the Rotten Row) and the father of [[Samuel James Cameron]], Reguis Professor of Midwifery at Glasgow in the 1930s.

==Early life==
Murdoch Cameron was born in Glasgow in 1847 the son of a successful timber merchant, Samuel Cameron (25 June 1811 – 27 January 1886), who originated from the Gaelic-speaking farming communities on the [[Isle of Mull]], [[Argyllshire]], and his wife Mary Clow, daughter of William Clow of [[Drymen]], [[Stirlingshire]]. He studied medicine at  the University of Glasgow qualifying as MB in 1870, and MD in 1872.

==Early professional life==
Specialising in obstetrics at his practice in the Townhead district of Glasgow, Cameron was almost immediately appointed Physician to the Glasgow Lying-in Hospital after his graduation.  He retained this post until becoming Physician Accoucher to Glasgow's [[Western Infirmary]] in 1878. From about 1884 he acted as Professorial Assistant to William Leishman, Professor of Midwifery at Glasgow. And in 1888 he was appointed Obstetric Physician to the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. He also acted as lecturer on gynaecology at Glasgow Queen Margaret’s College and was a leading fundraiser for the campaign to erect a new Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital on the Rottenrow site in 1880-1.

==Caesarean section==
[[File:Cameron-1stCaesarianPatients.jpg|thumb|First three Caesarean section patients]]
In an improvised operating theatre crowded with doctors and undergraduates on the top floor of the [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] on 10 April 1888, Murdoch Cameron carried out the first [[Caesarean section]] under modern antiseptic conditions. The patient, Catherine Colquhoun, was a rachitic dwarf incapable of natural birth. Cameron, who as an undergraduate had worked as a surgical dresser to the pioneer of antiseptic surgery [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]], helped transform the Caesarean section, under antiseptic conditions, from a dreaded and little used procedure, that usually ended with the death of the mother, into the routine and safe operation it has become.

==Controversial appointment==
In recognition of his pioneering work Cameron was appointed honorary President of the first international Congress on Obstetrics and Gynaecology, held in Brussels, in 1892. In 1894, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland, Sir George Trevelyan, Murdoch Cameron succeeded Leishman to the position of Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow.

It was an appointment that created furious controversy in some quarters. In an anonymous letter to ''The Times'', London, on 8 January 1894, one correspondent condemned Murdoch Cameron’s election as ‘a heavy blow to the prestige and prosperity of Scotch Universities’.&lt;ref name=times1894-01-08&gt;''The Times'', London, 8 January 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Cameron’s only claim to the position, the correspondent wrote, was that he ‘is an ardent Gladstonian partisan’.&lt;ref name=times1894-01-08/&gt;

Nevertheless, Cameron held the position of Professor of Midwifery for thirty-two years, and was awarded an honorary LLD for ‘a long period of faithful, useful and distinguished service’ &lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow Herald'', Glasgow, 29 April 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[University of Glasgow]] at his retirement. During four decades of academic teaching, Cameron taught four of his successors to the Chair of Midwifery: [[John Martin Munro Kerr]], [[Samuel James Cameron]], [[James Hendry (obstetrician)|James Hendry]] and [[Robert Aim Lennie]]. Murdoch Cameron died in Glasgow in 1930.

==Boer War Incident==
In a famous incident on 23 February 1900, a large crowd of students at the University of Glasgow surrounded the German lecturer, Professor Alexander Tille. The students berated Professor Tille, first English translator of [[Nietzsche]]’s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', for an article in ''Die Woche'' in which he condemned British conduct in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. As the students attempted to strip the unapologetic Tille of his professorial gown, he sought refuge in Murdoch Cameron’s lecture room. Cameron, acting as mediator between the students and Tille, arranged a meeting between both sides. At the conclusion of which Professor Cameron, asking the students to ‘forgive and forget’,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', London, 24 February 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; shook hands with Tille on their behalf.

==A Medical Family==
Murdoch Cameron married Agnes Wallace at [[Kilsyth]], [[Stirlingshire]] in 1873. He was the father of S.J. Cameron, successor to the Reguis chair of Midwifery at Glasgow in the 1930s. Murdoch Cameron’s fourth child, Agnes Wallace Cameron, was among the first generation of female medical graduates from a Scottish University. Graduating MB from Glasgow in 1904, Dr A. W. Cameron was later a paediatric specialist to Glasgow Parish Council. Cameron’s eldest daughter, Jean Wallace Cameron, was Matron of the Stirling Maternity Hospital in the 1920s and ‘30s. While his second daughter, Mary Clow Cameron, was lecturer in French at the University of Glasgow, who with her husband, Leon Maurice Pitoy, Chevalier [[Légion d’honneur]], also lecturer in French at Glasgow, founded the Pitoy French language prize at the University in 1938.

The '''Pellegrini Lake''' is an [[reservoir|artificial lake]] located on the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Patagonia]], in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], near the city of [[Cinco Saltos]], at approximately {{coord|38|40|S|68|00|W|region:AR-R_type:waterbody}} and 270 m [[above mean sea level]].

This reservoir was originally a natural depressed area, possibly excavated by [[wind|eolic]] forces, which was later filled with water brought by a derivation channel from the nearby [[Neuquén River]], in order to regulate its flow (since the river had no natural lakes that would fulfill this function). It has mean and maximum depths of 9.4 and 18 m, respectively. It covers an area of 112&amp;nbsp;km² and has a volume of 1.053×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m³.

The lake is employed for commercial [[fishing]] of ''trucha criolla'' (''Percichthys trucha'', a species of [[temperate perch]]) and ''pejerrey'' (''Odontesthes microlepidotus'', a [[Neotropical silversides|neotropical silverside]]), as well as sport fishing, recreation and tourism.

Marketing to health-care providers takes three main forms: activity by pharmaceutical sales representatives, provision of drug samples, and sponsoring [[continuing medical education]] (CME). The use of gifts, including pens and coffee mugs embossed with pharmaceutical product names, has been prohibited by PHRMA ethics guidelines since 2008.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-07-10-3919705145_x.htm |title=New pharma ethics rules eliminate gifts and meals - USATODAY.com |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the 237,000 medical sites representing 680,000 physicians surveyed in SK&amp;A's 2010 Physician Access survey, half said they prefer or require an appointment to see a rep (up from 38.5% preferring or requiring an appointment in 2008), while 23% won't see reps at all, according to the survey data.  Practices owned by hospitals or health systems are tougher to get into than private practices, since appointments have to go through headquarters, the survey found.
13.3% of offices with just one or two doctors won't see representatives, compared with a no-see rate of 42% at offices with 10 or more doctors.
The most accessible physicians for promotional purposes are allergists/immunologists – only 4.2% won't see reps at all – followed by orthopedic specialists (5.1%) and diabetes specialists (7.6%). Diagnostic radiologists are the most rigid about allowing details – 92.1% won't see reps – followed by pathologists and neuroradiologists, at 92.1% and 91.8%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmm-online.com/docs-are-visited-by-20-reps-a-week-survey-says/article/180995/ |title=SK&amp;A's 2010 Physician Access Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-detailing is widely used to reach "no see physicians"; approximately 23% of primary care physicians and 28% of specialists prefer computer-based edetailing, according to survey findings reported in the 25 April 2011, edition of American Medical News (AMNews), published by the American Medical Association (AMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmslists.com/news-articles/article.asp?ID=9 |title=Less than 30% of doctors prefer detailing, according to surveys: Doctor emails are primary promotional method }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PhRMA Code===
The [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA) released updates to its voluntary Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals on 10 July 2008. The new guidelines took effect in January 2009."&lt;ref name="Phrmacode"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/phrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf |title=Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to prohibiting small gifts and reminder items such as pens, notepads, staplers, clipboards, paperweights, pill boxes, etc.,&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt; the revised Code:
# Prohibits company sales representatives providing restaurant meals to healthcare professionals, but allows them to provide occasional modest meals in healthcare professionals’ offices in conjunction with informational presentations"&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt;
# Includes new provisions requiring companies to ensure their representatives are sufficiently trained about applicable laws, regulations, and industry codes of practice and ethics.&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt;
# Provides that each company will state its intentions to abide by the Code and that company CEOs and compliance officers will certify each year that they have processes in place to comply.&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt;
# Includes more detailed standards regarding the independence of continuing medical education.&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt;
# Provides additional guidance and restrictions for speaking and consulting arrangements with healthcare professionals.&lt;ref name="Phrmacode" /&gt;

===Free samples===
Free samples have been shown to affect physician prescribing behaviour.  Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;  Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow standard of care practices.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;

Receiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alexander GC, Zhang J, Basu A | year = 2008 | title = Characteristics of patients receiving pharmaceutical samples and association between sample receipt and out-of-pocket prescription costs | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 394–402 | pmid = 18362819 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181618ee0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that a benefit to free samples is the “try it before you buy it” approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away.  Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a [[pharmacy]].&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

===Continuing medical education===
Hours spent by physicians in industry-supported [[continuing medical education]] (CME) is greater than that from either [[medical school]]s or professional societies.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;

===Pharmaceutical representatives===
Currently, there are approximately 81,000 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zsassociates.com/news_events/news_media/the_doctor_wont_see_you_mr_pharma_rep_now/ |title=ZS Associates; Pharmaceutical |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200-300 physicians with 120-180 targets that should be visited in 1-2 or 3 week cycle.

Because of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality.  Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness.  Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.

The United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt; The number and persistence of pharmaceutical  representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=177968  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As the  number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with  doctors went down—so  far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis.  Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem."

Marketers must  decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a  particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see  them) for each individual physician, how many patients suffer from that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, and of course, their business potential.

Marketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then "deciled" into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:
* Profitability of a prescription (script),
* Accessibility of the physician,
* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company's drugs,
* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug,
* The [[adoption sequence]] of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments), and
* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs
* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kiefer|authorlink1=Kiefer Lee|last2=Carter|first2=Steve|date=2012|title=Global Marketing Management|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=524|isbn=978-0-19-960970-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians are perhaps the most important component in  sales. They  write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by  people.  Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales.  Historically, this was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A  medium-sized  pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000  representatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around  the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly,  providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach  today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing  pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to  physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.

===Peer influence===
;Key opinion leaders
Key opinion leaders (KOL), or "thought leaders", are  respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who  influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical  companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug  development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharma-mkting.com/glossary/keyopinionleader.htm  |title=Glossary Term: Key Opinion Leader |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some  pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct  inquiry of physicians (primary research).  Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use [[social network analysis]] to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lnxpharma.com/images/pages/Lnx_Whitepaper_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives  to  segmenting physicians purely on the basis of prescribing do exist,  and  marketers can call upon strategic partners who specialize in   delineating which characteristics of true opinion leadership, a   physician does or does not possess.  Such analyses can help guide   marketers in how to optimize KOL engagements as bona fide advisors to a   brand, and can help shape clinical development and clinical data   publication plans for instance, ultimately advancing patient care.

;Colleagues
Physicians  acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues,  including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital  affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some  pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through  commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=395598  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Doctor  dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire  educational information from respected peers.  These meetings are  sponsored by some pharmaceutical companies.

===Journal articles and technical documentation===

Recent legal cases and US congressional  hearings have provided access to [[Drug Industry Document Archive|pharmaceutical industry documents]]  revealing new marketing strategies for drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/284  |title=Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of  Internal Industry Documents -- Steinman et al. 145 (4): 284 -- Annals of  Internal Medicine |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activities  once considered independent of promotional intent, including [[continuing medical education]] and [[medical research]],  are used, including paying to publish articles about promoted drugs for  the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study  results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/305?etoc  |title=Safeguarding Patient Welfare: Who's In Charge? -- Henney 145 (4):  305 -- Annals of  Internal Medicine |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private and public insurers===
Public and private insurers affect the writing of prescriptions by physicians through [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formularies]] that restrict the number and types of drugs that the insurer will cover. Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. Known as [[Medicare Part&amp;nbsp;D]], this program engages private insurers to negotiate with [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.

==To consumers==
Only two countries as of 2008 allow [[direct to consumer advertising]] (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt; Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States. It takes two main forms: the promotion or creation of a disease out of a non-pathologic physical condition or the promotion of a medication.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt; The rhetorical objective of direct-to-consumer advertising is to directly influence the patient-physician dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|last2=Balzhiser|first2=Deborah|date=September 2015|title=Pharmaceutical Companies Are Writing the Script for Health Consumerism|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2826972.2826976|journal=Commun. Des. Q. Rev|volume=3|issue=4|pages=35–49|doi=10.1145/2826972.2826976|issn=2166-1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many patients will inquire about, or even demand a medication they have seen advertised on television.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; In the United States, recent years have seen an increase in mass media advertisements for pharmaceuticals.
Expenditures on direct-to-users advertising have more than quintupled in the seven years between 1997 and 2005 since the FDA changed the guidelines, from $1.1 billion in 1997 to more than $4.2 billion in 2005, a 19.6% annual increase, according to the United States [[Government Accountability Office]], 2006).&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;

The mass marketing to users of  pharmaceuticals is banned in over 30 industrialized nations, but not in  the US and [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; which is considering a ban.&lt;ref  name="www.chmeds.ac.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chmeds.ac.nz/report.pdf  |title=www.chmeds.ac.nz |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel it  is better to leave the decision wholly in the hands of medical professionals; others feel that users education and participation in health is useful, but users need independent, comparative information about drugs (not promotional information).&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="www.chmeds.ac.nz"/&gt; For these  reasons, most countries impose limits on pharmaceutical mass marketing that are not placed on the marketing of other products. In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. [[Canada]]'s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.

Reynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as [[Avastin]] and [[Opdivo]], in the former case and [[Statin|statins]] in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spector |first1=Reynold |title=Drug Therapy Hype: The Misuse of Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=44-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug coupons===
In the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide [[drug coupon]]s to consumers to help offset the [[copayment]]s charged by health insurers for prescription medication. These coupons are generally used to promote medications that compete with non-preferred products and cheaper, generic alternatives by reducing or eliminating the extra out-of-pocket costs that an insurers typically charge a patient for a non-preferred drug product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lunzer Kritz|first=Francesca|title=Check out drug coupons, then check bottom line|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/health/he-coupons3|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Pharmaceutical company spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research.&lt;ref name="Brezis2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;  In 2004 in Canada $1.7 billion a year was spent marketing drugs to physicians and in the United States $21 billion were spent in 2002.&lt;ref name=McGill04&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/orig_articles/barfett.pdf  |title=www.medicine.mcgill.ca |format= |work=  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 money spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States was estimated at $29.9 billion with one estimate as high as $57 billion.&lt;ref name=Women08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sufrin CB, Ross JS |title=Pharmaceutical industry marketing: understanding its impact on women's health |journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=585–96 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18713478 |doi=10.1097/OGX.0b013e31817f1585 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the US number are broken down 56% was free samples, 25% was detailing of physicians, 12.5% was direct to users advertising, 4% on hospital detailing, and 2% on journal ads.&lt;ref name=McGill04/&gt; In the United States approximately $20 billion could be saved if generics were used instead of equivalent brand name products.&lt;ref name=Women08/&gt;

Although pharmaceutical companies have made large investments in marketing their products, overall promotional spending has been decreasing over the last few years, and declined by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010. Pharmaceutical companies are cutting back mostly in detailing and sampling, while spending in mailings and print advertising grew since last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldofdtcmarketing.com/the-ax-comes-out-for-pharma-promotional-spending/business-of-the-drug-industry/ |title=The ax comes out for pharma promotional spending}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and fraud==

=== European Union ===
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
In the European Union, marketing of pharmaceuticals is regulated by EU (formerly EEC) [[Directive 92/28/EEC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=URISERV:l21143&amp;from=EN&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it requires member states to prohibit off-label marketing, and direct-to-consumer marketing of prescription-only medications.

=== United States ===
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements|List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements}}
In the United States, marketing and distribution of pharmaceuticals is regulated by the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] and the [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]], respectively. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on "substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience", to provide a "fair balance" between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.

In the 1990s, antipsychotics were "still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses". Drugs such as [[Abilify]] and [[Geodon]] were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.&lt;ref name=bied2010/&gt;

Every major company selling the drugs—[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]—has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements in 2009 set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly’s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=bied2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=2 October 2010  |work=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement. Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including [[Medicare fraud|Medicare and Medicaid fraud]], [[Off-label use|off-label]] promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sammy Almashat, M.D., M.P.H.,  Charles Preston, M.D., M.P.H., Timothy Waterman, B.S., Sidney Wolfe, M.D., "Rapidly Increasing Criminal and Civil Monetary Penalties Against the Pharmaceutical Industry: 1991–2010", Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, December 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Katie | last1=Thomas | first2=Michael S. | last2=Schmidt | title=GlaxoSmithKline Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in Fraud Settlement | date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of marketing==
The emergence of  new media and technologies in recent years is quickly changing the  pharmaceutical marketing landscape in the United States. Both physicians  and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target  audiences.

In 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the  Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or  medical device information—a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are  finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details.  Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and [[Epocrates]].

Direct-to-users  marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television,  radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies  are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, [[display advertising|online display advertising]], [[search engine marketing]], [[social media]] campaigns, place-based media and [[mobile advertising]] to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.  

In 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by [[Novartis]] Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Debra Dunne |title=Unbranded Web Sites: FDA Finds Violative Promotional Practices |date=October 4, 2010 |publisher=Stradley Ronon  |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/unbranded-web-sites-fda-finds-violative-promotional-practices|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plyometrics''', also known as '''jump training''' or '''plyos''', are exercises in which [[muscle]]s exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power (speed-strength). This training focuses on learning to move from a muscle [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] to a [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] in a rapid or "explosive" manner, such as in specialized repeated jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Donald|title=Jumping into plyometrics|year=1998|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=0880118466|pages=1–4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plyometrics are primarily used by [[Sportsperson|athletes]], especially [[martial arts|martial artists]], sprinters and [[high jump]]ers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athleteculture.com/training/an-athletes-guide-to-jumping-higher-vertical-jump-secrets-uncovered/|title=An Athlete’s Guide to Jumping Higher: Vertical Jump Secrets Uncovered!|last=Starks|first=Joe|date=25 April 2013|publisher=Athlete Culture|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve performance,&lt;ref name="Yessis"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Plyometrics |publisher=Ultimate Athlete Concepts|year=2009 |isbn=978-098171806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in the fitness field to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoryessis.com/public/Why_is_plyometrics_so_misunderstood_and_misapplied.cfm|title=Why is plyometrics so misunderstood and misapplied?|last=Yessis|first=Michael|publisher=doctoryessis.com|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Plyometrics includes explosive powerful training exercises that are trained to activate the quick response and elastic properties of the major muscles in the body. It was initially made famous by Soviet Olympians in the 1970s, providing the core element in the strength programs of elite sporting athletes worldwide.  Sports using plyometrics include basketball, tennis, badminton, squash and volleyball as well as the various codes of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultrafitnessmag.com.au/Train/Ground/tabid/4592/entryid/457/RUNNING-STRONG-INTRODUCING-PLYOMETRICS.aspx|title=RUNNING STRONG, INTRODUCING PLYOMETRICS|website=Fitness PRO Magazine|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "plyometrics" was coined by [[Fred Wilt]] after watching Soviet athletes prepare for their events in track and field; he felt this was a key to their success.&lt;ref name="Wilt"&gt;Wilt, Fred &amp; Yessis, Michael. ''Soviet Theory, Technique and Training for Running and Hurdling.'' Vol 1. Championship Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began a collaboration with Soviet ([[Russia|Russian]]) trainer [[Michael Yessis]] to promote plyometrics.

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, two forms of plyometrics have evolved. In the original version of plyometrics, created by Russian scientist Yuri Verkhoshansky, it was defined as the shock method.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshansky1966"&gt;{{cite book|author= Yuri Verkhoshansky|title=Perspectives in the Improvement of Speed-Strength Preparation of Jumpers|journal=Legkaya Atletika(Track and Field)|volume=9|pages=11–12|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2"&gt;{{cite book|author= Yuri Verkhoshanski|title=Are Depth Jumps Useful?|journal= Legkaya Atletika (Track and Field)|volume=12|pages=9|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this, the athlete would drop down from a height and experience a "shock" upon landing. This in turn would bring about a forced [[eccentric contraction]] which was then immediately switched to a [[concentric contraction]] as the athlete jumped upward. The landing and takeoff are executed in an extremely short period of time, in the range of 0.1–0.2 second. The shock method is the most effective method used by athletes to improve their speed, quickness, and power after development of a strong strength base.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;

Rather than using the term plyometrics to indicate exercises utilizing the shock method, it may be preferable to use the term explosive or true plyometrics which can be considered the same as the plyometrics originally created by Verkhoshansky.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;  The shock method that he created was the result of studying the actions that occur in running and jumping.  He found that the landings and takeoffs in these two skills involved high ground reaction forces that were executed in an extremely quick and explosive manner.  For example, time of execution of the landing and takeoff in jumping was close to 0.20 second and in sprinting it was approximately 0.10 second.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshansky1966" /&gt;

Since one of the main objectives of the Soviet research was to develop practical methods of training to improve athletic performance, Verkhoshansky tackled the task of how these forces in explosive execution could be duplicated in an exercise.  By doing exercises such as the depth jump, that he created, the athlete would enhance his ability in the takeoff and his resultant performance in the running or jumping event.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;  He experimented with many different exercises, but the depth jump appeared to be the best for duplicating the forces in the landing and takeoff.

The second version of plyometrics, seen to a great extent in the [[United States]], relates to doing any form of jump regardless of execution time. Such jumps cannot be considered truly plyometric (as described by Verkhoshansky) since the intensity of execution is much lower and the time required for transitioning from the eccentric to the concentric contraction is much greater.  The term plyometrics became very popular with the publication of many books on the subject matter.  It now appears impossible to go back to its original meaning and method of execution. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As a result, it is important to distinguish which type of "plyometric" exercise is used in order to determine its effectiveness and potential to receive the stated benefits. Though the name plyometrics is given to all jumps, not all jumps are plyometric. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Etymology==
The term plyometric is a combination of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots that means to increase measurement — ''plio-'' means "more" and ''metric'' means "to measure".

==History==
[[Fred Wilt]], a former [[US Olympic]] [[long-distance runner]], is credited with coining the term plyometrics. He admits that it is not a very good term, but it was the best he could come up with after watching the [[Russians]] execute jumps in their warm-ups prior to their event in [[track and field]]. He could not understand why the Russians were doing all of these jumps while the Americans were doing multiple static stretches, but he firmly believed it was one of the reasons why they were so successful in many events.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt;
From its beginnings in the early 1980s, the term plyometrics gained greater popularity and is now well established.  When Fred Wilt learned of the work being done by [[Michael Yessis]] in the field of Russian training methods, they quickly teamed up to help disseminate information on plyometrics.

In collaboration with Yessis who visited and worked with Verkhoshansky&lt;ref&gt;McCadam, K., "Russian Training Legend: Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky." Retrieved online April 22, 2012 from http://www.pushtheground.com/2011/06/russian-traning-legend-dr-yuri.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the former Soviet Union the early 1980s, the term plyometrics and how it is used (practiced) was gradually disseminated in the US.  Yessis brought this information on plyometrics back to the US and in the following years was able to create even more ways of using this method to train and improve explosive power. 
  
Plyometrics (the shock method) was created by Yuri Verkhoshansky in the late 1960s, early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt; Since then, the shock method of plyometrics is still being practiced for improvement of athletic performance by what appears to be a relatively limited number of athletes. These athletes still do depth jumps, the key exercise in the shock method, according to the guidelines established by Verkhoshansky.

Most athletes execute simple and complex jumps and call them plyometrics rather than jump training as it was called in the past.  This includes the depth jump which was executed in ways different from what was recommended by Verkhoshansky.  This form of jump training is very popular but plyometrics is a buzzword for all types of jumps, regardless of how long it takes to execute the jump. Its use is so pervasive that it is even possible to find push-ups described as being plyometric.

Due to the wide use and appeal of the term plyometrics, the true meaning of plyometrics as developed by  Verkhoshansky has for the most part been forgotten. Verkhoshansky was well known and respected worldwide in both the scientific and in the coaching arenas.  He was relatively unknown in the United States except for some of his articles that were translated and published in the "Soviet Sports Review", later called the "Fitness and Sports Review International."

In addition to creating the shock method, Verkhoshansky is credited with developing the stretch-shortening concept of muscle contractions and the development of specialized (dynamic correspondence) strength exercises. Plyometrics, or more specifically the shock method, is considered a form of specialized strength development.

Before undertaking plyometric training, it is necessary to distinguish jumps that are commonly called plyometric and true plyometric jumps as exemplified in the depth jump which is illustrative of the shock method. Since its inception in the former Soviet Union as the shock method, there have been other forms of the plyometric exercises created by Yessis that do not involve jump exercises.  For details and illustrations of these exercises see "Explosive Running"&lt;ref name="Yessis2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Running |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; 1st edition|year=2000 |isbn=978-0809298990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Explosive Plyometrics".&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;  These exercises involve the stretch-shorten concept that underlies the shock method.

==Method==
In the depth jump, the athlete experiences a shock on landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle extensor muscles undergo a powerful eccentric contraction. For the muscles to respond explosively, the eccentric contraction is then quickly switched to the isometric (when the downward movement stops) and then the concentric contraction, in a minimum amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.S. Medvedev |author2=V.V. Marchenko |author3=S.V. Fomichenko |title=Speed-Strength Structure of Vertical Jumps by Qualified Weightlifters in Different Take-off Conditions (Condensed)|journal=Soviet Sports Review International-Teoriya I Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury|volume=19|pages=164–167|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the athlete to jump upward as high as possible.
  
In the eccentric contraction, the muscles are involuntarily lengthened, while in the concentric contraction, the muscles are shortened after being tensed.  Most of the stretching and shortening takes place in the tendons that attach to the muscles involved rather than in the muscles.  
To execute the depth jump, the athlete stands on a raised platform, usually not greater than {{convert|20|-|30|in|cm}} high, and then steps out and drops down in a vertical pathway to make contact with the floor.  The height used by most athletes is usually quite low in the early stages of training.  The key is how high the athlete jumps in relation to the height of the takeoff platform.  Technique and jump height are most important at this time.  
While the body is dropping, the athlete consciously prepares the muscles for the impact by tensing the muscles.  The flooring upon which the athlete drops down on should be somewhat resilient, mainly for prevention of injury. Upon making contact with the floor, the athlete then goes into slight leg flex to absorb some of the force for safety.  However, the main role played by the muscles and tendons is to withstand the force that is experienced in the landing.  This force is withstood in eccentric contraction.  When muscle contraction is sufficiently great, it is able to stop the downward movement very quickly.

This phase is sometimes called the phase of amortization in which the athlete absorbs some of the force and stops downward movement by the strong eccentric contraction of the muscles. The strong eccentric contraction prepares the muscles to switch to the concentric contraction in an explosive manner for takeoff.

When the athlete drops down to the floor, the body experiences an impact upon landing. The higher the height of the step-off platform, the greater the impact force upon landing.  This creates a shock to the body which the body responds to by undergoing a strong involuntary muscular contraction to prevent the body from collapsing on the ground. This in turn produces great tension in the muscles and tendons which is then given back in a return upward movement. The faster the change in the muscular contractions, the greater the power created and the resulting height attained.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;

More specifically, the muscles and tendons undergo a stretch (eccentric contraction) while landing which is needed to absorb some of the force generated but most importantly, to withstand the force that is produced by the shock that occurs on the landing. The greater the shock (forces experienced on landing), the stronger the eccentric contraction will be, which in turn produces even greater tension.  This tension, which is potential force, is then given back in the return movement when the muscular contractions switch to the concentric or shortening regime.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;

However, for maximum return of energy, minimum time must elapse from when the force is received to when they are returned. The greater the time between receiving the forces and giving them back, the less is the return and the less the height that can be achieved in the jump.  Most of the lengthening and shortening occurs in the respective muscle tendons which have greater elasticity.

Another way of saying this is that the faster the switching from the eccentric to the concentric contraction, the greater will be the force produced and the greater the return movement.  The speed of the switching is extremely fast, 0.20 seconds or less.  For example, high-level sprinters execute the switch from the eccentric contraction that occurs when the foot hits the ground to the concentric contraction when the foot breaks contact with the ground in less than 0.10 seconds.  In world-class sprinters, the time is approximately 0.08 seconds.
The exact platform height used by most athletes in the depth jump should be less than {{convert|30|in|cm}} in the early stages of training.  Most athletes start at approximately {{convert|12|in|cm}} after doing some jump training. They then gradually work up to {{convert|20|in|cm}} and then to 30 inches depending upon how well the jumps are executed. The main criterion is that the athlete is jumping as high as possible on every jump.

If the athlete gradually improves his jump height, the same platform height is continued until increases in jump height are no longer observed. At this time, takeoff height is increased by a few inches. If the athlete continually fails to jump very high, the height of the drop-down is lowered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N.I. Volkov |author2=V.M. Koryagin |title=Systematization of Special Basketball Exercises (Condensed)|journal=Yessis Review of Soviet Physical Education and Sports|volume=13 #4|pages=110–111|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most important here is how high the athlete jumps after the drop-down.

The maximum platform height used by a high level athlete is no more than {{convert|40|in|cm}}.  Rather than developing greater explosive power this height leads to more eccentric strength development.  Going higher than {{convert|30|in|cm}} is usually counterproductive and may lead to injury.  This occurs when the intensity of the forced involuntary eccentric contraction upon landing is greater than the muscles can withstand.  In addition, the athlete will not be able to execute a quick return (fast transition between muscular contractions), which is the key to successful execution of explosive plyometrics.

Because of the forces involved and the quickness of execution, the central nervous system is strongly involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N.A. Masalgin |author2=Y.V. Verkhoshansky |author3=L.L. Golovina |author4=A.M. Naraliev |title=The Influence of the Shock Method of Training on the Electromyographic Parameters of Explosive Effort|journal=Teoriya i Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury (Theory and Practice of Physical Culture)|volume=1|pages=45–46|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the athlete not overdo using the shock plyometric method.  Doing so will lead to great fatigue, and, according to Verkhoshansky, sleep disturbances.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yuri Verkhoshansky |author2=Natalia Verkhoshansky |title=Specialized Strength and Conditioning, Manual For Coaches|publisher=Verkhoshansky SSTM|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes have great difficulty sleeping well if they execute too many depth jumps. This indicates that athletes must be well-prepared physically before doing this type of training.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"/&gt;

Technique of jumping is also very important when executing plyometric exercises. In essence, the athlete goes into a slight squat (crouch) upon landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle joints flex.  The takeoff or jump upward is executed in a sequence initiated by hip-joint extension followed by knee-joint extension which begins during the hip-joint extension.  As the knee-joint extension is taking place, ankle-joint extension begins and is the only action that occurs as the takeoff (breaking contact with the ground) takes place.  All three actions contribute force to the upward jump, but the knee-joint extension is the major contributor.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

==As simple jumping==

The most common type of plyometrics used in the United States is simple and relatively easy jump exercises executed with little regard to execution time. These jumps are effective for athletes who execute skills in their sport that do not require explosive type muscular contractions. An example is long-distance running in which the runners execute repeat actions of 20 to 30 consecutive jumps and other cyclic-type activities such as leaping for multiple repetitions.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

Such plyometric jumps are also used as a warm-up for doing explosive plyometric jumps and for initial preparation of the muscles prior to undertaking exercises such as depth jumps.  In essence, they are effective in the early stages of learning how to do plyometric exercises and for preparing the muscles for explosive or quick jumps.  These jumps are similar to those done by youngsters in the playground or in neighborhood games and as such, do not require additional preparation.  Athletes, regardless of their level of expertise, can undertake such jumps in the initial stages of training.

When athletes who have been doing plyometrics without regard to time of execution first attempt to execute explosive plyometrics, they often fail because the time of execution is too long.  This occurs quite often in the depth jump.  The athlete usually sinks (drops) too low which takes too long to make the transition from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.  As a result, the exercise becomes a jump-strength exercise and not a true plyometric one.

Jump technique remains the same regardless of whether it is a true plyometric exercise or a jump exercise. The hips, knees, and ankles flex when landing and the joints extend on the upward return. The sequence and overlapping in the sequence is basically the same, beginning with the hip extension, followed by knee extension, and ending with the ankle-plantar flexing.  The major differences in execution are the depth of the landing and the time of executing the switch from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.

Studies have been conducted testing ten various plyometric exercises on overall performance during jumping examined by EMG, power, and ground reaction force (GRF). Of the ten exercises, the single-leg cone hops, box jumps, tuck jumps, and two-legged vertical jumps produced the highest EMG values, alluding to greater motor recruitment. Power was examined in dumbbell jumps, depth jumps, countermovement jumps, squat jumps, and tuck jumps which all produced the higher power scale readings. In terms of athletic performance and training, the plyometric movements that utilize total body vibration produced an overall increase in performance output. A recent study examined two groups using the same plyometric protocol in combination with [[weight training]], one using high loads and the other utilizing small loads, and similar decreases in power were found. This shows that the  plyometric exercises themselves had a greater effect in the decrease in power output rather than the type of weight training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebben | first1 = W.

==Safety considerations==
Plyometrics have been shown to have benefits for reducing lower extremity injuries in team sports while combined with other neuromuscular training (i.e. strength training, balance training, and stretching). Plyometric exercises involve an increased risk of injury due to the large force generated during training and performance, and should only be performed by well conditioned individuals under supervision. Good levels of [[physical strength]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[proprioception]] should be achieved before beginning plyometric training.

The specified minimum strength requirement varies depending on where the information is sourced and the intensity of the plyometrics being performed. Chu (1998) recommends that a participant be able to perform 50 repetitions of the [[Squat (exercise)|squat exercise]] at 60% of his or her body weight before doing plyometrics. Core (abdomen) strength is also important.

Flexibility is required both for injury prevention and to enhance the effect of the stretch shortening cycle. In fact, some advanced training methods combine plyometrics and intensive stretching in order to both protect the joint and make it more receptive to the plyometric benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Marc De Bremaeker (2013). ''Plyo-Flex''. {{ISBN|978-1938585104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proprioception]] is an important component of balance, coordination and agility, which is also required for safe performance of plyometric exercises.

Further safety considerations include:

* Age: should be taken into account for both prepubescent and the elderly because of hormonal changes.
* Technique: a participant must be instructed on proper technique before commencing any plyometric exercise. He or she should be well rested and free of injury in any of the limbs to be exercised.

Plyometrics are not inherently dangerous, but the highly focused and intense movements used in repetition increase the potential level of stress on joints and musculo-tendonous units. Therefore, safety precautions are strong prerequisites to this particular method of exercise. Low-intensity variations of plyometrics are frequently utilized in various stages of injury rehabilitation, indicating that the application of proper technique and appropriate safety precautions can make plyometrics safe and effective for many people.

== Benefits ==

Many professional and Olympic athletes use plyometrics training to improve muscular strength and jumping abilities which therefore increases their power. There are  varying levels of intensity to plyometrics. Another benefit of plyometrics are that you can vary your level of intensity which means anyone looking to improve strength and jumping training can be involved regardless of fitness. With there being so many exercises this means you are less likely to get burned out and have a wide range of exercises to choose from. Another good reason with so many exercises being available are that you can find exercises that don’t require the use of any equipment. It also increases muscular strength and endurance, also increases metabolic rate which increases weight loss and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.alot.com/wellness/pros-of-the-plyometrics-workout--1050|title=Pros of the Plyometrics Workout|date=2015-02-18|website=Alot Health|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loaded plyometrics ==

Plyometric exercises are sometimes performed with an additional load, or weight, added. The weight is held or worn. The additional weight may be in the form of a barbell, trap bar, dumbbells, or weighted vest. For instance, a vertical jump whilst holding a [[Trapbar|trap bar]] or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. In addition, a regular weight lifting exercise is sometimes given a plyometric component, such as is found in a loaded jump squat. Jumping onto boxes or over hurdles whilst holding weights is not recommended for safety reasons. The advantage of loaded plyometric exercises is that they increase the overall force with which the exercise is performed. This can enhance the positive effect of the exercise and further increase the practitioners ability to apply explosive power.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Program Resources and Outcomes Management Information System''' (PROMIS) is the first [[World Wide Web|web-based]] [[Case management (USA health system)|case management]] system for [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] and other [[Social work|social service]] organizations. It has been developed by Cleverex Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promisinfo.cleverex.com/ Program Resources and Outcomes Management Information System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425054237/http://promisinfo.cleverex.com/ |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==
PROMIS is built upon the Kynamic just in time knowledge technology.  This solution platform covers the complete service cycle and outcome analysis including:

* Client intake
* Screening and assessment
* Goals establishment
* Service plan
* Service delivery
* Outcome tracking
* Analysis and evaluation

Automation for real-time case tracking eliminates gaps in the service delivery process and reduces redundancy and fragmentation of services. PROMIS provides support for all client-service functions of an agency from "outreach to outcome." Through the use of [[Internet protocol suite|Internet technologies]] and a development approach built on [[business process re-engineering]] and extensive user involvement, the PROMIS system improves client service by reducing paperwork, automating [[Policies and Procedures|policies and procedures]] and integrating the delivery system within Head Start agencies.

The PROMIS project effort was funded by the Offices of Head Start, ACF from 2001 through 2003. Although the first [[Development stage|beta version]] became available for Head Start agencies to use free of charge back in 1999, the first production release was not available until the summer of 2004. Since its first release, PROMIS' user base has been increasing by about 100 new organizations a year. &lt;!--This fast growth has been attributed by several factors:

* Relatively low cost;
* The user community has been actively involved (thousands of people participated);
* Commercially mature;
* Scalable.--Not supported by source material--&gt;

A large majority of the so-called mega agencies (serving 10,000 families or more) have been using the PROMIS system for their daily operation.

A '''self-test of intelligence''' is a [[psychological testing|psychological test]] that someone can take to measure one's own [[intelligence]].

As with other intelligence tests, a self-test of intelligence normally consists of a series of verbal and non-verbal intellectual tasks and puzzles. These tests usually give the taker instructions on how to complete the tasks and offer a performance score after the test has been completed.

These self-tests can be performed in various ways that are quick, easy, and can be done at home or on the go. Web sites on the [[internet]], [[Mobile app|app]]s for mobile devices, and one or more books are popular choices for taking these tests.

There are two ways that one can look at intelligence: either as an innate, intrinsic, static characteristic of a person; or as a characteristic that is acquired which can be influenced by the environment and that can be improved on. These opposing points of view are part of a more general nature vs. nurture (or hereditarianism vs. environmentalist) debate that dates back to Ancient Greeks like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. [[Implicit theories of intelligence]] can be at the basis of the chosen point of view, and whether or not the results of a self-test of intelligence are considered definitive or can be improved upon may depend on this.

Self-tests of intelligence can contribute to the '''self-assessed intelligence (SAI)''' of a person, where SAI can be defined as ''people's estimates of their cognitive abilities in relation to the overall population''.&lt;ref&gt;Little more than personality: Dispositional determinants of test anxiety (the Big Five, core self-evaluations, and self-assessed intelligence) in Learning and Individual Differences Volume 18, Issue 2, 2nd Quarter 2008, Pages 258–263 by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzica, Gorkan Ahmetoglua, Adrian Furnhamb, University College London&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources for self-tests of intelligence ==

=== Websites on the internet ===
Various self-tests of intelligence are offered online on the [[internet]], on websites like iqtest.com iqdiploma.com, free-iqtest.net, test-iq.nl, Metis International and that of IQ Certificate.

The official website of [[Mensa International]], which is the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not offer an online IQ test. It does offer an online quiz for entertainment purposes which is called "Mensa Workout". Sites that claim to offer a Mensa IQ test online may not be related to this organization.

=== Apps for mobile devices ===

There are [[Mobile app|apps]] for devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]] for self-tests of one's IQ with names such as ''IQ Test'' and ''What's My IQ?''. These apps are offered on [[app store]]s like [[App Store (iOS)|the iOS App Store]] and [[Google Play|the Google Play Store]].

Some of these apps - for example ''IQ Test - Brain Training Puzzle Game'' and ''Stupidmeter - tool to test your intelligence'' - are mainly meant for entertainment purposes and can be considered games.

Carter, Kogan Page, Northwestern University, 2008 {{ISBN|9780749452322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What's Your IQ? Book and Card Kit: A Book and IQ Test to Find Out Just How Smart You Really Are! by Janet Terban Morris, Peter Pauper Press Inc. New York 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Test Your IQ, 6th Edition, by Alfred W. Munzert, Ph.D, Pocket Books, New York 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these books are mainly meant to train the reader for official IQ tests, most give the reader the opportunity to determine an IQ score based on tests in the books themselves.

[[Alfred Binet]] can be seen as the father of the intelligence test. He made various publications on human intelligence and intelligence tests. The Stanford-Binet test of 1916 which was published by Terman became known as the first IQ test.&lt;ref&gt;The IQ Mythology by Elaine Mensh and Harry Mensh, 1991 {{ISBN|0-8093-1666-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, books on self-tests of intelligence were written later. One of the early books on this subject was ''Know Your Own I.Q.'' by [[Hans Eysenck]], which was first published in 1962. Four years later, his book ''Check Your Own I.Q.'' was published. As low cost pelican [[paperback]]s, these books were popular and reprinted for years under multiple names like ''Test Your IQ.''

== Self-tests versus other tests of intelligence ==
Self-tests of intelligence are quite different from tests that are administered by others, like the [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]], and the [[Wonderlic test]] as with a self-test normally no other parties are involved in the assessment of one's intelligence.

Other tests of intelligence are mostly performed under more controlled circumstances: under the supervision of trained [[psychologist]]s (mostly in groups but sometimes individually).

The motives of self-tests of intelligence are also different. Other tests can be motivated by organizations like the [[military]], [[educational institution]]s, or scholars, but self-tests are normally based on individual motives like [[curiosity]], [[test anxiety]], or [[pride]].

== Certification ==

Certificates one can obtain for self-tests of intelligence are called by various names such as ''Certificate of Intelligence,'' ''Certificate of Intellectual Achievement,'' ''Certificate of High IQ,'' ''IQ examination,'' and ''intelligence test.''

Many self-tests are not offered by an official certification organization. If self-tests are not conducted by some officially certified organization, the value of them may be doubted. An IQ certificate may be offered for commercial reasons, or the way the intelligence quotient is measured may not be based on solid scientific grounds. In fact, any company that would like to do so can offer a certificate based on a self-test of intelligence. If companies do not have some sort of validation or certification to issue such certificates themselves, the value of the certificates can be taken with a grain of salt. It can be questioned who certifies the certification organization. In general, for many other kinds of certifications there are certification boards or standards. If there is no such board or standard, a certification may lack the proper [[accreditation]], which can be defined in this context as ''The formal recognition by an independent body, generally known as an [[accreditation]] body, that a certification body operates according to international standards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification.htm |title=Certification Page on International Organization for Standardization Website |website=Iso.org |accessdate=17 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417154721/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, self-tests of intelligence do not even offer an IQ Certificate, although it may seems obvious that they will offer them (for instance if they ask for payment for the self-test and mention an IQ certificate). At times it may seem self-evident that some test report or IQ certificate is generated as one pays for that, but none is offered.

== Characteristics of self-tests of intelligence ==
There are various types of self-tests of intelligence, those that offer a general score, and those that offer a score based on parts of one's abilities, like [[logic]]al, [[number theory|numeric]], expressive, spacial and other abilities. Intelligence can be seen as ''a very complex concept, in that it encompasses many dimensions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Social Research Methods: Essentials for Getting the Edge |first1=Janet M. |last1=Ruane |isbn=978-1-118-87425-7 |date=February 2016 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Also [[emotional intelligence]] can be measured and self-reports of this have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relating Emotional Abilities to Social Functioning: A Comparison of Self-Report and Performance Measures of Emotional Intelligence |last1=Brackett |first1=Marc A. |last2=Rivers |first2=Susan E. |last3=Shiffman |first3=Sara |last4=Lerner |first4=Nicole |last5=Salovey |first5=Peter |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=October 2006 |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=780–795 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.780 |pmid=17014299 |url=http://www.unh.edu/emotional_intelligence/EI%20Assets/Posted%20on%20Behalf%20of%20the%20HEB%20Lab/Brackett,Rivers_etal.2006.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604032034/http://www.unh.edu/emotional_intelligence/EI%20Assets/Posted%20on%20Behalf%20of%20the%20HEB%20Lab/Brackett,Rivers_etal.2006.pdf |archivedate=June 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tests which work with a time limit, and tests that do not. This may depend on the [[psychology|psychological]] theory or framework that the test is based on.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Studies on self-assessed intelligence ==
According to Tatiana V. Kornilova et al. ''The concept of self-assessed intelligence (SAI) appeared at the intersection of three major fields of research: studies of self-evaluation and [[self-esteem]], studies of lay (or implicit) theories of intelligence, and studies of intelligence as a general cognitive ability.''&lt;ref&gt;SELF-ASSESSED INTELLIGENCE, PERSONALITY, AND PSYCHOMETRIC INTELLIGENCE: PRELIMINARY VALIDATION OF A MODEL WITH A SELECTED STUDENT POPULATION in Psychology in Russia: State of the Art by Tatiana V. Kornilova et al.Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[narcissism|narcissistic]] traits of a person who performs self-evaluations of intelligence has been studied in relation with [[physical attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Narcissistic Illusions in Self-Evaluations of Intelligence and Attractiveness by Marsha T. Gabriel, Joseph W. Critelli and Jullana S. Ee, Journal of Personality Volume 62, Issue 1, pages 143–155, March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the relation between self-assessed intelligence and academic performance has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Self-Assessed Intelligence and Academic Performance DOI:10.1080/01443410500390921 by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzica and Adrian Furnhamb, Published online: 19 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe''' (SHARE) is a multidisciplinary and cross-national [[Longitudinal study|panel database]] of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks of more than 120,000 individuals aged 50 or over (more than 297,000 interviews). SHARE covers 27 European countries and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/organisation/dates-facts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as a response to the [[European Commission]]'s call to "examine the possibility of establishing, in co-operation with Member States, a European Longitudinal Ageing Survey". SHARE has become a major pillar of the [[European Research Area]], selected as one of the projects to be implemented in the [[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures]] (ESFRI) in 2006 and was given a new legal status as the first ever [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (SHARE-ERIC) in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/?pg=eric-landscape&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/organisation/share-eric.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== About SHARE ==
Founded in 2002, SHARE is coordinated centrally at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Sozialrecht und Sozialpolitik|Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA), Max-Planck-Institute for Social Law and Social Policy]] by [[Axel Börsch-Supan]]. It is a collaborative effort of more than 150 researchers worldwide organized in multidisciplinary national teams and cross-national working groups. A Scientific Monitoring Board composed of eminent international researchers and a network of advisors help to maintain and improve the project’s high scientific standards.

SHARE is harmonized with its role models and sister studies the U.S. [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) and the [[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA), and has the advantage of encompassing cross-national variation in public policy, culture and history across a variety of European countries. Its scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process. SHARE’s multi-disciplinary approach delivers a full picture of the ageing process. Procedural guidelines and programs ensure an ex-ante harmonized cross-national design.
Data collected include health variables (e.g. self-reported health, health conditions, physical and cognitive functioning, health behaviour, use of health care facilities), biomarkers (e.g. grip strength, body-mass index, peak flow), psychological variables (e.g. psychological health, well-being, [[life satisfaction]]), economic variables (current work activity, job characteristics, opportunities to work past retirement age, sources and composition of current income, wealth and consumption, housing, education), and social support variables (e.g. assistance within families, transfers of incomes and assets, social networks, volunteer activities).

SHARE data collection is based on [[Computer-assisted personal interviewing|computer-assisted personal interviewing]] (CAPI) complemented by measurements as well as paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The data are available to the entire research community free of charge.

== Summary results ==

=== Economic Situation, Income and Retirement ===
The data collected by SHARE provide a detailed insight into the financial situation of households of elderly Europeans. Among other things, the study shows that not in all European countries incomes are sufficient – therefore, poverty in old age is a serious problem in some countries. Income is considered the least sufficient in the Eastern European countries Poland and Czech Republic, in the Southern European countries Greece, Italy, and Spain as well as Israel. In these countries, more than 50 percent of households report difficulties making ends meet with their income. In contrast, income is considered satisfactory especially in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland; there, less than 20 percent of households have problems getting by with their income.

Likewise, patterns of employment and retirement differ significantly between the European countries. The proportion of people with high workloads in the low wage sector is particularly high in Poland and Greece. Accordingly, the proportion of early retirees is above average. In contrast, work quality in regard to the balance between performance and wage is high in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. These countries also show the lowest percentage of older employees opting for early retirement.

=== Family ===
Availability of kin support largely depends in general on geographic accessibility and social contact. The SHARE data confirm, on the one hand, the existence of longstanding regional patterns of ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ family ties, while, on the other hand, they reveal many similarities across Europe. In all countries – and across all age groups – 85 percent of all parents have at least one child living at a distance of at most 25&amp;nbsp;km. Moreover, the share of parents with less than weekly contacts to a child is equally low (7%) in Sweden and in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These results provide no evidence to support the notion of a ‘decline’ of parent-child relations in ageing Europe at the beginning of the 21st century.

=== Health ===
SHARE data document a strong relationship between education and health among the older population. This holds not only on the individual level (better educated individuals are healthier than less educated) but also across European nations. Comparing average education and average health levels in SHARE countries reveals that in particular the East European and Mediterranean countries are characterized by low levels of education and health simultaneously. In contrast, populations in Northern European countries and Switzerland are both healthier and better educated than the average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research with SHARE data ==
As of January 2018, about 7.500 researchers worldwide use SHARE data for their research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/share-publications/user-publications-statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; Publications based on SHARE data are documented and published online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/share-publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves of data collection ==
[[File:SHARE EU Karte.jpg|thumb|Countries participating in Wave 7 of the SHARE study]]
By now, seven waves of data collection have been conducted. Further waves are being planned to take place on a biennial basis.

=== Wave 1 (2004) ===
Eleven European countries have contributed data to the 2004 SHARE baseline study. They constitute a balanced representation of the various regions in Europe, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden) through Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece). Israel joined the SHARE framework in late 2004, being the first country in the Middle East to initiate a systematic study of its aging population.
The SHARE main questionnaire consisted of 20 modules on health, socio-economics and social networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; All data were collected by face-to-face, computer-aided personal interviews (CAPI), supplemented by a self-completion paper and pencil questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 2 (2006-07) ===

Two 'new' EU member states - the Czech Republic and Poland - as well as Ireland joined SHARE in 2006 and participated in the second wave of data collection in 2006-07.
In addition to the main questionnaire an ‘End of Life’ interview was conducted for family members of deceased respondents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Israel carried out its second wave in 2009-10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 3 / SHARELIFE (2008-09) ===

SHARELIFE is the third wave of data collection for SHARE, which focuses on people's life histories. 30,000 men and women across 13 European countries took part in this round of the survey.
SHARELIFE links individual micro data over the respondents’ entire life with institutional macro data on the welfare state. It thereby allows assessing the full effect of welfare state interventions on the life of the individual. Changes in institutional settings that influence individual decisions are of specific interest to evaluate policies throughout Europe.
The SHARELIFE questionnaire contains all important areas of the respondents’ lives, ranging from partners and children over housing and work history to detailed questions on health and health care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-3-sharelife.html&lt;/ref&gt; With this variety SHARELIFE constitutes a large interdisciplinary dataset for research in the fields of sociology, economics, gerontology, and demography. 
The SHARELIFE life history data can be linked to the first two waves of SHARE assessing the present living conditions of older Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-3-sharelife.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 4 (2010-11) ===

In the fourth wave which started in autumn 2010, Estonia, Hungary, Luxemburg, Portugal and Slovenia joined the SHARE survey. In the other European countries the national samples were enlarged, and a new social network module was added to the main questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the German study, three additional projects including innovative biomarkers (e.g. dried bloodspots), the linkage with the German pension data as well as nonresponse experiments were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 5 (2013) ===

Data collection for Wave 5 took place in 2013. A total of 15 countries participated in this wave, including, for the first time, Luxemburg. Since March 2015 the data is available for research purposes. Wave 5 included additional questions regarding childhood, material deprivation, social exclusion, and migration, as well as information on computer skills and the use of computers at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 6 (2015) ===

Wave 6 was conducted in 2015 in 17 countries. One of the most important innovations was the collection of objective health measures by means of “Dried Blood Spot Sampling” (DBSS): In 12 countries, a blood samples were collected in order to determine blood levels which are associated with diseases that primarily occur among older people. These include cardiovascular diseases and diseases that can be triggered by external living conditions and environmental factors, such as diabetes mellitus (type 2). These additional biomarkers are expected to be a useful instrument for comparing the objective health status with the subjective perception of the respondents. Moreover, they should help to explain correlations between health and social status and to demonstrate the course of a disease. Wave 6 furthermore captures longitudinal changes in the social networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 7 (2017) ===

In 2017, the main data collection of Wave 7 took place in 28 countries - full coverage of the EU was achieved by including 8 new countries in SHARE: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus. The Wave 7 questionnaire contains a SHARELIFE module for all respondents who did not participate in Wave 3 (first SHARELIFE wave), as well as a standard module for all respondents who already answered a SHARELIFE interview.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-7.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years and education ==
Naidich was born in [[Buenos Aires]]. She studied at National Direction of Culture (Buenos Aires, 1949–50), [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|University of Music and Performing Arts]] ([[Vienna]], Austria, 1950–52), [[Collegium Musicum]] ([[Salzburg]], Austria, 1951), [[Brandeis University]] ([[Waltham, Massachusetts]], US, 1954–56), and [[Longy School of Music of Bard College]] ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], 1954–56).&lt;ref name="Curriculum"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040613013412/http://www.susananaidich.com.ar/curriculum/curriculum.htm «Currículum vítae»], en el sitio web de Susana Naidich.&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her singing debut at the age of 17 at the School of Opera, [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Voz"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081022054322/http://www.sav.org.ar/nuevo_sitio_sav/naidich13_10_08.php «Entrevista exclusiva a Susana Naidich: “Un cantante no puede emitir con libertad si está pensando en su onda sonora”], artículo de Soledad Sacheri en el sitio web de la Sociedad Argentina de la Voz.&lt;/ref&gt; While studying in Vienna, she performed in the [[Salzburg Festival]] under the direction of [[Georg Solti]].&lt;ref name="DBAnoticias"&gt;[http://dbanoticias.com/2011/06/susana-naidich-personalidad-destacada/ «Susana Naidich, personalidad destacada»], artículo en el diario DBA Noticias, de junio de 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;«Acerca de los músicos judíos exiliados en la Argentina durante el nazismo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After returning to Buenos Aires, she joined the cast of Teatro Colón, performing under the direction of [[Karl Böhm]], [[Erich Kleiber]], and [[Jean Martinon|Jean Martinón]], among others. Simultaneously, she was appeared as a soloist in other symphonic venues. In the United States, she sang in various festivals, including [[Tanglewood]] and [[Boston]], accompanied by [[Aaron Copland]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]]. In 1963 and 1964, she worked in Israel, performing in concerts with orchestra and on camera.&lt;ref name="Voz"/&gt; During this trip, she recorded ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Eurídice]]'' (of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]), ''[[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Shéhérazade]]'' (of [[Maurice Ravel]]), ''[[El amor brujo|The love wizard]]'' (of [[Manuel de Falla]]), and ''[[Songs Of A Wayfarer]]'' (of [[Gustav Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="DiarioZ"&gt;[http://www.diarioz.com.ar/#/susana-naidich-personalidad-destacada-de-la-cultura/ «Susana Naidich, personalidad destacada de la Cultura»], artículo en el ''Diario Z'' del 14 de junio de 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, while she continued her performance activities, she began to teach classes (private and institutional) in voice, sung and spoken, vocal technical elements for voice (without forcing the vocal cords), rehabilitation of functional problems ([[Dysphonia|disfonías]]) related to organic (nodules, polyps and edemas) or by bad technical training, erroneous vocal classification (in singers) and abuse of the voice.&lt;ref name="DiarioZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioZ"/&gt; In 1970, Naidich recorded the [[LP record|LP]] "Cantares de madre", [[lullaby]]es of diverse origins. The arrangements were under the direction of Eduardo Rovira. The re-release in 2000 included five [[Spiritual (music)|black spirituals]], in which Alberto Favero coordinated the orchestral direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/2000/suple/radar/00-07/00-07-23/nota3.htm «Veinte años de la muerte de Eduardo Rovira, el otro Piazzolla»], artículo de [[Julio Nudler]] en el diario ''[[Página/12]]'' del 23 de julio de 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she sang [[Spiritual (music)|black spirituals]] and works of [[George Gershwin]] in duet with her daughter Alisa Kaufman in a popular music show called Verdadero Encanto in the [[Centro Cultural Borges]].&lt;ref name="LaNacion"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/418790-canciones-entre-madre-e-hija «Canciones entre madre e hija.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Naidich speaks and writes in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="Curriculum"/&gt; Her professional associations include: International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics, Collegium Medicorum Thetri, Argentinian association Logopedia and Foniatría, and Argentinian Society of the Voice, in which she was the founder and first president, between 2000 and 2003.&lt;ref name="DiarioZ"/&gt; Her publications have included "Principios de foniatría: para alumnos de canto y dicción", with Renato Segré and María Cristina (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040806022600/http://www.susananaidich.com.ar/publicaciones/comentario.htm Comentario de Julio Bernaldo de Quirós] al libro ''Principios de foniatría''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various publications on speech pathology.&lt;ref name="DiarioZ"/&gt;

[[Thallium]] and its compounds are often highly toxic.&lt;ref name=EMedicine821465&gt;{{EMedicine|article|821465|Thallium Toxicity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with skin is dangerous, and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal.&lt;ref name="WebEl"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Tl/biol.html | title = Biology of Thallium | publisher = webelemnts| accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many thallium(I) compounds are highly [[solubility|soluble]] in water and are readily absorbed through the skin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Exposure to them should not exceed 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of skin in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium is a suspected human [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref name="WebEl"/&gt;

Part of the reason for thallium's high [[toxicity]] is that, when present in aqueous solution as the univalent thallium(I) ion (Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), it exhibits some similarities with essential [[alkali metal]] cations, particularly [[potassium]] (due to similar [[Ionic radius|ionic radii]]). It can thus enter the body via potassium uptake pathways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141021160520/http://www.aurorabiomed.com/download/presentations/pres09/Wei_Zheng.pdf A Homogenous Thallium Flux Assay for High Throughput Screen of Potassium Channels]&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of thallium's chemistry differ strongly from that of the alkali metals, such as its high [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for [[sulfur]] ligands. Thus, this substitution disrupts many cellular processes (for instance, thallium may attack sulfur-containing proteins such as [[cysteine]] residues and [[ferredoxin]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/vogteh/assignments/eliminatingthalliumpoisoning-bogdanmandzyuk &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;Eliminating Thallium (poisoning)&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thallium's toxicity has led to its use (now discontinued in many countries) as a [[rat]] and [[ant]] poison.&lt;ref name=EMedicine821465/&gt;

Among the distinctive effects of thallium poisoning are [[alopecia|hair loss]] (which led to its initial use as a [[depilatory]] before its toxicity was properly appreciated) and [[Peripheral neuropathy|damage to peripheral nerves]] (victims may experience a sensation of walking on hot coals), although the loss of hair only generally occurs in low doses; in high doses the thallium kills before this can take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, The Poisoner's Handbook, 256&lt;/ref&gt; Thallium was once an effective murder weapon before its effects became understood and an antidote ([[Prussian blue]]) discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = International Journal of Biochemistry |volume = 22 | issue = 5 | year = 1990 | pages = 429–438 | doi = 10.1016/0020-711X(90)90254-Z | title = Thallium in biochemistry |author1=Douglas, K. T. |author2=Bunni, M. A. |author3=Baindur, S. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, thallium poisoning has been called the "poisoner's poison" since thallium is colorless, odorless and tasteless; its slow-acting, painful and wide-ranging symptoms are often suggestive of a host of other illnesses and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Ellis Nutt &amp; Sue Epstein, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html A 15-year-old case yields a timely clue in deadly thallium poisoning], [[The Star-Ledger]], February 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment and internal decontamination ==

There are two main methods of removing both radioactive and stable isotopes of thallium from humans. First known was to use [[Prussian blue]], which is a solid [[ion exchange]] material, which absorbs thallium. Up to 20&amp;nbsp;g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the [[Human feces|stool]]. [[Hemodialysis]] and [[hemoperfusion]] are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/prussianblue.asp Prussian blue fact sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020123050/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/prussianblue.asp |date=2013-10-20 }} from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Malbrain, M.

==Bioconcentration==
According to the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), thallium release to the environment was reported in Texas and Ohio. This may indicate bioconcentration in aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427121500/http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/dwh/t-ioc/thallium.html|url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/dwh/t-ioc/thallium.html|title=Technical Drinking Water and Health Contaminant Specific Fact Sheets|archivedate=27 April 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thallium compounds==
The [[odor]]less and [[taste]]less [[Thallium(I) sulfate|thallium sulfate]] was also used as [[rat poison]] and [[ant]] killer. Since 1975, this use in the [[United States]] and many other countries is prohibited due to safety concerns.&lt;ref name="sl2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chemical fact sheet — Thallium | publisher=''Spectrum Laboratories'' |date=April 2001 | url=http://www.speclab.com/elements/thallium.htm | accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection in body fluids==
Thallium may be quantitated in blood or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. Normal background blood and urine concentrations in healthy persons are usually less than 1&amp;nbsp;μg/litre, but they are often in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;mg/litre range in survivors of acute intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Guohua |last2=Ding |first2=Meiping |last3=Zhang |first3=Baorong |last4=Lv |first4=Wen |last5=Yin |first5=Houmin |last6=Zhang |first6=Liang |last7=Ying |first7=Zhilin |last8=Zhang |first8=Qiong |title=Clinical Manifestations and Management of Acute Thallium Poisoning |journal=European Neurology |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=292–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18824857 |doi=10.1159/000157883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Randall Clint |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=1522–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous uses as a poison ==

There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its use for [[murder]], thallium has gained the nicknames "The Poisoner's Poison" and "Inheritance Powder" (alongside [[arsenic]]).

===Australia's "Thallium Craze"===

In [[Australia]], in the early 1950s, there was a notable spate of cases of murder or attempted murder by thallium poisoning. At this time, due to the chronic rat infestation problems in overcrowded inner-city suburbs (notably in Sydney), and thallium's effectiveness as a rat poison, it was still readily available over the counter in New South Wales, where thallium sulphate was marketed as a commercial rat bait, under the brand "Thall-rat".

* In September 1952, [[Yvonne Gladys Fletcher]], a housewife and mother of two from the inner [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], was charged and tried for the murders of both her first husband, Desmond Butler (who died in 1948) and her abusive second husband, Bertrand "Bluey" Fletcher, a rat bait layer, from whom Yvonne had obtained the thallium poison that she used to kill him earlier that year. Suspicions were raised after it became obvious to friends and neighbours that Bluey Fletcher was suffering from the same fatal illness that had killed Yvonne's first husband. A police investigation led to the exhumation and testing of Desmond Butler's remains, which showed clear evidence of thallium, and this led to Yvonne being convicted of Butler's murder. She was sentenced to death, but this was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment after the NSW Government abolished the death penalty; she was eventually released in 1964. At the time of the trial, it was reported that this was the first known case in Australia of a person being convicted of murder by administering thallium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18283164 ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 1952]. Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph.com.au"&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011]. Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fletcher case is also notable for the fact that one of the arresting officers was Sydney detective [[Fred Krahe]], who later became notorious for his suspected close involvement with elements of Sydney's organised crime scene and his alleged involvement in the disappearance of social activist [[Juanita Nielsen]].
* A month later, in October 1952, [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] grandmother Ruby Norton was tried for the murder of her daughter's fiancė Allen Williams, who died of thallium poisoning at [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] Hospital in July 1952. Despite allegations that Norton hated all the men in her family and Williams was an unwanted son-in-law, Norton was acquitted.&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph.com.au"/&gt;
* In 1953, Sydney woman Veronica Monty, 45, was tried for the attempted murder of her son-in-law, noted [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] and Australian rugby league player [[Bob Lulham]], who was treated for thallium poisoning in 1952. After separating from her husband, Monty had moved in with her daughter Judy and Judy's husband, Bob Lulham. The sensational trial revealed that Lulham and Monty had an "intimate relationship" while Lulham's wife was at Sunday mass. Monty was found not guilty; Judy Lulham divorced her husband as a result of the revelations about his affair, and Veronica Monty killed herself with thallium in 1955.&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph.com.au"/&gt;
* In July 1953, Sydney woman Beryl Hague was tried for "maliciously administering thallium and endangering her husband's life". Hague confessed to buying Thall-rat from a corner shop and putting it in her husband's tea, because she wanted to "give him a headache to repay the many headaches he had given me" in violent disputes&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph.com.au"/&gt; 
* In 1953, Australian [[Caroline Grills]] was sentenced to life in prison after three family members and a close family friend died. Authorities found thallium in tea that she had given to two additional family members. Grills spent the rest of her life in Sydney's Long Bay Gaol, where fellow inmates dubbed her "Aunt Thally".&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-thallium"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6163520.stm ''What is thallium?''], BBC, November 19, 2006.  Retrieved November 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/post-war-days-of-thallium-and-old-lace/story-fn6ccwsa-1226060629402 Marea Donnelly, "Post-war days of thallium and old lace", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian TV documentary ''[[Recipe for Murder (film)|Recipe for Murder]]'', released in 2011, examined three of the most sensational and widely reported Australian thallium poisonings, the Fletcher, Monty and Grills cases.

===Other notable cases===

* [[Félix-Roland Moumié]], a [[Cameroon]]ian leader, was assassinated with thallium in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]] on 3 November 1960 by a former agent of the [[SDECE]] (French secret service) probably at the request of Cameroonian authorities.
* In 1971, thallium was the main poison that [[Graham Frederick Young]] used to poison around 70 people in the English village of [[Bovingdon]], [[Hertfordshire]], of whom three died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2990.1991.tb00687.x | title = What have we learnt from Graham Frederick Young?

* From 1976 to late 1979, thallium was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent, most notably by a unit of the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) attached to the [[Selous Scouts]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Cross, "Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975-1980," Solihull, UK: [http://www.helion.co.uk/dirty-war-rhodesia-and-chemical-biological-warfare-1975-1980.html Helion &amp; Company](2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1977, a 19-month-old girl living in [[Qatar]] fell ill due to thallium poisoning (from pesticides used by her parents). While doctors were unable to identify the cause, a nurse named Marsha Maitland managed to do it from the description of the symptoms given in ''[[The Pale Horse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yeyfuCFgDj8C&amp;pg=PA325#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Elements of Murder : A History of Poison]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In summer 1981 the East German secret service "Stasi" poisoned dissident Wolfgang Welsch, who had previously been expelled to West Germany, on his holiday in Israel. He barely survived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wissen/article102972391/Giftmord-Thallium-hat-Arsen-abgeloest.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1987, in Kiev, a woman named [[:ru:Иванютина, Тамара Антоновна|Tamara Ivanutina]] was arrested along with her older sister and parents. They were found guilty of 40 cases of poisoning (13 of them lethal) with [[Clerici solution]] obtained from an acquaintance working at a geology institute. Tamara (guilty of nine deaths, including four children) was executed; one of the three documented cases of women receiving the capital punishment in post-Stalin Soviet Union. Her relatives received prison terms, the parents dying in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizarrepedia.com/tamara-ivanyutina-family-killers Tamara Ivanyutina and Her Family of Serial Killers] - Bizarrepedia&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1988, members of the Carr family from Alturas, [[Polk County, Florida]], fell ill from what appeared to be thallium poisoning.  Peggy Carr, the mother, died slowly and painfully from the poison. Her son and stepson were critically ill but eventually recovered.  The Carrs' neighbor, chemist [[George J.

* Thallium was the poison of choice for [[Saddam Hussein]] to use on dissidents, which even allowed for them to emigrate before dying.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/#q=thallium+saddam&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, [[Zhu Ling (poisoning victim)|Zhu Ling]] was the victim of an [[Thallium poisoning case of Zhu Ling|unsolved attempted thallium poisoning]] in [[Beijing]], China. In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore studying Physical Chemistry at [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain and extensive hair loss. Ultimately she was diagnosed on [[Usenet]] with poisoning by thallium. To this day, there is still speculation among Chinese expatriates overseas as to the poisoner's identity. The only suspect of the police investigation, Sun Wei, is a member of a family with high-level political connections, which may have been used to halt and suppress the results of the investigation.  Sun Wei was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said she was the only student who had access to thallium compound at the school. The investigation's results have never been released to Zhu Ling's parents or the general public. However, Tsinghua University declined to issue Sun Wei's B. S. certificate and refused to provide her with the documentation needed to get a passport or visa in 1997.
* In 1999, Norwegian [[Terje Wiik]] was sentenced to 21 years prison for poisoning his girlfriend with thallium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/21-ar-for-terje-wiik/65576919|title=21 år for Terje Wiik|date=2000-02-11|work=Dagbladet.no|access-date=2018-07-01|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2004, 25 Russian soldiers earned Honorable Mentions in the [[Darwin Awards]] after becoming ill from thallium exposure when they found a can of mysterious white powder in a rubbish dump on their base at [[Khabarovsk]] in the Russian Far East.

* In 2011, a chemist at [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] in [[New Jersey]], Li Tianle, was charged with the murder of her husband. According to an investigation by the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]] Prosecutor's Office, Li Tianle was able to obtain a chemical containing thallium and fed it to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Death-by-Poison-NJ-Police-Charge-Woman-in-Death-of-her-Husband-115590444.html] NBC New York, February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Li was a chemistry student at Beijing University at the time of the highly publicized thallium poisoning of [[Zhu Ling (poisoning victim)|Zhu Ling]] in 1995 at neighboring Tsinghua University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/thallium_is_favored_method_of.html ''A 15-year-old case yields a timely clue in deadly thallium poisoning''], NJ.com News, February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urine screening revealed elevated thallium levels in a small number of other members of the chemistry department, though none were at toxic levels. The source of the poisoning remains unknown, and although police investigations were fruitless, foul play is strongly suspected.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''''United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries''''', [[Case citation|86]] [[F.2d]] 737 ([[2d Cir.]] 1936) (often just '''''U.S. v. One Package'''''), was an ''[[in rem jurisdiction|in rem]]''  [[United States Court of Appeals]] case in the [[2nd Cir.|Second Circuit]] involving [[birth control]].

==Background==
In 1873 Congress adopted the [[Comstock Act]], which prohibited the importation or mailing of "obscene matter".  The law's definition of obscene matter included [[contraceptive]]s or information about contraception.  In the 1930s, [[Margaret Sanger]] and the [[National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control]] lobbied Congress to revise this law, but were unsuccessful.

==The case==
Dr. Hannah Stone, at one of Sanger's clinics, ordered a new type of [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] (a [[pessary]]) from a [[Japan]]ese [[physician]] to be shipped from [[Tokyo]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="Ph.D.2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ph.D.|first=Aharon W. Zorea|title=Birth Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykBkLjaI-qcC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=18 March 2016|date=2012-01-16|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313362552|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon arrival in the United States the shipment was seized and confiscated under the [[Tariff Act of 1930]], which had incorporated the anti-contraceptive provisions of the Comstock Act.

A lower court ruled against the government. When the government appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], the appellate court affirmed the lower court's ruling.  The appellate court held that the law could not be used to intercept shipments which originated from a doctor.&lt;ref name="McCann1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCann|first=Carole R.|title=Birth Control Politics in the United States, 1916-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it1LHbLKVpkC&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=18 March 2016|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801486128|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Augustus Noble Hand]] wrote, in his decision:

{{quote|While it is true that the policy of Congress has been to forbid the use of contraceptives altogether if the only purpose of using them be to prevent conception in cases where it would not be injurious to the welfare of the patient or her offspring, it is going far beyond such a policy to hold that abortions, which destroy incipient life, may be allowed in proper cases, and yet that no measures may be taken to prevent conception even though a likely result should be to require the termination of pregnancy by means of an operation. It seems unreasonable to suppose that the national scheme of legislation involves such inconsistencies and requires the complete suppression of articles, the use of which in many cases is advocated by such a weight of authority in the medical world.&lt;ref&gt;86 F. 2d. at 739-40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Water Industry Commission for Scotland (WICS)''' is the economic regulator of the water and sewerage industry in Scotland. Established in 2005, it is an executive non-departmental public body of the [[Scottish Government]] with statutory responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watercommission.co.uk/view_Our%20role%20and%20remit.aspx |title=About us: Our role and remit |publisher=Water Industry Commission for Scotland |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission comprises a non-executive Chairman, two non-executive members and an office of supporting staff. Based in Stirling, the office is led by the Chief Executive, Alan Sutherland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watercommission.co.uk/view_Alan_Sutherland.aspx |title=Alan Sutherland |publisher=Water Industry Commission for Scotland |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also a member of the Commission.

== Activities ==

===Price setting===
The Water Industry Commission for Scotland has a statutory duty to promote the interests of customers by setting prices for water and sewerage services that deliver Scottish Ministers’ objectives for the water industry at the lowest reasonable overall cost. The objectives include improvements in water quality, environmental performance and customer service. The price setting process takes place every six years, with the current regulatory period covering the years 2015-2021.

===Monitoring performance===
The Commission monitors and reports on Scottish Water’s performance regarding customer service, investment, costs and leakage. The Commission sets challenging targets for Scottish Water to achieve and monitors performance to make sure that it responds positively to these challenges.
The regulatory framework in Scotland has resulted in [[Scottish Water]] becoming significantly more efficient and has helped keep bills low – average household bills in 2015-16 are around £40 lower than they are in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watercommission.co.uk/UserFiles/Documents/Performance%20Report%202010-15.pdf "Scottish Water Performance Report 2010-15"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
The Commission is also responsible for facilitating competition in the Scottish water industry. In April 2008 Scotland became the first country in the world to open up water and sewerage services to competition for all non-household customers, under the Water Services etc. (Scotland) Act 2005. This means that all non-household customers (public sector, non-profit and business organisations) are able to choose who provides their services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandontap.gov.uk/ "Scotland on Tap"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission is responsible for implementing the framework set out in the Act, including licensing all participants in the market. Since competition has been introduced there have been significant improvements for customers, with more options and better services.
