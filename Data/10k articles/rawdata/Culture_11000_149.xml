[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|27 Club graffiti in Tel Aviv depicting several members of the club.]]
The '''27 Club''' is a list of [[popular music]]ians, artists, or actors who died at age 27. It originated with an unsupported claim of a "statistical spike" for the death of musicians at that age, but this has been repeatedly disproved by research.

It remains a cultural [[meme]], documenting the deaths of celebrities, some noted for their high-risk lifestyles. Names are often put forward for inclusion, but because the club is entirely notional, there is no official membership.

Statistical studies have failed to find any unusual pattern of musician deaths at this age, comparing it to equally small increases at ages 25 and 32, with a 2011 ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'' study noting instead that [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] musicians have a higher death rate than the rest of the young adult population, concluding: "Fame may increase the risk of death among musicians, but this risk is not limited to age 27".&lt;ref name="BMJStudy"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.bmj.com/press-releases/2011/12/20/27-really-dangerous-age-famous-musicians-retrospective-cohort-study | title=Is 27 really a dangerous age for famous musicians?

The "club" has been repeatedly cited in music magazines, journals and the daily press. Several exhibitions have been devoted to the idea, as well as novels, films and stage plays.&lt;ref name="history-of-the-27-club-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=27: A History of the 27 Club through the Lives of Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse|isbn=978-0306821684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the-27-club-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 27 Club: Why Age 27 Is Important|isbn=978-0473206840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the-27s"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll|isbn=978-0615189642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curse-of-27-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Curse of 27: They Have Three Things in Common.

Cobain and Hendrix biographer [[Charles R. Cross]] wrote, four years before the ''BMJ'' study was published, "The number of musicians who died at 27 is truly remarkable by any standard. [Although] humans die regularly at all ages, there is a statistical spike for musicians who die at 27."&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/writers/304767_writer23.html |title= P-I's Writer in Residence Charles R.

== History ==
[[File:Jim Morrison 1969.JPG|right|thumb|Jim Morrison, lead singer of the rock band [[the Doors]]]]
[[Brian Jones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] all died at the age of 27 between 1969 and 1971. At the time, the coincidence gave rise to some comment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Nesta Roberts |title= Flower bower |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= September 10, 1971 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= James Riordan | author2 = Jerry Prochnicky | title = Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison | publisher = It Books | year= 1992 | isbn = 978-0-688-11915-7 | pages = 416, 467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the 1994 [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death]] of [[Kurt Cobain]] at age 27, that the idea of a "27 Club" began to catch on in public perception.&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi"/&gt;

According to Hendrix and Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross, the growing importance of the media—Internet, television and magazines—and the response to an interview of Cobain's mother were jointly responsible for such theories. An excerpt from a statement that Cobain's mother, Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor, made in the [[Aberdeen, Washington]], newspaper ''[[The Daily World (Aberdeen)|The Daily World]]''—"Now he's gone and joined that stupid club. I told him not to join that stupid club."—referred to Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison dying at the same age, according to Cross.&lt;ref name="cross-357"&gt;{{cite book | author = Charles R. Cross | title = Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain | publisher = Hyperion |year = 2002 | page = 357 | edition = 2nd |isbn = 978-0-7868-8402-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors share his view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = R. Gary Patterson | title = Take a Walk on the Dark Side: Rock and Roll Myths, Legends, and Curses | page = 259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Eric Segalstad, writer of ''[[The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll]]'', assumed that Cobain's mother referred to the death of his two uncles and his great-uncle, all of whom had also committed suicide.&lt;ref name="the27s-12"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Josh Hunter | author2 = Eric Segalstad | title = The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll | publisher = Samadhi Creations | location = Berkeley Lake | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-615-18964-2 | page = 12 | url = http://the27s.com/ | accessdate =September 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919002136/http://www.the27s.com/| archivedate=September 19, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cross, the events have led a "set of conspiracy theorists [to suggest] the absurd notion that Kurt Cobain intentionally timed his death so he could join the 27 Club".&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi" /&gt;

In 2011, seventeen years after Cobain's death, [[Amy Winehouse]] died at the age of 27, prompting a renewed swell of media attention devoted to the club once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and the 27 Club|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/amy-winehouse-jimi-hendrix-kurt-cobain-and-the-27-club/2011/07/23/gIQAiLAhVI_blog.html|agency=The Washington Post|issue=July 23, 2011|date=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years earlier, she had expressed a fear of dying at that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/13488/stating-the-obvious-amy-winehouse-fears-early-death/ |title=The Inquisitr: Stating the Obvious, Amy Winehouse |date=December 28, 2008 |publisher=Inquisitr.com |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual does not necessarily have to be a musician to qualify as a member of the 27 Club. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included television actor [[Jonathan Brandis]], who committed suicide in 2003, in a list of "members" of the 27 Club.&lt;ref name="RS-A-Brief-History"/&gt; [[Anton Yelchin]], who had played in a punk rock band but was primarily known as a film actor, was also described as a member of the club upon his death in 2016.&lt;ref name="yelchinbbc"/&gt; Likewise, [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] has been included in 27 Club lists, despite the relative brevity of his music career and his prominence as a graffiti artist and painter.&lt;ref name=Yahoo /&gt;&lt;ref name=BuzzFeed /&gt;

== Scientific studies ==

A study published in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' in December 2011 concluded that there was no increase in the risk of death for musicians at the age of 27. Although the sampled musicians faced an increased risk of death in their 20s and 30s, this was not limited to the age of 27.&lt;ref name="BMJStudy" /&gt; A 2015 article in ''[[The Independent]]'' also provided statistical evidence that popular musicians are not more likely to die at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Dianna Theodora (April 2, 2015). [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/why-the-27-club-is-a-myth-jimi-hendrix-and-amy-winehouse-may-be-members-but-that-doesnt-make-it-real-10152675.html "Why the 27 Club Is a Myth: Jimi Hendrix and Amy Winehouse May Be Members But That Doesn't Make It Real"], ''The Independent''.

The song title "27" by [[Fall Out Boy]] from their album ''[[Folie a Deux (album)|Folie à Deux]]'' is a reference to the club.  The song explores the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles common in rock and roll.  [[Pete Wentz]], the primary lyricist of Fall Out Boy, wrote the song because he felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Stevie Chick meets"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/24/falloutboy-popandrock|title=Chemical brothers|last=Chick|first=Stevie|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2011|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his song "Brand Name" from the album ''[[GO:OD AM]]'', [[Mac Miller]] says "To everyone who sell me drugs, don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hoping not to join the twenty-seven club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Mac-miller-brand-name-lyrics|title=Brand Name by Mac Miller|website=Genius|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself died on September 7, 2018, at the age of 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-dead-at-26-720756|title=Mac Miller Dead at 26|author=Klinkenberg, Brendan|website=Rolling Stone|date=September 7, 2018|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autopsy revealed that cause of death was an accidental overdose of [[Fentanyl#Overdose|fentanyl, cocaine]] and alcohol.&lt;ref name=cause&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-cause-of-death-fentanyl-cocaine-alcohol-751974/|title=Mac Miller’s Cause of Death: Accidental Fentanyl, Cocaine Overdose|date=2018-11-05|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Colors (Halsey song)|Colors]]" by [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] references the club with the lyric, "I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papermag.com/halsey-new-americana-1510217196.html |title=''Halsey On Being A Gossip Magnet, Growing Up Emo, And How People Missed The Satire In "New Americana"'' |author= Lobenfeld, Claire |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Paper Magazine|access-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "27 Club" by [[Ivy Levan]] released as a promotional single for her debut album ''[[No Good (album)|No Good]]'' released in 2015 is a reference to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iamhighvoltage.com/2015/08/12/no-good-by-ivy-levan|title=NO GOOD BY IVY LEVAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In [[New York City]], Richie ([[Shawn Christensen]]), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill ([[Ron Perlman]]), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.

At his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie ([[Emmy Rossum]]), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia ([[Fátima Ptacek]]). Richie goes to her school, where she recites "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]" by [[Emily Dickinson]] in both English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.

Richie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for [[menopause]]. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.

Richie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon ([[Paul Wesley]]), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.

As a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham ([[Richard Schiff]]), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.

Richie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called "Sophia". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.

After Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren ([[Fran Kranz]]), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.

Having reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.

Maggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a "false idol". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "visually well mounted, but too overwrought to really convince or resonate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-before-i-disappear-1201136801/|title=SXSW Film Review: 'Before I Disappear'|last=Chang|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eric Kohn of [[Indiewire]] rated it B− and wrote that the film "contains all the strong moments that distinguished ''Curfew'' while surrounding them with a lot of superfluous additions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sxsw-review-oscar-nominated-short-film-receives-competent-feature-length-upgrade-with-before-i-disappear|title=SXSW Review: Oscar-Winning Short Film Receives Questionable Feature-Length Upgrade With 'Before I Disappear'|last=Kohn|first=Eric|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Adams of ''[[Screen Daily]]'' described it as "a stylish and beautifully shot adaptation, strong on performance and a nicely nuanced script, but in the end perhaps lacking an expanded story to suit its feature length."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/before-i-disappear/5068616.article|title=Before I Disappear|last=Adams|first=Mark|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote a negative review, in which he criticized the writing and flow of the film as being sporadic, but gave credit to the performances of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rooney | first = David | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/before-i-disappear-venice-review-728524 | title = 'Before I Disappear': Venice Review | date = August 27, 2014 | publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | accessdate = August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the standard form of Bengali is largely uniform across West Bengal and Bangladesh, there are a few sounds that vary in pronunciation (in addition to the myriad variations in non-standard dialects):

* {{note|1|1}} {{IPA|/f/}}: (written as {{angbr|{{lang|bn|ফ}}}}) can be produced as a voiceless aspirated stop {{IPA|[pʰ]}}, or a voiceless labial fricative ({{IPAblink|ɸ}} or {{IPAblink|f}}), depending on the speaker.
* {{note|2|2}} {{IPA|/s/}} is a phoneme for many speakers of Standard Bengali (e.g. {{lang|bn|সিরকা}} {{IPA|/sirka/}} 'vinegar', {{lang|bn|অস্থির}} {{IPA|/ɔstʰir/}} 'uneasy', {{lang|bn|ব্যস}} {{IPA|/bas/}} or {{IPA|/bɛs/}} 'enough').
** For most speakers, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are phonemically distinct ({{lang|bn|আস্তে}} {{IPA|/aste/}} 'softly' vs. {{lang|bn|আসতে}} {{IPA|/aʃte/}} 'to come'). For some, especially in [[Rajshahi]], there is no difference between {{lang|bn|স}} and {{lang|bn|শ}}, ({{lang|bn|বাস}} {{IPA|/bas/}} 'bus' vs. {{lang|bn|বাঁশ}} {{IPA|/bas/}}); they have the same consonant sound.
** For some speakers, {{IPA|[s]}} can be analyzed as an allophone of either {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}} ({{IPA|[ʃalam]}} for {{lang|bn|সালাম}} {{IPA|[salam]}} 'greetings' or {{lang|bn|বিচ্ছিরি}} {{IPA|[bitʃʰiri]}} for {{lang|bn|বিশ্রী}} {{IPA|[bisri]}} 'ugly').
** Some words that originally had {{IPA|/s/}} are now pronounced with {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}} in Standard Bengali ({{lang|bn|পছন্দ}} ''pochondo'' {{IPA|[pɔtʃʰondo]}} 'like', compared to Persian ''pasand'').
* {{note|3|3}} {{IPA|/z/}}: {{angbr|{{lang|bn|জ}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|bn|য}}}} may represent a voiced affricate {{IPAslink|dʒ}} in Standard Bengali words of native origin, but they can also represent {{IPAslink|z}} in foreign words and names ({{lang|bn|জাকাত}} {{IPA|[zakat]}} '[[zakah]] charity', {{lang|bn|আজিজ}} {{IPA|[aziz]}} 'Aziz'). Many speakers replace {{IPA|/z/}} with {{IPA|/dʒ/}}. However, a native ''s/z'' opposition has developed in Chittagong Bengali.

* {{note|4|4}} {{IPA|/ɽ/}}: In the form of Standard Bengali spoken in Dhaka, {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are often indistinct phonemically, and thus the pairs {{lang|bn|পড়ে}} {{IPA|/pɔɾe/}} 'reads'/'falls' vs. {{lang|bn|পরে}} {{IPA|/pɔre/}} 'wears'/'after', and {{lang|bn|করা}} {{IPA|/kɔra/}} 'do' vs. {{lang|bn|কড়া}} {{IPA|[kɔɾa]}} 'strict' can be homophonous.

In other dialects, they are fronted to apical alveolar.

===Consonant clusters===
{{main|Bengali consonant clusters}}

Native Bengali ({{lang|bn|তদ্ভব}} ''tôdbhôbo'') words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as {{lang|bn|গেরাম}} ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for {{lang|bn|গ্রাম}} ''gram'' (CCVC) meaning 'village' or {{lang|bn|ইস্কুল}} ''iskul'' / ''ishkul'' (VC.CVC) for {{lang|bn|স্কুল}} ''skul'' (CCVC) 'school'.

Sanskrit ({{lang|bn|তৎসম}} ''tôtshômo'') words borrowed into Bengali, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the {{IPA|[mr]}} in {{lang|bn|মৃত্যু}} ''mrittü'' ('death') or the {{IPA|[sp]}} in {{lang|bn|স্পষ্ট}} ''spôshṭo'' ('clear'), have become extremely common, and can be considered permitted consonant clusters in Bengali. English and other foreign ({{lang|bn|বিদেশী}} ''bideshi'') borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} as commonly-used loanwords such as {{lang|bn|ট্রেন}} ''ṭren'' ('train') and {{lang|bn|গ্লাস}} ''glash'' ('glass') are now included in leading Bengali dictionaries.

Final consonant clusters are rare in Bengali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in {{lang|bn|লিফ্ট}} ''lifṭ'' ('elevator') and {{lang|bn|ব্যাংক}} ''beņk'' ("bank'). However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bengali word would be {{lang|bn|গঞ্জ}} ''gônj'', which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including {{lang|bn|নবাবগঞ্জ}} ''Nôbabgônj'' and {{lang|bn|মানিকগঞ্জ}} ''Manikgônj''. Some nonstandard varieties of Bengali make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in {{lang|bn|চান্দ}} ''chand'' ('moon'). The Standard Bengali equivalent of ''chand'' would be {{lang|bn|চাঁদ}} ''chãd'', with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.

Magadhan languages such as Bengali are known for their wide variety of [[diphthongs]], or combinations of [[vowel]]s occurring within the same [[syllable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several vowel combinations can be considered true monosyllabic diphthongs, made up of the main vowel (the nucleus) and the trailing vowel (the off-glide). Almost all other vowel combinations are possible, but only across two adjacent syllables, such as the disyllabic vowel combination {{IPA|[u.a]}} in {{lang|bn|কুয়া}} ''kua'' ('well'). As many as 25 vowel combinations can be found, but some of the more recent combinations have not passed through the stage between two syllables and a diphthongal monosyllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chatterji|1926|pp=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosody==

===Stress===
In standard Bengali, [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as {{lang|bn|সহযোগিতা}} ''shôhojogita''{{IPA|[ˈʃɔhoˌdʒoɡiˌta]}} ('cooperation'). The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress. However, in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the root syllable has stress, out of harmony with the situation with native Bengali words.&lt;ref name="suniti_stress"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chatterji|1921|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in a declarative sentence, the stress is generally lowest on the last word of the sentence.

Adding [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] to a word typically shifts the stress to the left; for example, while the word {{lang|bn|সভ্য}} ''shobbho'' {{IPA|[ˈʃobbʱo]}} ('civilized') carries the primary stress on the first syllable, adding the [[negation|negative]] prefix {{IPA|/ɔ-/}} creates {{lang|bn|অসভ্য}} ''ôshobbho'' {{IPA|[ˈɔʃobbʱo]}} ('uncivilized'), where the primary stress is now on the newly added first syllable {{lang|bn|অ}} ''ô''. Word-stress does not alter the meaning of a word and is always subsidiary to sentence-level stress.&lt;ref name="suniti_stress"/&gt;

===Intonation===
For Bengali words, intonation or pitch of voice have minor significance, apart from a few cases such as distinguishing between identical vowels in a diphthong. However, in sentences intonation does play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chatterji|1921|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a simple [[declarative sentence]], most words and/or phrases in Bengali carry a rising tone,&lt;ref name="inton0"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bengali sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.

In sentences involving [[Focus (linguistics)|focused]] words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone.&lt;ref name="inton0"/&gt; This intonation pattern extends to [[wh-questions]], as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.&lt;ref name="inton1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hayes|Lahiri|1991|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel length===
Like most Magadhan languages, [[vowel length]] is not contrastive in Bengali; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a "[[short vowel]]" and a "[[long vowel]]",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bhattacharya|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the situation in most Indo-Aryan languages. However, when [[morpheme]] boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise homophonous words. This is because [[open syllable|open]] [[syllable|monosyllables]] (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) can have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types.&lt;ref name="munier"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ferguson|Chowdhury|1960|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the vowel in ''ca'' ('tea') can be somewhat longer than the first vowel in ''caṭa'' ('licking'), as ''ca'' is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. The [[Affix|suffix]] ''ṭa'' ('the') can be added to ''ca'' to form ''caṭa'' ('the tea'), and the long vowel is preserved, creating a minimal pair ({{IPA|[ˈtʃaʈa]}} vs. {{IPA|[ˈtʃaˑta]}}. Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found. In general, Bengali vowels tend to stay away from extreme vowel articulation.&lt;ref name="munier"/&gt;

Furthermore, using a form of [[reduplication]] called "echo reduplication", the long vowel in ''ca'' can be copied into the reduplicant ''ṭa'', giving ''caṭa'' ('tea and all that comes with it'). Thus, in addition to ''caṭa'' ('the tea') with a longer first vowel and ''caṭa'' ('licking') with no long vowels, we have ''caṭa'' ('tea and all that comes with it') with two longer vowels.

==Regional phonological variations==
{{main|Bengali dialects}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The phonological alternations of Bengali vary greatly due to the dialectal differences between the speech of Bengalis living on the {{lang|bn|পশ্চিম}} ''Poschim'' (western) side and {{lang|bn|পূর্ব}} ''Purbo'' (eastern) side of the [[Padma River]].

===Fricatives===
In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern Bangladesh ([[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]], [[Dhaka]] and [[Sylhet]] divisions), many of the stops and affricates heard in Kolkata Bengali are pronounced as [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]].

The aspirated velar stop {{lang|bn|খ}} {{IPA|[kʰ]}} and the aspirated labial stop {{lang|bn|ফ}} {{IPA|[pʰ]}} of Poshcim Bengali correspond to {{lang|bn|খ়}} {{IPA|[x~ʜ]}} and {{lang|bn|ফ়}} {{IPA|[f]}} or {{IPA|[ɸ]}} in many dialects of Purbo Bengali. These pronunciations are most extreme in the [[Sylheti language|Sylheti dialect]] of far northeastern Bangladesh—the dialect of Bengali most common in the [[United Kingdom]].

Many Purbo Bengali dialects share phonological features with Assamese, including the debuccalization of {{lang|bn|শ}} {{IPA|[ɕ]}} to {{lang|bn|হ}} {{IPA|[h]}} or {{lang|bn|খ়}} {{IPA|[x]}} and the pronunciation of  {{lang|bn|র}} {{IPA|[ɹ]}} and {{lang|bn|ড়/ঢ়}} {{IPA|[ɽ]}}.

===Tibeto-Burman influence===
The influence of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the phonology is mostly on the Bengali spoken in east of the Padma River and relatively less in West and South Bengal as is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels in eastern Bengal but nasalization being present in Indian Bengali and an alveolar articulation for the otherwise [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] {{lang|bn|ট}} {{IPA|[t̠]}}, {{lang|bn|ঠ}} {{IPA|[t̠ʰ]}}, {{lang|bn|ড}} {{IPA|[d̠]}}, and {{lang|bn|ঢ}} {{IPA|[d̠ʱ]}}, resembling the equivalent phonemes in languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]]. In the phonology of [[West Bengal|West]] and [[South Bengal|Southern Bengal]], the distinction between {{lang|bn|র}} {{IPA|[ɹ]}} and {{lang|bn|ড়/ঢ়}} {{IPA|[ɽ]}} is clear and distinct like neighbouring Indian languages. But in the far-eastern variants where there is Tibeto-Burman influence, the distinction becomes less clear and sometimes becomes similar to the phonology of the Assamese ৰ rô. Unlike most languages of the region, Purbo Bengali dialects tend not to distinguish aspirated voiced stops {{lang|bn|ঘ}} {{IPA|[ɡʱ]}}, {{lang|bn|ঝ}} {{IPA|[dʑʱ]}}, {{lang|bn|ঢ}} {{IPA|[d̠ʱ]}}, {{lang|bn|ধ}} {{IPA|[dʱ]}}, and {{lang|bn|ভ}} {{IPA|[bʱ]}} from their unaspirated equivalents, with some dialects treating them as allophones of each other and other dialects replacing the former with the latter completely. Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bengali, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. There is also a distinction between {{lang|bn|ই}} and {{lang|bn|ঈ}} in many northern Bangladeshi dialects. {{lang|bn|ই}} representing the uncommon to Bengali {{IPAblink|ɪ}} sound whereas {{lang|bn|ঈ}} the standard {{IPAblink|i}} used for both letters in most other dialects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">A  '''bill of quantity ''' (BOQ) is a document used in [[Call for bids|tendering]] in the [[construction]] industry / supplies in which [[Building material|materials]], parts, and labor (and their costs) are itemized. It also (ideally) details the terms and conditions of the construction or repair contract and itemizes all work to enable a [[General contractor|contractor]] to price the work for which he or she is bidding.The quantities may be measured in number, length, area, volume, weight or time. Preparing a bill of quantities requires that the design is complete and a specification has been prepared.
The bill of quantities is issued to tenderers for them to prepare a price for carrying out the construction work. The bill of quantities assists tenderers in the calculation of construction costs for their tender, and, as it means all tendering contractors will be pricing the same quantities (rather than taking-off quantities from the drawings and specifications themselves), it also provides a fair and accurate system for tendering

==Creation==

Bills of quantities are prepared by [[quantity surveyor]]s and [[building estimator]]s, and "Indeed the bill of quantities was the reason for the development of quantity surveying as a separate profession."
COBRA The international operations or trades used in construction.
As the rates for materials and labour change due to inflation, these books are frequently republished..

The practice  historically of estimating building costs in this way arose from non-contractual measurements, taken off drawings to assist tenderers in quoting lump sum prices.

There are different styles of bills of quantities, mainly the Elemental BOQ and Trade Bills.

==Contingency sum==
A Contingency sum is an item found within a Bill of quantities (BoQ).

The item refers to unforeseeable cost likely to be incurred during the contract.

There are two types of contingency sum. The first refers to a specific item, e.g., 'additional alterations to services when installing said shower unit', where an item for alterations to existing services is not contained within the BoQ but some work is envisaged.

The second type of sum is where money can be allocated to any item, within the BoQ, in the same way as the above example or used as 'additional work to be undertaken by the contractor, at the request of the contract administrator'.

The first is usually approximated by the client’s PQS and the second by the contractors QS (or commercial manager).

Additional requirements is referred as Bill of materials (BOM).

== See also ==
* [[Bill of materials]] (BOM)
* [[Operational bills]]
A Bill of Quantities does in fact consider all costs and is transparent in relations to all costs.  Where information is missing at the time, sums based on ad hoc schedules or known rates will be entered, but this will of course depend on the contract being used.  Traditional routes, where time is not so much an issue add better cost certainty.  From inception to completion and beyond Bills of Quantities cover all aspect of work and this includes all work, materials and any cost related aspects supplied by the contractor.  This is done in the preliminary stages of the Bill and it is then up to the contractor to enter rates against the items mentioned.  (The description previously edited here is misleading and untrue. )

The '''Black Star of Africa''' is a black [[five-pointed star]] (&lt;big&gt;&lt;span style="color: black"&gt;★&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;) symbolizing [[Africa]] in general and [[Ghana]] in particular. The [[Black Star Line]], founded in 1919 by [[Marcus Garvey]] as part of the [[Back-to-Africa movement]], modelled its name on that of the [[White Star Line]], changing the colour from white to black to symbolise ownership by [[black people]] rather than [[white people]]. The black star became a symbol of [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[anti-colonialism]]. Described as the "Lodestar of African Freedom", the black star was used in 1957 by [[Theodosia Okoh]] in the design of the [[Flag of Ghana]].&lt;ref name="Lentz11"&gt;Lentz 2008, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghana==
Ghanaians have come to regard the Black Star as a specific symbol of Ghana rather than of Africa in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz 2008, p.12. "Most contemporary Ghanaians, however, tend to interpret the Black Star as a uniquely Ghanaian symbol rather than one borrowed from an older pan-Africanist movement."&lt;/ref&gt; As well as on the flag, the star appears on [[coat of arms of Ghana|the coat of arms]]; on the Black Star Gate in [[Black Star Square]] in the capital, [[Accra]];&lt;ref name="Lentz11"/&gt; and on the Seat of State in [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], on which [[President of Ghana|the President]] sits on ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz 2008, pp.3,11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ghana national football team]] is nicknamed the "Black Stars".&lt;ref name="BroeckJunker2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Broeck|editor-first1=Sabine|editor-last2=Junker|editor-first2=Carsten|last=Nimako|first=Kwame|title=Postcoloniality - Decoloniality - Black Critique: Joints and Fissures|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=430wBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=2014-11-06|publisher=Campus Verlag|isbn=9783593501925|pages=53–62: 58|chapter=Location and Social Thought in the Black : A Testimony to African Intellectual Tradition. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Star was also in the flag of the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) on which the [[Flag of Guinea-Bissau]] and the former [[Flag of Cape Verde]] were based. The [[Flag of São Tomé and Príncipe]] uses the same [[Pan-African colours]] with two black stars, one each for [[São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZauSgqSl6ekC&amp;pg=PA91|title=Complete Flags of the World|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd.|date=November 3, 2008|author=[[Flag Institute]]|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag of the short-lived [[Union of African States]] had three black stars, one for each member state.

'''''Blood &amp; Orchids''''' is a [[1986 in film|1986]] [[Television movie|made-for-TV]] [[crime drama|crime-drama]] [[film]].  Written for the screen by Norman Katkov, it was an adaptation of Katkov's own [[novel]] which, in turn, was inspired by the 1932 [[Massie Trial]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. It was typical of many [[crime drama]]s produced during the period.

== Plot ==
In 1937 [[Hawaii]], four native Hawaiian men find a white woman, beaten nearly to death, and take her to a hospital—only to be charged later with her rape and assault. During their trial, the woman's husband, a [[lieutenant]] in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], fatally shoots one of them and later stands trial himself. The trial brings into stark relief the racial tensions that tear at the social fabric of Territorial Hawaii in the years prior to [[World War II]].

[[Socialite]] Hester Ashley Murdoch ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) leaves an officers' dinner party at the US Naval base in [[Honolulu]] in the company of a man who is not her husband (Lieutenant Lloyd Murdoch, played by [[William Russ]]), but rather Lt. Murdoch's best friend. The friend coldly announces that he is terminating their relationship, though Hester is carrying his child. Outraged, she announces that she will tell her husband and the commanding admiral on the station. In retaliation, the friend beats her savagely and leaves her bloodied and battered where she lies.

Four young Hawaiian men find her and take her to a hospital, although they fear being blamed for the condition she is in because she is ''[[haole]]'' (white) and they are native Hawaiian. At the hospital, Hester's mother Doris ([[Jane Alexander]]) assumes that the Hawaiians are to blame, but Hester says, "It's nobody's fault; I was the pregnant one!" The shocked Doris tells her daughter that she must collaborate in Doris' campaign to blame the Hawaiians, saying that Hester must think of Doris' "position" in [[upper class|high society]]. Accordingly, the four are charged with rape and assault, although the only sexual intercourse that Hester had was consensual and not with any of the four.

Most of the law-enforcement officers involved, including the [[Honolulu Police Department]] and the Navy [[Shore Patrol]], assume that the Hawaiians are guilty, but Detective Captain Curt Maddox ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) is unconvinced. Meanwhile, the Hawaiians get a court-appointed attorney who strives valiantly to show that the four must be innocent of the crime, because of time-line conflicts with the best estimate of when the beating took place.
The trial of the four ends abruptly and tragically, though, when Lieutenant Murdoch, at the height of an at-the-bench discussion between the judge and the two opposing counsels, abruptly draws his service automatic and shoots the lead defendant twice in the head, killing him.

Now Murdoch must stand trial (in a civilian court) for murder in the first degree. Doris sends a wire to famed criminal attorney Walter Bergmann ([[Jose Ferrer]]), who agrees to defend Lieutenant Murdoch against the murder charge. The pretrial investigation is complicated by an affair between Detective Maddox and Mr. Bergmann's wife Leonore ([[Sean Young]]).

The case is further complicated when a number of Navy petty officers, all friends of Murdoch, kidnap the three remaining Hawaiians, tie them in spread-eagle fashion to an improvised rack, and beat them to get them to confess to the original alleged rape and assault. In the course of that particular atrocity, the Navy men repeatedly use the expression "bilge", which (at least according to the film) is common Navy slang for useless information or known falsehood. The lawyer for the Hawaiians interviews the three, after they are brought to a hospital and unable to lie on their backs because of the severe beatings they have received. There, they finally blurt out, "They said, 'Bilge!'" This gives the lawyer the vital clues he needs. Maddox follows up the clues and has the three arrested.

Murdoch's trial climaxes with Attorney Bergmann trying to sum up by saying that Murdoch's action was excusable. "Those animals beat her!" he cries; then Hester, plagued by her conscience, blurts out, "They're innocent! They're innocent!" Although Bergmann roughly escorts her from the courtroom, the damage is done: Murdoch is convicted.

Subsequently, Doris engages in a behavior called "brazening it out". She hires an interior decorator to redecorate her home. In the middle of her interview with the decorator, Detective Maddox arrives with a warrant for the arrests of Doris and Hester. Hester, crushed, rushes to her bathroom and hangs herself from the shower head. Doris discovers Hester's dead body and cries out in anguish, although whether that anguish is truly for losing her daughter or because this is the final shameful and devastating blow to her social position, the film leaves unresolved, perhaps deliberately so.

== Cast ==
* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Detective Captain Curtis "Curt" Maddox, HPD
* [[Jane Alexander]] as Doris Ashley
* [[Sean Young]] as Leonore Bergmann (Walter Bergmann's wife)
* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Walter Bergmann, counsellor-at-law
* [[Susan Blakely]] as Marie Farrell
* [[David Clennon]] as Philip Murray
* [[George Coe]] as Dr. Lansing (who examines Hester)
* [[Richard Dysart]] as Harvey Koster
* [[Elizabeth Lindsey]] as Sarah
* [[Haunani Minne]] as Princess Luahine (presumably a member of the deposed royal house of Hawaii, she breaks her self-imposed isolation to take up the cause of the four Hawaiians who are so ill-used by the ''haole'' community)
* [[William Russ]] as [[Lieutenant]] Lloyd Murdoch [[United States Navy|USN]]
* [[James Saito]] as Halehone (the Hawaiian lawyer who represents the accused men)
* [[Matt Salinger]] as Bryce Parker
* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Hester Ashley Murdoch (Lloyd's wife)
* [[Arthur Rosenberg (actor)|Arthur Rosenberg]] as Sergeant Jack Keller
* [[Sandy McPeak]] as [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Glenn Langon, USN, (the [[14th Naval District]] commandant)

== Allusions to actual history ==
This film is based loosely on the [[Massie Trial|trial]] of [[Lieutenant]] Thomas Massie[[United States Navy|USN]], the real-life person that forms the basis of [[Lieutenant]] Murdoch. Names of real-life persons have been changed, as follows:

*Captain Curt Maddox = Detective Sergeant John Jardine
*Lloyd Murdoch = Thomas Massie
*Doris Ashley = [[Grace Fortescue]]
*Hester Ashley Murdoch = [[Thalia Fortescue Massie]]
*Walter Bergmann = [[Clarence Darrow]]
*Halehone = Lawyer William Heen
*Princess Luahine = Princess [[Abigail Campbell Kawananakoa|Abigail Kawananakoa]]
*Glenn Langdon = [[Rear Admiral]] [[Yates Stirling, Jr.]] [[United States Navy|USN]]

In addition, new characters are added that have no verifiable real-life counterpart, or who performed actions for which there is no real-life counterpart. For example, though John Jardine was probably the most prominent HPD detective involved in the investigation, he was not a captain, but an only a sergeant, and there is no evidence that he or any other HPD officer ever had a romantic liaison with Clarence Darrow's wife.

This teleplay departs from historical events in many ways, as one can see by comparing the plot summary to the main article on the [[Massie Trial]]. For example:

*In the teleplay, the four original defendants get into trouble because they took the stricken woman to the hospital. Actually, Massie was found by a passing car, driven by Eustace Bellinger, wandering along Ala Moana Road at 1:00 am. Mrs. Bellinger wanted to take Thalia directly to the hospital and call the police but she insisted they take her home instead. Later Thalia's husband called the police over her objections when he found she had a broken jaw. Horace Ida, Joseph Kahahawai, and their three friends were arrested earlier that night after assaulting a Hawaiian couple during a [[road rage]] incident, during which Joseph Kahahawai, a [[prizefighter]], admitted punching the woman, Agnes Peeples.
*The teleplay makes no mention of what the five were actually doing that night—namely, getting into an altercation with Homer and Agnes Peeples, a Hawaiian couple after they and the couple missed each other by inches in their respective automobiles at King and Liliha Streets at about 12:30 Sunday morning.
* The Honolulu Police Department and the Honolulu County Sheriff's Office are spoken of as two separate, distinct agencies.  In fact, the HPD did, and still does, have Island-wide (which is to say county-wide) jurisdiction, and, at the time of the Massie case, HPD's top-ranking officer was an elected [[sheriff]].  It was partly as a consequence of the Massie case that HPD was reorganized in 1932 so that the head of the force became an appointed Chief of Police.
*The role of Princess Luahine is quite different from that of the historical Princess [[Abigail Campbell Kawananakoa|Abigail Kawananakoa]]. Far from being a recluse, Kawananakoa was in fact a member of the Republican National Committee at the time. It was she who encouraged a local lawyer, William Heen, to represent the five original defendants, at great personal risk to himself. But she did not turn the case into a [[cause célèbre]].
*No firm historical or forensic evidence exists for [[Thalia Fortescue Massie]] having been raped, much less for the identity of her actual assailant. Rumor held that she was seen with a white man before she arrived home. Unsubstantiated gossip at the time suggested that the man was one of Lieutenant Massie's shipmates, and even that Lieutenant Massie himself had dealt the vicious blows that landed his wife in the hospital. (For further versions of the alleged assault, see the main article on the [[Massie Trial]].)
*Lieutenant Massie did not shoot Joseph Kahahawai in hot-blooded passion in open court with his service automatic before courtroom spectators, as is depicted in this film. Rather, he, his mother-in-law, and two other Navy men kidnapped Kahahawei and tortured him to confess to the rape--''after'' the five original defendants were released following a mistrial in their case. Kahahawai never confessed, and one of his four kidnappers shot him.
*Lieutenant Massie did not stand trial alone. His mother-in-law and two Navy accomplices stood trial with him.
*Thalia Massie ''never'' admitted the possibility that she had misidentified her assailants. She certainly never blurted out, "They're innocent!" in open court.
*Nor did Thalia commit suicide following the conviction of her mother, her husband, and her husband's friends. Instead, the four defendants, originally sentenced to serve ten years in prison, had the sentence commuted to serve one hour—in the Territorial Governor's office. But Thalia was always mentally unstable, and in the end died in Palm Beach, Florida, of an overdose of barbiturates—in 1963, fully thirty-one years after the trial.
* [[Rear Admiral]] Stirling did make a number of unprofessional and irresponsible statements to the press during the first trial, including a suggestion that he would take it kindly if some Naval personnel were to hunt down the five alleged assailants of Mrs. Massie and "string them up"—which is to say, to [[Lynching|lynch]] them. In fact, a number of never-identified Navy men kidnapped and beat Horace Ida with belt buckles, trying to extract a confession that he never gave. No evidence exists for the same or similar thing happening to any of Joseph Kahahawai's other three co-defendants. (Which is not to say that they escaped unscathed. They never lived down the trial, and to their dying days they had to deal with people who believed them guilty of a crime that, in all likelihood, they did not commit.)

'''Cultural economics''' is the branch of [[economics]] that studies the relation of [[culture]] to economic outcomes. Here, 'culture' is defined by shared beliefs and preferences of respective groups.  Programmatic issues include whether and how much culture matters as to economic outcomes and what its relation is to [[institutional economics|institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;Press '''+''' button or  '''ctrl +''' for  small-font links below.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Raquel Fernández]], 2008.

== Development ==
Cultural economics develops from how wants and tastes are formed in society. This is partly due to nurture aspects, or what type of environment one is raised in, as it is the internalization of one’s upbringing that shapes their future wants and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics|last=Stretton|first=Hugh|publisher=Pluto Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=247–55|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquired tastes can be thought of as an example of this, as they demonstrate how preferences can be shaped socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutter|first=Michael|year=1996|title=The Impact of Cultural Economics on Economic Theory|url=|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=20|pages=263–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key thought area that separates the development of cultural economics from traditional economics is a difference in how individuals arrive at their decisions. While a traditional economist will view decision making as having both implicit and explicit consequences, a cultural economist would argue that an individual will not only arrive at their decision based on these implicit and explicit decisions but based on trajectories. These trajectories consist of regularities, which have been built up throughout the years and guide individuals in their decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Economic Sociology, Second Edition|last=Weber|first=Roberto|last2=Dawes|first2=Robyn|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|page=101|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining value systems and systems thinking ===
Economists have also started to look at cultural economics with a [[systems thinking]] approach. In this approach, the economy and culture are each viewed as a single system where "interaction and feedback effects were acknowledged, and where in particular the dynamic were made explicit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Throsby|first=David|year=1995|title=Culture, Economics and Sustainability|url=|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=19|pages=199–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the interdependencies of culture and the economy can be combined and better understood by following this approach.

Said E. Dawlabani's book ''MEMEnomics: The Next-Generation Economic System''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; combines the ideas of value systems (see [[value (ethics)]]) and [[systems thinking]] to provide one of the first frameworks that explores the effect of economic policies on culture. The book explores the intersections of multiple disciplines such as cultural development, [[organizational behavior]], and [[memetics]] all in an attempt to explore the roots of cultural economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memenomics.com/what-is-memenomics|title=What is Memenomics {{!}} The MEMEnomics Group.

== Growth ==
The advancing pace of new technology is transforming how the public consumes and shares culture. The cultural economic field has seen great growth with the advent of online social networking which has created productivity improvements in how culture is consumed. New technologies have also lead to cultural convergence where all kinds of culture can be accessed on a single device. Throughout their upbringing, younger persons of the current generation are consuming culture faster than their parents ever did, and through new mediums. The smartphone is a blossoming example of this where books, music, talk, artwork and more can all be accessed on a single device in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|year=2008|title=Why everything has changed: the recent revolution in cultural economics|url=|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=32|pages=261–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This medium and the culture surrounding it is beginning to have an effect on the economy, whether it be increasing communication while lowering costs, lowering the barriers of entry to the technology economy, or making use of excess capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elearning.scranton.edu/resource/business-leadership/how-the-smartphone-has-impacted-economic-development|title=How the Smartphone has Impacted Economic Development|last=kayla.mcphail|date=2016-03-04|work=The University of Scranton Online|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridge-gadget-hand-iPhone-macro-1845364 1280.jpg|thumb|An example of culture being consumed via smartphone.|alt=]]

This field has also seen growth through the advent of new economic studies that have put on a cultural lens. For example, a recent study on Europeans living with their families into adulthood was conducted by Paola Sapienza, a professor at Northwestern University. The study found that those of Southern European descent tend to live at home with their families longer than those of Northern European descent. Sapienza added cultural critique to her analysis of the research, revealing that it is Southern European culture to stay at home longer and then related this to how those who live at home longer have fewer children and start families later, thus contributing to Europe's falling birthrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster|title=Europe needs many more babies to avert a population disaster|last=|first=|date=23 August 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sapienza's work is an example of how the growth of cultural economics is beginning to spread across the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/economic-growth-a-question-of-culture|title=Is Economic Growth a Question of Culture?|date=2014-09-02|work=Kellogg Insight|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable development ==
An area that cultural economics has a strong presence in is sustainable development. Sustainable development has been defined as "...development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/topic/sustainable-development|title=Sustainable Development|last=|first=|date=|website=International Institute for Sustainable Development|access-date=March 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture plays an important role in this as it can determine how people view preparing for these future generations. [[Delayed gratification]] is a cultural economic issue that developed countries are currently dealing with. Economists argue that to ensure that the future is better than today, certain measures must be taken such as collecting taxes or "going green" to protect the environment. Policies such as these are hard for today's politicians to promote who want to win the vote of today's voters who are concerned with the present and not the future. People want to see the benefits now, not in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Challenge to Market Democracies|last=Galston|first=William|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=14–18|chapter=Economics and Culture in Market Democracies|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[David Throsby]] has proposed the idea of culturally sustainable development which compasses both the cultural industries (such as the arts) and culture (in the societal sense). He has created a set of criteria in regards to for which policy prescriptions can be compared to in order to ensure growth for future generations. The criteria are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Throsby|first=David|year=1995|title=Journal of Cultural Economics|url=|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=19|pages=199–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Advancement of material and non-material well-being: implies balance amongst economic, social, and cultural forces
# Intergenerational equity and the maintenance of cultural capital: current generation must recognize their responsibility to future generations
# Equity within the present generation: distribution of cultural resources must be fair
# Recognition of interdependence: policy must understand the connections between economic, cultural and other variables within an overall system.

With these guidelines, Throsby hopes to spur the recognition between culture and economics, which is something he believes has been lacking from popular economic discussions.

== Cultural finance ==
As a growing field in [[behavioral economics]], the role of culture in financial behavior is increasingly being demonstrate to cause highly significant differentials in the management and valuation of assets.  Using the [[dimensions of culture]] identified by [[Shalom Schwartz]], it has been proved that corporate dividend payments are determined largely by the dimensions of Mastery and Conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shao | first1 = L | last2 = Kwok | first2 = C | last3 = Guedhami | first3 = O | title = National culture and dividend policy | journal = [[Journal of International Business Studies]] | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1391–1414 | date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, higher degrees of conservatism are associated with greater volumes and values of dividend payments, and higher degrees of mastery are associated with the total opposite. A different study assessed the role of culture on earnings management using [[Geert Hofstede]]’s [[cultural dimensions]] and the index of [[earnings management]] developed by [[Christian Leutz]]; which includes the use of accrual alteration to reduce volatility in reported earnings, the use of accrual alteration to reduce volatility in reported [[operating cash flows]], use of accounting discretion to mitigate the reporting of small losses, and the use of accounting discretion when reporting [[operating earnings]].  It was found that [[Hofstede]]'s dimension of Individualism was negatively correlated with earnings management, and that Uncertainty Avoidance was positively correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Callen | first1 = L | last2 = Morel | first2 = M | last3 = Richardson | first3 = G | title = Do culture and religion mitigate earnings management? Evidence from a cross-country analysis | journal = [[Journal of Disclosure and Governance]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–21 | date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behavioral economist]] Michael Taillard demonstrated that investment behaviors are caused primarily by behavioral factors, largely attributed to the influence of culture on the [[psychological frame]] of the investors in different nations, rather than rational ones by comparing the cultural dimensions used both by [[Geert Hofstede]] and [[Robert House]], identifying strong and specific influences in [[risk aversion]] behavior resulting from the overlapping [[cultural dimensions]] between them that remained constant over a 20-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taillard | first1 = Michael | title = Cultural Influences of Investing Behavior: A Correlational Design Study | journal = [[ProQuest]] | date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to [[investing]], it has been confirmed by multiple studies that greater differences between the cultures of various nations reduces the amount of investment between those countries.  It was proven that both cultural differences between nations as well as the amount of unfamiliarity investors have with a culture not their own greatly reduces their willingness to invest in those nations, and that these factors have a negative impact with future returns, resulting in a cost premium on the degree of foreignness of an investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Xu |first1= Y |last2= Hu |first2= S |last3= Fan |first3= X |title= The impacts of country risk and cultural distance on transnational equity investments |journal= Chinese Management Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages= 235–48 |date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Baik |first1=B |last2= Kang |first2=J |last3= Kim |first3=J |last4= Lee |first4=J |title= The liability of foreignness in international equity investments: Evidence from the US [[stock market]] |journal= [[Journal of International Business Studies]] |volume= 43 |pages= 107–22 |date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, equity markets continue to integrate as indicated by equity price comovements, of which the two largest contributing factors are the ratio of trade between nations and the ratio of [[GDP]] resulting from [[foreign direct investment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Shi |first1= J |last2= Bilson |first2=C |last3= Powell |first3=J |last4= Wigg |first4= J |title= Foreign Direct Investment and International Stock Market Integration |journal= [[Australian Journal of Management]] |volume=35 |issue=3 |page= 265 |date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even these factors are the result of behavioral sources, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Xu |first1=Y |last2= Hu |first2= S |last3= Fan |first3= X |title= The impacts of country risk and cultural distance on transnational equity investments |journal= Chinese Management Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages= 235–48 |date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[UN World Investment Report]] (2013) &lt;ref&gt;[http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf UN World Investment Report 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; shows that regional integration is occurring at a more rapid rate than distant [[foreign relations]], confirming an earlier study concluding that nations closer to each other tend to be more integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Kivilcim |first1=Y |last2= Muradoglu |first2= S |title= The impacts of country risk and cultural distance on transnational equity investments |journal= Chinese Management Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages= 235–48 |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since increased cultural distance reduces the amount of [[foreign direct investment]], this results in an accelerating curvilinear correlation between financial behavior and cultural distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Baik |first1=B |last2= Kang |first2=J |last3= Kim |first3=J |last4= Lee |first4= J |title= The liability of foreignness in international equity investments: Evidence from the US stock market |journal= [[Journal of International Business Studies]] |volume= 43 |pages= 107–22 |date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Xu |first1=Y |last2= Hu |first2=S |last3= Fan |first3= X |title= The impacts of country risk and cultural distance on transnational equity investments |journal = Chinese Management Studies |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages= 235–48 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Christelis |first1= D |last2= Georgarakos |first2= D |title= Investing at Home and Abroad: Different Costs, Different People? |journal= [[Journal of Banking and Finance]] |volume= 37 |pages= 2069–86 |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture also influences which factors are useful when predicting stock valuations. In [[Jordan]], it was found that 84% of variability in stock returns were accounted for by using [[money supply]], [[interest rate]] term structure, industry [[productivity]] growth, and [[risk premium]]; but were not influenced at all by [[inflation]] rates or [[dividend yield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Ramadan |first= Z |title= The Validity of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory in the Jordanian Stock Market |journal= [[International Journal of Economics and Finance]] |volume=4 |issue=5 |page= 177 |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nigeria]], both real [[GDP]] and [[Consumer Price Index]] were both useful predictive factors, but [[foreign exchange rate]] was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Isenmila |first1=A |last2= Erah |first2=O |title= Share prices and macroeconomic factors: A test of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) in the Nigerian stock market | journal = [[European Journal of Business and Management]] |volume=4 |issue=15 |pages= 66–76 |date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zimbabwe]], only [[money supply]] and [[oil]] prices were found to be useful predictors of stock market valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Jecheche |first=P |title = An empirical investigation of Arbitrage Pricing Theory: A case Zimbabwe |journal= [[Research in Business &amp; Economics Journal]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=1 |date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; India identified [[exchange rate]], [[wholesale price index]], [[gold]] prices, and [[market index]] as being useful factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Basu |first1=D |last2= Chawla |first2=D |title= An Empirical Test of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory – The Case of Indian Stock Market |journal= [[Global Business Review]] |volume= 13 |issue=3 |pages= 421–32 |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comprehensive global study out of [[Romania]] attempted to identify if any factors of [[stock market]] valuation were culturally universal, identifying [[interest rates]], [[inflation]], and industrial production, but found that [[exchange rate]], currency exchange volume, and [[trade]] were all unique to [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= GeambaŞu |first=C |last2= Jianu |first2=I |last3= Herteliu |first3=C |last4= GeambaŞu |first4=L |title= Macroeconomic Influence on Shares’ Return Study Case: Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) Applied on Bucharest Stock Exchange |journal=[[Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research]] |volume= 48 |issue=2 |pages= 133–50 |date= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henryk Siemiradzki 004.jpeg|thumb|300px|''An orgy in Imperial Rome'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]]]
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

      <comment>/* Designer jeans */Changed start of caption on Armani Jeans photo, "Customers shopping at...", to "Staff working at...", as careful inspection of photo shows there are most likely no customers, but rather three staff pictured.

'''Designer clothing''' is luxury clothing.

== Brands ==

Designer clothing is not always created by the founder of the company. For example, the actual designer of [[Chanel]] is not its original founder and designer, [[Gabrielle Chanel]], but German designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. The quality of the clothing and degree of its resemblance, if any, to the designer's work vary considerably depending on the licensee and the terms of the agreement the designer has struck. Some terms may limit the number of garment styles that may be produced, allowing the designer to veto any designs he or she finds unappealing. Examples include:

* [[Armani]]
*[[BT21]]
* [[Calvin Klein]]
* [[Dean and Dan Caten|DSquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* [[Dior]]
* [[Givenchy]]
* [[Gucci]]
* [[Jean Paul Gaultier]]
* [[Jil Sander (brand)|Jil Sander]]
* [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]
* [[Polo Ralph Lauren]]
* [[Philipp Plein]]
* [[Saint Laurent Paris]]
* [[Adidas]]
* [[Tommy Hilfiger (company)|Tommy Hilfiger]]
* [[Versace]]

This licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fashion-clothing-industry/fashion-designers/pierre-cardin|title=Pierre Cardin|last=Walker|first=Myra|date=|website=www.lovetoknow.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designer jeans are available at many different price points usually at several hundreds of dollars, with some even approaching $1,000 USD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Before the "Great Recession," premium denim was one of the fastest growing categories of the apparel business, and there seemed to be no limit to what customers would pay for the latest label, fit, finish, or wash.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Wilson, Eric|[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/fashion/29JEANS.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0]| "Preshrunk Prices", October 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Americans bought $13.8 billion USD of men's and women's jeans in the year ended April 30, 2011, according to market-research firm NPD Group. But only about 1% of jeans sold in the U.S. over that year cost more than $50.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Binkley, Christina|[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303365804576429730284498872]| "How Can Jeans Cost $300?", July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since the "Great Recession," the landscape for premium jeans has changed: “Charging $600 for jeans for no reason at all — those days are over,” said You Nguyen, the senior vice president of women’s merchandising and design for Levi Strauss &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;   

The difference between the $300 jeans and the $30 jeans often has to do with the fabric quality, hardware, washes, design details, abrasions, and where they are manufactured. A "fancy" pair of jeans that has been treated with abrasions, extra washes, etc., to break the denim down to achieve a texture has undergone a certain amount of damage to get the 'worn in' feel. In this sense, the expensive jeans may be more delicate than the cheap ones. Jeans brands also try to stand out from season to season by using patented materials, such as rivets and stitching, and by using special washes and distressing methods. These might involve dying, pressing, and even using sandpaper and drills on the raw jeans. These methods can be particularly expensive when done in the U.S., where factories must meet more stringent environmental and labor standards than in many low-cost nations.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;   

To be produced domestically (in the United States), jeans have to be priced at "$200-plus," says Shelda Hartwell-Hale, a vice president at Directives West, an L.A.-based division of fashion consulting firm Doneger Group.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The profit margins on premium jeans can be substantial. One retail executive says his gross profit margins for private-label jeans, which he makes for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Holdings Corp., and other retailers, are less than 20%, whereas the margins for his own premium lines are 40%-to-50%.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

'''Draper''' was originally a term for a retailer or wholesaler of cloth that was mainly for clothing. A draper may additionally operate as a [[cloth merchant]] or a [[haberdasher]]. 
[[File:Adriaen Bloem - In the Draper´s Shop - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''In the Draper's Shop'' by [[Adriaen Bloem]] ]]

==History==
Drapers were an important [[guild|trade guild]] during the [[medieval period]], when the sellers of cloth operated out of draper's shops.{{cn|date=July 2013}} However the original meaning of the term has now largely fallen out of use.

In 1724, [[Jonathan Swift]] wrote a series of [[Satire|satirical]] pamphlets in the guise of a draper called the ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''.

==Historical drapers==
[[File:Museum of Lincolnshire Life, Lincoln, England - DSCF1759.JPG|thumb|A replica draper's shop at the [[Museum of Lincolnshire Life]], Lincoln, England]] 
A number of notable people who have at one time or another worked as drapers include:
* [[Sir Thomas Adams, 1st Baronet]] 
* [[William Barley]]
* [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Norman Birkett]]
* [[Margaret Bondfield]]
* [[Eleanor Coade]] (1733–1821), successful businesswoman with [[Coade stone]]
* [[Harry S. Truman]], [[haberdasher]] before he became a Senator, Vice President and President
* [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]
* [[John Lewis Partnership|John Spedan Lewis]]
* [[Anthony Munday]]
* [[Thomas Burberry]], Founder of fashion brand "Burberry"
* [[H. G. Wells]]
* [[Edward Whalley]], regicide, cousin of [[Oliver Cromwell]]
* [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]], founder of the [[YMCA]]&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/360/ |title = My Dear Home, I Love You, You’re a House for Each of Us and Home for All of Us |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1918 |accessdate = 2013-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]], geologist and physician to King Charles II
* [[John Graunt]], founder of the science of demography

==Current usage==
A draper is now defined as a highly skilled role within the [[fashion industry]]. The term is used within a [[fashion design]] or [[costume design]] studio for people tasked with creating garments or patterns by draping fabric over a [[dress form]]; draping uses a human form to physically position the cloth into a desired pattern. This is an alternative method to drafting, when the garment is initially worked out from measurements on paper. 

A fashion draper may also be known as a "first hand" because they are often the most skilled creator in the workshop and the "first" to work with the cloth for a garment. However a first hand in a costume studio is often an assistant to the draper. They are responsible for cutting the fabric with the patterns and assisting in costume fittings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16164">In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''evolutionary algorithm''' ('''EA''') is a [[subset]] of [[evolutionary computation]],&lt;ref name="EVOALG"&gt;{{cite article|last=Vikhar|first=P. A.|title=Evolutionary algorithms: A critical review and its future prospects|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7955308&amp;isnumber=7955253|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication (ICGTSPICC)|publisher= Jalgaon, 2016, pp. 261-265|isbn=978-1-5090-0467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generic population-based [[metaheuristic]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]], such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and [[natural selection|selection]]. [[Candidate solution]]s to the [[optimization problem]] play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[fitness function]] determines the quality of the solutions (see also [[loss function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying [[fitness landscape]]. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of [[microevolution|microevolutionary processes]] and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor.&lt;ref name="VLSI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohoon|first=J et al.|title=Evolutionary algorithms for the physical design of VLSI circuits|url= https://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/cohoon.pdf|journal=Advances in Evolutionary Computing: Theory and Applications|publisher= Springer, pp. 683-712, 2003|isbn=978-3-540-43330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. [[Fitness approximation]] is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.

==Implementation==

Step One: Generate the initial [[population]] of [[individual]]s randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Evaluate the [[Fitness function|fitness]] of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)

Step Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:
#Select the best-fit individuals for [[reproduce|reproduction]]. (Parents)
# [[Breed]] new individuals through [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] operations to give birth to [[offspring]].
# Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals.
# Replace least-fit population with new individuals.

==Types==
Similar techniques differ in [[genetic representation]] and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.
*[[Genetic algorithm]] – This is the most popular type of EA. One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers (traditionally binary, although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved),&lt;ref name=VLSI/&gt; by applying operators such as recombination and mutation (sometimes one, sometimes both).  This type of EA is often used in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. Another name for it is ''fetura'', from the Latin for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Roland, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPW3Y10 ''Wayward World'']. Novel that uses fetura to select candidates for public office.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Genetic programming]] – Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs, and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem.
*[[Evolutionary programming]] – Similar to genetic programming, but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.
*[[Gene expression programming]] – Like genetic programming, GEP also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotype-phenotype system, where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length.
*[[Evolution strategy]] – Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions, and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates.
*[[Differential evolution]] – Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for [[numerical optimization]] problems.
*[[Neuroevolution]] – Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights. The genome encoding can be direct or indirect.
*[[Learning classifier system]] – Here the solution is a set of classifiers (rules or conditions). A Michigan-LCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a Pittsburgh-LCS uses populations of classifier-sets. Initially, classifiers were only binary, but now include real, neural net, or [[S-expression]] types. Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based [[reinforcement learning]] or [[supervised learning]] approach.

==Comparison to biological processes==

A possible limitation{{According to whom|date=May 2013}} of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear [[genotype-phenotype distinction]]. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as [[embryogenesis]] to become a mature [[phenotype]]. This indirect [[encoding]] is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the [[evolvability]] of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Hornby and J.B. Pollack. "Creating high-level components with a generative representation for body-brain evolution". ''[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]]'', 8(3):223–246, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Clune, Benjamin Beckmann, Charles Ofria, and Robert Pennock.

''Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing Special Section on Evolutionary Robotics'', 2009. Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Clune, C. Ofria, and R. T. Pennock, [http://jeffclune.com/publications/Clune-HyperNEATandRegularity.pdf "How a generative encoding fares as problem-regularity decreases"], in ''PPSN'' (G. Rudolph, T. Jansen, S. M. Lucas, C. Poloni, and N. Beume, eds.), vol. 5199 of ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', pp. 358–367, Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the field of [[artificial development|artificial embryogeny]], or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And [[gene expression programming]] successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, C., 2001. [http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/GEP.pdf "Gene Expression Programming: A New Adaptive Algorithm for Solving Problems"].

*[[Gaussian adaptation]] – Based on information theory. Used for maximization of manufacturing yield, [[mean fitness]] or [[average information]]. See for instance [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]].
*[[Memetic algorithm]] – A hybrid method, inspired by [[Richard Dawkins]]'s notion of a meme, it commonly takes the form of a population-based algorithm coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements. Emphasizes the exploitation of problem-specific knowledge, and tries to orchestrate local and global search in a synergistic way.

The incident occurred during the main event of ''Nitro'', featuring [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Kevin Nash]], who was the leader of the Wolfpac faction of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), and [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]], the leader of the Hollywood faction of the nWo, with whom Nash and his group had been feuding since April 1998 when the original faction split up, and Hogan had retired from wrestling. The Wolfpac faction were [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]] (heroes), while the Hollywood faction were [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (villains), as was the original nWo.

The match saw Hogan poke Nash in the chest with his index finger, prompting Nash to theatrically throw himself onto the mat and allow Hogan to pin him; the victory marked the reunion of both nWo factions into one villainous group. During the same broadcast, WCW announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] gave away the results of their [[Monday Night Wars]] rival [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' (which was taped six days earlier and aired on tape delay at the same time Nitro was being aired live), revealing that wrestler [[Mick Foley]] (as Mankind) was set to win the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. Although this revelation was meant to deter ''Nitro'' viewers from switching to ''Raw Is War'', it instead reportedly prompted 600,000 viewers to change channels in order to see Foley's victory, with most viewers only tuning back in to ''Nitro'' when there were five minutes left in the broadcast. The incident was named "The Fingerpoke of Doom" both for Nash's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over-sell|over-selling]] the finger poke, and for the negative ramifications the incident had for the company as a whole, with some wrestling journalists crediting it as the beginning of WCW's ultimate downfall and loss of the Monday Night Wars.&lt;ref name=fritz&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Brian|author2=Christopher Murray|title=Between the ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs And Failures|isbn=1-55022-726-2|publisher=ECW Press|year=2006|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setup ==
The match was directly related to a controversial main event that occurred at [[Starrcade (1998)|Starrcade]] in December 1998, during which Kevin Nash [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. At the time of the match, Goldberg [[Bill Goldberg#Undefeated streak (1997–1998)|had been undefeated in his WCW career]]; and his defeat came about due to the interference of Nash's former [[tag team]] partner [[Scott Hall]].

The following evening, Nash professed dissatisfaction with Hall's interference, and offered Goldberg a rematch for the following episode of ''Nitro'' in Atlanta. However, Goldberg was [[kayfabe]] arrested halfway through the three-hour ''Nitro'' at the Georgia Dome and accused of "aggravated [[stalking]]" by [[Miss Elizabeth]] (Goldberg was originally to have been accused of [[rape]], but refused to go along with that particular storyline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Goldberg|last=Davies|first=Ross|isbn=0-8239-3495-0|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2001|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Goldberg was later released when Elizabeth could not keep her story straight, he would not make it back to the arena in time to compete against Nash; it was noted in ''The Death of WCW'' by R.D. Reynolds and [[Bryan Alvarez]] that the entire skit was proven to make no sense after it was revealed that the police station was across the street from the Georgia Dome.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, R.D.; Alvarez, Bryan. "The Death of WCW", ECW Press, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Hollywood Hogan showed up for the first time since declaring his retirement one month prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=nWo (New World Order) - FAQ|publisher=WrestleView|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?article=nwo|accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan and Nash had been in a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] since April 1998, when Nash became a fan favorite by breaking away from Hogan's nWo [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] in order to form his own rival faction, [[nWo Wolfpac]]; Hogan remained a villain, leading his own nWo faction, nWo Hollywood. In Goldberg's absence, Nash offered the title shot to Hogan, who accepted the offer.

Hogan came out to the ring accompanied by [[Scott Steiner]], who had taken over the leadership role in nWo Hollywood. Nash came out next, then revealed a surprise to Hogan and the crowd by stopping at the end of the entrance ramp and pointing backwards. The surprise was Hall, who had been a part of nWo Hollywood for most of the last seven months and who entered wearing a Wolfpac T-shirt. This marked the reunion of [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]], who had broken up as a tag team at [[Slamboree (1998)|Slamboree]] in May 1998.

== Match ==
The match started with the two men circling each other. Nash tried intimidating Hogan by pushing him hard into the corner. In retaliation, Hogan then hinted at punching Nash only to poke him in the chest. Nash fell on his back in a theatrical manner, which has been compared to "getting hit in the chest with a cannonball".&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite book|last=Alvarez|first=Bryan|author2=R.D. Reynolds|title=The Death of WCW|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|year=2004|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nash80&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Ross|title=Kevin Nash|isbn=0-8239-3492-6|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan then covered him to get the [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] and was declared the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion.

After this occurred, Hall and Steiner entered the ring and celebrated with Nash and Hogan to signify the Wolfpac and Hollywood factions were reuniting again.&lt;ref name=nash&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Nash|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=SLAM! Sports|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/nash.html|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Hogan had done before each time he had won the title since August 1996, he spray-painted the belt's faceplate with "nWo". However, to signify the reunion with the Wolfpac, Hogan used red spray paint. Meanwhile, the dissatisfied crowd began pelting the ring with food and other debris.

Goldberg then reentered the building and ran to the ring to attack the reunited nWo members. Wolfpac member [[Lex Luger]] followed him, appearing to assist him, but instead jumped Goldberg from behind and showed he was also part of the reunited nWo. Goldberg was handcuffed to the ropes, repeatedly shocked with a [[Electroshock weapon|taser]], and had "nWo 4 Life" painted in red and black paint all over his back. A loud "We want Sting!" chant erupted from the fans in the Georgia Dome, hoping that [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] would come to rescue Goldberg and even things up for WCW. However, Sting had been out since [[Bret Hart]] attacked him at [[Halloween Havoc (1998)|Halloween Havoc]] in October and would not appear again until March 1999; by that time the nWo reunion story had largely petered out in favor of [[Ric Flair]] taking control of WCW, and most of the nWo members had been sidelined due to injuries.

== Mankind incident ==
Airing opposite ''Nitro'' this night was the episode of ''Raw Is War'' in which Mick Foley (as Mankind) won the WWF Championship from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the WWE Championship: Mankind's first reign|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541411|accessdate=2008-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129085811/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541411|archivedate=2005-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per their procedures at the time, the WWF had taped this particular episode of ''Raw Is War'' six days in advance of the program's airing and even acknowledged the title change on their website immediately after the taping had concluded. Earlier that night, armed with knowledge of what happened, WCW announcer [[Tony Schiavone]], who was acting on orders from [[Eric Bischoff]], gave away the result of the match before it aired: {{quote|"Fans, as Hollywood Hogan walks away and you look at this 40,000 plus on hand, if you're even thinking about changing the channel to our competition, fans, do not, because we understand that Mick Foley, who wrestled here one time as Cactus Jack, is going to win their world title. Ha! That's gonna put some butts in the seats, heh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCW "Monday Nitro": Commentator Tony Schiavone reveals Mankind's WWE Title Victory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8nbJikFTv8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Within minutes, as shown by [[Nielsen ratings]], several hundred thousand viewers switched channels from ''Nitro'' on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] to ''Raw Is War'' on the [[USA Network]].&lt;ref name=wcrap&gt;{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Randy|author2=R.D. Reynolds|title=WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|isbn=1-55022-584-7|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mankind won the title, many fans then switched back to ''Nitro'', which still had five minutes of air time left. The final ratings for the night were 5.7 for ''Raw Is War'' and 5.0 for ''Nitro''.

The next week on ''Raw Is War'', there were signs in the crowd that said: "Mick Foley put my butt in this seat".

== Controversy==
In ''[[WrestleCrap]]: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling'', R.D. Reynolds says of the match, "That was that. Fans had been burned one time too many by WCW and the nWo. From that point on in 1999, ratings steadily dropped for the company".&lt;ref name=wcrap&gt;{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Randy|author2=R.D. Reynolds|title=WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|isbn=1-55022-584-7|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWE refers to the match as "one of the most scandalous title changes of all time" and states that "shocking does not even adequately describe this moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411037|title=Hulk Hogan's fifth WCW Championship reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723225023/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411037|archivedate=2008-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to wrestling writers Brian Fritz and Christopher Murray, the event insulted fans, upset viewers, and alerted other wrestlers in the company of problems. They draw a direct link between the title change and the drop in ratings that took place in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=fritz/&gt; In ''The Death of WCW'', Reynolds and Alvarez expand on this link, stating that the January 4 incident "more than any other, started the ball rolling towards the company's inevitable doom". They believe that the "now-legendary" event made the episode "the single most destructive ''Nitro'' in the history of the company" and call it a "disaster of epic proportions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alvarez|first=Bryan|author2=R.D. Reynolds|title=The Death of WCW|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-661-4|year=2004|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' stated that the match "is widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hulkamania Turns 25: Picture 12|quote=The 'match' - in which Hogan poked Nash in the chest with his finger before Nash collapsed for the three-count - is widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW.|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/galleries/hulkamania_turns_25/hulkamania_turns_25.html|accessdate=2010-12-31|date=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with RF Video, Nash claimed that he had nothing to do with the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Booking|booking]] of the incident. When discussing what RF Video refers to as "infamous one finger pin with Hogan",&lt;ref name=rf&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoot With Kevin Nash|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/shootwithkevinnash1.aspx|publisher=RF Video|accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash said that Goldberg was the one who caused that rumor to be spread and that he had not begun booking until February 1999. In ''The Rise and Fall of WCW'', Goldberg said that the incident was Hogan and Nash playing their own little games against the wrestling world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Rise and Fall of WCW|publisher=WWE Home Video|medium=DVD|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Reynolds and Alvarez contended in ''The Death of WCW'' that the actions of Hogan and Nash from the time Goldberg beat Hogan in Atlanta until their own match in the same venue six months later, including the match itself, were part of an ongoing plot between the two wrestlers.

On the August 31, 2009 episode of ''Raw'', [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Shawn Michaels]], and [[Triple H]] were shown watching and discussing footage of the Hogan–Nash match backstage.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''The Sun''|first=Rob|last=McNichol|title=Dusty Shines on Dramatic Raw|date=2009-10-02| accessdate=2010-12-30|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2619329/Dusty-Rhodes-shines-on-dramatic-Raw-show.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=WWE Raw|series=WWF Television|episodelink=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]|location=[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]|airdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/08312009/|accessdate=2010-12-30|title=American nightmare|first=Aubrey|last=Sitterson|date=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, ''Hollywood Hulk Hogan'', Hulk Hogan rejected the idea that the Fingerpoke of Doom was pivotal in WCW's fall. He claimed that "watering down the whole concept" of the New World Order by splitting the group and creating spinoffs such as the [[Latino World Order]] and an inability to compete with the WWF's more risqué "[[Attitude Era|Attitude]] style" were more responsible for WCW's downfall.

Eric Bischoff's autobiography ''Controversy Creates Ca$h'' includes a chapter entitled ''The Turning Point That Wasn't''. In it, Bischoff claimed that singling out the Fingerpoke as the reason WCW went under to be an over-simplification. He did acknowledge that people switched from watching ''Nitro'' to ''Raw Is War'' after Schiavone's remark about Foley winning the WWF Championship, but claimed that "the tide had turned so significantly that us talking about one match didn't matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bischoff|first=Eric|title=Controversy Creates Ca$h|isbn=978-1-4165-2854-8|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2006|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Frau Holle'''" (also known as "'''Mother Holle'''" or "'''Mother Hulda'''" or "'''Old Mother Frost'''") is a [[German language|German]] [[fairy tale]] that comes from the book ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'' (''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'')  collected by [[The Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]].&lt;ref name=surlalune&gt;{{cite web|title=Frau Holle (Mother Holle) (A German Tale)|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/stories/holle.html|website=SurLaLuneFairyTales.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Frau Holle" is the 24th story in the first volume of the book published in 1812 as part of ''Children's and Household Tales''.

==Background==
[[File:Vrouwholle.jpg|thumb|260px|Frau Holle in the [[Efteling]]]]
The legend itself, as it was eventually passed to the Grimm Brothers, originates from oral traditions in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] in what is now known as [[Hesse]]. It was told to them by Henriette Dorothea Wild (whom Wilhelm Grimm married in 1825) with more details, which were added in the second edition (1819). It is still a common expression in Hesse and beyond to say "Hulda is making her bed" when it is snowing, that is, she shakes her bed and out comes snow from heaven.

In the second edition of the book in 1819 they added some details, most prominently the rooster's greetings, provided by a correspondent: Georg August Friedrich Goldmann from [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name=Bio.&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Grimm|url=http://www.biography.com/people/wilhelm-grimm-21085173#grimms-fairy-tales|website=Bio.|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other tales collected by the brothers Grimm the story of Frau Holle was told to teach a moral. In this case, it is that hard work is rewarded and laziness is punished.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Frau Holle - Mauro Breda.jpg|420px|thumb|upright|Frau Holle]]
A rich [[widow]] lives with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and [[Weaving (mythology)|spin]] beside the well.

One day she pricked her finger on the point of the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. Leaning over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in a panic she leapt into the well after it.

The girl found herself in a meadow where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's [[Peel (tool)|peel]] she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile, before continuing on her way. Finally she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.

The woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.

After a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of [[gold]] fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house. 

Her mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] spilled over her. "That is what you have earned," said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.

Other versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips everytime she speaks.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; That is why, in [[Hessen]] whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm024.html ''Frau Holle'', translated by D.L. Ashliman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Marija Gimbutas]] names Hulda (or [[Holda]], Holla, Holle) as having originally been an ancient Germanic supreme goddess who predates most of the Germanic pantheon, including deities such as [[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Freya]], and [[Loki]], continuing traditions of [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European]] [[Neolithic Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija, ''The Living Goddesses'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Christianity slowly replaced Scandinavian paganism during the [[Early Middle Ages]], many of the old customs were gradually lost or assimilated into Christian tradition. By the end of the [[High Middle Ages]], Scandinavian paganism was almost completely marginalized and blended into rural [[folklore]], in which the character of Frau Hulda eventually survived.

In Germanic Pre-Christian folklore, Hulda, [[Holda]], Holle and Holla were all names to denote a single being. According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt; Hulda is also related to the Germanic figure of [[Perchta]]. She dwells at the bottom of a well, rides a wagon, and  first taught the craft of making linen from flax. Holle is the goddess to whom children who died as infants go, and alternatively known as both the Dunkle Großmutter (Dark Grandmother) and the ''Weisse Frau'' (White Lady), elements which are more typically associated with the Grimms' fairy tale as well. Her connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving]] has associated her with [[witchcraft]] in Catholic German folklore.

Frau Holle is one of Germany's most durable female legendary figures and represents a pre-Christian deity who survived in popular belief and in the memory of common people well into the nineteenth century.

==Perchta==
{{Main|Perchta}}

The Grimms say Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Jacob (1882). Deutsche Mythologie 4th ed. [1875]. Trans. James Stallybrass Grimm's Teutonic Mythology Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed female spirit. She was known as a goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like myths of Holda in Continental German regions. He believes she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and she was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]].

According to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Like many of the other tales collected by the Grimm brothers, "Frau Holle" personifies good behavior and bad, and the appropriate reward meted out for each.  Even so, it also exhibits a number of contrasts with other stories.  Typically, the magical beings who appear in the tales must enter the real world and appear to the protagonists before any intercession can take place.  Moreover, these beings are almost always anonymous and therefore difficult to correlate with figures in pre-Christian mythology.  By contrast, Frau Holle resides somewhere above the earth, and the protagonists must go to her, paradoxically by diving into a spring.  When she makes her bed, loose feathers are 'stirred up' and fall to earth as snow, and so this fairy tale is an origin myth as well.  Comparison between Frau Holle and a weather or earth goddess is inevitable.  Jakob Grimm&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Ludwig Karl Grimm, transl J.S. Stallybrass.''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]''. George Bell, London 1882, pp 263f.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Thunar ([[Thor]]) makes rain in a similar fashion, implying for Frau Holle a very high rank in the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm (1882) p268&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not unique in this respect, the Frau Holle story is also notable for the absence of class-related motifs such as palaces,  balls to which one may or may not be invited, and the rise to the status of the [[nobility]] through marriage.

According to the [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne and Thompson classification system of fairy tales]], ''Mother Hulda'' is a story of type 480, ''The Kind and the Unkind Girls''.  Others of this type include ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'', ''[[Diamonds and Toads]]'', ''[[The Three Heads in the Well]]'', ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]'', ''[[The Enchanted Wreath]]'', ''[[The Old Witch]]'', and ''[[The Two Caskets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/other.html "Tales Similar to Diamonds and Toads"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary variants include ''[[The Three Fairies]]'' and ''[[Aurore and Aimée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 543, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are [[Sex differences in humans|biologically determined]], and to what extent they are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].

Various groups, most notably the [[feminism|feminist movement]], have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate.

The term ''gender role'' was first used by [[John Money]] and colleagues in 1954, during the course of his study of [[intersex]] individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a [[male]] or [[female]] in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = Know Thy Gender: Etymological Primer | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1300-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines gender roles as "socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |title=What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=WHO.int |publisher=World Health Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074425/http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |archivedate=18 August 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues as to what extent gender and gender roles are socially constructed (i.e. non-biologically influenced), and to what extent "socially constructed" may be considered synonymous with "arbitrary" or "malleable".&lt;ref&gt;The social construction of race.

Gender roles are culturally specific, and while some cultures distinguish only two ([[boy]] and [[girl]] or [[man]] and [[woman]]), others recognize more.

Gender ''role,'' which refers to the cultural expectations as understood by gender classification, is not the same thing as [[gender identity]]{{contradiction inline|date=December 2018}}, which refers to the internal sense of one's own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these [[Internalization|internalized]] gender identities become [[Externalization|externalized]] into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = P. | last2 = Kless | first2 = S. | last3 = Adler | first3 = P | year = 1992 | title = Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls | url = | journal = Sociology of education | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 169–087 | doi=10.2307/2112807| jstor = 2112807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acker | first1 = J | year = 1992 | title = From sex roles to gendered institutions | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 565–569 | doi=10.2307/2075528| jstor = 2075528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of gender as a social construct==
{{Main|Social construction of gender}}
[[File:Gobert - Louis XV as child, Fundación Jakober.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Changing norms of [[gender socialization]]: [[Louis XV]] in 1712, wearing the customary clothes of [[breeching (boys)|unbreeched]] boys, would be considered [[Cross-dressing|cross-dressed]] in the 21st century.]]

Some theories – which are collectively termed ''social construction'' theories – claim that gender behavior is mostly due to social conventions, although opposing theories disagree, such as theories in [[evolutionary psychology]].

Most children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three.&lt;ref name="Pate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pate |first=J. s.d |title=What everyone should know about gender and sexuality |url=http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm|website=jamespatemd.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119172004/http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm |archivedate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, in the course of gender socialization, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. In a traditional view, males learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E. (1986) Language practices and self definition: The case of gender identity acquisition. The Sociological Quarterly vol. 27, issue 3, pp 295-311&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionists state, for example, that gender-segregated children's activities create the appearance that gender differences in behavior reflect an essential nature of male and female behavior.&lt;ref name="Fenstermaker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenstermaker|first=Sarah|title=Doing Gender, Doing Difference: Inequality, Power, and Institutional Change|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-93179-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7vLBpyjCFwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspect of [[role theory]], gender role theory "treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H. (1997). Sex differences in social behavior: Comparing social role theory and evolutionary psychology. American Psychologist, December, 1380-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gilbert Herdt]], gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labour division was extended to gender roles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Gender roles are considered by social constructionists to be hierarchical, and are characterized as a male-advantaged gender hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

According to Eagly ''et al.'', the consequences of gender roles and stereotypes are sex-typed social behavior because roles and stereotypes are both socially shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms.&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A. H. (2004). Prejudice: Toward a more inclusive understanding. In A. H. Eagly, R. M. Baron, &amp; V. L.

[[Judith Butler]],&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (1990). {{Full citation needed|date=December 2012}} ‘’Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity.’’ New York; Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; in works such as ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' and ''[[Undoing Gender]]''{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}, contends that being female is not "natural" and that it appears natural only through repeated performances of gender; these performances in turn, reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.

==Major Theorists==
===Talcott Parsons===
Working in the [[United States]], [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure.{{According to whom|date=June 2016}} It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.

{{context inline|date=December 2018}} Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

{| border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;" class="wikitable"

! Model A – Total role segregation !! Model B – Total integration of roles
|-
| '''[[Education]]'''
| Gender-specific education; high professional qualification is important only for the man
| Co-educative schools, same content of classes for girls and boys, same qualification for men and women.
|-
| '''[[Profession]]'''
| The workplace is not the primary area of women; career and professional advancement is deemed unimportant for women
| For women, career is just as important as for men; equal professional opportunities for men and women are necessary.
|-
| '''Housework'''
| Housekeeping and child care are the primary functions of the woman; participation of the man in these functions is only partially wanted.
| All housework is done by both parties to the marriage in equal shares.
|-
| '''[[Decision making]]'''
| In case of conflict, man has the last say, for example in choosing the place to live, choice of school for children, buying decisions
| Neither partner dominates; solutions do not always follow the principle of finding a concerted decision; [[status quo]] is maintained if disagreement occurs.
|-
| '''Child care and education'''
| Woman takes care of the largest part of these functions; she educates children and cares for them in every way
| Man and woman share these functions equally.
|}

However, these structured positions become less a liberal-individualist society, {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).{{According to whom|date=June 2016}}

===Geert Hofstede===
[[File:Landsdowne Herakles.jpg|thumb|upright|In Greek mythology, [[Heracles]] is synonymous with [[Apollonian]] masculinity.]]
[[Geert Hofstede]], a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture, sees culture as "broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting" in a society&lt;ref&gt;Hoststede, Geert. 1998. Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures. page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Hofstede's view, masculinity and femininity differ in the social roles that are associated with the biological fact of the existence of the two sexes: masculinity and femininity refer to the dominant sex role pattern in the vast majority of both traditional and modern societies, males being more assertive and females more nurturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture’s consequences: international differences in work-related values. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Femininity creates a society of overlapping gender roles, where "both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001"&gt;Hofstede (2001), Culture’s Consequences, 2nd ed. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculinity creates a society of clearly distinct gender roles, where men should "be assertive, tough, and focused on material success," while women should "be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001" /&gt;

Hofstede's ''Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Masculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, define relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Cultural differences in teaching and learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = 308 | doi=10.1016/0147-1767(86)90015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In feminine cultures, modesty and relationships are important characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|year=2002|title=Consensus Societies with Their Own Character: National Cultures in Japan and the Netherlands.|url=|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=1|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from in masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic, and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships.

'The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert|last2=de Mooij|first2=Marickc|title=The Hofstede model Applications to global branding and advertising strategy and research|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2010|volume=29|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.2501/S026504870920104X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Albert Ellis]] studied eighty-four cases of mixed births and concluded that 'while the power of the human sex drive may possibly be largely dependent on physiological factors... the direction of this drive does not seem to be directly dependent on constitutional element'.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; In the development of masculinity, femininity, and inclinations towards homosexuality or heterosexuality, nurture matters a great deal more than nature.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne (2000).

===John Money===
"In the 1950s, [[John Money]], along with colleagues took up the study of [[intersex]] individuals, who, Money realized 'would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and [[psychosexual]] orientation'."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fausto-Sterling |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Fausto-Sterling |title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-976qhsz7A4C&amp;pg=PA46 |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-2433-8 |page=46 |oclc=818855499 |orig-year=1st pub. 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008" /&gt;

They concluded that [[gonads]], [[hormones]], and [[chromosomes]] did not automatically determine a child's gender role.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; Among the many terms he coined was ''gender role'' which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |journal=Bull.

In recent years, the majority of Money's theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the false reporting of success in the "John/Joan" case, later revealed to be [[David Reimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colapinto|first=J.|title=The True Story of John/Joan|work=The Rolling Stone|date=11 December 1997|pages=54–97|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/gender/inside-intersexuality/the-true-story-of-john-joan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colapinto, J.

=== Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman ===
West and Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction as "roles." For them, gender is "the product of social doings of some sort...undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Don H.|date=June 1987|title=Doing Gender|journal=Gender and Society|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|volume=1|issue=2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the use of "role" to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, roles are situated identities, such as "nurse" and "student," developed as the situation demands while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, "conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.

Because of the influence of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality (among others), the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that the relationship between gender and sex (presence of genitals/gonads) is not causally determinate. That is, that one may have the genitals of one sex while having the gender of another.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be debate on the subject. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge University professor of psychology and psychiatry claims 'the female brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for understanding and building systems'.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S (2003) The Essential Difference: men, women and the extreme male brain.

Several studies have been conducted looking at the gender roles of [[intersex]] children.

One such study looked at female infants with [[adrenal hyperplasia]], and who had excess male hormone levels, but were thought to be females and raised as such by their parents. These girls were more likely to express masculine traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berenbaum|first1=Sheri A.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|year=1992|title=Early androgens are related to childhood sex-typed toy preferences|work=Psychological Science 3|pages=203–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mgorman/Berenbaum.pdf|title=Gorman Lab|author=Sven Design|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study looked at 18 infants with the intersex condition [[5-alpha reductase deficiency]], and XY chromosomes, assigned female at birth. At adult age only one individual maintained a female role, all the others being stereotypically male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Imperato-McGinley|first=J|author2=Peterson, RE |author3=Gautier, T |author4= Sturla, E |title=Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=31 May 1979|volume=300|issue=22|pages=1233–7|pmid=431680|doi=10.1056/NEJM197905313002201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a third study, 14 male children born with [[cloacal exstrophy]] and assigned female at birth, including through [[intersex medical interventions]]. Upon follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12, eight of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/node/564 |title=Reiner &amp; Gearhart's NEJM Study on Cloacal Exstrophy - Review by Vernon Rosario, M.D., Ph.D |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the [[gender schema theory]], based on the combination of aspects of the [[social cognitive theory|social learning theory]] and the [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition, to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life. In 1971, she created the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] to measure how well an individual conformed to a traditional gender role, characterizing those tested as having masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated personality. She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories, and that therefore individuals processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bem |first=Sandra L. |title=Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing |journal=Psychological Review|date=July 1981|volume=88|issue=4|pages=354–364|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g. better average balance in females or greater average physical size and endurance in males) between the sexes{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex. [[Eve Shapiro]], author of ''Gender Circuits'', explains that "gender, like other social categories, is both a personal identity and a culture set of behaviors, beliefs and values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gender_Circuits.html?id=FQ67HsfI1rUC |last1=Shapiro|first1=Eve|title=Gender circuits : bodies and identities in a technological age|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780415996952|page=9&lt;!--|pages=298--&gt;|edition=1.|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{off topic sentence}}

Research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates. Yerkes researchers studied the interactions of 11 male and 23 female [[Rhesus monkey]]s with human toys, both wheeled and plush. The males played mostly with the wheeled toys while the females played with both types equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes National Primate Research Center |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Kim Wallen has, however, warned against overinterpreting the results as the color and size of the toys may also have been factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys.html |title=Male monkeys prefer boys' toys |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008 |accessdate=17 April 2010 |journal=Hormones and Behavior |date=2008 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=359–364 |first=Janice M. |last=Hassett|pmc=2583786 |pmid=18452921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. [[R.W. Connell]] in ''Men, Masculinities and Feminism''&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn, Ph.D. "Men, Masculinities and Feminism." Social Alternatives July 1997: 7-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; claims:

{{quote|There are cultures where it has been normal, not exceptional, for men to have homosexual relations. There have been periods in 'Western' history when the modern convention that men suppress displays of emotion did not apply at all, when men were demonstrative about their feeling for their friends. Mateship in the Australian outback last century is a case in point.}}

There are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. In the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fortin | first1 = Nicole | year = 2005 | title = Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries | url = | journal = Oxford Review of Economic Policy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 416–438 | doi=10.1093/oxrep/gri024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have also varied historically, for example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers|year=2010|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=0-912670-13-4|pages=44–87|edition=2nd|author2=Deirdre English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rise of [[witch-hunt]]s across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich" /&gt; but in the last few decades these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boulis|first=Ann K.|title=The changing face of medicine: women doctors and the evolution of health care in America|year=2010|publisher=ILR|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-7662-3|author2=Jacobs, Jerry A.|quote=Encouraging one's daughter to pursue a career in medicine is no longer an unusual idea… Americans are now more likely to report that they feel comfortable recommending a career in medicine for a young woman than for a young man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vern Bullough]] stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bullough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bullough |first=Vern L.|title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. 1993 |isbn=978-0-8122-1431-4|page=390|edition=1st|author2=Bonnie Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an [[Adam's apple]], wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employer, according to a 2011 report from the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2011/06/pdf/workplace_discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles may be a means through which one expresses their [[gender identity]], but they may also be employed as a means of exerting [[social control]], and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J.R. (1992). "Group influences on individuals in organizations". In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology (Vol. 3).

===Religion===
{{main|Gender and religion}}

Different religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to "police" within their own group, including gender norms.

====Christianity====

{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
{{see also|Christian views on marriage}}

''I Corinthians,'' 11:14 and 15 indicates that it is inappropriate for a man to wear his hair long, and good for a woman to wear her hair long.

The roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today as they have varied historically since the first century New Testament church. This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].

Many leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.

Christian traditions that officially recognize "[[saint]]s", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the "[[Theotokos]]", i.e. "Mother of God", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. 
Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.

====Islam====
{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}

In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.

In some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress "[[modesty|modestly]]" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.

[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; How gender roles are honored is largely cultural. While some cultures encourage men and women to take on the same roles, others promote a more traditional, less dominant role for the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Connections .

====Hinduism====
{{main|God and gender in Hinduism}}
Hindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than deities of other world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and others. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood&lt;ref&gt;Gopal, Madan (1990). K.S. Gautam, ed. India through the ages. Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:God marriage AS.jpg|thumb|upright|Image of [[Ardhanarishvara]]]] However, in a religious cosmology like [[Hinduism]], which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]], and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. On one hand, women's fertility is given great value, and on the other, female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Peletz"&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies on marriage in the U.S.===
{{see also|Marriage}}

Marriage is an institution that influences gender roles, inequality, and change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Introduction: Marriage, gender relations and social change | url = | journal = Journal of Development Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi=10.1080/00220388.2011.629653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill the stereotypical gender roles within a heterosexual marriage starting out at a young age. Although traditionally, society claims that roles within a heterosexual marriage should be decided based on one's biological sex, today individuals are determining their own roles for themselves, ultimately creating equal partnerships.

====Communication of Gender Roles in the United States====
In the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society's expectations and [[Media and gender|the influence of the media]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2008). ''Media, gender and identity: An introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = G. L. | year = 1988 | title = Leadership roles and the gender stereotype traits | doi = 10.1007/BF00288051 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 18 | issue = 11–12| pages = 649–668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male. Typically, women are concerned with caring for the family and the home while men are typically providing for the family. This ultimately portrays the man as a leader and the woman as the follower.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"/&gt;

In the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchard|first=Justin|title=Men hold the edge on gender gap odds|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6970963.html|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.&lt;ref&gt;Facts for features: Valentine's Day U.S. Census Bureau Report 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/09/china.justinmccurry|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2004|author2=Allison, Rebecca|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polygamy proposal for Chechen men|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610396.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study by [[David Buss]], men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long term partner. Both men and women ranked "kindness" and "intelligence" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.

====Media====
In today's society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one's life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Traditional gendered roles view the man as a “pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,” and the woman as “pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the Internet, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Michael Messner]] argues that "gendered interactions, structure, and cultural meanings are intertwined, in both mutually reinforcing and contradictory ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Barbie girls vs. sea monsters: children constructing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 765&amp;ndash;784 | doi = 10.1177/089124300014006004 | date = December 2000 | ref = harv |url=http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/barbiegirls.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television's influence on society, specifically the influence of television advertisements, is shown in studies such as that of Jörg Matthes, Michael Prieler, and Karoline Adam. Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings. This underrepresentation in television advertising is seen in many countries around the world but is very present in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=Jörg|last2=Prieler|first2=Michael|last3=Adam|first3=Karoline|date=October 2016|title=Gender-Role Portrayals in Television Advertising Across the Globe.|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=118091293&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Sex Roles|volume=75|issue=7–8|pages=314–327|doi=10.1007/s11199-016-0617-y|pmid=27688526|pmc=5023740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]],'' many television advertisements in countries around the world are seen targeting women at different times of the day than men. Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=85285381&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179–180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]]. Girls feel pressurised and stressed to achieve a particular appearance and there have been highly worrying consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.

It has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141–142 |url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=13247295&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171–180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Interaction====
Gendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing gender roles in marriage====
Over the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Motivated by the women's rights movement and various other movements gender roles have begun to change, resulting in the changing economic landscape, women entering the workplace and many more. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Despite the fact that there is still a gap between gender roles, today, roles are less gendered and more equal in comparison to how they were traditionally.

Societies can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives earn more than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27instincts.html | work=The New York Times | first=M.P. | last=Dunleavey | title=A Breadwinner Rethinks Gender Roles | date=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their education. Women have also started to get more involved in recreation activities such as sports, which in the past were regarded to be for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=7 November 2012|title=Women and the Wild: Gender Socialization in Wilderness Recreation Advertising|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12147-012-9111-1|journal=SpringerLink|volume=29|pages=39–55|via=|doi=10.1007/s12147-012-9111-1 | last1 = McNiel | first1 = Jamie N. | last2 = Harris | first2 = Deborah A. | last3 = Fondren | first3 = Kristi M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing. Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.

According to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Stay-at-Home Dads - Pew Research Center|date=5 June 2014|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/9822271/Rise-in-stay-at-home-fathers-fuelled-by-growing-numbers-of-female-breadwinners.html|title=Rise in stay-at-home fathers fuelled by growing numbers of female breadwinners|author1=Louisa Peacock |author2=Sam Marsden |date=23 January 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/stay-at-home-dads-on-the-rise-increasingly-because-they-want-to-be/article19014624/|title=Stay-at-home dads on the rise – increasingly because they want to be|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=Toronto|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/sweden-sees-boom-in-stay-at-home-dads/|title=Sweden sees boom in stay-at-home dads|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|title=Breadwinner Moms|date=29 May 2013|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender equality]] allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason "men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pompper | first1 = Donnalyn | year = 2010 | title = Masculinities, The Metrosexual, And Media Images: Across Dimensions Of Age And Ethnicity | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 63 | issue = 9/10| pages = 682–696 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LGBT rights movement]] has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Brian.

According to Professor [[Lei Chang]], gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles, can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:
* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,
* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and
* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.
Through such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722–41 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that "high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=July 2016}} This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.

A study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Bag"/&gt; The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that "gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that "women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means".&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641–72 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups — for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.

==Communication==
{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}
Gender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.

Communication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough. ''Gender in communication a critical introduction''. Los Angeles: Sage, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, but males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Differences in Communication." Intercultural Communication: A Global Reader. Ed. Fred E. Jandt. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004. 221–29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(11)00102-4/abstract the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women] could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/nov/15/woman-lower-tone-voice-successful Margaret Thatcher's years in power].)

===Nonverbal communication===
Hall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. A. (1990). Nonverbal sex differences: Accuracy of communication and expressive style. Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.

Men, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

McQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women's nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McQuiston | first1 = D. | last2 = Morris | first2 = K.

===Communication and gender cultures===
[[File:Personality and gender word cloud for social media.png|thumb|upright|Words, phrases, and topics most highly distinguishing English-speaking females and males in social media in 2013]]
According to [[Julia Wood]], there are distinct communication 'cultures' for women and men in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Indian Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in reality the root is "gender".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltz and Broker's research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into [[Masculinity|masculine]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] gender roles:&lt;ref name="maltz"&gt;Maltz, D., &amp; Borker, R. (1982). A cultural approach to male-female miscommunication. In J. Gumperz (Ed.), Language and social identity (pp. 196–216). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, girls being encouraged to play "house" may promotes stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.

===Communication and sexual desire===
Mets, et al.&lt;ref name="metts"&gt;Metts, S., Sprecher, S., &amp; Regan, P. C. (1998). Communication and sexual desire. In P. A. Andersen &amp; L. K. Guerrero (Eds.) Handbook of communication and emotion. (pp. 354–377). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explain that [[Libido|sexual desire]] is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.

Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 242–273 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectation of their gender culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seal | first1 = D | last2 = Ehrhardt | first2 = A | year = 2003 | title = Masculinity and urban men: Perceived scripts for courtship, romantic, and sexual interactions with women | url = | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality: an International Journal for Research, Intervention and Care | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 295–319 | doi=10.1080/136910501171698}}&lt;/ref&gt; When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the [[Challenge hypothesis]].

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen,&lt;ref name="murnen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perot |first1= |last2=Byrne Murnen |first2=SK |last3=Perot |first3=A |last4=Byrne |first4=D |year=1989 |title = Coping with unwanted sexual activity: Normative responses, situational determinants, and individual differences |doi=10.1080/00224498909551493 |journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 85–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis&lt;ref name="perper"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perper | first1 = T. | last2 = Weis | first2 = D. L. | year = 1987 | title = Proceptive and rejective strategies of U.S. and Canadian college women | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 455–480 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551385}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

==Gender stereotypes==

[[File:Glaspalast München 1883 064.jpg|thumb|An 1883 German illustration of children playing house]]
A 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children.&lt;ref name="fagot"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = Beverly I. | last2 = Leinbach | first2 = Mary D. | last3 = O'Boyle | first3 = Cherie | title = Gender labeling, gender stereotyping, and parenting behaviors | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–230 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.225 | date = March 1992 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagot ''et al.'' divided this into two different studies, the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.

Within the first study, 23 children between the ages of 2 and 7 underwent a series of gender labelling and gender stereotyping tests consisting of showing the children either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom then identifying or labeling those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.

The third was a series of questionnaires such as an "Attitude Toward Women Scale", "[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]", and "Schaefer and Edgerton Scale" which looked at the family values of the mother.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.

They also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the “Gender Labeling Test”, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]], in the 1920s, made the point: 'It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Woolf | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Woolf | title = A room of one's own | publisher = Hogarth Press | location = New York | year = 1929 | page = 76 | oclc = 31499943| title-link = A Room of One's Own }}&lt;/ref&gt; remade sixty years later by psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, ''[[In a Different Voice]]'', holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilligan |first = Carol | author-link = Carol Gilligan | title = In a different voice |publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780674445444|title-link = In a Different Voice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Carol Lynn | last2 = Halverson Jr. | first2 = Charles F. | title = A schematic processing model of sex typing and stereotyping in children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 1119–1134 | doi = 10.2307/1129498 | jstor = 1129498 | date = December 1981 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a 'boy's subject'. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.&lt;ref name="Cvencek"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math–gender stereotypes in elementary school children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 766–779 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x | pmid = 21410915 | date = May–June 2011 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.300.2757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1972 study by Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result indicates that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lipman-Blumen | first = Jean | title = How ideology shapes women's lives | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 226 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–42 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0172-34 | date = January 1972 | ref = harv | bibcode = 1972SciAm.226a..34L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 July 2015 |first = Leigh|last = Goodmark|first2 = Juanita|last2 = Flores|first3 = Julie|last3 = Goldscheid|first4 = Andrea |last4 = Ritchie |last5=SpearIt |title=Plenary 2—Redefining Gender Violence |url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=umrsjlr |journal=University of Miami Race &amp; Social Justice Law Review |volume=5 |page=289 |ssrn=2628984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later study, Deaux and her colleagues (1984) found that most people think women are ''more'' ''nurturant'', but ''less self-assertive'' than men. and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women's ''role''. To put it another way, women do not have an ''inherently'' nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deaux | first1 = Kay | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Laurie L. | title = Structure of gender stereotypes: interrelationships among components and gender label | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 991–1004 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991 | date = May 1984 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of gender stereotypes by Jacobs (1991) it was found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jacobs | first = Janis E. | title = Influence of gender stereotypes on parent and child mathematics attitudes | journal = [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 518–527 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.518 | date = December 1991 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereotype threat]] is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = Joshua | author-link1 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 797–811 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 | pmid = 7473032 | date = November 1995 | ref = harv }} [http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = Steven J. | last2 = Steele | first2 = Claude M. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = Diane M. | author-link2 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and women's math performance | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–28 | doi = 10.1006/jesp.1998.1373 | date = January 1999 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.370.3979 }} [http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108184501/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf |date=8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article of stereotype threat research (2012) relating to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded "that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement? | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–102 | doi = 10.1037/a0026617 | date = March 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Jolien A. van Breen and colleagues conducted research into [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] gender stereotyping. Researchers took participants through a fictional Moral Choice Dilemma Task, which consisted of eight scenarios "in which sacrificing one person can save several others of unspecified gender... In four scenarios, participants are asked to sacrifice a man to save several others (of unspecified gender), and in four other scenarios they are asked to sacrifice a woman." The results showed that women who identified as feminists were more willing to 'sacrifice' men than women who did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jolien A. | first1 = van Breen | last2 = Spears | first2 = Russell | last3 = Kuppens | first3 = Toon | last4 = de Lemus | first4 = Soledad | title = Subliminal gender stereotypes: who can resist? | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 44 | issue = 12 | pages = 1648–1663 | doi = 10.1177/0146167218771895 | pmid = 29781373 | date = May 2018 | ref = harv }} [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt; "If a person wanted to counteract that and ‘level the playing field’, that can be done either by boosting women or by downgrading men”, said van Breen. “So I think that this effect on evaluations of men arises because our participants are trying to achieve an underlying aim: counteracting gender stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Airaksinen | first = Toni | title = STUDY: Feminists more willing to ‘sacrifice’ men | url = https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=10984 | work = [[Campus Reform]] | publisher = [[Leadership Institute]] | date = 5 June 2018 | access-date = 11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender stereotypes and issues in the workplace ===
[[Gender stereotypes]] are frequently brought up{{by who|date=December 2018}}{{clarify|date=December 2018}} as one disadvantage to women during the hiring process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorman|first1=Elizabeth H.|title=Gender Stereotypes, Same-Gender Preferences, and Organizational Variation in the Hiring of Women: Evidence from Law Firms|journal=American Sociological Review|date=August 2005|volume=70|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000312240507000408|pages=702–728}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as one explanation of the lack of women in key organizational positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|title=Description and Prescription: How Gender Stereotypes Prevent Women's Ascent Up the Organizational Ladder|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00234|pages=657–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Management and similar leader positions are often perceived to be "masculine" in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Gender Stereotypes Are Alive, Well, and Busy Producing Workplace Discrimination|journal=Industrial and Organizational Psychology|date=2008|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is often referred to as the "lack of fit" model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Madeline E.|year=1983|title=Sex Bias in Work Settings: The Lack of Fit Model|url=|journal=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these "masculine" qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.

One's performance at work is also evaluated based on one's gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person's gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|last3=Etcoff|first3=Nancy L.|last4=Ruderman|first4=Audrey J.|title=Categorical and Contextual Bases of Person Memory and Stereotyping|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1978|volume=36|issue=7|pages=778|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.7.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Female performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.

Consequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the [[glass ceiling]]. While the number of [[women in the workforce]] occupying management positions is slowly increasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalysh|first1=Kateryina|last2=Kulik|first2=Carol T.|last3=Perera|first3=Sanjeewa|title=Help or hindrance?

In relation to white women, [[women of color]] are disproportionally affected by the negative influence their gender has on their chances in the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browne|first1=Irene|last2=Misra|first2=Joya|title=The Intersection of Gender and Race in the Labor Market|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2003|volume=29|issue=1|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016|pages=487–513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, women held only 14.7% of Fortune 500 board seats with 79% of them being white and 21% being women of color.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This difference is understood through [[intersectionality]], a term describing the multiple and intersecting oppressions and individual might experience. Activists during [[second-wave feminism]] have also used the term "horizontal oppressions" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Feminist Theory: From Modernity to Postmodernity|last=Mann|first=Susan Archer|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a "concrete wall" or a "sticky floor" to better visualize the barriers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Liberal feminism|Liberal feminist]] theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Reproduction of Gender Inequality: A Discourse Analysis of Research Texts on Women's Entrepreneurship|last=Ahl|first=Helene|publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|year=1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01066.x|journal=Hypatia|volume=2|issue=2|pages=65–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While activists have tried calling on [[Title VII]] to provide an equal hiring and promotional process, that practice has had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=Kathryn|title=Gender Discrimination and the Transformation of Workplace Norms|journal=Vand.

A proposed step towards solving the problem of the gender pay gap and the unequal work opportunities is the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] which would constitutionally guarantee [[equal rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soule|first1=Sarah A.|last2=Olzak|first2=Susan|title=When do Movements Matter?

===Economic and social consequences===
If a woman ''does'' act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does ''not'' act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more [[androgynous]], or even [[Masculinity|masculine]], it is likely to cause backlash through [[third-party punishment]] or further [[job discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=Laurie A.|last2=Glick|first2=Peter|title=Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Toward Agentic Women|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00239|pages=743–762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are expected to behave in a way that aligns with female gender stereotypes while these stereotypes are simultaneously used to justify their lack of success in an economic context, putting women in the workforce in a precarious, "double bind" situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Joan C.|title=Reconstructive Feminism: Changing the Way We Talk About Gender and Work Thirty Years After the PDA|journal=21 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism|date=2009|volume=79|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed step to relieve women from this issue is the above-mentioned ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], as it would legally further gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|date=1989|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex.

[[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] identified four types of [[Media and gender|stereotypes given to professional women via the media]]. The four stereotypes are, iron maiden, pet, mother, and [[Seduction|seductress]]/sex object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Women of the Corporation|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss|publisher=Basic Books Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780465044542|location=New York|pages=233–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron maiden refers to women who are deemed to display too many [[Masculinity|masculine]] traits and not enough feminine traits according to her audience. This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

A proposed step to relieve women from that [[double bind]] is the above-mentioned ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would further legal gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarlin|first1=William Wayne|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex. L. Rev.|date=1989|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes or in defiance of them.

===Implicit gender stereotypes===
{{See also|Implicit stereotype}}
[[File:Bettie Page driving.jpg|thumb|300px|A magazine feature from ''Beauty Parade'' from March 1952 stereotyping women drivers. It features [[Bettie Page]] as the model.]]
Gender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. [[Implicit stereotypes]] are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.

These implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).

One example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = Brian A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = Mahzarin R. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math = male, me = female, therefore math ≠ me | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–59 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | date = July 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.6120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYw7ZZzCqNYC&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=males+better+at+math|title=Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition|first=Anne|last=Fausto-Sterling|date=4 August 2008|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786723904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.&lt;ref name="Cvencek" /&gt;

The same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Kapur | first3 = Manu | title = Cognitive consistency and math–gender stereotypes in Singaporean children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 117 | pages = 73–91 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | pmid = 24141205 | date = January 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Smyth | first2 = F.

==Gender inequality online==
An example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more 'tech savvy' and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai &amp; Shafer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differences in Actual and Perceived Online Skills: The Role of Gender*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x/abstract|journal = Social Science Quarterly |date=1 June 2006 |issn = 1540-6237|pages = 432–448|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x|first = Eszter|last = Hargittai|first2 = Steven|last2 = Shafer}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.

In the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an 'ideal' figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Women have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quite sexist in their appearance. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples' beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the male and female characters in different games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8|title=The Effects of the Sexualization of Female Video Game Characters on Gender Stereotyping and Female Self-Concept|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Dana|last2=Mastro|date=1 December 2009|publisher=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=61|issue=11–12|pages=808–823|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Postmes|first1=Tom|last2=Spears|first2=Russell|title=Behavior Online: Does Anonymous Computer Communication Reduce Gender Inequality?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=2002|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1073–1083|doi=10.1177/01461672022811006}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in [[Online game|online gaming]] where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming regardless of actual gender those who are perceived to be female are treated differently because of their on-line gender identity.

In marked contrast to the traditional male-dominated stereotype a study shows that 52% of the gaming audience is made up of women and a minority of gaming characters are women.{{non sequitur|date=December 2018}} Only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers are women.&lt;ref name="Jayanth1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn’t know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the growing number of women who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet, issues such as gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.

== Politics and gender issues ==
=== In political office ===
Even though the number of women running for [[elected office]] has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current Numbers |quote=This page contains current numbers of women officeholders serving in 2017 with links on the right to basic fact sheets for each level of office. |url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|website=www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nayda|title=Gender Stereotypes and the Perception of Male and Female Candidates|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=February 1993|volume=37|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2111526|page=119|jstor=2111526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.

Elections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate's gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling [[women's rights]] and [[poverty]], whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with [[crime]] and [[foreign affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanbonmatsu|first1=Kira|title=Stereotypes and Vote Choice|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=January 2002|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3088412|page=20|jstor=3088412}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.

It has also been predicted that gender does only highly matter for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaign or the focal point of media coverage. This has been disproven by multiple scholars, often based on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s multiple campaigns for the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Susan J.|year=2009|title=Reflections on Gender and Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign: The Good, the Bad, and the Misogynistic|url=|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=5|pages=1–20|via=|doi=10.1017/s1743923x09000014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlin|first1=Diana B.|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly L.|title=Have You Come A Long Way, Baby?

Additionally, when voters don't have a lot of information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nadya|title=The Consequences of Gender Stereotypes for Women Candidates at Different Levels and Types of Office|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=1993|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from "homemakers" and "caregivers", women were now factory workers and "breadwinners" for the family.

However, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the "private sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres? Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity | url = | journal = Current Anthology | volume = 47 | issue =4 | pages=666–674 |doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though frequently sold and idealized as “perfect living”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodson | first1 = Dan W. | year = 1958 | title = Suburbanism and Education | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Sociology | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages =2–7|doi=10.2307/2264228| jstor = 2264228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many women had difficulty adjusting to the new “private sphere.” Writer [[Betty Friedan]] described this discontent as “[[The Feminine Mystique|the feminine mystique]].” The “mystique” was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the “public sphere”, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique". New York:W.W. Norton, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major concern of feminism, is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housework.&lt;ref name="Gender differences in perceptions of household labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18658547.html|title=Gender differences in perceptions of household labor|accessdate=23 October 2009 |publisher=The Journal of Psychology|date=1 July 1996|author1=Kiger, Kiger |author2=Riley, Pamela J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and "mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).&lt;ref name="The Shriver Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/10/womans_nation.html/#executive_summary|title=The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything|accessdate=23 October 2009 |publisher=Center for American Progress|date=19 October 2009|author=Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, "Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Torregrosa|first=Luisita|title=They Call It the Reverse Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/us/14iht-letter14.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this study concerned American cities, a global trend is developing, and has now been termed "the reverse gender gap."

Feminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female's duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, "Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]’s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, “abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.”&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47–70&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.

The men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early-1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, [[discrimination]] and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgzFZ4o0qnMC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |last=Gavanas |first=Anna |title=Fatherhood Politics in the United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, and Marriage |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= Urbana |year=2004 |isbn=0-252-02884-8 |quote=All these cases of perceived discrimination make up the men's rights view that men are considered, by government and society, to be more expendable than women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editor1-first=Stephen Blake |editor1-last=Boyd |editor2-first=W.

Scholars consider the men's rights movement or parts of the movement to be a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=backlash&gt;See, for example:

The definition of ''transgender'' includes:

"A friend of mine recently did the ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' show about transgender youth", said RuPaul. "It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the [[American League|American baseball league]] and the [[National League|National baseball league]], when they are both so similar."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art|Interview with RuPaul]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person's emotional and physical attraction toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Society : Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. (2014). Thirroul, AU: The Spinney Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ebrary.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindley | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Walsemann | first2 = Katrina | last3 = Carter | first3 = Jarvis | year = 2012 | title = The Association of Sexual Orientation Measures With Young Adults' Health-Related Outcomes | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1178 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300262 | pmid = 22021310 | pmc=3483939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that sexual orientation is better defined as a continuum with those three categories represented. This idea was first proposed by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1948. After conducting a series of interviews, Kinsey and his team of researchers concluded that most people fell somewhere on a spectrum between strictly heterosexual and strictly homosexual. Their findings suggested that sexual orientation was more fluid than once believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = Robert | last2 = McKinney | first2 = Paul | last3 = Fox | first3 = Shannon | last4 = Garcia | first4 = Carlos | year = 2013 | title = Support for a Fluid-Continuum Model or Sexual Orientation: A Large-Scale Internet Study | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 59 | issue = 10| pages = 1356–1358 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2012.724634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation is developed based on the three components of sexual identity, sexual behavior and sexual attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Robert |author2=Paul McKinney |author3=Shannon Fox |author4=Carlos Garcia|title=Support for a Fluid-Continuum Model or Sexual Orientation: A Large-Scale Internet Study|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=20 November 2013|volume=59|pages=1356–1358|doi=10.1080/00918369.2012.724634|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each component is independent so no other conclusions can be drawn based on one another.

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mager|first1=Don|title=Gay Theories of Gender Role Deviance|journal=SubStance|date=1985|volume=14|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.2307/3684953|jstor=3684953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer |first=D.|title=Interpersonal Relationships [e-book]|year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-203-01971-7|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different "rules" they are expected to follow by society.

These modified "rules" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for "not being gay enough"; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, D.

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Legal Issues http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lsex15&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine, respectively, may be assumed to be, or suspected to be, homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality.

'''An Act To Protect Heritage Lighthouses''' ({{lang-fr|Loi sur la protection des phares patrimoniaux}}), officially known as '''Bill S-215''', is a federal act to designate and preserve historically significant Canadian [[lighthouses]]. It was passed by the Canadian Parliament in May 2008. The act set up a public nomination process and sets heritage building conservation standards for lighthouses which are officially designated. First introduced in 2000 as Bill S-21 in the [[Senate of Canada]] the bill enjoyed consistent multi-party support despite the unpredictable legislative agendas of minority Parliaments and was repeatedly re-introduced. The final vote of approval was made by the Canadian Senate in 2008 and the bill received [[Royal Assent]] on May 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/H-3.4/|title=Heritage Lighthouses Protection Act |date=20 March 2017 |website=Justice Laws, Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (S.C. 2008, c. 16) came into effect on May 29, 2010 and established a deadline of May 29, 2012 to nominate lighthouses for heritage designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218105416/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/index.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However an announcement in June 2010 to declare almost all Canadian lighthouses as surplus caused critics to accuse the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] of emasculating the bill.

The first designations under the Act were announced on 3 August 2012: the [[St. Paul Island (Nova Scotia)]] in Dingwall, and three in [[Saugeen Shores, Ontario]], McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the Saugeen River Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2012/08/government-canada-designates-heritage-lighthouses-nova-scotia-ontario-689589.html?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true |title=First designations under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=3 August 2012 |website=Government of Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, a total of 92 lighthouses had been designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/page01.aspx |title=Heritage Lighthouses of Canada |date=2017 |website=Parks Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=27 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202132938/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/page01.aspx |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Chebucto Head Lighthouse (23238949363).jpg|left|thumb|[[Chebucto Head]] Lighthouse, at left where the Lighthouse Protection act campaign was launched]]
With the world's largest coastline, Canada built a large network of lighthouses and developed a unique Canadian style of lighthouses following [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867. Advances in navigational technology have lessened the critical navigational role of lighthouses while at the same time their cultural role and potential for tourism development has grown. Lighthouse groups seeking to preserve lighthouses soon found that in Canada, the landmark buildings fell into a heritage [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]. As federal buildings, they are exempt from municipal or provincial laws, but they are not protected by any federal heritage laws. Lighthouses are instead merely subject to a property management program called the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO). A survey of lighthouses across Canada in 1998 by the [[Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society]] showed that fewer than 4 per cent of Canadian lighthouses have been protected from demolition under FHBRO, while in the United States, 70 percent of lighthouses over 50 years old have heritage protection by the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The FHBRO process has also been criticized for lack of public consultation with most communities having no idea when local lighthouses were evaluated and for the fact that when lighthouses are sold privately or transferred to other levels of government, even the minimal FHBRO protection evaporates.&lt;ref&gt;CANADA NEEDS A LIGHTHOUSE PROTECTION ACT http://www.nslps.com/r&amp;p_lighthouse_protection_act.asp {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024223648/http://www.nslps.com/r%26p_lighthouse_protection_act.asp |date=2004-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of protection for heritage lighthouses was first felt in Nova Scotia, the Canadian province with the largest number of lighthouses. So many were facing demolition and neglect, that a campaign for federal legislation to protect lighthouses was launched by the [[Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society]] at the [[Chebucto Head]] lighthouse near Halifax on March 11, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Hamilton "Lighthouse Yard Sale Coming, Group Fears" National Post March 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of the society soon networked with other lighthouse groups in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, organizing a letter campaign to the Canadian Heritage Minister and every Member of Parliament and Senator to ask for legislation creating a "Lighthouse Protection Act".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mills 'Saving Our Lights' ''Heritage: The Magazine of the Heritage Canada Foundation'' Autumn 1999, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many politicians responded positively but the leadership for the bill emerged from a fitting East Coast/West Coast partnership of two Canadian Senators, [[Mike Forrestall]] from Nova Scotia and [[Pat Carney]] from British Columbia. Forrestall first introduced the Bill in 2000, noting that lighthouses were neglected national symbols, "The government was hell-bent on tearing them down or abandoning them."&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Cook "Sending an SOS for Canada's Lighthouses" ''Capital News Online'' November 14, 2003 https://carleton.ca/jmc/cnews/14112003/n3.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The bill is modeled on the successful [[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act]] passed by Parliament in 1988 which has proven a success in preserving railway heritage buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Parks Canada State of Protected Areas 
http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/pc/rpts/etat-state-2001/sec6/histor6_E.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designation process===
Under the bill the Minister responsible for the Parks Canada Agency sets criteria to designate a heritage lighthouse, based on historical, architectural, and community values. The Minister is guided by specific criteria and the advice of an advisory committee. Before a lighthouse that has been declared surplus by the government can be designated, a group must provide a written commitment to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to acquire it, protect is heritage characteristics and to make use of it in a manner that will be financially viable. Parks Canada published full specifics about the program on its Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/page03.aspx |title=Heritage Lighthouses of Canada - Evaluation and Designation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2 July 2015 |website=Parks Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection===
Renovations at a designated lighthouse must meet heritage building criteria established by the minister based on national and international standards for the conservation of heritage properties. An exception is made for renovations in emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements for the lighthouse's navigational role.
The heritage character of the lighthouse must still be protected even if a lighthouse is sold or transferred to another level of government. A heritage lighthouse may not be demolished unless "there is no reasonable alternative". An exception is made for demolitions in emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements. Both the sale and demolition of a designated lighthouse would require public consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/page03.aspx |title=Heritage Lighthouses of Canada - Evaluation and Designation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2 July 2015 |website=Parks Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Bills/392/public/S-215/S-215_1/s-215_text-e.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Bill in Parliament==
An Act To Protect Heritage Lighthouses was first introduced by the late Senator [[Mike Forrestall]] of Nova Scotia as a Private Member's Bill (S-21) in 2000. It was brought it forward three more times, as S-7, then as S-14, then as S-41 which was given Third Reading by the Senate on March 23, 2005. The House of Commons debated the bill in June 2005 in Second Reading and referred it to the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development for clause-by-clause review. The bill died on the [[Order Paper]] when the federal election of January 2006 was called. Following the death of Senator Forrestall in June 2006, the bill was re-introduced as Bill-S220 in October 2006 by Senator [[Pat Carney]] of British Columbia. The Bill was given Third Reading and passed by the Senate on December 14, 2006. 
[[File:Harbour range lighthouse, Southampton, ON.jpg|thumb|Harbour Range lighthouse, Saugeen Shores, Ontario, one of the first four designated under the Act (2012)]]

The bill was first sponsored in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament [[Gerald Keddy]]. It passed Second Reading on June 13, 2007 and was scheduled to be reviewed by the House of Commons Fisheries Committee in October 2007 before Third and Final Reading. However, the announcement on September 4 that Parliament would be prorogued in October put the bill back to the Senate where on October 30 Pat Carney re-introduced it as Bill S-215.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;Chamber=N&amp;StartList=A&amp;EndList=Z&amp;Session=15&amp;Type=0&amp;Scope=I&amp;query=5303&amp;List=stat LEGISINFO - The Library of Parliament's research tool for finding information on legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed Third Reading in the Senate on December 13, 2007 and was re-introduced in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament [[Larry Miller (Canadian politician)|Larry Miller]] where it passed 2nd Reading on March 11, 2008. The bill was referred to committee where an amendment were made to define lighthouse structures and limit the act to federally owned lighthouses. The Third and final Commons vote was made on May 1, 2008 followed by a Senate vote to approve the amendment which the bill passed on May 8. [[Royal Assent]] was given on May 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;Chamber=N&amp;StartList=A&amp;EndList=Z&amp;Session=15&amp;Type=0&amp;Scope=I&amp;query=5303&amp;List=stat LEGISINFO - The Library of Parliament's research tool for finding information on legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Bills/392/public/S-215/S-215_1/s-215_text-e.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act came into effect on May 29, 2010, two years after Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Chase "Bill A Beacon of Hope for Decaying Lighthouses", ''Globe and Mail'' May 9, 2008, p.

===Debate===
The bill enjoyed consistent multi-party support from its Conservative sponsors but also Liberals such as Newfoundland MP [[Scott Simms]] and New Democratic Party MP [[Peter Stoffer]] who withdrew his own private members bill to protect lighthouses in support of S-220.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/featured/current.html The Heritage Canada Foundation - Featured Heritage Buildings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513182532/http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/featured/current.html |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other MPs such as [[Catherine J. Bell|Catherine Bell]] from British Columbia welcomed an initiative to preserving a national landmark as a healthy alternative to contentious partisan issues of a minority Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catherinebellmp.ca/page/325 Press release: Budget “No”, Preserving Heritage Lighthouses “Yes” Says MP Catherine Bell | NDP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The only formal opposition was voiced by a Bloc Quebecois MP [[Raynald Blais]] who said he could not support the bill because it might mask federal neglect of other DFO responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard Vol. 141 No. 129 1st Session 39th Parliament March 27, 2007 http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=Hansard&amp;Doc=129&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2805041&amp;File=0#Int-1986764&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to regional lighthouse advocates such as the [[Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society]], the [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] was a consistent supporter noting that lighthouses need special protection because of the lack of federal legislation for any federal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/news/pdf/HeritageReportCardforCanada_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the broad public support for the bill, some federal departmental staff initially opposed the bill suggesting it could cost up to $384 million to upgrade all of Canada's lighthouses to heritage standards.&lt;ref&gt;Federal bill to protect lighthouses running out of time in Parliament, ''Macleans" June 9, 2007 Hannah Zitner Canadian press http://www.macleans.ca/canada/wire/article.jsp?content=n060908A&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the bill called these numbers inflated, pointing out that it assumes that every pieces of navigational equipment in the country, including hundreds of steel towers and floating buoys, would be designated whereas even the strongest proponents only anticipate the nomination of a select number of landmark lighthouses. They also noted that the bill leaves control of the number of designations, and any associated, costs, with the minister.&lt;ref&gt;Lighthouse Bill Protecting Our Lighthouses - The Icons of Canada's Maritime Heritage by Douglas Franklin {{cite web |url=http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/featured/current.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513182532/http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/featured/current.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and controversy==
[[File:Chantry Island Lighthouse after Renovations.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Chantry Island Lighthouse]], Ontario, one of the first lights to be nominated under the Act is not yet designated]]

Parks Canada assigned staff and set up a program for heritage lighthouses following the passage of the act. Beginning in May 2010 communities became eligible to nominate lighthouses for designation. Communities had two years to nominate lighthouses as nominations closed on June 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/index.aspx "Heritage Lighthouses of Canada" ''Parks Canada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805142228/http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/index.aspx |date=2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fall of 2010, 22 lighthouses had been nominated, mostly in Ontario including [[Chantry Island Lightstation Tower]], one of the first to be nominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewwaterfronthome.com/lightnouses.aspx Linda Mondoux, "Always Wanted to Own Your Own Lighthouse", My Waterfront Home.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; It has yet to be designated because ownership cannot be transferred from the federal government to the Town of [[Saugeen Shores]] due to the uncertainty created by First Nations land claims to islands in the Lake Huron basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schleich |first=Jennifer |date=5 June 2012 |title=Chantry Lighthouse transfer held up by land claim |url=http://www.shorelinebeacon.com/2012/06/05/chantry-lighthouse-transfer-held-up-by-land-claim |work=Shoreline Beacon |location=Saugeen Shores |access-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The move in June 2010 to dispose of almost all lighthouses in Canada, even operational lighthouses, caused controversy. Critics noted that as non-federal lighthouse are not covered by the Act, the move to disposal proposal essentially "emasculates" the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/news/new.html#jun10_10 "DFO Declares All Lighthouse Surplus Undermining Intention of Act", ''Canadian Heritage Foundation'' June 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups have pointed out that the Act is being used as a disposal mechanism for lighthouses contrary to its original intent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagebc.ca/blog/dfo-declares-all-lighthouses-surplus "DFO Declares ALL Lighthouses Surplus" ''BC Heritage Blog'' July 29, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics included the Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. In late 2010, Committee chair [[Bill Rompkey]] of Newfoundland and Labrador said the sell-off defeats the purpose of the act and called for the nomination process to be extended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://montrealgazette.com/Feds+lighthouse+sell+program+hits+dark+patch/4021047/story.html Amy Minsky, "Feds Lighthouse Sell-Off Program Hits Dark Patch", ''Montreal Gazette'', Dec. 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2015, 970 had been declared surplus; 348 of those were the subject of public petitions for preservation under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2015/05/29/future-of-canadas-lighthouses-to-be-revealed-soon/ "Fate of Canada’s lighthouses to be revealed soon", ''CBC News'', 29 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
The announcement required that any group that nominates a lighthouses must buy or take ownership of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2010/06/08/ns-lighthouses-surplus.html "976 Lighthouses Declared Surplus", ''CBC News'', June 9, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, according to the ''Chronicle Herald'', the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act "seeks to divest the structures to new owners".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1399117-three-lighthouses-in-atlantic-canada-granted-federal-heritage-status "Three Lighthouses in Atlantic Canada Granted Federal Heritage Status", ''Chronicle Herald'', 22 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1447783-nowns-a-tale-of-two-lighthouses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 90 lighthouses that had been designated under the Act as of September 2016, 42 were still being managed by the federal government and 48 were being managed by other owners, such as community groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1399117-three-lighthouses-in-atlantic-canada-granted-federal-heritage-status "Three Lighthouses in Atlantic Canada Granted Federal Heritage Status", ''Chronicle Herald'', 22 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage designation status== 
[[File:Originalcapespear.jpg|thumb|[[Cape Spear Lighthouse]], St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, designated 30 June 2016]]

The designation process has continued well beyond 2015. For example, a full 13 were protected in July 2016 under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. Subsequently, Marc Seguin of the non-profit group Save Our Lighthouses told [[Radio Canada]] that there were over 500 others that could be designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/07/07/parks-canada-designates-88-new-heritage-lighthouses/ |title=Parks Canada designates 88 heritage lighthouses |access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/government-of-canada-announces-new-heritage-lighthouse-designations-613406983.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/government-of-canada-announces-new-heritage-lighthouse-designations-613406983.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional two were protected in February 2017 for a total of 92, in eight provinces, as of that date. A full list of lighthouses protected to date is published (and updated as required) on the [[Parks Canada]] web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/pp-hl/page01 |title=Heritage Lighthouses of Canada |date=2017 |website=Parks Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibn Zafar al Siqilli''', ({{lang-ar|ابن ظفر الصقلي}}), or ({{lang-ar|احجة الدين أبو عبد الله محمد بن أبي محمد بن محمد بن ظفر الصقلي}}), or '''Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Abī Muḥammad Ibn Ẓafar al-Siqillī al-Makkī al-Mālikī''' (are among the several variants), was a [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] and Arab-Sicilian politician of the [[Normans|Norman]] period (1104 - 1170), and has come to be known in the West as "[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s Arab Precursor".

==Biography==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to be physically small and frail. His [[demonym]] 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in [[Sicily]], but the [[patronym]] 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in [[Mecca]], where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain.  He probably spent his youth in [[Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]], but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to [[Aleppo]] in 1146, where he taught at the [[Madrasa]] Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in [[Hamat]], in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt al-Rūmī]] referred to him as a ‘refined [[philologist]]’, and both [[Al-Dhahabi|Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī]] and [[Ibn Khallikan|Ibn Khallikān]] praised his scholarship and thought.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530190020000493 R. Hrair Dekmejian  &amp;  Adel Fathy Thabit  ''Machiavelli’s Arab Precursor: Ibn Zafar al-Siqillī'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ia801900.us.archive.org/5/items/WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan/Vol4Of4WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan.pdf Khallikan, ''Obituaries of Eminent Men              '', Vol.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Miniatures pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solwan, or Waters of Comfort===
''Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā'' ({{lang-ar|سلوان المطاع في عدوان الأتباع}}) (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt; When [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, '[[The Prince]]', to [[Lorenzo di Medici]] four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the [[Western world]].  He remained in relative obscurity even after [[Michele Amari]]'s [[Italian language|Italian]] translation appeared in 1851.  Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt;  At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, [[Gaetano Mosca]], wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's.  Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.

The treatise is a form  of [[Wisdom literature]] with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called '[[Mirrors for princes]]', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade.   Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of [[Damascus]] expelled by [[Nur Eddin]] - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53654">'''Inoculation theory''' was developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[William J. McGuire]] in 1961 to explain how [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[beliefs]] change, and more importantly, how to keep existing attitudes and beliefs consistent in the face of attempts to change them. Inoculation theory functions as a [[strategy]] to protect attitudes from change–to confer [[Psychological resistance|resistance]] to counter-[[Attitude (psychology)|attitudinal]] influences, whether such influences take the form of direct attacks or sustained pressures.

The [[theory]] posits that weak [[Counterargument|counterarguments]]–arguments that are easily refuted–generate resistance within the receiver, enabling them to maintain their beliefs in the face of a future, stronger, attack. Following exposure to weak counterarguments, the inoculation receiver will then seek out supporting information to further strengthen their threatened position. Finally, the held attitude or belief becomes resistant to a stronger attack, hence the medical analogy of a [[vaccine]].

==About==

Inoculation is a [[theory]] developed to strengthen existing attitudes and beliefs while building resistance to future counterarguments. For inoculation to be successful it is crucial that a threat (motivation for resistance) is imposed upon these existing ideas and refutational preemption (ability to build defenses against potential counterarguments) takes place after the inoculation. The argument that is presented through inoculation must be strong enough to initiate motivation to maintain current attitudes and beliefs, but weak enough that the receiver will refute the [[counterargument]] (Compton, 2013; McGuire, 1964). Inoculation has been proven successful through trials and research. This article highlights vital aspects of inoculation theory, however, it is not exhaustive–there is a large volume of quality research on the theory not mentioned. Finally, while numerous studies have tested and verified the efficacy of the inoculation process, there continues to be a need for refinement and elaboration.

Inoculation theory is used today as part of the suite of tools used by those engaged in shaping or manipulating [[public opinion]]. These contexts include: [[politics]] (e.g., Pfau et al., 1990; see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2013, for a review), [[health campaign]]s (e.g., Pfau &amp; VanBockern, 1994; see Compton, Jackson, &amp; Dimmock, 2016, for a review), [[marketing]] (e.g., Compton &amp; Pfau, 2004) and [[education]] (Compton, 2011), among others. (See Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, for a [[meta-analysis]], and Compton, 2013, for a narrative overview.)

The inoculation process is analogous to the medical [[inoculation]] process from which it draws its name; the [[analogy]] served as the inaugural exemplar for how inoculation confers resistance. As McGuire (1961) initially explained, medical inoculation works by exposing the body to a weakened form of a virus—strong enough to trigger a response (i.e., the production of [[antibodies]]), but not so strong as to overwhelm the body's resistance. Attitudinal inoculation works the same way: Expose the receiver to weakened counterarguments, triggering a process of counterargument which confers resistance to later, stronger persuasive messages. This process works like a metaphorical vaccination: the receiver becomes immune to attacking messages that attempt to change their attitudes or beliefs regarding the initial threat. Inoculation theory suggests that if one sends out messages with weak counterarguments, an individual can build immunity to those messages and strengthen their original attitudes. It uses a threat on initial beliefs to trigger a person's desire to fight against the threat, ultimately reinforcing their attitude.

==History==
William McGuire set out to conduct research “on ways of inducing resistance to persuasion, under the impression that while much experimental work was being done on factors that increased persuasive effectiveness, little was being done on ways of producing resistance to persuasion” (McGuire, 1964, p. 192). McGuire was motivated to study inoculation and persuasion as a result of the [[aftermath of the Korean War]]. Nine US [[prisoners of war]], when given the opportunity, elected to remain with their captors. Many assumed they were [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]], so McGuire and other [[social scientists]] turned to ways of conferring resistance to persuasion (Dewey, 2017). This was a change in [[wikt:extant|extant]] persuasion research, which was almost exclusively concerned with how to make messages more [[persuasive]], and not the other way around (Gass &amp; Seiter, 2003). 

The theory of inoculation was derived from previous research studying one-sided and two-sided messages. One-sided messages are supportive messages to strengthen existing attitudes, but with no mention of counterpositions. One-sided messages are frequently seen in [[political campaign]]s when a [[candidate]] denigrates his or her opponent through "[[Negative campaigning|mudslinging]]". This method is effective in reinforcing [[wikt:extant|extant]] attitudes of derision toward the opposition and support for the "mudslinging" candidate. If the audience supports the opposition, however, the attack message is ineffective. Two-sided messages present both counterarguments and [[refutations]] of those counterarguments. To gain [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] and [[source credibility]], a two-sided message must demonstrate the sender's position, then the opposition's position, followed by a refutation of the opposition's argument, then finally the sender's position again (Lumsdaine &amp; Janis, 1953).

Since its creation, the uses of inoculation theory have been expanded in the areas of health, political, educational and commercial messaging. When McGuire (1966a) created this theory, it was applied to social [[cliché]]s. This meant it was primarily used toward the attitudes that were rarely, if ever attacked by opposing forces. The early tests of inoculation theory were used on non-controversial issues, (e.g. brushing your teeth is good for you). Few refute that brushing one's teeth is a good habit, therefore external opposing arguments against tooth brushing would not change one's opinion, but it would strengthen support for brushing one's teeth (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010). Inoculation theory studies currently target less popular or common attitudes, such as whether one should buy a [[Apple Mac|Mac]] or a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[Personal computer|PC]] [[computer]] or if one should support [[gay marriage]].  Implementing inoculation theory in studies of contemporary social issues (from [[mundane]] to [[controversial]] [[social issues]]), the variety and resurgence of studies using inoculation theory helps bolster the effectiveness and [[utility]] of the theory and provides support that it can be used to strengthen and/or predict attitudes.

McGuire led a series of experiments assessing inoculation's [[efficacy]] and adding nuance to our understanding for how it works (for a review, see Compton, 2013; Compton &amp; Pfau, 2005). Early studies (e.g., McGuire &amp; Papageorgis, 1961) limited testing of inoculation theory to [[cultural]] truisms, or [[beliefs]] accepted without consideration (e.g., people should brush their teeth daily). Later development of the theory extended inoculation to more [[controversial]] and contested topics in the contexts of politics (see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2013), health (see Compton, Jackson, &amp; Dimmock, 2015), marketing, and contexts in which people have different pre-existing attitudes, such as climate change.&lt;ref name=inoculation2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008 |title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change |journal=Global Challenges |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1600008 |year=2017 |last1=van der Linden |first1=Sander |last2=Leiserowitz |first2=Anthony |last3=Rosenthal |first3=Seth |last4=Maibach |first4=Edward }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has also been applied in education to help prevent substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drchrustowski.com/TheSocialPsychologyofAdolescentSubstanceAbuse.pdf|title=The Social Psychology of Adolescent Substance Abuse|format=PPT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325034118/http://www.drchrustowski.com/TheSocialPsychologyofAdolescentSubstanceAbuse.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, more recent research has examined inoculation's effects on targets besides attitudes, including task self-efficacy (Jackson, Compton, Whiddett, Anthony, &amp; Dimmock, 2015). Other work has confirmed that inoculation's efficacy can be boosted with other persuasion processes, like reactance (Miller et al., 2013).

==Explanation==
Inoculation theory states that to prevent persuasion it is necessary to strengthen preexisting attitudes, beliefs, or opinions. First, the receiver must be made aware of the potential vulnerability of an existing position (e.g., attitude, belief). This establishes threat and initiates defenses to future attacks. The idea is that when a weak argument is presented in the inoculation message, processes of refutation or other means of protection will prepare for stronger arguments later. It is critical that the attack is strong enough to keep the receiver defensive, but weak enough to not actually change those preexisting ideas. This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts. The more active the receiver becomes in his or her defense the more it will strengthen their own attitudes, beliefs, or opinions (McGuire, 1964).

===Key components===
There are four basic key components to successful inoculation: threat, [[refutational preemption]], delay, and involvement. The first is threat, which provides motivation to protect one's attitudes or beliefs (Pfau, 1997a). Threat is a product of the presence of counterarguments in an inoculation message and/or an explicit forewarning of an impending challenge to an existing belief (see Compton &amp; Ivanov, 2012). The message receiver must interpret that a message is threatening and recognize that there is a reason to fight to maintain and strengthen their opinion. If the receiver of an opposing message does not recognize that a threat is present, they will not feel the need to start defending their position and therefore will not change their attitude or strengthen their opinion (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Compton and Ivanov (2012) found that participants who had been forewarned of an attack–i.e. threat–but not given the appropriate tools to combat the attack were more resistant than the control group. In this case, the simple act of forewarning of an attack was enough to resist the counterattitudinal persuasion.

The second component, refutational preemption, is the [[cognitive]] part of the process. It is the ability to activate one's own argument for future defense and strengthen their existing attitudes through counterarguing (Pfau, 1997). Scholars have also explored whether other resistance processes might be at work, including affect. Refutational preemption provides specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change. This aids in the inoculation process by giving the message receiver a chance to argue with the opposing message. It shows the message receiver that their attitude is not the only attitude or even the right attitude, creating a threat to their beliefs. This is beneficial because the receiver will get practice in defending their original attitude, therefore strengthening it. This is important in fighting off future threats of opposing messages and helps to ensure that the message will not affect their original stance on the issues (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Refutational preemption acts as the weak [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in the metaphor. By injecting the weakened virus–the opposing opinion–into a receiver, this prompts the receiver to strengthen their position, enabling them to fight off the opposing threat. By the time the body processes the virus–the counterattack–the receiver will have learned how to eliminate the threat. In the case of messaging, if the threatening message is weak or unconvincing, a person can reject the message and stick with their original stance on the matter. By being able to reject threatening messages a person builds strength of their belief and every successful threatening message that they can encounter their original opinions only get stronger (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;285). Recent research has studied the presence and function of word-of-mouth communication, or post-inoculation talk (see Compton &amp; Pfau, 2009), following exposure to inoculation messages (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2015).

Delay is the next element that is necessary in the inoculation process. There has been much debate on whether there is a certain amount of time necessary between inoculation and further attacks on a persons' attitude that will be most effective in strengthening that person's attitude. McGuire (1961) suggested that delay was necessary strengthening a person's attitude and since then many scholars have found evidence to back that idea up. There are also scholars on the other side who suggest that too much of a delay lessens the strengthening effect of inoculation. With this being said, it has been revealed that the effect of inoculation can still be significant weeks or even months after initial introduction or the treatment showing that it does produce somewhat long-lasting effects (Banas &amp; Rains, 2010).

Involvement is the final element of the inoculation process. Pfau, et al. (1997a) defined involvement as "the importance or salience of an attitude object for a receiver" and is “among the most important and widely employed concepts in the scholarly literature on persuasion” (p. 190). Involvement is critical; an individual's involvement with an issue determines how effective the inoculation process will be, if at all. If an individual does not have a vested interest in the subject, they will not perceive a threat and, consequently, will not feel the need to defend and strengthen their original opinion, rendering the inoculation process ineffective.

===Applications===
Research during the past two decades has revealed numerous real-world applications of inoculation theory. The field of Public Relations is the perfect place for the inoculation theory to be used because the field itself is meant to act to the public, their opinions, and their actions. It is especially useful with an audience who already has an opinion on a brand. Inoculation theory is the perfect way to convince already faithful customers that they are making the right choice in trusting your company and to keep the customer coming back in the future. For example, Apple and their "[[Get A Mac]]" campaign. This campaign did a great job of following the inoculation theory in targeting those who already preferred Mac computers. The series of ads pit out in the duration of the campaign had a similar theme; they directly compared Macs and PCs. Inoculation theory applies here as these commercials are more than likely aimed toward Apple users. These ads are effective because the Apple users already prefer Mac computers and they unlikely to change their minds. This comparison creates refutational preemption, showing Macs may not be the only viable options on the market. The TV ads throw in a few of the positive advantages that PCs have over Macs, but by the end of every commercial they reiterate the fact that the Mac is ultimately the superior product for consumers. This reassures viewers that their opinion is still right and that Macs are in fact better than PCs. The inoculation theory in these ads keep Mac users coming back for Apple products and may even have them coming back sooner for the bigger and better products that Apple is releasing. That last part is especially important in a field like technology because it is continually changing and something new is always being pushed out onto the shelves.

An example of inoculation theory usage in politics are present in studies indicating that it is possible to inoculate political supporters of a candidate in a campaign against the influence of an opponent's attack ads (Pfau &amp; Burgoon, 1988); citizens against the corrosive influence of soft-money-sponsored political attack ads on democratic values (Pfau, M., Park, D., Holbert, R. L., &amp; Cho, J., 2001); citizens of fledgling democracies against the spiral of silence which can thwart the expression of minority views (Lin, W. K., &amp; Pfau, M., 2007); commercial brands against the influence of competitors' comparative ads (Pfau, 1992a); corporations against the damage to credibility and image that can occur in crisis settings (Dawar, N., &amp; Pillutla, M. M., 2000); and young adolescents against influences of peer pressure, which can lead to smoking, underage drinking, and other harmful behaviors (Godbold, L. C., &amp; Pfau, M., 2000).

===Refutational same and refutational different===
While there are many studies that have been conducted comparing different treatments of inoculation, there is one specific comparison that is mentioned throughout various studies. This is the comparison between what is known as refutational same and refutational different messages. A refutational same message is an inoculation treatment that refutes specific potential counterarguments that will appear in the subsequent persuasion message, while refutational different treatments are refutations that are not the same as those present in the impending persuasive message  (Pfau et al., 1990). Pfau and his colleagues (1990) developed a study during the [[United States presidential election|1988 United States presidential election]]. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were claiming that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate was known to be lenient when it came to the issue of crime. The researchers developed a refutational same message that stated that while the Democratic candidate was in favor of tough sentences, merely tough sentences could not reduce crime. The refutational different message expanded on the candidate's platform and his immediate goals if he were to be elected. The study showed comparable results between the two different treatments. Importantly, as McGuire and others had found previously, inoculation was able to confer resistance to arguments that were not specifically mentioned in the inoculation message.

==Relevant research==

===Political campaigning===
Compton and Ivanov (2013) offer a comprehensive review of political inoculation scholarship and outline new directions for future work.

Sample studies include:

Pfau and some of his colleagues examined inoculation through the use of direct mail during the 1988 presidential campaign.  The researchers were specifically interested in comparing inoculation and post hoc refutation. Post hoc refutation is another form of building resistance to arguments, however, instead of building resistance prior to future arguments, like inoculation, it attempts to restore original beliefs and attitudes after the counterarguments have been made. Results of the research reinforced prior conclusions that refutational same and different treatments both increase resistance to attacks. More important, results also indicated inoculation was superior to post hoc refutation when attempting to protect original beliefs and attitudes (Pfau et al., 1990).

===Health===
Much of the research conducted in health is attempting to create campaigns that will encourage people to stop unhealthy behaviors (e.g. getting people to stop smoking or prevention of teen alcoholism). Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) reviewed studies where inoculation theory was applied to health-related messaging. There are many inoculation studies with the intent to inoculate children and teenagers to prevent them from smoking, doing drugs or drinking alcohol. Much of the research shows that targeting at a young age can help them resist peer pressure in high school or college.

Godbold and Pfau (2000) used sixth graders from two different schools and applied inoculation theory as a defense against peer pressure to drinking alcohol. They hypothesized that a normative message, a message tailored around what the social norms are, would be more effective than an informative message. An informative message is a message tailored around giving individuals information pieces. In this case, the information was why drinking alcohol is bad.  The second hypothesis was that subjects who receive a threat two weeks later will be more resistant than those receiving an immediate attack. The results supported the first hypothesis partially. The normative message created higher resistance from the attack, but was not necessarily more effective. The second hypothesis was also not supported; therefore, the time lapse did not create further resistance for teenagers against drinking. One major outcome from this study was the resistance created by utilizing a normative message.

In another study conducted by Duryea (1983), the results were far more supportive of the theory. The study also attempted to find the message to use for educational training to help prevent teen drinking and driving. The teen subjects were given resources to combat attempts to persuade them to drink and drive or to get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The subjects were: 1) shown a film; 2) participated in question and answer; 3) role playing exercises; and 4) a slide show. The results showed that a combination of the four methods of training was effective in combating persuasion to drink and drive or get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The trained group was far more prepared to combat the persuasive arguments.

Additionally, Parker, Ivanov, and Compton (2012) found that inoculation messages can be an effective deterrent against pressures to engage in unprotected sex and binge drinking—even when only one of these issues is mentioned in the health message.

Another study by Pfau, et al. (1992) examined the role of inoculation when attempting to prevent adolescents from smoking. One of the main goals of the study was to examine longevity and persistence of inoculation. They took a group of elementary school students in [[South Dakota]] and had the students watch a video warning them of future pressures to smoke. In the first year, resistance was highest among those with low [[self-esteem]] (Pfau et al., 1992). At the end of the second year, students in the group showed more attitudinal resistance to smoking than they did previously (Pfau &amp; Van Bockern 1994). Importantly, the study and its follow-up demonstrate the long-lasting effects of inoculation treatments.

Other recent areas of study include vaccination safety. Wong and Harrison (2014) studied 212 female students and their attitudes about the HPV vaccine. They found that inoculation messages about HPV helped build resistance to messages that attacked the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. Additionally, Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) discussed possibilities of further research. One topic was on the preparation of possible health concerns that new parents may not be expecting. For example, benefits of breastfeeding, sleep deprivation and post-partum depression.

One area that has been heavily researched since the development of the theory is the prevention of smoking. These studies have mainly focused on preventing youth smokers–inoculation seems to be most effective in young children. Grover (2011) researched the effectiveness of the [[Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)|"truth" anti-smoking campaign]] on smokers and non-smokers. Grover divided the two groups to show that inoculation works differently when the behavior is already being exercised versus the behavior being non-existent. In the first hypothesis Grover predicted that exposure to the "truth" ads would result in negative attitudes towards smoking after being exposed to pro-smoking advertisements. That hypothesis was supported by the data. In the second hypothesis, exposure to "truth" ads results in increased aversion to tobacco industry retail products, the results showed the contrary. Exposure to "truth" ads reduces aversion to tobacco branded products. The other observation made here was that the greater the exposure to pro-smoking ads, the higher the aversion to tobacco retail products. This observation contradicts hypothesis H2c and hypothesis H3. In H3, the prediction was that the aversion towards tobacco industry retail products would dictate the exposure to "truth" ads and attitudes towards tobacco companies. This data was taken from a combined sample of both smokers and non-smokers. When Grover split the data between the two groups all the original hypotheses were supported, except H2c. Those results mirrored the results of the pooled data. What Grover demonstrated was that the initial attitude plays a major role in the ability to inoculate an individual.
 
Future studies in the area of health can be extremely beneficial to communities. Some areas that are currently being researched can possibly help with present-day issues (e.g., inoculation-based strategies for addiction intervention to assist sober individuals from relapsing). Other areas for future studies include, promoting healthy eating habits, exercising, breastfeeding and creating positive attitude towards mammograms (Ivanov, 2017). An area that has been underdeveloped is mental health awareness. With the number of young adults and teens committing suicide due to bullying this can be an area where inoculation messages could be effective. McGuire (1961) used a medical analogy to initially describe his theory. Unsurprisingly, inoculation strategies can be most effective when combined with health issues.

===Marketing===
Inoculation theory research, as applied to advertising and marketing, are primarily focused on promoting healthy lifestyles with the help of a product or for a specific company's goal.

Shortly after McGuire published his development on inoculation theory, Szybillo and Heslin (1973) applied the concepts that McGuire used in the health industry to advertising and marketing campaigns. They sought to provide answers for advertisers marketing a controversial product or topic: if an advertiser knew the product or campaign would cause an attack, what would be the best advertising strategy? Would they want to refute the arguments or reaffirm their claims? (Szybill and Heslin, 1973)

Szybillo and Heslin (1973) sought to test five hypotheses: 1) to reaffirm or refute the arguments is better than not addressing, 2) refuting the same counterarguments will be more effective than supportive defense, 3) refutational defense is better than supportive defense, 4) over a long period, refutational defense is more effective than supportive defenses, and 5) high credibility sources are more effective than low credibility. The controversial topic in the study was: "Inflatable air bags should be installed as passive safety devices in all new cars."

Szybillo and Heslin (1973) tested four advertisement strategies: defense, refutational-same, refutational-different and supportive. They also manipulated the time of the counterargument attack. Some subjects received the attack message 30 minutes after and the other group three days later. The results confirmed the first hypothesis that a reaffirmation or refutation approach is better than not addressing the attack. The second hypothesis was also confirmed with the data that refuting the counterargument is more effective than supportive defense. The third hypothesis was confirmed as well, though the mean for refutational-different posttreatment was not much greater than for supportive posttreatment. In this study the time lapse was not significantly impactful nor was the credibility of the source. Thus, hypothesis four and five were not supported.

In 2006, a jury awarded Martin Dunson and Lisa Jones, the parents of one-year-old Marquis Matthew Dunson, $5 million for the death of their son. Dunson and Jones sued [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], the makers of Infant's [[Tylenol (brand redirect)|Tylenol]] claiming that there were not enough warnings regarding the dosage of [[acetaminophen]] (Daly, 2006).

What resulted was a Johnson &amp; Johnson campaign that encouraged parents to practice proper dosage procedures (Veil and Kent, 2008). In a review of the campaign by Veil and Kent (2008), they breakdown the message of the campaign utilizing the basic concepts of inoculation theory. They theorize that Johnson &amp; Johnson used inoculation to alter the negative [[perception]] of their product. The campaign began running prior to the actual verdict, thus the timing seemed suspicious.

A primary contention made by Veil and Kent (2008) was that the intentions of Johnson &amp; Johnson were not to convey safety guidelines for consumers, but to change how the consumer might respond to further lawsuits on [[overdose]]. The inoculation strategy used by Johnson &amp; Johnson, per Veil and Kent, is evident in their campaign script: "Some people think if you have a really bad headache, you should take extra medicine." The authors state the term "some people" is referring to the party suing the company. The commercial also used the Vice President of Sales for Tylenol to deliver a message, who may be considered a [[Source credibility|credible source]].

In 1995, Burgoon et al. published empirical findings on issue/advocacy advertising campaigns like the one Johnson &amp; Johnson executed. Most, if not all, of these types of advertising campaigns utilize inoculation to create the messages. Burgoon et al. (1995) posited that the use of inoculation strategies for these types of campaigns should be utilized to enhance the corporations' credibility and aide in maintaining the existing consumer attitude. This strategy should not be used to change consumer attitudes. Based on the analysis of previous research Burgoon et al. concluded issue/advocacy advertising is most effective for reinforcing support and avoid potential slippage in the attitudes of supporters. 
Based on previous publications they looked to test three hypotheses. The first was that issue/advocacy advertisements work to inoculate against counterattitudinal attacks. Next, issue/advocacy advertisements work to protect the source credibility. Lastly, [[conservatives]] are more likely to be inoculated by issue/advocacy messages. They use [[Mobil Oil]]'s issue/advocacy campaign to test the hypotheses.

The first hypothesis was supported by the data. There was a significant effect provided by inoculation.  Additionally, H1 showed that issue/advocacy inoculation messages and attack messages vary in effectiveness depending on the content. The result was also noted in the results of H2, which were also supported by the results. Finally, the results indicated that political views play a role in the effectiveness of the campaigns. Thus, confirming H3, that conservatives are easier to inoculate. They also posed a research question regarding the impact of [[gender]] on inoculation effectiveness in issue/advocacy campaigns. The conclusion was made that females are more likely to be inoculated with these types of campaigns. An additional observation made by Burgoon et. al (1995) was that the type of content used in these campaigns contributed to the campaigns success. The further the advertisement was from "direct self-benefit" the greater the inoculation effect was on the audience (Burgoon, et al., 1995).

It took quite some time for inoculation theory to be applied to marketing, because of the many limitations (Lessne and Didow, 1987). Lessne and Didow (1987) reviewed publications about inoculation application to marketing campaigns. They note that, at the time, the closest to true marketing context was Hunt's 1973 study on the Chevron campaign.

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] made a statement that Chevron had deceived consumers on the effectiveness of their gas additive F-310. The FTC was going to conduct a corrective advertising campaign to disclose the information. In response to that, Chevron ran a print campaign to try and combat the anticipated FTC campaign. The double page advertisement read, "If every motorist used Chevron with F-310 for 2000 miles, air pollutants would be reduced by thousands of tons in a single day. The Federal Trade Commission doesn't think that's significant." Hunt used this real-life message as an inoculation treatment in his research (Lessne and Didow, 1987).

He used the corrective campaign by the FTC as the attack on the positive attitude toward Chevron. The results indicated that a supportive treatment offered less resistance than a refutational treatment. The other discovery was that when an inoculative treatment is received, but no attack is followed there is a drop in attitude. One of the major limitations in this study was that Hunt did not allow a time elapse between the treatment and the attack. Which is a major element from McGuire's original theory (McGuire, 1961). Since this publication, there has been more research conducted in marketing and advertising as well. The future applications in marketing are far more promising than they were in 1987.

Other more recent studies include:

# Compton and Pfau (2004) extended inoculation theory into the realm of credit card marketing targeting college students. They wondered if inoculation could help protect college students against dangerous levels of [[credit card debt]] and/or help convince them to increase their efforts to pay down any existing [[debt]]. The results were encouraging: Inoculation seemed to protect students' healthy attitudes about debt and some of their behavioral intentions. Further, Compton and Pfau found some evidence that those who received the inoculation treatment were more likely to talk to their friends and family about issues of credit card debt.
# Ivanov, Parker, and Compton (2011) proposed inoculation as a means for helping [[consumers]] work through [[Buyer's remorse|post-purchase dissonance]].

===Cyber security===
Treglia and Delia (2017) apply inoculation theory to [[cyber security]]; people are susceptible to electronic or physical tricks, scams or misrepresentations that may lead to deviating from security procedures and practices, opening the operator, organization or system to exploits, malware, theft of data or disruption of systems and services. Inoculation in this area improves peoples resistance to such attacks, examples and directions for future work are provided.

===Psychological reactance===
Recent studies have approached inoculation by incorporating [[Reactance theory|psychological reactance theory]] (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981) as a means to enhance resistance outcomes through inoculation theory's two key components: threat and refutational preemption.

Miller, et al. (2013) focused their study on [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|emerging adults]] and their reactance to persuasive appeals. Research has demonstrated that this population is in a transitional stage in life (Voyer et al., 2005) and are more likely to defend their behavioral freedoms if they feel others are attempting to control their behavior (Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006). Populations in transitional stages rely on source credibility as a major proponent of cognitive processing and message acceptance. If the message is [[explicit knowledge|explicit]] and threatens their perceived [[freedoms]], transitional-stage populations will most likely derogate the source and dismiss the message. Two important needs for reactance to a threatened freedom from an emerging adult population is [[Vested interest (communication theory)|immediacy and vested interest]] (Crano, 1995). Their study discusses how emerging adults need to believe their behavioral freedoms, for which they have vestedness, are being threatened and that the threat exists in real time with almost immediate consequences. Threats that their perceived freedoms will be eliminated or minimized increases motivation to restore that freedom or possibly engage in the threatened behavior to reinforce their autonomy and control of their attitudes and actions. The study also surmises that threat does not necessarily need anger to motivate counterargumentation and simply attempting to provoke anger through manipulation is limited as a technique of gauging negative cognitions. Miller, et al. (2013) also consider refutational preemption as motivation for producing initial counterarguments and provocation of [[dissension]] when contemplating the attack message (Miller et al., 2013). The main focus of this study is to determine how to improve the effectiveness of the inoculation process by evaluating and generating reactance to a threatened freedom by manipulating explicit and implicit language and its intensity. While most inoculation studies focus on avoiding reactance, or at the very least, minimizing the impact of reactance on behaviors, in contrast, Miller, et al. (2013) chose to manipulate reactance by designing messages to enhance resistance and counterarguing output.

They posit seven hypotheses in this study. H1 aims to discover if reactance-enhanced messages warning of a potential attitudinal threat negative affect and cognitions toward the attack message and its source. H2 considers if reactance-enhanced messages increase more counterarguments for the subject and a decrease in attitude change. H3 ponders if reactance-enhanced messages also result in more source derogation in terms of credibility and an increase in negative affect toward the source. These first three hypotheses consider the appraisal process of reactance. The final four hypotheses regard the impact of language and intensity as potentially more threatening (i.e. generating more resistance to the message because of increased counterattitudinal output and source derogation.

Their methods involve three phases. Phase 1 assesses the attitudes of their participants regarding four topics: "legalization of marijuana, gun control legislation, legalization of gambling, and restriction of television violence" (Miller et al., 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;135). Phase 2 presented an inoculation message relative to each participant's measured attitudes from Phase 1. The participants were divided into two groups, including the inoculation group and the control group. The questionnaire the participants received also gauged both their perceived threat and affect toward the attack messages. In Phase 3, each group was also given an attack message using either high-controlling or low-controlling language, and again, to evaluate the levels of perceived threat and affect.

The study concluded that support existed for all hypotheses. The results of their experimentation yielded the understanding that inoculation coupled with reactance-enhanced messages leads to "stronger resistance effects" (p.&amp;nbsp;148). Consistent with the medical analogy of inoculation theory, Miller, et al. (2013) liken reactance-enhanced messages to a "booster shot," increasing the success of the inoculation. Another unique feature of the study is examining low-controlling language versus high-controlling language and its impact on affect and source credibility.

Similarly, Miller, et al. (2007) utilizes psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm &amp; Brehm, 1981) to avoid or eliminate source derogation and message rejection. In this study, their focus is instead Brehm's concept of restoration. Some of their ideas deal with low reactance and whether it can lead to more positive outcomes and if behavioral freedoms can be restored once threatened. As discussed in Miller, et al. (2013), this study ponders whether individuals know they have the behavioral freedom that is being threatened and whether they feel they are worthy of that freedom. This idea also ties into the emerging adult population of the above study and its affirmation that individuals in transitional stages will assert their threatened behavior freedoms (Voyer et al., 2005; Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006; Miller et al. 2007; Miller et al., 2013).

Miller, et al. (2007) sought to determine how effective explicit and implicit language is at mitigating reactance. Particularly, restoration of freedom is a focus of this study, and gauging how concrete and abstract language informs an individual's belief that he or she has a choice. Some participants were given a persuasive appeal related to health promotion with a following postscripted message designed to remind them they have a choice as a method of restoring the participants' freedom. Using concrete language proved more effective at increasing the possibilities of message acceptance and source credibility. This study is relevant to inoculation research in that it lends credence to Miller, et al. (2013), which transparently incorporates psychological reactance theory in conjunction with inoculation theory to improve the quality of persuasive appeals in the future.

===Postinoculation talk===
Following Compton and Pfau's (2009) research on postinoculation talk, Ivanov, et al. (2012) explore how cognitive processing could lead to talk with others after receiving an inoculation message in which threat exists. The authors found that message processing leads to postinoculation talk which could potentially lead to stronger resistance to attack messages. Further, postinoculation talk acts virally, spreading inoculation through talk with others on issues that involve negative cognitions and affect. In previous research, the assumption that talk was [[subvocal]] (existing only [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonally]]) was prevalent, without concern for the impact of vocal talk with other individuals. Ivanov, et al. (2012) deems vocal talk important to the incubation process.

Their study concluded that individuals who receive an inoculation message that contains threat will talk to others about the message and talk more frequently than individuals who do not receive an inoculation message. Additionally, the act of postinoculation talk bolsters their attitudes and increases resistance to the message as well as increasing the likelihood that talk will generate a potentially viral effect–spreading inoculation to others through the act of vocal talk (Ivanov et al., 2012).

'''''Inquisitor''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by Czech company [[Cinemax (video game developer)|Cinemax]]. The game was originally released in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/article/302/reviews-inquisitor |accessdate=May 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121022000/http://www.justadventure.com/article/302/reviews-inquisitor |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was in development for almost 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/inquisitor/ |title=Inquisitor – Databáze-her.cz |publisher=Databaze-her.cz |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more years were needed to translate the game into English and it was released on [[GOG.com]] on September 5, 2012. On June 1, 2013, ''Inquisitor'' was greenlit on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/765/announcements/detail/1605811459513742352 |title=Group Announcements :: |publisher=Steamcommunity.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Inquisitor plays similarly to ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' series, being a top-down role-playing game. Firstly, the player chooses his character from the classes of priest, [[paladin]] or thief. The player then travels throughout the world, fighting against monsters along the way. The player also investigates crimes against God and the king by finding evidence against the suspect, after which they may be arrested, tortured, and, after conviction, burned at the stake. It is, however, possible to mistakenly arrest innocents should false evidence be found.

Evidence in ''Inquisitor'' includes the testimony of other characters in the game, as well as items found at location where the crime was committed. It is also possible to draw conclusions from seemingly unrelated information. Found evidence is recorded in character's notebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inquisitor-rpg.com/?page=basics |title=Inquisitor (RPG) |publisher=Inquisitor-rpg.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has an estimated playing time of 100&amp;nbsp;hours. Inquisitor includes more than 200 weapons, 80 spells and 7 types of magic, alongside over 90 types of monster to combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenlitgaming.com/inquisitor-preview/ |title=Inquisitor Preview |publisher=Greenlitgaming.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The setting of Inquisitor is the fictional kingdom of Utherst, in which the omens of the Prophecy of Saint [[Ezekiel]] have started to appear, foretelling the [[Apocalypse|end of the world]]. The game chronicles the efforts of the titular Inquisition to fight against [[heresy]] in light of this. The main character Maxmilian Conti&lt;ref&gt;Protagonist's name is selectable but he is named Maxmilian Conti in novel and it is also the custom name in the original game.&lt;/ref&gt; is an Inquisitor who is sent to the town of Hillbrandt to investigate the murder of a local merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/v-ceske-rpg-inquisitor-budete-upalovat-kacire-fov-/Recenze.aspx?c=A091209_160245_bw-pc-recenze_prq |title=V české RPG Inquisitor budete upalovat kacíře - iDNES.cz |publisher=Bonusweb.idnes.cz |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxmilian finds out that the merchant was murdered by Linda von Callagan a wife of a local noble. At first she refuses her guilt but later she confesses due to fear of murder by bishop Vallarian a highest ranking Inquisitor in area. It is revealed that Vallarian is a plotted all problems in Hillbrandt to retrieve an artifact found by the murdered merchant. He used the artifact to summon a demon Arthamon. Vallarian is executed but there are clues indicating that he was a member of an ancient cult trying to bring an apocalypse.

Maxmilian leaves Hillbrandt and continues his investigation in Glatzburg. There he seeks a help of a local priest Trevorius. When he gains his trust Trevorius is murdered. In the end the protagonist tracks down another member of the cult who is no less than Cardinal Truncquillius. Truncquillius is also arrested an executed but not before he summons a demon Bafomet to the world.

Maxmilian then goes to Alvaron, the capital of the kingdom. He gets there just a short time after death of the king. His investigation leads to his fight to all summoned demons and finding the actual leader of the cult - archbishop Lauentius. When he finds him, player can choose if he wants to join the cult or to stop it.

If he joins the cult, Laurentius is killed by a knight who shows up and attacks the player. When the knight is killed player has to defeat Archangel Gabriel. Player then revives the crown prince Louis who has to create a new world order.

If player decides to stop the cult he kills Laurentius but has to fight a fallen angel Azrael. When he defeats Azrael, the crown prince Louis is revived and becomes the new king. In outro it is revealed that pope sent a crusade against the kingdom and Louis has to lead his armies to defend the kingdom. Conti's fate is left unknown.

== Development ==
''Inquisitor'' was in development since 1999 when a company ''Wooden Dragon'' was founded. The project was financially supported by Cinemax. The game is inspired by [[Umberto Eco|Umberto Eco's]] works such as [[The Name of the Rose]]. The original release date was scheduled for 2001. In 2001 the game was delayed to 2002. The new release date wasn't scheduled.&lt;ref name=Nadejne&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiriloviczova|first=Alena|title=nquisitor - nadějné české RPG|url=http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/inquisitor-nadejne-ceske-rpg-diu-/Preview.aspx?c=A010727_inquisitorp_bw|work=Bonusweb|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GamesIZ&gt;{{cite web|title=Izometrická RPG Inquisitor od českých tvůrců|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/izometricka-rpg-inquisitor-od-ceskych-tvurcu-22976|work=Games.cz|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podporte&gt;{{cite web|last=Macura|first=Lukáš|title=Podpořte české hry na Greenlight + něco o vývoji RPG Inquisitor|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/podporte-ceske-hry-na-greenlight-neco-o-vyvoji-rpg-inquisitor-60567|work=Games.cz|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end the development took 10 years and the game was finally released in November 2009. Developers started to focus on fixing bugs and translation to English. In 2012 the English version was released on [[GOG.com|GOG]] and in 2013 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="Podporte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Po deseti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Po deseti letech přichází český Inquisitor|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/preview/po-deseti-letech-prichazi-cesky-inquisitor-35397|work=Games.cz|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kovář|first=Martin|title=Inquisitor is available on Steam now!|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/92965329/1375897116|work=Steam Greenlight|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The game received average to positive reviews. It was praised for its story, atmosphere and scope, but was criticized for the quality of its [[graphics]] and its high difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/inquisitor |title=Inquisitor for PC Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hodnoceniher.cz/pc/rpg/inquisitor.html |title=Inquisitor - recenze, hodnocení |publisher=Hodnoceniher.cz |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible sequel ==
When Steam started its concepts feature in October 2012, Cinemax made a concept for ''Inquisitor 2''. They asked players what would they expect from next project, giving the choice of a classic role-playing like ''Inquisitor'', an [[adventure game]] with role-playing elements, or a different type of a role-playing game than ''Inquisitor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Homola|first=Adam|title=Steam Greenlight má nově Koncepty, nevyžadují $100 poplatek|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/steam-greenlight-ma-nove-koncepty-nevyzaduji-100-poplatek-61022|work=Games.cz|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers also released ''Inquisitor: Renesance zla'' (''Inquisitor: The Renaissance of Evil''), a novel that serves as a sequel to the game. It is set 200 years after Inquisitor game and follows Maxmilian Conti, the protagonist of the game, who is summoned from hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smutný|first1=Aleš|title=České RPG Inquisitor se vrací v románu Renesance zla|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/ceske-rpg-inquisitor-se-vraci-v-romanu-renesance-zla-248267|website=Games.cz|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''It Conquered the World''''' is an [[Independent film|independently made]] 1956 American [[black-and-white]] [[science fiction film]], produced and directed by [[Roger Corman]], starring [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Beverly Garland]], and [[Sally Fraser]]. ''It Conquered the World'' was released theatrically by [[American International Pictures]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The She-Creature]]''.&lt;ref name="senses" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren 1982{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''It Conquered the World'' concerns an alien creature from the planet [[Venus]] that secretly wants to take control of the Earth. The creature makes radio contact with a disillusioned human scientist, who agrees to help because the scientist believes such an alien intervention will bring peace and save a doomed humanity from itself.
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Plot==
Dr. Tom Anderson (Van Cleef), an embittered scientist, has made contact with a [[Venus in fiction|Venusian]] creature, while using his [[radio transmitter]]. The alien's secret motivation is to take complete control of the Earth by enslaving humanity using [[mind control]] devices; the alien claims it only wants to bring peace to our troubled world by eliminating all emotions. Anderson agrees to help the creature and even intends to allow it to assimilate his wife (Garland) and friend Dr. Nelson (Graves).

The Venusian then disrupts all electric power on Earth, including motor vehicles, leaving Dr. Nelson to resort to riding a bicycle.

After avoiding a flying bat-like creature which carries the mind control device, Dr. Nelson returns home to find his wife newly assimilated. She then attempts to force his own assimilation using another bat-creature in her possession, and he ends up being forced to kill her in self-defense. By then, the only people who are still free from the Venusian's influence are Nelson, Anderson, Anderson's wife and a group of army soldiers on station in the nearby woods.

Nelson finally persuades the paranoid Anderson that he has made a horrible mistake in blindly trusting the Venusian's motives, allying himself with a creature bent on world domination. When they discover Tom's wife has taken a rifle to the alien's cave in order to kill it, they hurriedly follow her, but the creature kills Claire Anderson before the two doctors can rescue her. Finally, seeing the loss of everything he holds dear, Dr. Anderson viciously attacks the Venusian by holding a [[blowtorch]] to the creature's face; Anderson dies at the alien's hand as it expires.

==Production==
''It Conquered the World'' was written by [[Lou Rusoff]], but before being completed, Rusoff's brother died and he had to leave for Canada. Corman then called in Charles Griffith to do a final rewrite, two days before filming began; Griffith, however, didn't want his name to be credited on screen.&lt;ref name="senses"&gt;Graham, Aaron W.[http://sensesofcinema.com/2005/35/charles_b_griffith/ ['Little Shop of Genres: An interview with Charles B. Griffith."]  ''Senses of Cinema'', April 15, 2005. Retrieved: January 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith does have a small part as a scientist.

The design of the creature was Corman's idea, and he thought that coming from a big planet, ''It'' would have evolved to deal with heavy gravity and would therefore be low to the ground. Corman later admitted this was a mistake, saying the creature would have been more frightening had ''It'' been larger or taller. When [[Beverly Garland]] first saw the creature, she commented "''That'' conquered the world?" and kicked ''It'' over.&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;McGee 1996,  p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this action, the design of the creature was reworked.&lt;ref name=Frank1998&gt;Frank (1998) The Films of Roger Corman. Batsford&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature's working pincers were broken on the first day of shooting, but its arms could still be raised.&lt;ref name=Frank1998 /&gt; The melting eye effect was completed using chocolate syrup.&lt;ref name=Frank1998 /&gt;

Griffith on the creature prop:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I called it Denny Dimwit and somebody else called it an ice-cream cone. I was around when [[Paul Blaisdell]] was building it, and he thought the camera would make it look bigger. I have some photographs of it in construction, probably the only ones in existence. I asked for my name not to be on that picture, so I was unbilled. Surprisingly, it got good reviews.&lt;ref name="senses"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Release history==
''It Conquered the World'' was released theatrically by AIP in July 1956 on a double bill with ''The She-Creature''.&lt;ref name="senses"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0366537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film originally received an "X" certificate in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], meaning the picture could only be seen by adults. At issue, the scene of the creature being destroyed by a blowtorch was seen as animal cruelty. However, producer [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] convinced the film board that the violence was against a otherworldly person, and not an animal, earning the film its passing certificate.&lt;ref name=Frank1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubine, Irving. "Boys meet ghouls, make money." ''[[The New York Times]]'',  March 16, 1958, p. X7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, ''It Conquered the World'' was syndicated to television by American International Television. [[VHS]] versions appeared in the 1990s on the US home video market ([[RCA Columbia Pictures|RCA Columbia Home Video]]), but these are no longer in distribution, nor is the film available on [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001M6X9Y "'It Conquered the World' US-American VHS."] ''Amazon.com''.

==Reception==

Film historian and critic [[Leonard Maltin]] called ''It Conquered the World'' "... well acted and interesting but awkwardly plotted".&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 2009, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the movie a cut above normal, despite its low budget, and praised the "remarkable adult questions" asked by the screenplay.

''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine, however, gave the film a negative review, criticizing its poor special effects. Critic Tony Rayns opined, "You have to see a movie like this to realise that film-makers who feel they have nothing to lose are rarer than you'd think".&lt;ref&gt;Rayns, Tony.

Nicholson]], sued [[A&amp;E Networks]] for copyright infringement after the channel used footage of the film in a documentary about [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]].&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/146/442/2333426&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1966, ''It Conquered the World'' was remade in [[16mm]] color by self-proclaimed "schlockmeister" [[Larry Buchanan]] after he secured rights from AIP; he retitled his rewritten remake ''[[Zontar, the Thing from Venus]]'' and then sold it to television syndication.
*[[Frank Zappa]]'s 1974 live album ''[[Roxy &amp; Elsewhere]]'' referred to the film in the introduction for the song "[[Cheepnis]]". 
*The end of the film was shown at the beginning of ''[[Elvira, Mistress of the Dark]]'' (1988).
*In 1991, ''It Conquered the World'' was the subject of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''; joke topics included poor monster props, occasionally wooden acting, and an overblown closing monologue. 
*Audio samples from the film were included in the song "Facing That" from [[M83 (band)|M83]]'s [[M83 (album)|self-titled debut album]], released in 2001.&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt;

'''"Kapcsolat" concert''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈkɒpt͡ʃolɒt}}; {{lang-en|connection}}) was an annual open-air free concert event between 1997 and 2011 in [[Budapest]], Hungary. It was organized by the T-Mobile branch of [[Magyar Telekom]] on {{lang|hu|Ötvenhatosok tere}}. The open-air concert was considered to be one of the largest in Europe.

The name of the concert was borrowed from the motto of the mobile network operator Westel: "{{lang|hu|Westel, a Kapcsolat!}}" ({{lang-en|"Westel, the Connection!"}}), while its approximate date from the [[telephone prefix]] of the operator (06-30, also dubbed "{{lang|hu|kapcsolat napja}}", {{lang-en|Day of Connection}}). The concert was free and paid for from sponsorships. It attracted hundreds of thousand concert-goers. Tickets were only given to VIP guests and employees of Magyar Telekom to VIP sectors.

The first concert was organized in 1996, however, the name "Kapcsolat" was used only from 1997. It was held annually until 2011. In 2012, new telecommunication taxes were introduced, and the concert was called off due to budgetary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmonline.hu/cikk/sporol_a_tmobile_elmarad_a_kapcsolat_koncert|title=Spórol a T-Mobile, elmarad a Kapcsolat koncert|publisher=mmonline|date=April 19, 2012|accessdate=May 28, 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kirchner Cultural Centre''' ({{lang-es|Centro Cultural Kirchner}}) is a [[cultural centre]] located in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It is the largest of [[Latin America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/politica/Cristina-inaugura-el-Centro-Cultural-Nestor-Kirchner-20150521-0004.html "Cristina inaugura el Centro Cultural Néstor Kirchner"], Perfil, 21 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=791533 "Las impactantes fotos del Centro Cultural Néstor Kirchner"], Ambito Financiero, 20 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and the third or fourth largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losandes.com.ar/article/la-obra-faraonica-del-legado-cultural-k "La obra faraónica del legado cultural K"], Los Andes, 31 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/10/03/442664722/in-argentina-where-culture-is-a-right-a-free-new-arts-center-opens NPR.org: "In Argentina, Where Culture Is 'A Right,' A Free New Arts Center Opens"], 3 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was opened on May 21, 2015, and is located in the former [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office]] ("Palacio de Correos").&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The cultural centre was named after former president of Argentina [[Néstor Kirchner]].

The 9 floor centre has a concert hall; 5 other auditoriums for theater and concerts; 18 halls for poetry readings, performance art, and other events; 40 rooms of art and history galleries totaling 15,000 square meters on 6 floors; 16 rehearsal rooms; and 2 rooftop terraces.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=bubble&gt;[http://www.bubblear.com/sorry-but-the-new-kirchner-cultural-center-is-goddamn-beautiful/ The Bubble Blog: "Sorry, But The New Kirchner Cultural Center is Goddamn Beautiful"], by 'Unpaid Intern,' 21 May 2015; (with images).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Buenos Aires Central Post Office===
{{Main|Buenos Aires Central Post Office}}
The need for a new central post office in Buenos Aires was first raised in 1888 by the director of the [[Correo Argentino]] (Argentine Postal Service) at the time, Dr. [[Ramón J. Cárcano]]. Later that year a Congressional bill providing for its construction was signed by President [[Miguel Juárez Celman]]. The Ministry of Public Works commissioned [[French architecture|French architect]] Norbert Maillart for its design in 1889.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;[http://www.intertournet.com.ar/capfederal/monumentos/correo.htm Intertour net: Palacio de Correos] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palacio de Correos (Buenos Aires, 1920).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The post office under construction (c. 1920).]]
Designating a 12,500 m² (134,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) city block on the corner of [[Leandro Alem Avenue|Leandro Alem]] and [[Corrientes Avenue]]s for its construction, the Public Works Ministry chose the site as a means to beautify a [[land reclamation]] site where the shores of the [[Río de la Plata]] had reached just a decade earlier. The sudden onset of the [[Panic of 1890]] and the subsequent [[Revolution of the Park|crisis]] led to President Juárez Celman's resignation, however, as well as to the project's suspension.&lt;ref name=alameda&gt;''Buenos Aires Nos Cuenta'' nº 10 (1994). "La Alameda, el primer paseo de la ciudad." {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buenos Aires - Correo Central - 20051215.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The building in 2005.]]
The national government revived the plans only in 1905, and in 1908 Maillart returned to Buenos Aires, where his new plans for a larger post office were approved the following April. Differences later arose between Maillart and the Argentine government, and the French architect abandoned the project in 1911. Construction, which had just started, was then left to the supervision of Maillart's chief assistant, Jacques Spolsky. Spolsky reengineered the design, which featured [[masonry]] supports, to consist of a [[steel-reinforced concrete]] structure, for which 2,882 steel pillars were placed onto the bedrock, 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft) deep.&lt;ref name=alameda/&gt;

Limitations on the city's public works budgets resulting from the onset of [[World War I]] forced another major design alteration in 1916. The planned construction of an elevated causeway on Leandro Alem Avenue was cancelled, and a [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] was quickly added to the plans to compensate for an entrance which would now be one floor below the original's. Spolsky achieved this without substantial changes to the building's exterior, though the number of delays led to considerable cost overruns on the project, and its budget was exhausted in 1923.&lt;ref name=alameda/&gt; President [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]], however, obtained Congressional support for a new appropriation, and on September 28, 1928 (two weeks before the end of Alvear's tenure), the new ''Secretaría de Comunicaciones'' was inaugurated.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

The building's eclectic design, drawing prominently from French [[Second Empire architecture]], was typical of the public buildings and upscale real estate built in Buenos Aires and other Argentine cities early in the 20th Century. Despite their differences, Maillart went on to design the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires National College]] and the [[Argentine Supreme Court]], and Spolsky designed post offices for [[Rosario]] and [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] in a similar style while at work on this structure.

The largest public building completed in Argentina up to that point, the building measured eight stories and 60&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) in height and included over 88,000 m² (948,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) of indoor space.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The central hall was decorated with marble throughout, features [[stained glass window]]s, numerous bronze sculptures and mail drop boxes, and a 4-story-high domed ceiling.&lt;ref name=clarin5&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/06/17/laciudad/h-06601.htm ''Clarín'' (6/17/2005)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perón era===
The grandiose setting led President [[Juan Perón]] to move his offices in the building during the early years of his 1946-55 tenure, and the First Lady, [[Eva Perón]], designated a wing as the first headquarters of the charitable [[Eva Perón Foundation]].&lt;ref name=clarin5/&gt;

During the subsequent automobile boom in Argentina, the plaza facing the post office was made into a parking lot. Opposition to the 1979 sale of the parking lot for the construction of a local [[Bank of Tokyo]] headquarters proved insurmountable, and the plans were cancelled. Guillermo del Cioppo, the Minister of Urban Development and later  Mayor, ordered the construction of an underground parking structure instead, and the lot above was converted into a park in 1983.&lt;ref name=alameda/&gt;

The building was designated a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]] in 1997. Most of its postal activities had been transferred to a newer structure during the Perón administration, and it handled only international mail in later years. In 2005, its last remaining postal bureau was closed.

[[File:Correo Central 2015.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Cultural Center in 2015, with new illuminated cupola dome.]]

==Cultural centre==
President [[Néstor Kirchner]] proposed the conversion of the abandoned building and landmark into a cultural centre in June 2005,&lt;ref name=clarin5/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; and two years later, plans were approved for the construction of two concert halls and an exhibition gallery for the creation of the Bicentennial Cultural Centre (''Centro Cultural del Bicentenario''). The centre's winning design was provided by a team of architects led by siblings Enrique, Federico and Nicolás Bares.

It was originally scheduled to be inaugurated on the [[Argentina Bicentennial]], May 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/09/04/laciudad/h-03801.htm ''Clarín'' (9/4/2007)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the new centre was delayed considerably, however, and in 2012 its designated name was amended as ''Centro Cultural del Bicentenario Presidente Dr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner'', in honor of the late former president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1529561-el-centro-cultural-del-bicentenario-se-llamara-presidente-nestor-kirchner|title=El Centro Cultural del Bicentenario se llamará ahora Presidente Néstor Kirchner|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon opening in May 2015 it was named the shorter ''Centro Cultural  Kirchner'' (English: Kirchner Cultural Centre).&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

When the architects added new spaces and elements, they purposely used different materials such as clear and frosted glass and stainless steel, to maintain sight of the ornate [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]] beauty of the original building.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;  The main concert hall ''La Sala Sinfonica'', (originally named ''La Ballena Azul'', or "The Blue Whale") seating 1,950 people, is a blimp-shaped three-storey auditorium and opera house floating in the former package-sorting area. It houses a Klais Orgelbau pipe organ (opus 1912), this organ can played via a remote console, it has 4 manuals and about eight-thousand pipes, it weights 30 metric tons and features three 32' stops in pédale registers.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=bubble/&gt; The other principal venues are the ''Sala Federal'' for music, and ''La Cúpula'' and ''Sala Argentina'' for live theater.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151103050711/http://www.culturalkirchner.gob.ar/www/548/20454/salas.html Culturalkirchner.gob.ar: Néstor Kirchner Cultural Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inauguration of President [[Mauricio Macri]] (whose father, [[Francisco Macri]], led a conglomerate that once owned the building),&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Cox|title=Populism’s pervasive cycle|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729867-how-politics-can-shape-emerging-markets-populisms-pervasive-cycle|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre became part of the newly formed [https://www.argentina.gob.ar/mediospublicos Federal System of Media and Public Contents] (''Sistema Federal de Medios y Contenidos Publicos'') and has sought to de-emphasize its function as a homage to Néstor Kirchner. The Centre is now branded simply as "CCK" and the room that once housed a memorial display in honour of Kirchner has been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/05/11/argentina/1462971381_538034.html ''El Pais'' (11/5/2016)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macri administration has intended to change the name of CCK to the "Bicentennial Cultural Centre" (''Centro Cultural del Bicentenario'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.taringa.net/post/noticias/19122194/Le-cambiaran-el-nombre-al-Centro-Cultural-Kirchner.html ''Taringa'' (25/11/2015)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1945535-hernan-lombardi-sobre-el-reemplazo-del-nombre-nestor-kirchner-en-lugares-publicos-buscamos-salir-del-populismo ''La Nacion'' (09/10/2016)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, a bill was introduced in  Congress to prohibit the federal government from naming facilities after a president who has not been dead for at least 20 years, effectively forcing CCK to be renamed upon passage and enactment of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebubble.com/government-wants-to-wipe-off-kirchner-name-from-all-state-buildings/ ''The Bubble'' (10/10/2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine National Symphony Orchestra]], founded by Péron in 1948 but homeless for 67 years, has taken up permanent residency at the Kirchner Centre.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

As many as 10,000 patrons a day visit venues and events at the Kirchner Centre.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Everything is currently free, because the Culture Ministry operates on the assumption that the arts belong to everyone — "We consider culture to be a right" — as said by former minister of culture [[Teresa Parodi]] in her interview with the U.S. [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;

[[President of Argentina|President]] [[Mauricio Macri]] of Argentina assumed the one-year G20 presidency on 30 November 2017, during an official ceremony in Kirchner Cultural Centre, for the first time in [[South America]].

'''Lambya''' (Rambia) is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of Tanzania and Malawi. In Northern Malawi it is spoken particularly in the [[Chitipa District]].&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;University of Malawi Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi (2006) (see External links).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sukwa, once thought to be a dialect of [[Nyakyusa language|Nyakyusa]], is now considered to be a dialect of Lambya.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse, Derek (1988) "The Diachronic Background to the Language Communities of South Western Tanzania" in ''Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika'' vol 9, 15-115.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Malawi Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi (2006), agreeing with this, found that the three languages Cilambya, [[Ndali language|Cindali]], and Cisukwa form a single dialect group, although there are differences between them, especially between Cilambya and the other two. For example:

*Person = umunthu, umundu, umundu
*Grasshopper = imphanzi, imbashi, imbasi
*Scorpion = kalizga, kalisha, kalisya
*Maize = ivilombe, ifilombe, ifilombe

==An example of Lambya==
The Language Mapping Survey gives further vocabulary and also a short text (the Tortoise and the Hare) in all three dialects.&lt;ref name=LMS /&gt; The Lambya version of the story goes as follows:

:UKALULU NU FULU (Lambia)
:Mukaya mukaŵa izala. Po Ufulu akaya pakulaŵa ivyakulya ku ŵanthu. Nanthi ŵamupa ivyakulya vila akapotwagha ukuyamula chifukwa chakuti mupimpha. Chifukwa chinicho akapinyilira isaka kulukusa ulutali leka, lo akivwalika munsingo. Nanthi anda pakwenda isaka lira likamukonkhe zyanga munyumwa mwache. 

:Ŵoachili akwenda ukuya ku nyumba kwache, Ukalulu akiza munyuma. Akati alyenya isaka lira akanena ukuti: "Nalombola isaka, lyane!" Ufulu akiza ati "We Kalulu, isaka linilo lyane, enia ulukusa ulu imphinyiliye munsingo ukuti ponkwenda ingusaghe." Ukalulu akiza akana akati: "Pofwandi tuŵuke kwa mwene aye atulonganie." Ukalulu akati anena ŵunuŵo ŵakiza ŵaya kwa mwene kula. Umwene yula akadumula ukuti wadumule ulukusa lo Ufulu akavwala musingo nukusenda isaka lira ukumupa Ukalulu. 

:Isiku ilyinji Ukalulu akendagha, Ufulu akiza munyuma mwache. Akiza anena ukuti: "Nalombola umusinda wane!" Ukalulu akati "Asa! Wefulu umusinda tewako wane!" Ufulu akakana akati "Nalombola wane." Po ŵovyawa ŵunuŵu ŵosi ŵaŵiri ŵakiza ŵapangana ukuti ŵaye kwa mwene aye aŵalonganie. Kwa mwene kula inongwa yikiza yamunoghela Ufulu. Umwene akiza adumula ukuti ŵadumule umusinda wa Kalulu ŵamupe Ufulu. 

The story may be translated as follows:

:In the village there was a famine. So Tortoise went to beg food from people. When they gave him that food he wasn't able to carry it because he was short. For this reason he tied a sack to a very long rope and wore it round his neck. As he was walking along that sack was following behind him.

:As he was going to his home, Hare was coming behind him. When he saw that sack he said, "I've found it, my sack!" Tortoise said, "Hare, this sack is mine! See this rope I've tied to my neck so that when walking I can pull it." Hare denied it saying, "It's better we go to the chief so that he can decide." When Hare said this, they went to that chief. That chief judged that they should cut Tortoise's rope and take the sack and give it to Hare.

:Another day, when Hare was walking, Tortoise came behind him. He said: "I've found it, my tail!" Hare said, "Nonsense! The tail isn't yours, it's mine!" Tortoise denied it saying, "I found it, it's mine." Since this was the situation, they both decided that they should go to the chief so that he could decide. At the chief's the case went in favour of Tortoise. The chief decided that they should cut off Hare's tail and give it to Tortoise.

"'''Lavender (Nightfall Remix)'''" is a 2017 song by American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]]. It is a remixed version of the [[BadBadNotGood]] (BBNG) song "[[Lavender (BadBadNotGood song)|Lavender]]" with lyrics added which addressed the issue of [[police brutality in the United States]]. It was released with a music video which caused some controversy because of a scene depicting a mock assassination of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]. The song was included in Snoop's 2017 album ''[[Neva Left]]''.

==Background==
During a video game event in October 2016, the American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] and American YouTuber [[Jesse Wellens]] paused for a smoking session. During this time, Wellens proposed a music video with clowns, inspired by the [[shooting of Philando Castile]]. Three days later, Snoop sent Wellens his own version of "Lavender" with lyrics referencing [[police brutality]]. Wellens later told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', "When I originally wrote the idea of the video, the video of [Philando Castile] getting shot came out online and it was causing riots. We just kind of wanted to bring the clowns out, because it's clownery."&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web |last=Platon |first=Adelle |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7718241/snoop-dogg-lavender-video-donald-trump-clowns-director-jesse-wellens |title=Snoop Dogg on 'Lavender' Video Parodying Trump: 'Nobody's Dealing With the Real Issue With This F—king Clown as President' |work=Billboard |date=March 12, 2017 |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2016, Snoop previewed his new song regarding police brutality on Instagram, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] the beat of BBNG's "Lavender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dandridge-Lemco |first=Ben |url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/10/19/snoop-dogg-kaytranada-badbadnotgood-snippet |title=Listen To A Snippet Of A New Snoop Dogg Song Which Samples Kaytranada And BADBADNOTGOOD's "Lavender" |work=The Fader |date=October 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=April Clare |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/10/20/snoop-dogg-samples-badbadnotgood-kaytranada-new-song/ |title=Snoop Dogg samples BadBadNotGood and Kaytranada on new anti-police brutality song |work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |date=October 20, 2016 |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snoop said the song was meant to be "not controversial but real – real to the voice of the people who don't have a voice."&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Music video and release==
The song was released on March 12, 2017 with a music video directed by [[Jesse Wellens]] and James DeFina. It depicts a world of clowns and "doggs".&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/snoop-trump-lavender-remix-assassination-toy-gun-clown/519612/ |title=Snoop Dogg's Anti-Trump Video Becomes a Pro-Trump Prop |date=March 15, 2017 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the video shows a clown family and follows the father (played by [[Michael Rapaport]]), who smokes weed while stressed. After the father encounters a clown policeman, he is shot dead with a glitter gun while a bystander films the incident.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; The video cuts to "The Clown House", where Ronald Klump, a clown parody version of [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; holds a press conference calling for the deportation of all "doggs". In the video, Snoop Dogg sees Klump and his henchmen outside, and he grabs a gun and goes outside to aim it at Klump. When Snoop pulls the trigger, a flag with the word "bang" pops out, and Klump is later seen in chains.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;

The song was included in Snoop's album ''[[Neva Left]]'', released on May 19, 2017.&lt;ref name=mic&gt;{{cite web |last=Whaley |first=Natelegé |url=https://mic.com/articles/177487/snoop-dogg-s-neva-left-album-download-and-streaming-options-for-new-release |title=Snoop Dogg's 'Neva Left' album: Download and streaming options for new release |work=Mic |date=May 19, 2017 |accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Conservative politicians and commentators criticized the video's mock assassination of Ronald Klump, a parody of Donald Trump. Senator [[Marco Rubio]] (R-Florida) said, "We've had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that, people should really be careful about that kind of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hensch |first=Mark |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/323815-rubio-snoop-shouldnt-have-done-that |title=Rubio: 'Snoop shouldn't have done that' |date=March 13, 2017 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Cruz]] (R-Texas) said "I think it really is in poor taste to be making fun of murdering someone.

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[Africa]]'''. Separatism includes [[autonomism]] and [[secession]]ism. What is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
#They are active movements with living, active members.
#They are seeking greater autonomy or [[self-determination]] for a geographic region (as opposed to personal autonomy).
#They are the citizen/inhabitants of the conflict area and do not come from another country.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following:
*''De facto'' state: for regions with ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy from the government
*Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding [[sovereign state]]
*Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession
**Ethnic group(s): for the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|ethnic groups]] made up of the area
**''De facto'' autonomous government: for governments with ''de facto'' autonomous control over a region
**Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control
**Political party (or parties): for [[Political party|political parties]] involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession
**Militant organisation(s): for armed separatist organisations
**Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]]
**[[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s)

'''''Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland''''' (released in [[Japan]] as simply {{nihongo|'''''Nemo'''''|ニモ|Nimo}} and credited in some territories as '''''Little Nemo''''') is a 1989 Japanese-American [[Animation|animated]]  [[musical film|musical]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[fantasy film]] directed by Masami Hata and William Hurtz. Based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'' by [[Winsor McCay]], the film went through a lengthy development process with a number of screenwriters. Ultimately, the screenplay was credited to [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and [[Richard Outten]]; the storyline and art style differed from the original version. The original [[soundtrack]] was penned by the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Sherman Brothers]].

A [[box office bomb]] in its original Japanese release, the film suffered additional commercial failure when released in the United States, where 11 minutes of material was removed in order to secure a family-friendly G rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].

==Plot==
The film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a [[locomotive]]. Upon awakening the next day, he goes  with his pet [[flying squirrel]], Icarus to see a [[parade]] welcoming a [[traveling circus]]. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus because his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates [[sleepwalking]] in a failed attempt to sneak some pie, going against a promise he had earlier made to his mother. Upon falling asleep that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the parade. The circus [[organist]] introduces himself as [[Professor Genius]] and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with royalty of the opposite gender, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.

Nemo is taken to Slumberland in a [[dirigible]] which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos and is introduced to King Morpheus, who doubles as the circus ringmaster on Earth. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom, and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair and Icarus roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo is whisked away by Genius to prince lessons. Later, he meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes the dreaded Nightmare King. Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, the Nightmare King reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo reveal each other responsible for the Nightmare King's escape, since Morpheus gave Nemo the key and it was Flip's idea to open the door.

Nemo then awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him and Icarus into the ocean. Genius reunites with them and tells Nemo not to blame himself and that Flip is to blame for all that has happened; Nemo refutes this, citing that he's the one who made and then broke his promise to Morpheus to never open the door, and resolves to find and rescue the king. When the three return to Slumberland and narrowly prevent Flip's banishment, Nemo forces Flip to reveal that he has a map to Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the monster-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. 

The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic goblin bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter, but is unable to remember the full incantation and awakens in his bed along with Icarus just after watching Flip, Genius, and Camille be captured by the Nightmare King's forces. The goblins appear in Nemo's room and reunite with a lost member of theirs, who gives Nemo a letter from Morpheus containing the scepter's incantation to defeat the Nightmare King. The group returns to Nightmare Land by flying on Nemo's bed through a dimensional portal in the sky, and soon reach and infiltrate Nightmare Castle. However, they are subsequently trapped in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter and threatens Flip, Genius, Camille, and Morpheus, whom are all in suspended animated states, with harm if Nemo doesn't comply. After a fierce battle, Nemo uses the scepter to finally defeat and destroy the Nightmare King and purify his kingdom, though due to Nemo's young age, the use of the scepter inadvertently kills him as well. As everyone awakens in the aftermath and discovers Nemo's lifeless body, they begin to mourn for Slumberland's fallen prince. Morpheus, however, uses the scepter to restore Nemo to life. Nemo apologizes for breaking his promise, opening the door, and causing everything to begin with, but Morpheus forgives him, citing that his courage and strong will have allowed him to make up for his mistake, and become a true prince.

As Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom, Camille escorts Nemo and Icarus home on the dirigible. The two share a kiss after which Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window with Icarus as he reflects on his adventure.

==Cast==
* [[Gabriel Damon]] (Takuma Gōno in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo''': He is a human boy living in [[New York City]] who is taken to Slumberland to be the official playmate of Princess Camille; in actuality, however, he is being summoned to be the heir to the elderly King Morpheus. He is given the key to Slumberland, but is warned by the king to leave a door with a coiled dragon emblazoned on it closed. Sadly, he opens the aforementioned door when he is tempted by Flip and goes on a quest to restore Slumberland to its rightful glory, save King Morpheus and defeat the Nightmare King. 
* [[Mickey Rooney]] ([[Chikao Ōtsuka]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Flip''': He is described as a "frightful fellow" by Professor Genius, he is wanted throughout Slumberland for "having fun" (the bounty on his head is a sizeable one) and his only friend is his partner-in-crime: a bird named Flap. He tricks Nemo into accidentally releasing the Nightmare King and blames Nemo for the ruin of Slumberland. He is in possession of a map of Nightmare Land (hand-drawn and written in his own special code) and serves as the guide to the Nightmare Castle until he is replaced by the Boomps. He has a serious smoking addiction. In the real world, he is a clown in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.
* [[René Auberjonois]] ([[Kōichi Kitamura]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Professor Genius''': King Morpheus' advisor. He comes to the real world to bring Nemo to Slumberland. As a sophisticated man, he is quite punctual and prefers order as opposed to madness. He is quite a dancer, as he dances quite a bit during Nemo's coronation ceremony. In the real world, he is an organ player in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.
* [[Danny Mann]] as '''Icarus''': a [[flying squirrel]], Nemo's best friend and a supporting protagonist. Icarus is Nemo's only friend from the real world. He shows great concern for Nemo's wellbeing in a sense similar to that of two siblings. He speaks a mix of both squirrel and some English. His screech is painful to the ears of the Boomps. He detests being called a "little rat" (which Princess Camille mistakes him for). Unlike other squirrels, Icarus eats human food, like cookies. His initial relationship with Princess Camille, though rough, eventually changes for the better.
* [[Bernard Erhard]] ([[Kenji Utsumi]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''King Morpheus''': the elderly sovereign of Slumberland. He has protected Slumberland for years with the help of the royal scepter: an ancient weapon of great power. Though he is a child at heart, he knows when to be serious. He has Nemo brought to Slumberland so that he may become his heir to the throne. He gives Nemo the key to Slumberland, which can open any door; however, he warns Nemo of one door with a dragon symbol emblazoned on it that must never be opened. Like Professor Genius, he is quite a dancer, as he dances alongside the Professor during Nemo's coronation ceremony. When Nemo accidentally releases the Nightmare King, King Morpheus is captured and Nemo has to go and rescue him from Nightmare Land. In the real world, he is the ringmaster of a circus that stops in Nemo's town.
* [[William E. Martin|Bill Martin]] ([[Tarō Ishida]] in the Japanese adaptation) as the '''Nightmare King''': He is a demonic creature who was locked behind a massive door until he was accidentally set free by Nemo, who was given the key to the door by King Morpheus. Once free, he captures King Morpheus as revenge for his imprisonment and then retreats to the Nightmare Castle in Nightmareland. When Nemo goes to Nightmareland to save King Morpheus, the Nightmare King has his minions capture Nemo's friends (Professor Genius, Flip and Princess Camille). He is shown to be quite temperamental, as he destroys several minions for the failure of just one of his underlings (the general of his army). The only thing that can vanquish him is the legendary royal scepter.
* Laura Mooney ([[Hiroko Kasahara]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Princess Camille''': the daughter of King Morpheus. Though she initially acts somewhat spoiled, she eventually grows to like Nemo. She also grows fond of Icarus (and vice versa, despite a rough start). When her father is kidnapped by the Nightmare King, she takes over as sovereign but decides to join Nemo in his quest to save King Morpheus. In the real world, she is the daughter of the ringmaster of a circus that stops in Nemo's town.
* [[Greg Burson]] ([[Tesshō Genda]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo's father''' and '''Flap'''
* [[Jennifer Darling]] (Mari Yokō in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Nemo's mother'''
* [[Neil Ross]] ([[Hiroshi Ōtake]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompa'''
* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] ([[Keiichi Nanba]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oomp'''
* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] ([[Masaharu Satō]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompo''' and the '''Dirigible Captain'''
* [[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]] ([[Kōzō Shioya]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompe'''
* [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] ([[Hiroko Emori]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''Oompy'''
* [[Kathleen Freeman]] (Kimie Nakajima in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the dance teacher'''
* Bever-Leigh Banfield (Seiko Nakao in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the woman'''
* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] (Kazumi Tanaka in the Japanese adaptation) as '''the dirigible captain'''
* [[Bert Kramer]] ([[Yukimasa Kishino]] in the Japanese adaptation) as '''a goblin''': A hideous creature that serves as a member of the Nightmare King's army. They are sent by the Nightmare King to ensure that Nemo doesn't reach his castle and free King Morpheus. Though the goblins succeed in capturing most of Nemo's friends, they fail to capture Nemo himself and, when the Nightmare King finds out, he kills them all in a fit of rage. The only goblins to survive are the Boomps (who, in contrast to the other goblins, are not hideous and are actually good).
* [[Beau Weaver]] (Tarō Arakawa in the Japanese adaptation) as '''a policeman'''
* [[Sherry Lynn]] as '''Bon Bon'''
* Guy Christopher as a '''Courtier''' and a '''Cop'''
* [[Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ellen Gerstell]] as '''pages'''

==Production==
''Nemo'' was the brainchild of producer Yutaka Fujioka. His dream for years had been to make a feature length, animated film version of ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]'' which would utilize the resources of his [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] studio. As the first step towards realizing this project, in 1977 he personally flew to [[Monterey, California]] to convince McCay's descendents to allow him to obtain the film rights to the comic strip. He originally approached [[George Lucas]] a year later to help produce the film, but Lucas found problems with the storyline, feeling there was no character development for the titular character Nemo. Fujioka also approached [[Chuck Jones]], but Jones also declined. The film was officially announced as a project in 1982. In February of that year, the company TMS/Kinetographics was formed in America to produce ''Nemo'', and the best staff from around the world were gathered together to begin production. [[Gary Kurtz]] was appointed producer of the American production side and hired [[Ray Bradbury]] and later [[Edward Summer]] to write screenplays. Kurtz would eventually step down in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref name="Masami Hata Filmography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelleas.net/hm/28.shtml |title=Masami Hata Filmography &gt; 28 |publisher=Pelleas.net |date=1989-07-15 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, both [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Isao Takahata]] were involved with the film, but they both parted ways because of creative differences; essentially, Miyazaki did not seem to be keen on the concept of an animated feature created by him where everything was a dream, and Takahata agreed with Lucas and was more interested in creating a story depicting Nemo's growth as a boy.&lt;ref name="Masami Hata Filmography"/&gt; Miyazaki later described his involvement on the film as "the worst experience he has ever been through".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reviews Film Reviews Anime Reviews Book Reviews |url=http://www.isugoi.com/little-nemo-adventures-in-slumberland-review/ |title=Anime Review: Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland &amp;#124; リトルニモ：冒険スランバーランドで &amp;#124; 1989 &amp;#124; Masami Hata &amp;#124; William T.

A third pilot film was made by Sadao Tsukioka but has yet to become publicly available.&lt;ref name="Masami Hata Filmography"/&gt;

[[Brad Bird]] and [[Jerry Rees]] also worked on the film through the American department as animators for a month, while at the time were also working on an unproduced adaptation of [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Spirit (comics)|The Spirit]]'' with Gary Kurtz. During production, the two would regularly ask animators what they were doing, the response they were commonly given was "we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing", upon meeting Bradbury in person and asking him about the story he was writing for the film, he replied "I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing". Bird and Rees soon left the project after their meeting with Bradbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/anime/little-nemo-test-film.html |title=Little Nemo test film &amp;#124; Cartoon Brew: Leading the Animation Conversation |publisher=Cartoon Brew |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323020135/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/anime/little-nemo-test-film.html |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When all of these people had left, Fujioka had drafts done by Chris Columbus, [[Jean Giraud|Mœbius]], [[John Canemaker]], and many others. He then re-hired Summer to do yet another screenplay. Subsequently, [[Richard Outten]] was hired to work from Columbus' screenplay while Columbus was busy with his directorial debut, ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]''. Many [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney Studio]] animators including [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] and Leo Salkin worked on individual sequences, and John Canemaker, Corny Cole, and [[Brian Froud]] provided visual development. [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston|Oliver Johnston]] and [[Paul Julian (artist)|Paul Julian]] consulted to the production. The world-famous [[Sherman Brothers]] ([[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]) were hired to write the songs for ''Nemo''. This was their first [[anime]] film, though not their first animated film; the pair had previously worked on several projects for Disney, including ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.

Little production progress was made until January 1988, when the many ideas pasted on the walls of the Los Angeles studio were whittled down in order to create the storyboard from which the film would be made. It was at this point, Thomas and Johnston recommended William T. Hurtz as the director of the American production side and TMS hired Masami Hata, a former [[Sanrio]] film director, as the appointed director at the TMS studio in Japan. Actual animation for the completed film was commenced in June 1988, as TMS was just completing ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''.&lt;ref name="Masami Hata Filmography"/&gt; The success of that film in Japan further helped TMS finally start production on ''Little Nemo''. Even though it derived from an American comic strip, ''Little Nemo'' was animated by the Japanese company [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] and thus is often considered an anime film, even though it was a joint production of Japanese and American animators and production companies.

==Release==
The Japanese cut was released in Japan on July 15, 1989. In a Summer that included strong competition, including [[Studio Ghibli]]'s ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', which was ironically directed by one of the animators who left the production of this film, it grossed ¥0.9 billion ($10 million USD) in its release and was considered a box-office flop, against a budget of around ¥3 billion ($35 million USD).

The English dub was released three years later in the United States in 579 theaters on August 21, 1992 through [[Hemdale Film Corporation]].&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=littlenemo.htm |title=Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1992) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=1992-09-04 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 minutes were cut in order to secure a G rating. This version's opening credits were shortened, as a result, the opening song plays during the opening scene.

===Critical reception===
It received mixed to positive reviews from publications including ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/21/movies/review-film-young-hero-in-pajamas-braves-nightmare-land.html |title=Review/Film; Young Hero in Pajamas Braves Nightmare Land - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1992-08-21 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |first=Stephen |last=Holden}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, though on a positive note, he wrote: "Little Nemo is an interesting if not a great film, with some jolly characters, some cheerful songs, and some visual surprises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920821/REVIEWS/208210301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Little Nemo: Adventures In Slumberland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
Despite having a positive reception, the film failed to find an audience. In its opening weekend in the United States, ''Nemo'' made about $407,695 with a total US gross of approximately $1,368,000.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo.com"/&gt; It won the "Audience Award" at [[Amsterdam]]'s 1992 [[List of film festivals in Europe#Netherlands|Cinekid Festival]] and was nominated for "Best Animated Feature" at the 1993 [[Annie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annieawards.org/21stwinners.html |title=The Annie Awards |publisher=The Annie Awards |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525034005/http://annieawards.org/21stwinners.html |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, ''Little Nemo'' was given a very limited re-release in [[Denver]], [[Seattle]], [[Atlanta]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Houston]], and other cities in the US. This was through [[Regal Entertainment Group]]'s Regal Cinemas, Edwards Theatres, and United Artists Theatres as part of a [[Kidtoon Films]] family [[Movie theater|matinées]] promotion. It was only shown on weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-03-05/little-nemo-theatrical-release |title=Little Nemo Theatrical Release - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2005-03-05 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After the film's release, Fujioka decided to retire from the animation business. TMS, having to recoup ''Little Nemo''{{'}}s losses, increased production on locally based anime programs and became highly involved in animation for western-based productions, including ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Animated Series|Batman]]''. Since the early 2000s, TMS has no longer supplied animation services to western studios due to increasingly demanding costs. The studio has never again attempted a project like ''Akira'' or ''Nemo''. The studio still does features, but primarily films spinning off existing anime properties, which include the likes of ''[[Anpanman]]'' and ''[[Detective Conan]]''.

===Home media===
[[File:Littlenemo.jpg|thumb|US DVD cover]]
The film was released on [[VHS]] through Hemdale Home Video, Inc. on March 2, 1993. It features a mail-in coupon worth $5.00, with purchases of [[Tropicana Orange Juice]], along with an advert before the film produced by [[Pixar]]. Hemdale also produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, [[picture book|illustrated storybook]], and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] [[soundtrack]]. ''Nemo'' became the #4 best-selling children's title of 1993, with 1.5 million copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=little+nemo+2+million+copies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lfsx8SnNMx&amp;sig=5v90AhDoc2xNaRE4uIhIwyR92FE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHiZ2K2d7QAhXClFQKHYs9D1gQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20nemo%202%20million%20copies&amp;f=false|title=Suppliers Aim Kids Vid at Parents|last=Miller Rosenblum|first=Trudi|date=1994-06-25|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2004, ''Little Nemo'' was released on [[DVD]] through [[Funimation]] (under the Our Time Family Entertainment name, and under license from TMS, which had regained North American rights to the film after Hemdale closed). All of the cuts that were made in the 1992 release were restored in this DVD, bringing the run time of the film to the full 95 minutes, even though it would receive a PG rating. However, this is not mentioned or addressed in the DVD materials.

After the title went out of print, ''Little Nemo'' could be seen selling anywhere from $80 to $200 US for a sealed copy (usually DVD) on Internet sites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]]. Funimation's DVD was re-released as a budget title from [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] on January 27, 2009, appearing commonly in department stores in low-price bargain bins. Then after Echo Bridge's reissue went out of print, it was released again by [[Discotek Media]]. On November 6, 2012, Discotek released a [[Blu-ray]] of the film containing the Japanese dub and original English audio tracks and included bonus features such as the pilot films from 1984 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Little-Nemo-Adventures-in-Slumberland-Blu-ray/48885/|title=Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland Blu-ray|last=|first=|date=|website=Blu-ray.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909190413/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Little-Nemo-Adventures-in-Slumberland-Blu-ray/48885/|archive-date=2012-09-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
{{Main article|Little Nemo: The Dream Master}}
After the Japanese release, but before the US release, [[Capcom]] developed an [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game titled ''Little Nemo: The Dream Master'', which was released in late 1990. An [[arcade game]], also by Capcom, was developed that same year under the title ''Nemo''.

His coin showing the [[laurel wreath|laureate]] head of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] is in the collections of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

The other has a radiate ''Sol'' (sun) on obverse and a crescent moon and seven stars on reverse. The stars are the ''Septem Triones'' ([[Ursa major]]), a pun of the moneyer ''cognomen''.

The '''music of ancient Rome''' was a part of Roman culture from earliest times.{{Ref|Naerebout}} Music was customary at [[Roman funerals and burial|funerals]], and the ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]]''), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar}} Song ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmen]])'' was an integral part of almost every social occasion.{{Ref|Habinek}} The ''[[Carmen Saeculare|Secular Ode]]'' of [[Horace]], for instance, was commissioned by [[Augustus]] and performed by a mixed children's choir at the [[Secular Games]] in 17 BC. Under the influence of [[Music of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theory]], music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.{{Ref|Habinek90}} 

[[Etruscan culture|Etruscan]] music had an early influence on that of the Romans. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], Romans carried their music to the [[Roman province|provinces]], while traditions of [[Asia Minor]], [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]] and [[Gaul]] became a part of Roman culture.{{Ref|Scott}}

Music accompanied [[Roman Empire#Recreation and spectacles|spectacles and events in the arena]], and was part of the [[Roman Empire#Performing arts|performing arts form called ''pantomimus'']], an early form of [[story ballet]] that combined expressive dancing, instrumental music and a sung [[libretto]].{{Ref|Franklin-Starks}}

[[File:Musicians from Zliten mosaic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Musicians in a detail from the [[Zliten mosaic]] (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying [[gladiator]] combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the ''tuba'', ''hydraulis'' (water pipe organ), and two ''cornua'']]
The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four successive tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note.

The Romans may have tuned their instruments to [[Musical mode#Greek|Greek modes]].{{Ref|Pierce}}

===Instruments===
[[Roman art]] depicts various [[woodwind]]s, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], [[percussion]] and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

===Wind instruments===
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze [[trumpet]] with a detachable, conical mouthpiece like that of the modern [[French horn]]. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series that would probably sound familiar to the modern ear, given the limitations of [[musical acoustics]] for instruments of this construction.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] - αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''[[capistrum]]'' (Greek ''[[phorbeiá]] - φορβεία'') to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} Modern changes indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate each pipe having a single reed (like a modern clarinet) instead of a double reed.
*The ''[[askaules]]'' — a bagpipe.
*Versions of the modern [[flute]] and [[panpipes]].

===String instruments===
{{double image|right|Villa dei Misteri IV - 2.jpg|170|Boscoreale1.jpg|235|'''Left image:''': [[Silenus]] holding a [[lyre]], detail of a [[fresco]] from the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], [[Pompeii]], Italy, c. 50 BC&lt;br&gt;'''Right image:''' wall fresco of a seated woman with a [[kithara]], 40-30 BC, from the [[Villa Boscoreale]] of P. Fannius Synistor; late [[Roman Republic]]; it most likely represents [[Berenice II]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] wearing a ''stephane'' (i.e. royal [[diadem]]) on her head.{{Ref|Pfrommer and Towne-Markus}}}}
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}} The lyre was held or cradled in one arm and hand and plucked with the other hand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Playing technique not described in the cited source; other sources describe the manner of playing quite differently, particularly with respect to the use of a plektron and the function of the left-hand fingers.--&gt; The Romans gradually abandoned this instrument in favour of the more sophisticated ''cithara'',{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--The cited source says nothing of the sort.--&gt; a larger instrument with a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the sounding box at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a plectrum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--The cited source does not mention playing technique, only saying that a plectrum is shown beside the instrument in the engraving.--&gt; The strings were tuned "by adjusting sticks seen in the engraving."{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability. It was said some players could make it cry. From ''cithara'' comes the word ''guitar''. Though the guitar more directly evolved from the lute, the same mystique surrounds the guitar idols of today as it did for the virtuoso cithara players, the citharista, and popular singers of ancient Rome.{{cn|date=August 2014}} Like many other instruments, it came originally from Greece, and Greek images portray the most elaborately constructed citharas.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute  in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}

===Organs===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|''Hydraulis'' and ''cornu'' on a mosaic from [[Nennig]], [[Germany]]]]
Mosaics depict instruments that look like a cross between the bagpipe and the organ. The pipes were sized so as to produce many of the modes (scales) known from the Greeks. It is unclear whether they were blown by the lungs or by some mechanical bellows. 

The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome submerged in a tank of water. Air is pumped into the top of the dome, compressing the air and forcing water out the bottom; the displace water rises in the tank. This increased hydraulic head and the compression of the air in the dome provides a steady supply of air to the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The instrument goes back to the ancient Greeks and a well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885.{{Ref|Cook}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--Neither Carthage, pottery, nor the year 1885 are mentioned in this source.--&gt;

The ''hydraulis'' accompanied gladiator contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. It might also be found in homes, and was among the instruments that the emperor [[Nero]] played.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}}

===Percussion===
[[File:Scabellum.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[scabellum]]]]
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device called a [[scabellum]] — a 'clapper' — used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and tambourines.
*[[Drum]] and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes, military uses, hunting (to drive out prey) and even for the control of bees in apiaries.{{Cn|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--Extraordinary claim, sounds like a hoax.--&gt; Some Roman music was distinguished for its having a steady beat, no doubt through the use of drums and the percussive effects of clapping and stamping.{{Cn|date=May 2012}} Egyptian musicians often kept time by snapping the fingers.
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.{{Ref|Marcuse}}

==Music in society==
In spite of the purported lack of musical originality on the part of the Romans, they did enjoy music greatly and used it for many activities. Music was also used in religious ceremonies. The Romans cultivated music as a sign of education.{{Ref|Walter}} Music contests were quite common and attracted a wide range of competition, including [[Nero]] himself, who performed widely as an amateur and once traveled to [[Greece]] to compete.{{Ref|Suetonius}}

'''''RASL''''' is a 2013 graphic novel by cartoonist [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]]. A [[science fiction|sci-fi]] [[neo-noir|noir]], it is the story of RASL (Dr. Robert Joseph Johnson), an art thief who jumps to parallel universes in attempts to steal famous paintings, but runs into danger as he is pursued by the government.

''RASL'' draws influences from real-life events, people, and places, including [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture, and [[hardboiled]] [[crime fiction]]. The book's central storyline is narrated extensively through the protagonist's thoughts, aided by the use of flashbacks to tell the story of his past. Smith's art style is high-contrast black-and-white, and is notably more detailed and "human" than his previous work ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''. 
 
''RASL'' originally appeared in serial form in an independently published black-and-white [[comic book]] published from 2008–2012.

==Development==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Jeff Smith has stated that ''RASL'' came from a desire to do something completely different from his previous work ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''. He came up with the idea in 1999 during the process of inking ''Bone'', inspired by his thoughts of how films like ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the [[Bourne (film series)|Bourne film series]] could come together. Smith then talked to cartoonists [[Paul Pope]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] about the idea and gained support. Smith postponed his idea on ''RASL'' as to complete ''Bone'', and came back to it in 2007. He developed an idea of how the story would end and what would happen but needed to organize it into a full-fledged story. He flew out to [[Arizona]], as he knew the story would be set in the desert. He found the quiet and heat helped him develop his ideas for the story and characters. Smith was also interested in the visual aspects of [[film noir]], such as intense angles, heavy shadows, and a sense of discomfort. He then spent a year researching the latest in the theories of [[physics]], [[M-theory]], and [[string theory]] from the work of [[Brian Greene]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Carl Sagan]] to get a feel of what scientists believe is happening with [[Multiverse|parallel worlds]].

==Publication history==
[[self-publishing|Self-published]] through Smith's publishing company [[Cartoon Books]], the first issue of ''RASL'' was released in February 2008. Originally planned for three issues a year at 32 pages, the format was changed as of issue #5 to 24 pages (22 pages of comics, and a two-page [[Comic book letter column|letter column]] titled "RASLetters") for less wait in between. Issue #6 was delayed for an extensively long time, from October 2009 to January 2010. According to creator Jeff Smith's blog, the series was to go bimonthly with issue #7.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeff. [http://www.boneville.com/rasl-news-new-format-more-issues/ "RASL News: New Format, More Issues,"] Boneville.com (May 8, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the series' production, it was unclear whether ''RASL'' was supposed to be a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] or a standard ongoing series. However, in response to a fan's post on Smith's Facebook page on August 1, 2010,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} he commented; "I'm not sure how many issues there will be exactly, but you'll probably only have to be collecting ''RASL'' for about two more years", confirming that it was in fact an ongoing series, and that Smith estimated the series to end somewhere between 2012 and 2013. Smith hinted in the "RASLetters" section of issue #10 that either issue #15 or #16 would be the final issue of the series. Ultimately, the series ended with issue #15 in August 2012.

==Plot synopsis==
{{long plot|date=August 2012}}
The following synopses are cited directly from the collected editions of RASL, respectively.

===Chapter 1&amp;nbsp;– The Drift===
The story opens to RASL, a dimension-jumping art thief with a tattoo of a woman's name (Maya) on his left arm, wandering in a desert battered and bloody. He recollects his memories on a job where he steals a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] painting ("[[The Old Guitarist]]"). After tagging the location of the painting, RASL escapes from the police by using an immersion suit (resembling 4 airplane turbines strapped to his shoulders and legs and an African mask) to enter "The Drift", a place where he is able to travel to other dimensions.

He comes to a seemingly regular world and hides his suit, then visits a bar where he is the only one present. After some drinks and lighting a cigar, he looks through the songs on the jukebox, noticing that [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' album is instead credited to Robert Zimmerman, which is Bob Dylan's birthname. He realizes he is in the wrong place. As he is about to leave, an eerie assassin with a lizard like face comes in and shoots at RASL; as he escapes his painting is shot.

Outside the assassin chases him and a fight ensues, to which RASL beats and disarms the man. He finds no I.D. and is startled to see a small rectangle block in the man’s wrist. Hearing sirens, he decides to go find a quiet place to meditate for a couple of hours (to be put in a more zen-like state of purity so he may enter the Drift again) thinking to himself about how he knew someone could "figure it out eventually". His final lines as he meditates in the light of the moon are "You can fix this. It’s never too late to fix it." The story then cuts back to him one last time wandering in the desert.

===Chapter 2&amp;nbsp;– Annie===
RASL drives back into town after having returned to the real world. He comes to his client's house (a prostitute named Annie). Inviting him in, she notices RASL is in bad shape, and asks if he was "time traveling again". He corrects her by explaining that he jumps dimensions using "thermo-magnetic engines to bend the space" around him.  Annie notices the painting was shot in the foot and she can never show it to anyone. During a conversation RASL asks if Annie has seen the lizard face assassin (mentioning he was from "The Compound.") We also learn that under the assassin's wrist was a security chip. She has not seen the man. RASL is frustrated that "they" are unable to control him, so they sent an assassin.

Annie shows him a medallion depicting "The Man in the Maze" (a nickname for the [[I'itoi]]) which represents the journey of life and its turning points. During the conversation we see his point of view as he travels dimensions, mentioning while he is in the void, there are portals, and he goes through the one he sees. Annie believes that worlds also choose him. Later the two have sex and fall asleep. RASL wakes up later worried he felt something wrong (nervous he might be in the wrong place). However, Bob Dylan exists in this world and RASL decides to go out to a strip club and drink.

He returns later to find that Annie has been murdered, and a heart shape ripped from the painting covered in blood on Annie. RASL knows he must go after the assassin and gets his jeep. As he drives past The Compound he narrates about when he first played with magnets and learned [[Maxwell's equations]] to make his immersion suit. He asserts that "nothing is certain in the world of quantum physics." He gives an example of this by stating how electrons are not able to be pinned down in an atom. He narrates: "I can’t remember where I heard the theory that these particles were actually leaking into other dimensions. But I can remember the first time I followed one." He then burns the Picasso painting on a mountain top and uses his immersion suit to enter The Drift in a blast of light.

===Chapter 3&amp;nbsp;– Maya===
RASL re-enters the world where "Dylan isn't Dylan" on the same abandoned mountain top from Chapter 2 after having counted to 10. With his jeep gone he walks into town. At a bus stop he sees the Man in the Maze symbol used as an ad for a Maze of Life exhibit for a museum. As he contemplates finding a Jeep, he meets a shady character who introduces himself as "The President of the Street". RASL pays him 40 dollars for his help in finding a vehicle. Soon after, RASL begins his drive to the museum (during this we learn that he counts while drifting so he can focus and not black out). Blacking out is how he came to the current dimension the first time. Assuming Annie’s killer is following him, he wonders how he got the technology but admits it wouldn't be hard to master. However he mentions that two people saw his (RASL's) complete designs, and that one of them is dead.

The story flashes back to when he worked for The Compound (a military base). He works with a man named Miles and his wife Maya. We learn RASL’s name is Robert, and that he and his partners are working on a "St. George Array" (based on ideas by [[Nikola Tesla]]). According to Miles it’s an anti weapon which serves as a barrier against missiles. RASL feels reluctant going through with the plans, but Miles points out that in the past he supported Robert’s teleportation suits (t-suits). At this time, however, they do not function properly. The phone rings and Miles answers the call and tells them the project has now been green-lit and the budget doubled. While he gets a bottle of champagne Maya kisses RASL saying "Even if you could leave him, I know you can't leave me" (indicating an affair between them). Maya tells Miles Robert won't back out, leaving Robert himself unsure of the future.

In the museum he meets the curator who looks exactly like Maya who in this dimension doesn’t know him (instead her name is Uma Giles.) After showing her the silver medallion to examine she says it looks like [[Hopi]] silverwork, though his “friend” (Annie) was part [[Pima people|Pima]]. He leaves the museum shortly after making plans to meet her again, reeling from the experience. He decides to visit Annie’s house. As RASL is about to leave (after watching a client walk out of her house), the assassin with the lizard like face pulls up in a car to come kill her. RASL enters and sees the man has her hostage and greets him by his first name telling him, "You have something that belongs to us and we want it back."

RASL takes the gun and points it at the assassin but is startled when the assassin says that there are infinitely many different Annie’s but only one of he and Robert. A brutal fight ensues while Annie picks up the gun and aims it at both of them. The assassin runs outside while RASL makes sure Annie is ok. Outside, the assassin (with his own immersion suit) enters The Drift. RASL prepares to do the same telling Annie to get to safety. She asks where he is going, to which he replies “After him!” He enters the Drift, leaving this dimension’s Annie with the gun, in awe and bewildered.

===Chapter 4&amp;nbsp;– Opening Doors===
The story opens with RASL declaring himself a liar, in a world filled with liars. And that even a liar can find it difficult to tell what is truth and what is legend. During this, a boat spots a life raft holding a dead (and possibly mutated) sailor. We learn that this is 6 days prior to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]], which is narrated as follows:

In September 1943, a military convoy is leaving from Casablanca bound for Norfolk Virginia via the Atlantic (waters patrolled by German submarines in this era). As the ships pass within 100 miles from Bermuda, an immense flash is seen on the horizon, followed by the muffled sounds of depth charges. A distress call is picked up yet no ships or German subs are seen. 2 days pass and the calls and noises persist. The next day, the dead sailor is found. On the sixth night, a loud succession of explosions is heard and an unknown ship is seen with its stern on fire. Alarm is issued and the traveling boat goes to rescue the other. As they approach, it is gone and not seen nor detected on radar. Going further, the sailors look down into a trench in the shape of a hull. A loud pop of electricity is heard and the sailors look shocked at what is described as "a man-made horror/a travesty of nature." RASL narrates that this incident is the beginning of a series of lies that leads to the current point in his story. A quiet [[barrio]] in [[Tucson]].

Re-emerging from the Drift once more in a new dimension with the assassin, another brutal fight ensues at night in the street in a suburb area. The assassin draws his gun and points it at RASL, warning him to stay put. He looks at RASL, stating he looks nothing like his picture (addressing him by his full name, Robert Joseph Johnson). He notices drifting is killing him. The assassin asks if RASL came to "return the stolen property", but RASL has come only because of Annie's murder. The assassin warns RASL that he is meddling with forces he can't control, and that none of the worlds RASL visits are real, which is why he has never met himself. The assassin then reveals his name as Sal, that he is working for the Compound, and that they believe RASL has 2 journals stolen from the navy. He offers a truce for the journals in exchange for not killing RASL's "girlfriends" for 48 hours. RASL tries to make a grab for him but falls on the street, as Sal teleports away. Suddenly, he notices a very eerie and silent little girl who disappears quickly.

He goes to a nearby bar to drink and collect his thoughts. We learn through this that Nikola Tesla was working on magnetic fields for ships to detect German ships and repel mines during [[World War I]]. The assistant secretary of the navy at the time is [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. FDR becomes president and discusses the magnetic project with [[Albert Einstein]] during the period of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]]. RASL had seen the data of a full-scale test in which a ship blinked in and out of existence several times over 6 days; the experiment had horrific results, making the navy want to "close that door". However, RASL says he opened it again 2 years ago.

He walks out of the bar and sees the eerie girl again, who slaps the ground where he appeared and points to Annie's house. Unsure of what to make of this, RASL puts on his suit and returns once more to the dimension with no Bob Dylan. Checking on Annie, he is worried she doesn't know who he is. She addresses him as Robert, assures him and kisses him. As they do this, RASL slowly shuts the door of her house.

===Chapter 5&amp;nbsp;– Uma===
The story continues the morning after Anne and RASL have sex with Annie expressing her disbelief and amazement at RASL's explanation of his drifting technology. We learn that his first test was done in a desert of Arizona (where the story takes place) and it took 3 days to realize he was on another world. Knowing that this dimension's Annie saw the suit, Robert plans to leave to pull a new heist to get money while Annie can go somewhere safe. Annie questions RASL about her alternate versions RASL has seen or slept with. Asking why RASL wants to be with her, he simply says it is because they both are there. Keeping in mind that he destroyed The Compound's multibillion-dollar weapons division, he plans to not give the journals to them. Rob leaves, bloody and hurt from Drifting and has a short black out before and during driving.

During the second blackout the story flashes back to Robert coming back in the lab looking ill (we see the mask of his immersion suit hanging on the wall amongst other objects). RASL confesses that he tested a t-suit, that it worked, and expresses his want to postpone the St. George Array test (and shut down the Tesla Division) to analyze the calculations of his trip. Miles expresses his frustration and wonders if anything has to do with Robert and Maya's trip to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in Dayton, Ohio. Afterward, Miles picks up the phone and tells RASL to stick to a story, and that the head of security is arriving.

After the blackout, he pulls over and starts walking and sees the strange girl from Chapter 4 holding hands with a woman on the sidewalk (this is the second world he has seen her). Shortly, Maya (the Uma version) drives up to give him a ride to the museum to get his necklace (which Annie gave him). She offers him a private tour. During the drive, the story flashes back to Robert and Maya having sex during the Wright Patt trip (confirming Miles' suspicions). Maya confesses she wishes to be with Robert all the time. They discuss their schedule which includes a research meeting and another meeting with [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|H.A.A.R.P.]] to discuss Maya's bio-theories on low frequencies. RASL plans to go to the archives to check out U.F.O. conspiracies.

The story returns to RASL staring at Maya as she gives a tour, and notices he isn't listening, smiling seductively. The story then flashes back to when RASL meets Alvin Bester, a man who works in the archives. He tells RASL of his reputation he's been building and also reminds him of his desire to shut down the Tesla Division. Bester gives RASL Nikola Tesla's 2 missing journals. RASL has a look of shock and fright upon reading one of the journals. The story flashes back to Maya and RASL embraced, kissing in the museum.

===Chapter 6&amp;nbsp;– The Mad Scientist===
The story continues after the date with Maya with RASL reflecting on his and Miles' fascination with the life of Nikola Tesla and his "electrification" of the world. His exposition includes Tesla's relationship and rivalry with [[Thomas Edison]], which leads into a further explanation of the [[War of Currents]]. Halfway through this, RASL is seen breaking into a parallel version of the penthouse from Chapter 1 to obtain a new Old Guitarist painting.

He continues his story of Tesla by emphasizing that he felt electricity was a life force, and made plans to create wireless energy transmissions in a laboratory in the Colorado Rockies. The story then goes back to RASL to show that his job was successful as he receives pay from the owner of a casino (who allows RASL to go and enjoy it). The story jumps back into a further narration of Tesla's competition, specifically [[Guglielmo Marconi]]. Meanwhile, the company which Tesla and his partner [[George Westinghouse]] ran was in financial trouble, but Tesla temporarily saved it. The story goes to the present in the real world to a scene where RASL brings the painting to his friend Pauly in a casino office. Pauly gives RASL a free pass to enjoy the casino. RASL continues his recollection of Tesla.

Ultimately the residents in the area of Tesla's lab grew tired of the thunder being emitted, and he left to go meet [[J.P. Morgan]]. After working for Morgan, he is abandoned for Marconi (being that he became the first to transmit signals over the Atlantic Ocean). RASL for a moment sympathizes with Tesla but lets his story serve as a cautionary tale as he sits at a poker table with a drink. Sal approaches him from behind to confront him, questioning him as to why he does not have the journals. After realizing the casino set him up (because security isn't called to his aide), RASL tries to fight Sal drunk, but is smashed over the head with the butt of his gun.

===Chapter 7&amp;nbsp;– Brighter Than the Sun===
The story continues with RASL narrating [[The Tunguska Event]], expressing his belief that Nikola Tesla's attempt at putting his world system on line was the cause. The story then flashes back to The Compound. Robert and Miles' friendship has fallen apart with Robert having left the St. George project but persistent in advising Miles not to test the weapon. Miles is skeptical at RASL's advisions, seeing that he had, without authorization, taken the t-suit and accidentally discovered other worlds. During an exchange, RASL reveals his knowledge of the existence of Tesla's journals. Miles, infuriated that RASL had kept them secret, throws a laptop through a window. Ranting in an almost madness-driven manner. Maya comes in worried to break up the fight, to which Miles (reading Robert and Maya's faces) realizes their affair. RASL is taken out of the building by security, stating that after seven years of research, his time at The Compound was done. Three days before the St. George test, however, Robert returns to take his t-suit and drifts, conscious of it for the first time (and jamming the array in the process). Because of the electromagnetic effects drifting and a guilty conscience, RASL develops a drinking habit.

He wakes up in the present after the confrontation with Sal in the casino office from Chapter 6 (located in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]). Present in the room is Sal, along with Kalani Adams, the security head of the compound. Sal's full name is revealed as Salvador Crow, and that he has undergone training under the authority of The Department of [[Homeland Security]]. Also—that he is part of a "watchdog group" created by the [[Patriot Act]]. In conversation with Kalani, it is learned the department considers the new worlds (if real) a potential security risk. RASL expresses that they are real, to which Sal is disgusted by the thought of considering that so. We also learn that the St. George array is being rebuilt. RASL reveals his t-suit works because energy is shared in all the universes and that energy is transferred. In addition he states the barrier is thin and trying to create the St. George weapon is ill-advised, because an energy gusher could be opened up causing devastating consequences. Choosing to see this as a way to convince RASL to bring her the journals, Kalani offers an ultimatum to bring them in 24 hours or be locked away.

RASL is taken away by Sal and tossed out on the edge of town, telling him that he is still seeking out Annie. RASL's narration of the past is further revealed as he states that three days after jamming the weapon, he drifted back to Tucson and rented a jeep, knowledgeable of where he hid the journals. After driving out of town, he recalls seeing a flash in the mirror, and witnesses (along with other drivers who had gotten out of their cars) a devastating explosion from The Compound. The story flashes back to the present one last time with RASL standing in the desert where Sal left him, with the eerie girl he'd met earlier right behind him.

===Chapter 8&amp;nbsp;– Romance at the Speed of Light===

We pick up right from the end of the last chapter with RASL reflecting back on his motto, "It's never too late to fix it." He thinks back to a warning that Annie gave him— That he is an addictive personality and would run back to Maya, even if her motives seemed suspect. We then flash to a new scene in which Robert breaks off the affair with Maya (much to her dismay). We then jump to RASL watching the news after the explosion at the Compound (talked about at the end of Chapter 7). The entire team which includes Miles is rescued, but not Maya. We then cut to a scene in which RASL gets a tattoo in her memory. We jump two years later (to the present) and RASL realizes there is the eerie little girl is standing behind him.

RASL tries to communicate with the girl and see if she followed him from a parallel universe. But she motions for RASL to take off his jacket, and then crosses out Maya's name on his arm (to RASL's confusion). She then draws a diagram in the dirt which shocks RASL, as he backs away he bumps into The President of the Street, who recognizes RASL from their last meet (in Chapter 3) despite them not being in the world in which they met. RASL asks if the man knows who the little girl is, and he states that she is God.

===Chapter 9&amp;nbsp;– The Warning===

RASL contemplates God, existence and the origins of the universe through various Native American myths and stories. Included is a visual reference to the Man in the Maze who is described as "Elder Brother". We then pick up from where we left off, with RASL walking along in the desert to town and The President of the Streets behind him with the little girl (who he claims to be God). The President is recalling a story of how he saw a UFO when RASL stops momentarily to question the man's claim of the little girl being God. When The President makes references to Nikola Tesla and his downfall, RASL suddenly takes hold of the man angrily, and the little girl calms him down.

RASL explains to her that the drawing she made in the sand in the previous chapter is from Tesla's journals. The diagram/drawing makes reference to his Unified Field Theory which explains the ideas of dimensions and universes overlapping, along with shared energy. RASL explains that in order to tap into those dimensions, high frequencies of energy are needed, which would crack a hole in reality itself (which he states is what happened in The Philadelphia Experiment). He also worries that that is exactly what will happen if the St. George array is activated.

RASL decides to go and get Annie like he planned (after he'd side-tracked in Las Vegas in Chapter 6) and The President and the girl seem to vanish. RASL goes to a parking garage to pick up his Jeep and finds a figure going through his trunk, dressed in a T-Suit. He chases the figure, and is positive it isn't Sal (because of the person's dexterity and height). He almost catches the figure but they drift out of his reach with the T-Suit engines. RASL muses that he'll have to keep his Jeep locked up.

==Characters==
;Dr. Robert Joseph Johnson/"RASL"
:The main character of the series.

;Salvador "Sal" Crow/"The Lizard-Faced Man"
:An assassin working for The Compound who tried to kill RASL, which sets the initial present story in motion.

;Annie
:A prostitute and somewhat of a girlfriend of RASL. She seemed to have some knowledge of the Compound and held a relationship with RASL (providing spiritual guidance for him at one point). She is killed in the real world, but an Annie from the world with no Bob Dylan is saved but left bewildered at the events of what happened. She is later visited again by RASL and now knows of his technology and identity. RASL made plans for her to leave her home should he not return at a certain point from pulling a new heist. She is part Pima.

;Miles Riley
:A scientist and childhood friend whom RASL worked with in the past (appearing in flashbacks) who  helped work to make a St. George Array, and was frustrated at RASL's reluctance to go through with the project. From the flashbacks it could be inferred that he and RASL had frequent disagreements because of this. It is revealed in Chapter 7 that Miles was caught in an explosion after attempting to go through with the St. George Array test without the proper equipment and knowledge to do so, resulting in a blast which destroyed the building. Chapter 8, however, reveals that he was apparently found, though his condition was left a mystery.

;Maya Riley
:Miles' wife whom RASL was having an affair with at the time he was working with them. She appears in a flashback with Miles in Chapter 3 and again in Chapter 5 where she and RASL are on a trip to Wright-Patt. An alternate version exists whose name is Uma Giles working as a museum curator, to whom RASL visits again on a date.  She was also caught in the St George's explosion, but no trace was found of her.

;"The Spooky Little Girl"
:A nameless, eerie little girl that RASL begins to notice following him beginning in Chapter 4. She is short, wide-eyed, and wears rather ragged clothes and has a fearful and almost mindless expression on her face most times. In Chapter 8, The President of the Street says that she is God.

;"The President of the Street"
:A homeless, shady character who appeared in Chapter 3 (only in the collection The Drift, not the individual issue). He is characterized by his knowledge of the streets, as his name suggests, and accepts money to do favors for people. He reappears in Chapter 8, recognizing RASL (though this time, it is in a different world) and seems to be friends with The Spooky Little Girl, stating that she is God.

'''''Ralph Breaks the Internet''''' (originally titled '''''Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2''''') is a 2018 American [[3D film|3D]] [[computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as well as the studio's 57th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|feature-length film]]. It is the second installment of the [[Wreck-It Ralph (franchise)|''Wreck-It Ralph'' film series]] and the sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''. It is directed by [[Rich Moore]] and [[Phil Johnston (filmmaker)|Phil Johnston]], written by Johnston and [[Pamela Ribon]], and executive-produced by [[John Lasseter]], [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], and [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]].{{efn|Lasseter acted as the film's executive producer until June 2018 (5 months before the film's release), when he left Disney.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/08/pixar-co-founder-john-lasseter-to-leave-disney-after-missteps.html|title=Pixar co-founder to leave Disney after 'missteps'|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=June 8, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios by Lee, who was announced to be replacing Lasseter as executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/pete-docter-jennifer-lee-lead-pixar-disney-animation-1121432 | title = Pete Docter, Jennifer Lee to Lead Pixar, Disney Animation | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = June 19, 2018 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ultimately received a jointed executive producer credit, along with Williams.&lt;ref name=PressKit /&gt;}} It features [[John C. Reilly]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Ed O'Neill]] reprising their roles from the first film, with [[Alan Tudyk]] returning to voice a new character, alongside new additions to the cast including [[Gal Gadot]], [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Bill Hader]] (in an uncredited role), and [[Alfred Molina]].

Talks for a ''Wreck-It Ralph'' sequel began in October 2012, and went through three different scripts before settling on the final plot. The film was officially announced in June 2016, with much of the original cast confirming they had signed on, with new members being added in 2018. It marks the first feature-length theatrical sequel from Walt Disney Animation Studios since ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' in 2011, which was a sequel to the 1977 animated film ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. It is also the studio's first animated sequel to be created by the original film's writing/directing team.&lt;ref name="PressKit"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' had its world premiere at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on November 5, 2018, and was released in the United States on November 21, 2018. The film has grossed $207 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from critics, who called it a "worthy successor" and praised the animation, humor, characters and storyline, as well as the vocal performances of Reilly and Silverman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreman|first=Alison|title=Critics give 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' a big thumbs up |url=https://mashable.com/article/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review-roundup.amp|accessdate=November 14, 2018|work=[[Mashable]]|date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Christopher|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet First Reviews: A Hilarious, Heartwarming Sequel|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/ralph-breaks-the-internet-first-reviews/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 28, 2018|date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. Current word count is 673.--&gt;

Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz have been best friends since their misadventures six years ago, hanging out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. While Ralph is content, Vanellope admits being bored with her game's predictability as they learn that Mr. Litwak installed a [[Wi-Fi]] router. Ralph's attempt to cheer her up by creating a secret bonus track for her causes her to override the player controls to race on it, resulting with the steering wheel controller accidentally destroyed. Though one of the kids finds a replacement wheel on [[eBay]] after he reveals the company that made ''Sugar Rush'' is defunct, Mr. Litwak finds it too expensive and has no choice but to unplug ''Sugar Rush'' with the game's citizens left homeless.

After a conversation with Fix-It Felix Jr. in [[Tapper (video game)|Tapper]]'s when a despondent Vanellope doesn't show up, Ralph decides to enter the Internet to obtain the new wheel on eBay. Ralph brings Vanellope with him as they reach eBay and buy the wheel, finding they need money to pay the winning bid within 24 hours of purchase. The two turn to a [[Pop-up ad|pop-up advertiser]] named Spamley to make money fast, given the advertiser's most expensive job which requires them to steal a valuable car belonging to Shank from the violent online game ''Slaughter Race''. Ralph and Vanellope steal the car, but are forced to return it after a high-speed chase, Shank complimenting Vanellope's driving skills before recording a concerned Ralph being humiliated and pointing the pair toward the [[video sharing]] site [[BuzzFeed|Buzzz]][[YouTube|Tube]]. After meeting with its chief algorithm Yesss and learning that he made a [[Digital currency|profit]], Ralph decides to subject himself to a series of videos playing off popular trends to pay eBay.

As Ralph's videos become a viral sensation, Vanellope joins Yesss's staff in spamming users with pop-up ads. But Ralph convinces Yesss to send Vanellope to a Disney [[fansite]], where she meets the [[Disney Princesses]] while escaping from [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]]. Despite learning of the hurtful comments that users made on his videos, Ralph successfully earns enough money to cover the eBay bid. When Ralph contacts Vanellope when she doesn't show up to eBay after calling her prior to her musical epiphany, he inadvertently overhears her confessing to Shank that she wants to stay in ''Slaughter Race''. Desperate to not lose Vanellope, Ralph turns to Spamley for a way to make ''Slaughter Race'' too boring for Vanellope just like what happened when they are playing Tron. Ralph is taken by Spamley to meet Double Dan, a [[computer virus|virus]] designer hiding in the [[dark web]], and receives an Insecurity Virus which replicates any flaw it finds. When Ralph unleashes the virus in ''Slaughter Race'', it replicates Vanellope's glitch across the game with Vanellope almost killed when the server reboots.

When Ralph admits his misdeed to Vanellope when she assumed the crash was her fault, she angrily leaves after taking the medal she made for him and throwing it away. But as Ralph recovers the broken medal, the virus escapes from ''Slaughter Race'' and scans Ralph's insecurities. This results in a legion of Ralph clones that destroy the Internet to find Vanellope. The real Ralph finds her as they and Yesss attempt to lead the clones to an anti-virus software trap as said by a search result from Knowsmore. But the plan fails when Ralph clones aggregate into a giant Ralph that grabs Vanellope with Ralph fighting a losing battle, Vanellope surrendering as Ralph was about to get killed. But Ralph refuses to accept this and calls the clones out on their possessiveness while admitting that Vanellope's desire to enter ''Slaughter Race'' does not mean that their friendship must end. With his insecurities resolved, Ralph falls as the clones disintegrate before being saved by the Disney Princesses. The Internet is restored and Vanellope decides to stay in ''Slaughter Race'' after Shank arranged her to [[Spawning (gaming)|respawn]] in her new home, giving her half of his medal. As ''Sugar Rush'' is plugged back in, Ralph comes to terms with changes as he begins participating in social activities with other game characters while staying in touch with Vanellope through video chats.

In a mid-credits scene, Ralph and Vanellope [[Crash (computing)|crash]] a child's Pancake Milkshake game on her tablet. In a [[post-credits scene]], a ''[[Frozen 2]]'' trailer is teased, only for Ralph to [[rickroll]] the audience, making it [[clickbait]].

On March 24, 2016, Moore stated that a sequel was still being planned.

====Writing====
Two working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film, according to head writer Josie Trinidad. In one version, Vanellope had become self-absorbed by the Internet, gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users. Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore, and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self. A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet-famous celebrity, and would have been challenged by an [[Antivirus software|anti-virus program]] named Bev that served as a super cop and would have been the story's villain. Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel, being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-had-a-few-totally-different-p-1829920568 | title = Ralph Breaks the Internet Had a Few Totally Different Plots Before It Was Done | first = Germain | last =  Lussier | date = October 25, 2018 | accessdate = October 25, 2018 | work = [[io9]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Clark Spencer said that "the film is about change. Two best friends are about to realize that the world won’t always be the same. The internet is the perfect setting, really, because it’s all about change—things change by the second".&lt;ref name="PressKit"/&gt;{{rp|17}} Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet, stating that "[They] looked at how [they] could make the internet relatable on a human level—like how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie. In ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet,’ any person who uses the internet has a little avatar version of themselves that does their business for them".&lt;ref name="PressKit"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Reardon, however, said that Disney "didn’t want to make the movie about the internet", wanting to instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, wanting to instead treat the Internet as "the place where the movie takes place".&lt;ref name="PressKit"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers "didn’t want to just give the audience more of that friendship — [people had] to see that relationship grow."&lt;ref name="PressKit"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

The design of the scenes within the Internet was based on tours made of [[One Wilshire]] in Los Angeles, as it is one of the world's largest telecommunications centers, serving most traffic around the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies (outside of Disney) that are represented in the Internet, and strived to include net branding from all across the world.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; They also had to explore various [[Internet meme]]s, making sure to avoid those that lacked long-term presence on the Internet.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet, the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it, in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within ''[[Zootopia]]''.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; Such elements include Ralph reading through comment sections on videos to find users leaving disparaging messages about him, and having the pair travel to the dark web with its activities of questionable legal and ethical status. They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in ''Zootopia'', where she experienced, learned, and overcame the racism aspects, and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreck-it-ralph-2-wont-shy-away-from-the-internets-/1100-6461930/ | title = Wreck-It Ralph 2 Won't Shy Away From The Internet's Dark Side | first = Michael | last = Rougeau | date = September 20, 2018 | accessdate = September 20, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter [[Pamela Ribon]]. In 2014, Ribon was still working on ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to ''Wreck-It Ralph'', Ribon recognized that like the title character of ''Moana'', Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess. When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of ''[[Zootopia]]'', Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney.com, the Disney fan-driven website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Oh My Disney – Official Site|url=https://ohmy.disney.com|publisher=Disney|accessdate=October 22, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016144646/https://ohmy.disney.com/|archivedate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further inspiration came from a ''[[Buzzfeed]]'' online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was; Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt; Ribon's initial script for the scene, playing off the various tropes of the Princesses such as several being kidnapped or enslaved, remains mostly intact through production. Animators had to work out various techniques to take the different styles of animation into a single approach, and figure out the proportions of the characters to themselves using official figurines.&lt;ref name="DisneyPrincessScene"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/20/ralph-breaks-the-internet-inside-the-disney-princess-scene-everyones-talking-about | title = Ralph Breaks The Internet: Inside The Disney Princess Scene Everyone's Talking About | first = William | last =Bibbiani | date = September 20, 2018 | accessdate = September 20, 2018  |work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Casting===

===Animation===
The picture contains over 150 unique sets and 5,726 assets. It also included the highest number of characters in any Disney Animation film, with 434 individual characters with 6,752 variants.&lt;ref name="gamespot 31t"/&gt;

Following the initial trailer for the film, which included the first shots of the Disney Princesses, [[Tiana (Disney)|Tiana]], the lead character from the 2009 film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' and of [[African-American]] heritage, appeared to have a lighter skin tone, a narrower nose, and European features in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' than in the 2009 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brucculieri|first=Julia|date=August 13, 2018|title=Disney Accused Of Lightening Princess Tiana’s Skin Tone In ‘Wreck It Ralph’ Sequel|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wreck-it-ralph-tiana-white-wash_us_5b719a80e4b0bdd0620b4444|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=October 8, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006123535/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wreck-it-ralph-tiana-white-wash_us_5b719a80e4b0bdd0620b4444#|archivedate=October 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to some backlashes on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African-Americans.&lt;ref name="AnimationMagazine"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|date=September 23, 2018|title=Disney Reanimates ‘Ralph’s Tiana After Colorism Criticism|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-reanimates-ralphs-tiana-after-colorism-criticism/|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=October 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926124044/http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-reanimates-ralphs-tiana-after-colorism-criticism/|archivedate=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Tiana's voice actress [[Anika Noni Rose]] and the advocacy group [[Color of Change]] contacted Disney to redesign Tiana for ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' to make her look closer to her 2009 appearance, which was reintroduced in the second trailer.&lt;ref name="AnimationMagazine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gutierrez|first=Lisa|date=September 27, 2018|title=Anika Noni Rose goes to bat for Princess Tiana after Disney lightens her skin tone|url=https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article219100720.html|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|accessdate=October 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928122646/https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article219100720.html|archivedate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same treatment was made given to [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the titular character of the [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|1995 film]], who had been pointed out by many viewers that she was given a much lighter skin tone.&lt;ref name="AnimationMagazine"/&gt;

One of the initial scenes created for the movie involved Ralph and Vanellope invading a childrens' game, involving feeding pancakes to a bunny to the point it appears to explode, subsequently frightening the child that was playing the game. This scene was featured in the film's original teaser, released in March 2018, and was heavily discussed in buzz about the film. Over time as they developed the rest of the film, they found the scene no longer fit in the film they were presenting. Knowing that audiences would be asking for this scene, it was moved to the mid-credits scene, along with additional [[fourth wall]] commentary about scenes shown in trailers that go missing in the final film.&lt;ref name="io9 credit scenes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://io9.gizmodo.com/ralph-breaks-the-internets-post-credit-scenes-came-with-1830476959 | title=  Ralph Breaks the Internet's Post-Credit Scenes Came With Some Major Hurdles  | first = Germain | last = Lussier | date = November 26, 2018 | accessdate = November 26, 2018 | work = [[io9]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final post-credits scene involves what starts as a teaser for the upcoming ''Frozen 2'' film (due in 2019) but ends up with Ralph "[[rickrolling]]" the audience by starting to sing [[Rick Astley]]'s "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]". While producers Spencer and Moore had an idea of Ralph doing a "Wreck Roll" early on in the film's development, they never incorporated it into the story. Late in production, they mentioned this to studio executives who told them they should add it in. As it was one of the last scenes added, the producers had gotten Reilly, who was on vacation with his family at the time, to come in to a New York studio to record for the day so that the animators could work from that.&lt;ref name="io9 credit scenes"/&gt;

Bilge Ebiri, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', gave the film a positive review, saying that "somewhere amid the film’s ornate imagery and deliriously irreverent humor, we might begin to realize that we’re watching a terrifying, incisive satire about the ways that a life lived online makes monsters of us all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebiri|first=Bilge|title=‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ Review: Disney Gets Caught in the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/movies/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review.html|date=November 19, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry, of ''[[CNN]]'', said that "The colorful action should delight tykes, but the smart, media-savvy asides make it especially appealing to grownups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title='Ralph Breaks the Internet' runs up score on clever plot|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/19/entertainment/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review/index.html|date=November 19, 2018|publisher=[[CNN]]|work=CNN Entertainment|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry Lengel, of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, saying that "what makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience—our love affair, really—with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lengel|first=Kerry|title=‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ review: All hail our pop-culture overlords|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/2018/11/19/ralph-breaks-internet-review-all-hail-our-pop-culture-overlords-1-2/2005053002/|date=November 16, 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Hartalub, of ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, stating that the film is "almost always inspired in the moment" and said that "the new characters are all pretty great", though he said that the film's first third "struggles to find its focus", and felt that Felix and Calhoun's subplot "would have worked better as a pre-movie animated short".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartalub|first=Peter|title=‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ is a fun and inspired sequel, glitches and all|url=https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/ralph-breaks-the-internet-is-a-fun-and-inspired-sequel-glitches-and-all|date=November 19, 2018|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Bumbray, of ''JoBlo's Movie Emporium'', said that the film "is just as solid" as the first film, and said it was better than the science-fiction film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bumbray|first=Chris|title=REVIEW: RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/review-ralph-breaks-the-internet|date=November 16, 2018|work=[[JoBlo.com]]|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Hudson of ''[[Exclaim]]'' praised the film but criticized its "brand synergy," calling it "a peculiar piece of meta-fiction and a shameless advertisement for Disney's many subsidiary film studios." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=Alex|title='Ralph Breaks the Internet' Will Make You Want to Go Online Shopping|url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/ralph_breaks_the_internet_will_make_you_want_to_go_online_shopping-directed_by_rich_moore_and_phil_johnston|date=November 16, 2018|work=[[Exclaim]]|accessdate=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Jones, of ''Observer'', gave the film 2.5 score, saying that "''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' is a candy coated, hard shined brick of postmodernism—a Vitamix smoothie of gags, nostalgia, product placement and Fruity Pebbles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Oliver|title=The Dizzying Digital Wonderland in ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ Will Give You Whiplash|url=https://observer.com/2018/11/the-dizzying-digital-wonderland-in-ralph-breaks-the-internet-will-give-you-whiplash/|date=November 14, 2018|work=[[The New York Observer]]|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alonso Duralde]], of ''[[TheWrap]]'', said that "Within a few years, the specifics of the viral-video gags in ''Ralph Breaks the Internet'' will be as dated as a [[Tay Zonday]] joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duralde|first=Alonso|title=‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’ Film Review: Disappointing Sequel Offers a Few Good Clicks|url=https://www.thewrap.com/ralph-breaks-the-internet-film-review-sarah-silverman-gal-gadot/|date=November 14, 2018|work=TheWrap|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bradshaw, of ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the "sequel to the 2012 film is somewhere between ''Ready Player One'' and ''[[The Emoji Movie]]'', summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Ralph Breaks the Internet review – virtually impossible to enjoy tiresome arcade game re-run|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/21/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review-virtually-impossible-to-enjoy-tiresome-arcade-game-re-run|date=November 21, 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iceberg.svg|thumb|20% is above the surface ('''content aspect''') and 80% is underneath the surface ('''relation aspect''').]]

In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], '''relationship aspect''' refers to the quality of interpersonal cooperation in terms of [[intuition|intuitive]], [[affect (psychology)|emotional]] and social inner relatedness, which makes people feel connected outside of the content aspect.

Openness, honesty, reliability, [[emotional intelligence]] and other [[Key Skills Qualification|key skills]] are required to develop and deepen a good relationship.

== Relevance ==
In order for [[communication]] processes within familiar or business relationships and especially inside of [[Love|romantic]] relationships to succeed, the quality of the relationship aspect is of prime importance. According to [[Sigmund Freud]], trust, empathy, and shared values, along with preconceptions or fears and wishes, determine the success of interpersonal communication by more than 80 percent.

The iceberg model states that the relationship aspect has a much greater impact on communication than the content level, but also that it often works subconsciously.

=== Social context ===
[[Social skills|Social competence]] generally refers to skills needed for social behavior. The term “social” can be understood within the field of social-psychology as “interpersonal”, sociological-value-neutral (as in “societal”) or as sociological-judgemental (as in “social-moral”). It describes the different dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Which interpersonal relationships and mismeetings (Martin Buber) will unfold, which conflicts may develop, and which of the existing conflicts can possibly be solved? Courage, the ability to overcome something, and risk are fundamental traits in developing social skills and stable relationships. Their quality can generally be measured on the basis of the [[social status|status]], [[power (social and political)|power]] and influence within a [[social structure]] as well as the [[physical attractiveness|choice of partner]].

The ability to develop stable relationships is strongly based on the following features:

* [[Team|Teamwork]]
* [[Knowledge of human nature]]
* [[Empathy]] (compassion)
* [[Communication]] skills
* [[Criticism|Critical faculties]]
* [[Self-confidence]]
* [[Cooperation]]
* [[Perception]]

=== Economic context ===
The economic importance of the relationship aspect between employees and colleagues, or customers, or suppliers, becomes clear during [[business administration|business]] exchange processes, particularly within teams and in the sales area. Since [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] is an essential factor for the disposition to engage in [[money|monetary]] exchange processes, considerable efforts are made in this area to secure a defined relationship aspect, with the help of electronic records (see: [[customer relationship management|CRM]]).

The relationship aspect is of particular importance in the economic context for [[multi-level marketing|marketing]]. The economic importance of personal relationships is in no other [[distribution (marketing)|sales area]] of [[marketing]] as important as it is here. Consequently, the success of networking depends very much on the number of people one knows and their level of trust. Naturally, these are first and foremost close relatives and good friends. These people are seen as potential customers and future independent employees. Visits to these people are primarily for the purpose of selling products and recruiting them to the business. In this context, aspects of [[business ethics]] also play a direct role.

The efforts to establish a mutually beneficial business relationship on the basis of a "good relationship aspect" are represented by various concepts in the spirit of the [[win-win strategy]]. The "[[getting to yes]]" theory, in particular, aims to make the relationship between the two parties as good as possible and the dispute as clear as necessary (principle: "Separate the people from the problem").

=== Rhetorical context ===
Within the argumentation, the relationship to the use of the relationship aspect is based on emotional arguments which are supported by preconceptions, personal references, experience and the credibility of the speaker. The logically valid deductive reasoning on the other hand completely excludes the relationship aspect between speaker and audience. Since [[Plato]], [[dialectics]] has established itself as a school of argumentation. Dialectics aims to promote an inner understanding and willingness to compromise, comprising three stages of development: a thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis.

== Conflict resolution ==
Another method for solving interpersonal conflicts in the relationship aspect has been successfully established with [[systemic therapy]] or systemic [[organisational development]]. All persons and institutions involved with their needs and expectations, as well as the interactions with each other, are considered neutral. In this way, it is usually possible to clarify the relationship disturbances beyond the [[pure reasoning]] approach.

Another form of conflict resolution for a disturbed relationship aspect is [[mediation]]. This person mediates between parties in order to find a pragmatic solution, usually a compromise. In contrast to more therapeutically oriented systemic work, mediation is more frequently encountered in business.

From the theoretical background of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Gestalt therapy]] and [[humanistic psychology]], a third concept has been established, called [[theme-centered interaction]], which was developed by the educator and psychoanalyst [[Ruth Cohn]] to improve relationships within groups. The aim of TCI is to open up better possibilities of communication through understanding interrelationships and through emotional experience. The result is an interaction model that treats the person, the group and the task as a model unit, where each is equally important and where the context of communication is always taken into consideration.

== Representation ==
The [[genogram]] has been established as an instrument for the graphical representation of a bipolar or polypolar relationship aspect. Dependencies and informal structures that would be hardly recognizable on the surface can be visualized more easily with the help of graphical relationship lines between the participants. The mediator, the systemic organizational developer, or the [[therapist]] uses this image to reduce tension and previously hidden conflicts.

In Italian theatrical culture, the term '''sciantosa''' ({{IPA-it|ʃanˈtoːsa; -oːza|pron}}; {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|it|sciantose}}) refers to a [[stock character]] that developed from the late 19th Century through the early 20th Century&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2001/11/11/cafe-chantant-alla-romana.html C. Rendina, ''Cafè chantant alla romana''] "Repubblica", 11 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; in such popular genres such as [[café-concert]], [[variety show]], ''[[avanspettacolo]]'', and [[revue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_italiano/S/sciantosa.shtml Definition of "sciantosa" in the Sabatini Coletti Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a distortion of the [[French language|French]] word {{lang|fr|[[chanteuse]]}} (feminine form of "singer"), and was originally used for female singers that performed [[opera]] or [[operetta]] [[aria]]s in ''[[café-chantant]]'' venues.  As such, the "sciantosa" was a sort of scaled-down version of the opera "[[diva]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/08/30/lina-cavalieri-la-trasteverina-piu-bella-del.html C. Rendina, ''Lina Cavalieri, la trasteverina più bella del mondo''], "Repubblica", 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on, the term acquired further implications, most notably that of ''[[femme fatale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Livio Jannattoni, ''Roma Belle Epoque'', Multigrafica Editrice, Rome 1986, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular sciantose often had (or pretended to have) mysterious and exotic traits, such as a foreign accent, a turbulent past, or romantic affairs with lovers from the [[jet set]].  To emphasize their reputation of divas, prominent sciantose hired a [[claque]] to follow their shows.

Some of the most well known sciantose were [[Anna Fougez]], [[Gilda Mignonette]], [[Olimpia D'Avigny]], and [[Yvonne De Fleuriel]]. 

With the advent of cinema and television, many forms of popular theatrical shows faded, and so did the "sciantosa" archetype, whose traits were partially transferred to new roles such as the [[soubrette]] or the [[showgirl]].

The 1971 film ''[[La Sciantosa]]'', by director [[Alfredo Giannetti]], portrays a typical sciantosa (played by [[Anna Magnani]]).

In '''[[Slavic Native Faith]]''' ('''Rodnovery''') there are a number of shared '''[[holiday]]s''' throughout the year, when important ritual activities are set according to shared '''[[calendar]]s'''. Generally speaking, ritual activities may be distinguished into "external" (exoteric) and "internal" (esoteric) relatively to the different communities. External ceremonies are mass gatherings, usually held on important holidays dedicated to the worship of common gods, and involving large numbers of people. Internal ceremonies are those restricted to specific groups, and holding special meaning for such groups; they may comprise private rituals and worship of specific ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;"Native faith: The congress of the 'Circle of Pagan Tradition' (Родная вера: съезд 'Круга языческой традиции')".

===General Russian Rodnover calendar of holidays===
According to the Rodnover questions–answers compendium ''Izvednik'' (Изведник), almost all Russian Rodnovers rely upon the [[Gregorian calendar]] and celebrate the "sunny holidays" (highlighted in yellow in the table herebelow), with the addition of holidays dedicated to Perun, Mokosh and Veles (green herebelow), the Red Hill ancestral holiday (orange herebelow), and five further holidays dedicated to ancestors (including Вешние Деды, "Spring Forefathers"; Трояцкие Деды, "Whitsun Forefathers"; Дмитровские Деды, "[[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]] Forefathers"; and Рождественские Деды, "Christmas Forefathers", etc.).

===Ynglist calendar of holidays===
[[Ynglism]] respects eight holidays throughout the year. They are arranged in a "year's wheel" (кологод, ''kologod'') and they correspond to the eight major deities of nature. Holidays are called "thresholds" (порог, ''porog'') and they mark the beginning of various phases of the year. There are also overarching phases: the phase between the holidays of Koliada and Kupalo is that of the blossoming of males, while the phase between Lelia and Mokosh that of the blossoming of females. The threshold of Perun marks a period of quiescence of forces, while the subsequent Mara is a phase that is unfavourable for both sexes. Each holiday and the period that it begins has appropriate, different ritual actions to be carried out; Ynglists believe that if one behaves incorrectly, his life cycle is disrupted, he becomes unhealthy and quickly grows old.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"&gt;{{cite web |title=Кологод — природосообразность (Year's wheel – accordance with nature) |url=http://derzhavarus.ru/kologod-prirodosoobraznost.html |website=Derzhava Rus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701121158/http://derzhavarus.ru/kologod-prirodosoobraznost.html |archive-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Festival!!Meaning!!Period
|- bgcolor="#E0F0FF"
| '''Koliada''' || Winter solstice. This is the threshold that marks the beginning of the spiral of the new year; forces are ready for their expansion in new creations. Men are instructed by ancestors on how to project the new year.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || December
|- bgcolor="#E0F0FF"
| '''Veles''' || [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is the god of the underworld and of wild nature, from which new growth may develop. The Veles threshold marks the period in which man thinks how to interact with natural laws and resources in order to bring his projects to completion.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || February
|- bgcolor="#F0D0F0"
| '''Lelia''' || Spring equinox. The Lelia threshold is moment when the male transmits his power to the female, and symbolises impregnation, in which their power is perfectly balanced. In this phase projects are sown into matter.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || March–April
|- bgcolor="#F0D0F0"
| '''Yarilo''' || The Yarilo threshold marks the phase when powers sprout. In nature, everything starts its growth and things mate with one another (in Slavic called яриться, ''yaritsya''). In this time for merrymaking and feasts, and is a period of great creativity.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || May–mid June
|- bgcolor="#F0D0F0"
| '''Kupalo''' || Summer solstice. This is the threshold when forces reach their utmost strength, and marks the phase when it is more likely for healthy children to be born.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || Mid June–July
|- bgcolor="#F0FFD0"
| '''Perun''' || It is the threshold that marks the full maturity of males. On the day of Perun men show their skills with weapons and in crafts. At the same time it marks the start of the decline of youth, while women are in bloom.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || August
|- bgcolor="#FFE0F0"
| '''Mokosh''' || Fall equinox. [[Mokosh]] is the goddess of fate. This threshold marks a phase of introspection, as the year is coming to its end. Men examine their actions carried out during the outgoing year, in order to be transformed for the forthcoming year. The day of Mokosh is celebrated with a ritual consisting in taking a handful of earth, reckoning an action, and giving it back to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || September–October
|- bgcolor="#F0F0E0"
| '''Mara''' || This threshold marks the death of the Sun and the triumph of the chthonic goddess [[Marzanna]], the primordial mother. However, things die only in body, while thought continues to work and concentrates to be reborn in the new year. This makes this phase propitious for study and understanding spiritual truths.&lt;ref name="Derzhavarus-kologod"/&gt; || November

==Calendars of months==
===Names of months in local Slavic traditions===
{{See also|Slavic calendar}}
In some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the modern names of the months are borrowings from [[Latin]]. Otherwise, local traditions and other Slavic languages have preserved Slavic endonyms (endogenous names) for months. [[Volkhv]] Aleksey Aleksandrovich Dobroslav has proposed a standardised nomenclature, as reported in the table herebelow. Many Slavic months' names refer to natural phenomena, things and human crafts (for instance, ''Traven'' means "Grass"; Bulgarian ''Sukh'' means "Dry", etc.).

===Yngling calendar of months===
[[File:Ynglist Wheel of the Year.svg|thumb|150px|Yngling's "[[Wheel of the Year]]". Hand work. The runes representing the nine months are to be read leftwise starting from the top-left hooked cross of Yngly, representing the beginning of the year.&lt;ref name="Ynglist-year"/&gt;]]
Ynglism has a different structure of time distinguishing it from mainstream Rodnovery. According to Ynglist teachings, the structure of the year is itself a phenomenon reflecting the order of the supreme God, his action which is Yngly. Each month's name may also be written as a compound of two Ynglist runes. Ynglists claim that original Slavic months are nine, instead of twelve, and each month comprises forty or forty-one days. The first rune is either ''Ay'' (Ай), ''Bey'' (Бэй), ''Gey'' (Гэй), ''Day'' (Дай), ''E'' (Э), ''Vey'' (Вэй), ''Xey'' / ''Khey'' (Хей), or ''Tay'' (Тай), reflecting basic sounds in Indo-European tongues and representing the character of the given month. The second rune in the names is always the rune [[File:Ynglist Let rune.svg|20px]] ''Let'' (Летъ), which means "year" as well as "summer", as months are phases of the year which comes to full maturity in summer. The only exception to this rule is the first month whose name is "Ramhat" (Рамхатъ), a term which refers to the beginning of Ramha's ordering action, Yngly, represented by the ''swastika''-like first rune.&lt;ref name="Ynglist-year"&gt;{{cite web |title=Slavic names of the months (Славянские названия месяцев) |url=http://derzhavarus.ru/slavyanskie-nazvaniya-mesyacev.html |website=Derzhava Rus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621212830/http://derzhavarus.ru/slavyanskie-nazvaniya-mesyacev.html |archive-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kateri.png|thumb|right|125px|Kateri Tekakwitha]]
'''St. Francis Mission''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] mission complex on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] in [[St. Francis, South Dakota]], among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]-[[Sioux]] Native Americans.  The mission was founded in 1886 by the [[Jesuits]] who were welcomed by [[Martin Marty (bishop)|Bishop Martin Marty]], and it soon grew to a large collection of buildings.  Most of these were destroyed by a fire in 1916, but many were soon rebuilt. The mission complex includes 26 buildings, the most prominent of which are St. [[Charles Borromeo]] Church and the 1916 Drexall Hall, the latter a multifunction structure providing classrooms, meeting spaces, and residential spaces. The complex also includes one of two known copies of a statue of [[Kateri Tekakwitha]] by [[Joseph-Émile Brunet]].&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=75001723}}|title=NRHP nomination for St. Francis Mission|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
The Jesuit presence in this area goes back to the 1840s when Fr. [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Peter DeSmet]], S.J., was welcomed by the plains Indians and had contacts with the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]. Based on his reputation as a man who could be trusted, and on the Jesuit reputation as educators, in 1877 Chief Sinte Gleska (Spotted Tail), leader of the Sicangu Lakota, and Chief Red Cloud, leader of the [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], obtained permission from President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] "to get Catholic priests. Those who wear black dresses. These men will teach us how to read and write English." This led to the arrival of a Jesuit Father and brother soon after 1881 and, with financial help from St. [[Katherine Drexel]], the completion of a large building in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/5147/100/life-lakota|title=Life with the Lakota: A Jesuit mission on the rez|date=2012-07-30|newspaper=America Magazine|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 [[Franciscan]] Sisters Kostka, Rosalia, and Alcantara came to teach in the school which they named after [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]. Jesuit Fr. Florentine Digmann who had come with the sisters went on to establish 37 mission stations on the Rosebud Reservation. Since 1974 the school, locally called Sapa Un Ti ("where the Black Robes live"), has been run by the tribe, independently from the Jesuit mission. The many chapels have been replaced by six parishes on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/about/mission-history|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} Mission History|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current programs==
In 2016 three Jesuit priests along with [[Jesuit Volunteer Corps]] members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/about/jesuit-volunteers|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} Jesuit Volunteers|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; were serving the Mission, with assistance from Lakota –  a [[deacon]], several commissioned [[Lay ministry|lay ministers]], and numerous volunteers – working among the 20,000 who remain on the reservation. The Mission supports high school equivalency ([[GED]]) and adult education, Icimani Ya Waste Recovery Center, the White River Recovery Center, the CYO Religious Education Center in Rosebud, and the Wiwila Wakpala after-school center in Spring Creek, along with the following works at the Center:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/about|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} About|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sapa Un Catholic Academy''', based on the [[NativityMiguel Network of Schools|Jesuit Nativity model]] of schools, began in 2013 teaching both English and Lakota to 10-12 students a year in grades K through 5. The express purpose of the school is to enable more Lakota to graduate from colleges and universities and become leaders among their people. Open to students of all religions, its tuition is low and it offers scholarships. Cultural enhancement opportunities include a month-long summer camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/programs/sapa-un-academy|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} Sapa Un Academy|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Lakota Studies''' is an effort to preserve the Lakota language and cultural heritage, with a view especially to its spiritual richness. In pursuit of this purpose Deacon Ben Black Bear, Jr., is translating the [[New Testament]] into Lakota, along with prayers and [[catechism]] instructions. In 2008 the program produced a new, more complete Lakota dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/programs/lakota-studies|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} Lakota Studies|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southdakotamagazine.com/todd-county|title=Land of the Burnt Thigh|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Family Recovery''' program, funded by the [[Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation|Betty Ford Institute]], addresses the family dynamics behind addiction problems, in a 12-hour program that would facilitate recovery in the context of the whole family situation. The program is conducted by a trained staff in a different community on the reservation each month. Many have gone on to participate in other Mission programs such as [[Al-Anon]] and [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmission.org/programs/recovery-2|title=St. Francis Mission {{!}} Recovery|website=www.sfmission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stevna''' (plural: '''stevnur''') is a regional summer festival in the [[Faroe Islands]], usually accompanied by or built around national rowing boat championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfaroeislands.com/en/what-to-do/what%C2%B4s-on-2015-highlights/|title=What´s on: 2015 Highlights|work=Visit Faroe Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The races and regattas are always held on Saturdays, except the [[Ólavsøka]] race in the capital of [[Tórshavn]], which has a fixed date. There are seven official rowing-related''stevnur'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsf.fo/stevnur/ |title=Stevnur &amp;#124; Rsf |publisher=Rsf.fo |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stevnur in the Faroe Islands ==
*[[Norðoyastevna]] is held annually in [[Klaksvík]], usually in the first weekend of June.&lt;ref name="Visitnordoy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitnordoy.fo/UK/index.asp?pID={016C6314-D13B-4396-9D44-39F803F912A9}|title=Nordoyastevna - in Klaksvik|publisher=Visitnordoy.fo|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eystanstevna]] is held in [[Runavík]] the second weekend of June every year, and has a rowing race every other year. In the odd years (2005, 2007 etc.) the race is held at the Varmakelda.&lt;ref name="Visiteysturoy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiteysturoy.fo/uk/index.asp?pID={3161CFC7-37EA-4FA2-A0EA-1CFF28FD28D9}|title=Eystanstevnan|publisher=Visiteysturoy.fo|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sundalagsstevna]] is held in a weekend in mid-June in the Sundalagið region. The host town alternates between [[Kollafjørður]], [[Hósvík]] and [[Hvalvík]].
*[[Jóansøka]] is in the last weekend of June, or the Saturday nearest to the 24th of June, which is [[St John’s Day]]. In the even years it is held in [[Vágur]] and in the odd years in [[Tvøroyri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsuduroy.fo/UK/index.asp?pID={9564A453-480A-475B-A1A1-DE96BFC5D4E1} |title=Suðuroy - EN - Events - Jóansøka |publisher=Visitsuduroy.fo |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Varmakelda]] is usually the first weekend in July in [[Fuglafjørður]]. A rowing race is held every odd year; in the other years it is held in Runavík.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiteysturoy.fo/uk/index.asp?pID={F74DA030-B785-4E4A-8555-E6E8BDCB350E} |title=Eysturoy - EN - Events - Village Festivals - Varmakeldustevna |publisher=Visiteysturoy.fo |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vestanstevna]] is usually a weekend in the first half of July, and shifts between the three towns of [[Sandavágur]], [[Miðvágur]] and [[Sørvágur]].
*[[Fjarðastevna]] is celebrated in a weekend somewhere mid-July. In the even years it is held in [[Vestmanna]], whereas in the odd years the host town alternates between [[Strendur]]  and [[Skáli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiteysturoy.fo/uk/index.asp?pID={A0E6E9CE-E1D3-44DF-A94C-979EED72F519} |title=Eysturoy - EN - Events - Village Festivals - Fjarðastevna |publisher=Visiteysturoy.fo |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ólavsøka]] is the national holiday of the Faroe Islands with many festivities of all kinds in the capital of [[Tórshavn]], including the opening of Parliament. Whereas the other ''stevnur'' tend to be more-less regional festivals, this ''stevna'' is a national event. It is held at the 29th of July, whilst the rowing championships are held the wake before, on 28 July.

Other '''stevnur'''', that do not include rowing regattas, are held in various places, such as the Útoyggjastevna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utoyggj.fo/pages/utoyggjastevnan.php |title=utoyggj.fo |publisher=Utoyggj.fo |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for all the outpost islands, the Sandoyarstevna on Sandoy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandportal.fo/her-er-skrain-fyri-sandoyarstevnuna/|title=Sandportal  » Blog Archive   » Her er skráin fyri Sandoyarstevnuna|work=sandportal.fo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boating festivals for modern boats in various places.

===Origins===
[[File:Lisa Fonssagrives at Paddington Station, London, 1951.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lisa Fonssagrives]]]]

An early use of the term ''supermodel'' appeared in 1891 in an interview with artist [[Henry Stacy Marks]] for ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', in which Marks told journalist Harry How, "A good many models are addicted to drink, and, after sitting a while, will suddenly go to sleep. Then I have had what I call the 'super' model. You know the sort of man; he goes in for theatrical effect&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Illustrated Interviews.

Newnes|work=The Strand Magazine|volume= 2|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 6 October 1942, a writer named Judith Cass had used the term ''super model'' for her article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', which headlined ''"Super Models are Signed for Fashion Show"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com Chicago Tribune archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223192745/http://www.chicagotribune.com/ |date=23 February 2010 }} Cass, Judith. ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' "'Super' Models Are Signed for Fashion Show" 6 October 1942. pg 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1943, an agent named Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in a "how-to" book about modeling entitled ''So You Want to Be a Model!'' in which Dessner wrote, "She will be a super-model, but the girl in her will be like the girl in you—quite ordinary, but ambitious and eager for personal development."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007EL7RY So You Want to Be a Model!

In 1947, [[anthropologist]] [[Harold S.

The term ''supermodel'' had been used several times in the media in the 1960s and 1970s.

===1960s–1970s===
In February 1968, an article in ''[[Glamour magazine|Glamour]]'' described 19 models as "supermodels": [[Cheryl Tiegs]], [[Veruschka]], Lisa Palmer, [[Peggy Moffitt]], Sue Murray, [[Twiggy]], [[Sunny Harnett]], [[Marisa Berenson]], Gretchen Harris, Heide Wiedeck, Irish Bianchi, [[Hiroko Matsumoto]], [[Paul Anka#Personal life|Anne de Zogheb]], Kathy Carpenter, Jean Shrimpton, [[Jean Patchett]], [[Benedetta Barzini]], Claudia Duxbury and [[Agneta Frieberg]].&lt;ref name=BarryPopik /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cokal, Susann.

In the 1970s, some models became more prominent as their names became more recognizable to the general public.

[They] were like movie stars." The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, "None of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, [[Yasmeen Ghauri]], and [[Karen Mulder]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie&amp;nbsp;... Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis."

In the mid-1990s, the initial era of the supermodel ended and a new era for the supermodel began driven by [[heroin chic]]. By the late 1990s, actresses, pop singers, and other entertainment celebrities began gradually replacing models on fashion magazine covers and ad campaigns.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;''Death of the Supermodels'' by C.

A popular "conspiracy theory" explaining the supermodel's disappearance is that designers and fashion editors grew weary of the "I won't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day" attitude and made sure no small group of models would ever again have the power of the Big Six.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989517-1,00.html "The Fall of the Supermodel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505194751/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989517-1,00.html |date=5 May 2009 }} ''Time''.

Charles Gandee, associate editor at ''Vogue'', has said that high prices and poor attitudes contributed less to the decline of the supermodel.

===2000s and present day===
[[File:Cannes 2015 22.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[[Adriana Lima]], one of the "New Supers" and the longest-running [[Victoria's Secret#Victoria's Secret Angels|Victoria's Secret Angel]].]]

Emerging in the late 1990s, [[Gisele Bündchen]] became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to gain popularity in the industry and with the public. With numerous covers of ''Vogue'' under her belt, including an issue that dubbed her the "Return of the ''Sexy'' Model," Bündchen was credited with ending the "[[heroin chic]]" era of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gisele B&amp;#252;ndchen |url=http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |title=Celebrity Central: Gisele Bundchen biography |work=People |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710172826/http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following in her footsteps by signing contracts with [[Victoria's Secret]], fellow Brazilians [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to prominence; however, this "new trinity" were unable to cross over into the world of TV, movies and talk shows as easily as their predecessors due to their foreign accents&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; and, apart from Gisele, were often confined to Swimsuit magazines instead of high fashion titles.

Several seasons later, they were followed by Eastern Europeans barely into their teens, pale, and "bordering on anorexic. They were too young to become movie stars or date celebrities; too skeletal to bag Victoria's Secret contracts; and a lack of English didn't bode well for a broad media career".&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; The opportunities for superstardom were waning in the modeling world, and models like [[Heidi Klum]] and [[Tyra Banks]] took to television with reality shows like ''[[Project Runway]]'' &amp; ''[[Germany's Next Topmodel]]'' and ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', respectively, to not only remain relevant but establish themselves as media moguls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Contrary to the fashion industry's celebrity trend of the previous decade, lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret continues to groom and launch young talents into supermodel status, awarding their high-profile "[[Victoria's Secret#Victoria's Secret Angels|Angels]]" multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

[[Vogue (magazine)|American ''Vogue'']] dubbed ten models ([[Doutzen Kroes]], [[Agyness Deyn]], [[Hilary Rhoda]], [[Raquel Zimmermann]], [[Coco Rocha]], [[Lily Donaldson]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Sasha Pivovarova]], [[Caroline Trentini]] and [[Jessica Stam]]) as the new crop of supermodels in their May 2007 cover story,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/041607VFEA/ Vogue's ten covergirls bring personality and attitude to spring's eye-popping prints.

A new generation of models dubbed the "Instagirls" ([[Gigi Hadid]], [[Hailey Baldwin]], [[Bella Hadid]], [[Emily Ratajkowski]], [[Kendall Jenner]], [[Cara Delevingne]]), have all developed their own unique model-personalities through social media, simply by their number of followers on sites such as Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Kendall, Gigi, Bella, and the year in Insta-Girls |url = http://www.vogue.com/13514756/2016-insta-girls-instagram-fashions-new-normal-kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170110020354/http://www.vogue.com/13514756/2016-insta-girls-instagram-fashions-new-normal-kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid/ |archivedate = 10 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Instagirls: Joan Smalls, Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, and More on the September Cover of ''Vogue''|url = http://www.vogue.com/971533/supermodel-cover-september-2014/|accessdate = 2015-09-30|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007050007/http://www.vogue.com/971533/supermodel-cover-september-2014/|archivedate = 7 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's modeling industry, designers often feature models in campaigns who have a large social media following such as Italian model and actress [[Monica Bellucci]], who gained worldwide recognition whether through films or fashion appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.made-in-italy.com/italian-fashion/modeling/supermodels/monica-bellucci|title=Monica Bellucci|website=www.made-in-italy.com|accessdate=27 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102032203/http://www.made-in-italy.com/italian-fashion/modeling/supermodels/monica-bellucci|archivedate=2 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plus-size supermodels ==
[[File:Ashley Graham (model) 2014.png|thumb|231x231px|Plus-size model [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]].]]

In the last decade, there has been a new emergence of models known as "[[Plus-size model|plus-size]]" top models, including [[Robyn Lawley]], [[Crystal Renn]], [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]], [[Candice Huffine]], [[Tara Lynn]], [[Whitney Thompson]], [[Katya Zharkova]], [[Denise Bidot]], [[Sophie Dahl]], [[Jennie Runk]] and Natalie Laughlin.&lt;ref name="vh1.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/3421/plus-size-models-who-made-history/|title=12 Plus-Size Models Who've Made History|access-date=2016-10-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006150111/http://www.vh1.com/news/3421/plus-size-models-who-made-history/|archivedate=6 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models have been in Catwalks, magazines, and Billboards for brands known worldwide like ''Vogue'', ''Glamour'', Levi’s, [[Forever 21]], [[Cover girl|Cover Girl]] cosmetics, [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[GQ|GQ Magazine]], and [[Chanel]].&lt;ref name="vh1.com"/&gt;

In early 2016, Graham had an overwhelming amount of news coverage worldwide after [[Sports Illustrated]] had her on their cover as their first "Plus-sized" Top Model in their 2016 swimsuit edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/ashley-graham-sports-illustrated-cover-things-to-know|title=Who Is Ashley Graham?|date=2016-02-14|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917060503/http://www.people.com/article/ashley-graham-sports-illustrated-cover-things-to-know|archivedate=17 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Male supermodels ==
[[File:Tyson Beckford by Arnaldo Anaya Lucca.jpg|thumb|left|261x261px|[[Tyson Beckford]] posing for Ralph Lauren.]]

In addition to the models stated previously, a top-grossing part of the industry that tends to be overlooked is the male side of modeling. Though women are predominantly known in the modeling industry, men are used just as frequently in advertisements for clothing, cologne, sports wear and other such accessories.

In 1993, Italian model [[Fabio Lanzoni]], was the highest paid male model worldwide, getting paid several million dollars a year. He was the male identified individual in many romance novels; he did advertisements for high-end brands like [[Versace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/garden/on-location-with-fabio-please-judge-the-book-by-its-cover.html|title=ON LOCATION WITH: Fabio; Please, Judge the Book by Its Cover|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=1993-09-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195150/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/garden/on-location-with-fabio-please-judge-the-book-by-its-cover.html|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tyson Beckford]] is known for posing in a number of ads for [[Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren's]] Polo sport cologne line. Since 1990, he has been the face of [[Gucci]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Tommy Hilfiger (company)|Tommy Hilfiger]], won Model of the year on VH1 Fashion award, and he has also appeared in [[Calvin Klein (fashion designer)|Calvin Klein]]'s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/fashion/models/tbeckford/tysonbeckford/|title=Tyson Beckford - Fashion Model - Profile on New York Magazine|website=nymag.com|access-date=2016-10-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007183212/http://nymag.com/fashion/models/tbeckford/tysonbeckford/|archivedate=7 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Calvin Klein model is [[Mark Wahlberg]].

==Perception==
Critical perception of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent inside and outside the fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism, where the "supermodel" generally has to conform to a Northern European standard of beauty in the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of ''The New York Times'', in 2007, the "android" look was popular, a vacant stare and thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This had not always been the case. In the 1970s, black, heavier and "ethnic" models dominated the runways but social changes in the 1980s to the early 2000s persuaded the power players in the fashion industry to shun suggestions of "otherness".&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;''On runways, racial diversity is out'' Author: Guy Trebay, [[International Herald Tribune]], 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the latter part of the first decade of the twenty-first century, an increasing level of diversity has been noted among supermodels catering to the growing East Asian markets, including Japanese model [[Tao Okamoto]] and Chinese models [[Fei Fei Sun]] and Liu Wen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashiongonerogue.com/7-asian-models-face-fashion/|title=7 Asian Models Changing the Face of Fashion|website=fashiongonerogue|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724072802/http://www.fashiongonerogue.com/7-asian-models-face-fashion/|archivedate=24 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Three Skeleton Key"''' is a short story by the French author George C. Toudouze. The January 1937 edition  of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' marked its first appearance in English. This suspenseful tale and "[[Leiningen Versus the Ants]]" were discovered by the magazine's editor [[Arnold Gingrich]].&lt;ref name="Survival 2001"&gt;''The Greatest Survival Stories Ever Told'' edited by Lamar Underwood, (Guilford, Connecticut: The Lyons Press, 2001) pp. 61 - 71.&lt;/ref&gt; 

George G. Toudouze (1877-1972) was born in [[Paris|Paris, France]]. His father, Cat Toudouze, was a well-known author of the time. The younger Toudouze wrote on such topics as art, architecture, travel and French naval history.  Although he penned numerous adventure novels and short stories, he is today remembered for a single work: "Three Skeleton Key".

==Plot==
The plot involves three men tending a lighthouse on an island off the coast of [[French Guiana]].  The rock the lighthouse stands on is dubbed 'Three Skeleton Key', named after a tragedy when three escaped convicts became ship-wrecked on the rock and eventually died of hunger and thirst- the only thing left of them were a heap of bones cleaned off by scavenging birds. The three lighthouse attendants are headkeeper, Itchoua (the eldest of the men), Le Gleo, and the narrator (whose name is never given).

An abandoned ship, overrun by thousands of ferocious rats, makes landfall. A life-and-death struggle ensues as the men seek to save themselves from the hungry horde, who swarm over the lighthouse.&lt;ref name="Survival 2001"/&gt; The three men barely manage to survive fending off the rats, who manage to break into the tower. The three escape into the lighthouse gallery, which has a metal trapdoor that the rats cannot gnaw through, and are able to use the light to signal an investigating patrol boat. Eventually, the rats are lured off the island onto a barge loaded with meat, which is then set on fire by incendiary shells; however, Le Gleo has gone insane from the events and is locked away in a French Asylum, and Itchoua dies of infection from rat bites and scratches.  The narrator continues to work in the lighthouse until his service time is over.

==Adaptations==
[[James Poe]] adapted the story for radio in a version that aired on ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' on November 15, 1949. Poe's script gave different names to the three characters: the narrator is named "Jean", the head keeper Itchoua is named "Louis" and Le Gleo is now a hunchbacked former actor named "Auguste"; the adaptation also provides a different and more chilling reason as to why the rats eventually leave the lighthouse. The 1949 broadcast featured [[William Conrad]] as "Louis", [[Harry Bartell]] as "Auguste" and [[Elliott Reid]] as "Jean". Poe's adaptation was rebroadcast by popular demand in 1950 and 1953, each with a different cast: [[Vincent Price]] as "Jean", Harry Bartell again as "Auguste" and [[Jeff Corey]] as "Louis" in the March 17, 1950 broadcast; and [[Paul Frees]] as "Louis", [[Ben Wright (actor)|Ben Wright]] as "Jean" and [[Jay Novello]] as "Auguste" in the August 9, 1953 broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escape-suspense.com/2007/02/escape_three_sk.html Radio play] ''escape-suspense.com''. Retrieved: August 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Price]] is the actor most associated with the radio play, performing the role of "Jean" again in 1956 and 1958 for ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''.&lt;ref name="Virtual Museum"/&gt; 
 
The One Act Audio Theatre revisited "Three Skeleton Key" in 2001.  A modern recording of the piece can be found at the organization's web site as well as the script by [[James Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneact.org/productions/ThreeSkeletonKey/ThreeSkeletonKey.html One Act Audio Theatre] ''oneact.org''.

==Etymology==
The term "visual kei" is credited to Seiichi Hoshiko, the founder editor of ''[[Shoxx]]'' magazine, the first publication devoted to the subject. However, he said in an interview with ''Jrock News'' that the term was originally coined, or at least inspired by, [[X Japan]]'s lead guitarist [[hide (musician)|hide]]. Hoshiko said: "At the time, they were called 'Okeshou kei' (makeup style). But it simply felt… too cheap… Even though X Japan was a big band and people used the term 'Okeshou kei' to describe them, the term was still lacking substance, I didn't like the term at all! Because of this, I tried to remind all the writers to not use this term as "They are not okeshou kei, they are visual-shock kei'. From there, it went from 'Visual-shock kei' to 'Visual-kei' to 'V-kei'. After we spread the word, fans naturally abbreviated it to 'V-kei'. The Japanese love to abbreviate everything as a matter of fact". Hoshiko considers visual kei as a distinctive music genre and defines it "as the music itself along with all the visual aspects of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jrocknews.com/2018/01/interviewing-man-coined-term-visual-kei-seiichi-hoshiko.html|title=Interviewing the man who coined the term "Visual kei", Seiichi Hoshiko|publisher=Jrock News|date=January 24, 2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoshiko2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jrocknews.com/2018/01/interview-seiichi-hoshiko-part-2-impacted-hide-x-japan.html|title=Interview: How Seiichi Hoshiko was impacted by hide of X Japan|publisher=Jrock News|date=January 31, 2018|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luna Sea]] and [[Glay]], who went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy in 1991 and 1994.&lt;ref name="JRR"/&gt; Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader [[Dynamite Tommy]], while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as [[By-Sexual]] and [[Kamaitachi (band)|Kamaitachi]].&lt;ref name=bounce/&gt; Currently Free-Will is still going strong and has been a major contributor in spreading modern visual kei inside and outside Japan, whereas Extasy followed its owner and became based out of the US, signing and producing American acts and has since faded away.

The second transition era began in 1993 by bands such as [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], [[Glay]] (although formed in 1988, their first album was released in 1994) and [[Malice Mizer]].

By the late 1990s, the mainstream popularity of visual kei was declining;&lt;ref name="UCLA"/&gt; in 1997 Luna Sea was on a yearly hiatus, X Japan had disbanded and one year later their lead guitarist hide died, in 1999 died Malice Mizer's drummer [[Kami (musician)|Kami]] after departure of singer [[Gackt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/music/the-story-of-visual-kei |title=The story of visual kei|author=Bunny Bissoux|date=2015-06-11|publisher=TimeOut|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who with toned down make-up solo career became one of the most popular and successful visual-kei singers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s|editor=Ian Chapman, Henry Johnson|date=2016|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781317588191|chapter=Visual Kei: Glamour in Japanese Pop Music|author=Henry Johnson, Akitsugu Kawamoto|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Arc-en-Ciel publicly distanced themselves from the movement (in 2012 were partly promoted as visual kei rock band&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'Arc-en-Ciel, Japanese Visual Rock Band, To Play Madison Square Garden This Weekend|author=Rob Schwartz|date=2012-03-23|publisher=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;),{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=250}} and in 2000, Luna Sea decided to disband as well. In 1998, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Steve McClure commented that "To a certain extent, hide's death means the end of an era, X were the first generation of visual kei bands, but the novelty has worn off. For the next generation of bands, it's like: ''That's it. The torch has been passed to us''".&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; As other bands could not meet financial expectations most major companies backed out of the genre,{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=250}} and it became an underground style often associated with rebellious generation, non-conforming to proper society.&lt;ref name="GlobalEarly"/&gt;

===2001–2010: Neo-Visual Kei===
[[File:Versailles Chile.jpg|thumb|right|[[Versailles (band)|Versailles]] performing in 2010, wearing costumes similar to the French [[Rococo]] style.]]
A second generation emerged in visual kei-specific live houses managed by record companies like PS Company (Free-Will) and [[Danger Crue Records|Maverick DC Group]].{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=250}} Notable newer visual kei bands include [[The Gazette (band)|The Gazette]], [[Nightmare (Japanese band)|Nightmare]], [[Alice Nine]], [[An Cafe]], [[Sug]], [[Mucc]], [[D'espairsRay]], who have all performed overseas.&lt;ref name=bounce/&gt; Veterans of the scene have also established new acts, such as Malice Mizer's [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] with his band [[Moi dix Mois]] and three members of [[Pierrot (band)|Pierrot]] forming [[Angelo (band)|Angelo]].&lt;ref name=bounce/&gt; In 2007, visual kei was revitalized as Luna Sea performed a one-off performance and X Japan officially reunited with a new single and a world tour. With these developments, visual kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, with bands formed around 2004 having been described by some media as {{nihongo|"Neo-Visual Kei"|ネオ・ヴィジュアル系}}.&lt;ref name="GlobalEarly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oricon"/&gt; From this generation emerged subgenre Oshare kei which changed the sound and look of the genre, producing pop-rock type with bright attire.&lt;ref name="GlobalEarly"/&gt;

The difference between the first and second generation is that the second; has no straightforward music style, ranging from metal to pop, but still seemingly focused on heavy rock genres; the fashion and gender ambiguities are of central importance; although economically not very significant for the Japanese music market, it became the first Japanese genre which succeeded on international scale.{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=250–251}}

Although the first international concert was held in [[Taiwan]] by Luna Sea in 1999, only from 2002 the visual kei bands started to perform worldwide (United States, in Europe from 2004), with the initial interest coming from conventions like [[Project A-Kon|A-Kon]].{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=78}} In the first five years Dir en Grey was especially well received.{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=79, 86}} In 2007 was held first international exclusive festival, Jrock Revolution, in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=78–79}} Although recently some bands like The Gazette played at [[Tokyo Dome]] (not in full capacity), the majority of acts play in much smaller venues like [[Shibuya O-East]].{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=81}} In 2009 at [[Makuhari Messe]] and 2011 at [[Saitama Super Arena]], was held V-Rock Festival which gathered over 50 visual kei rock bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/v-rock-festival-2009/|title=V-Rock Festival 2009|author=JKlein|date=2009-08-11|work=JRockRevolution|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-81990-v-rock-festival-2011-white-and-rainbow-stages.html|title=V-Rock Festival 2011 - White and Rainbow Stages |author=Polina &amp; Kay|date=2011-12-22|work=JaME World|publisher=Japanese Music Entertainment|accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-86849-v-rock-festival-2011-rose-and-moon-stages.html|title=V-Rock Festival 2011 - Rose and Moon Stages|author=Remy Zane|date=2012-05-29|work=JaME World|publisher=Japanese Music Entertainment|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2013, a tribute album, titled "Dead End Tribute - Song of Lunatics -", was released. This album features Dead End covers played not by formal bands(except for [[Boris (band)|Boris]] and [[Cali Gari|cali≠gari]]), but collaborations between musicians from well-known bands such as [[Luna Sea]], [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], [[Kuroyume]], [[La'cryma Christi]], [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]], [[Janne Da Arc]] and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avex.jp/deadendtribute/index.html |title=DEAD END Tribute -SONG OF LUNATICS- |publisher=[[avex]] |language=日本語 |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There has been criticism directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost the spirit of their forefathers, copying each other in design and sound, becoming all the same.&lt;ref name="GlobalEarly"/&gt; As far back as 1991, [[Morrie (musician)|Morrie]] from Dead End was critical of rising imitation among bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Tetsushi Ichikawa|title=ISSAY (DER ZIBET) + MORRIE (ex DEAD END). New York karisuma sōtō-dan|magazine=Ongaku to hito|date=February 1995|issue=2|pages=119-125|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Neil Strauss]] reported that to visual kei bands "after X" makeup and outrageous looks became "more important than music".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Several musicians expressed their discontent; [[Kirito]] (Pierrot, Angelo) said "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way because they want to be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is obviously very different from when we started out more than ten years ago",&lt;ref name="Angelo"/&gt; while [[Sugizo]] (Luna Sea) that "they cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music".&lt;ref name="Sugizo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugizo on Luna Sea|url=http://www.jame-world.com/uk/articles-68169-sugizo-on-luna-sea.html|work=Jame World|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although almost from the newer generation himself, Dir en grey bassist [[Toshiya (musician)|Toshiya]] said in 2010 "to be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan and people thought it was cool" and added "the music was so unique, too – bands like X Japan. At that time, there weren't any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same".&lt;ref name="DirTimes" /&gt; Kenzi (Kamaitachi, [[The Dead Pop Stars]], [[Anti Feminism]]) commented in 2009 that "back in the day, there were bands, but people would try to do things differently. Nowadays, there's one band and everyone copies off of them", with Free-Will founder and Color frontman Tommy concluding with "I don't think our breed of visual kei exists anymore".&lt;ref name="KillingRedAddictio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: The Killing Red Addiction|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/interview-the-killing-red-addiction/|work=JRock Revolution|date=12 July 2009|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seiichi Hoshiko in 2018 interview was worried about this trend influence on the movement's future.&lt;ref name="Hoshiko2"/&gt;

==Popularity==
[[File:X Japan Cosplay (8644730147).jpg|thumb|Japanese fans doing [[X Japan]] [[cosplay]]]]
Visual kei has enjoyed popularity among [[Indie (music)|independent]] underground projects, as well as artists achieving [[mainstream]] success, with influences from Western phenomena, such as [[glam rock|glam]], [[goth subculture|goth]] and [[cyberpunk]].&lt;ref name="grammy_kabuki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blistering_deg"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Mascia|title=Dir en grey feature interview|work=[[Blistering]]|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3/|publisher=[[archive.is]]|accessdate=2017-08-20|quote=When we were growing up around [the] late '80s and early '90s, visual kei was influenced by glam music.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120728173833/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3/|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music performed encompasses a large variety of [[music genre|genres]], i.e. [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], pop and [[electronica]].&lt;ref name="jmf_jrock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grammy_kabuki"/&gt;

Magazines published regularly in Japan with visual kei coverage are ''Arena 37&amp;nbsp;°C'', ''[[Cure (magazine)|Cure]]'', ''Fool's Mate Express'',  ''Shoxx'', ''Shock Wave'', ''Rock and Read'' among others. The popularity and awareness of visual kei groups outside Japan has seen an increase in recent years, mostly through internet and Japanese [[anime]],{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=78, 83}} shown for example by German magazines ''Peach'' and ''Koneko'', as well European record label [[Gan-Shin]]. The biggest fan communities are found in United States, Germany, Poland, Russia, France and Brazil and to some extent Finland, Chile and Sweden.{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=251}}

From these international youth subcultures and influence emerged bands like [[Cinema Bizarre]], but they hesitate to consider themselves as visual kei because are not ethnically Japanese and instead as glam rock.{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=251}} Despite the existence of visually similar music acts, including such as [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Tokio Hotel]] and [[Lady Gaga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-76285-globalizing-visual-kei-investigating-the-visual-style.html|title=Globalizing Visual Kei: Investigating the Visual Style|author=Megan Pfeifle|date=2011-07-30|work=JaME World|publisher=Japanese Music Entertainment|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the West the androgynous look of the visual kei bands often has repulsive effect.{{sfn|Pfeifle|2013|p=82}}

According to the musicologists, the [[Lacanianism|Lacanist]] psychoanalysis of the subculture indicate that the fascination to the singer's voice (the lack of understanding amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on international scale.{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=17, 262–288}} The female fans (''bangyaru'') show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, as there several ''furi'' (movements) like ''tesensu'' (arm fan), ''gyakudai'' (reversed dive), ''hedoban'' (headbang), ''saku'' (spread hands in the air).{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=258}} The explicit [[fan fiction]] and [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] acts on the stage by some musicians called ''fan sabisu'' (fan service; a sexual term borrowed from [[manga]] culture), are related to the Lacanian man's type of [[Philosophy of desire|desire]] (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female fans do not desire the musician himself, but his desire, kind of cultural social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.{{sfn|Utz, Lau|2013|p=258–262}}

'''Émile Henri Bernard''' (28 April 1868 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1941) was a French [[Post-Impressionist]] painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Eugène Boch]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugeneboch.com Eugène Boch a common friend of Vincent van Gogh and Émile Bernard&lt;/ref&gt; and at a later time, [[Paul Cézanne]]. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]], two late 19th-century [[art movements]]. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of [[modern art]] to which Bernard had contributed.

==Biography==
[[File:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Émile Bernard''&lt;br&gt;by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1886)&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{For|a timeline|Émile Bernard chronology}}
Émile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, Émile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where Émile attended the ''Collège Sainte-Barbe.''

===Education===

He began his studies at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|École des Arts Décoratifs]]. In 1884, joined the [[Atelier Cormon]] where he experimented with [[impressionism]] and [[pointillism]] and befriended fellow artists [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. After being suspended from the École des Beaux-Arts for "showing expressive tendencies in his paintings", he toured [[Brittany]] on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.

In August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in [[Pont-Aven]]. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that "my own talent was already fully developed." He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.

===1887–1888===

Bernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted ''La Grandmère'', a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended [[Académie Julian]], &lt;ref&gt;Russell, John. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D61E30F93AA25750C0A96F948260 "An Art School That Also Taught Life,"] ''New York Times.'' 19 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.

One year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had "a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively..." Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.

1888 was a seminal year in the history of [[Modern art]]. From 23 October until 23 December [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] worked together in [[Arles]]. Gauguin had brought his new style from [[Pont-Aven]] exemplified in ''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
He also brought along Bernard's ''Le Pardon de Pont-Aven'' which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/07/26/badorment26.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/07/26/ixartright.html see in:] (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style Émile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a [[watercolor]] copy of the ''Pardon'' (December 1888) which he sent to his [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|brother]], to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of Émile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy."

Bernard's style was effective and coherent (see:[http://www.ackland.org/tours/classes/bernard.html woman at haystacks],) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two "portraits" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's drawings from the August batch ("...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers" – Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard – Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the Allée des [[Alyscamps]] in Arles.

In 1891 he joined a group of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] before he died in 1941.

::"[...] this creative, [[avant-garde]] young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]
Bernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as [[cloisonnism]]. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of [[Paul Cézanne]], and he collaborated with [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].

Many say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this "closisonisme" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin "turned against Neo-Impressionism."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of Cézanne. But Bernard says "When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by "everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan." {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.
And the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Symbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.
Bernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it "It is the invisible express by the visible,"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], but simplifying the actual symbol.

His concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.

==Influence==
It was always Émile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/vangogh/slide_intro.html Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South] that put Émile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Aguéli]].

===Letters===
His correspondence with other artists is of great art historical interest. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard traded ideas and art. Many [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|letters sent from van Gogh]] and Gauguin to Bernard give historians a better idea of the artists lives and connection to their artwork.
