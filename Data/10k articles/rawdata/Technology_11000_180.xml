A solid-state '''AC-to-AC converter''' converts an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[waveform]] to another AC waveform, where the output voltage and frequency can be set arbitrarily.

==Categories==
[[Image:AC AC Converter Classification.svg|thumb|300px|Fig 1: Classification of three-phase AC-AC converter circuits.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Kolar, T. Friedli, F. Krismer, S. D. Round, “The Essence of Three-Phase AC/AC Converter Systems”, Proceedings of the 13th Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (EPE-PEMC'08), Poznan, Poland, pp. 27 – 42, Sept. 1 - 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Referring to Fig 1, AC-AC converters can be categorized as follows: 
* Indirect AC-AC (or AC/DC-AC) converters (i.e., with rectifier, DC link and inverter)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=M. Y.|year=2009|publisher=University of Nottingham|url=http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/987/1/MYL_Thesis.pdf|title=Three-level Neutral-point-clamped Matrix Converter Topology|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cycloconverter]]s
* Hybrid matrix converters
* Matrix converters (MC).

==DC link converters==

Itoh, “Electrolytic Capacitor-Less PWM Inverter“, in Proceedings of the IPEC’90, Tokyo, Japan, , pp. 131 – 138, April 2 – 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:3PAC current DC.jpg|thumb|300px|Fig 3: Topology of current-source inverter AC/DC-AC converter&lt;ref&gt;K. Kuusela, M. Salo, H. Tuusa, “A Current Source PWM Converter Fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive with Adjustable DC-Link Current“, in Proceedings of the NORPIE’2000, Aalborg, Denmark, pp. 54 – 58, June 15 – 16, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Bierhoff, F. W. Fuchs, “Pulse Width Modulation for Current Source Converters – A Detailed Concept,“ in Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE IECON’06, Paris, France, Nov. 7–10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are two types of converters with DC link:
* Voltage-source inverter (VSI) converters (Fig. 2): In VSI converters, the rectifier consists of a diode-bridge and the DC link consists of a shunt capacitor.
* Current-source inverter (CSI) converters (Fig. 3): In CSI converters, the rectifer consists of a phase-controlled switching device bridge and the DC link consists of 1 or 2 series inductors  between one or both legs of the connection between rectifier and inverter.
Any [[dynamic braking]] operation required for the motor can be realized by means of [[braking chopper|braking DC chopper]] and resistor shunt connected across the rectifier. Alternatively, an anti-parallel thyristor bridge must be provided in the rectifier section to feed energy back into the AC line. Such phase-controlled thyristor-based rectifiers however have higher AC line distortion and lower power factor at low load than diode-based rectifiers.

An AC-AC converter with approximately sinusoidal input currents and bidirectional power flow can be realized by coupling a [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) rectifier and a PWM inverter to the DC-link. The DC-link quantity is then impressed by an energy storage element that is common to both stages, which is a capacitor C for the voltage DC-link or an inductor L for the current DC-link. The PWM rectifier is controlled in a way that a sinusoidal AC line current is drawn, which is in phase or anti-phase (for energy feedback) with the corresponding AC line phase voltage.

Due to the DC-link storage element, there is the advantage that both converter stages are to a large extent decoupled for control purposes. Furthermore, a constant, AC line independent input quantity exists for the PWM inverter stage, which results in high utilization of the converter’s power capability. On the other hand, the DC-link energy storage element has a relatively large physical volume, and when electrolytic capacitors are used, in the case of a voltage DC-link, there is potentially a reduced system lifetime.

==Cycloconverters==
{{Main|Cycloconverter}}
A cycloconverter constructs an output, variable-frequency, approximately sinusoid waveform by switching segments of the input waveform to the output; there is no intermediate DC link.  With switching elements such as [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]]s, the output frequency must be lower than the input. Very large cycloconverters (on the order of 10 MW) are manufactured for compressor and wind-tunnel drives, or for variable-speed applications such as [[cement]] kilns.

==Matrix converters==

Pelly, “Static Power Frequency Changers - Theory, Performance, &amp; Application“, New York: J. Wiley, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. I. Popow, “Der zwangskommutierte Direktumrichter mit sinusförmiger Ausgangsspannung,“ Elektrie 28, No. 4, pp. 194 – 196, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Boelkens, “Direct Frequency Converter with Sinusoidal Line Currents for Speed-Variable AC Motors“, IEEE Transactions Industry Electronics, Vol. 36, No. 4, pp. 475–479, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Shinohara, Y. Minari, T. Irisa, “Analysis and Fundamental Characteristics of Induction Motor Driven by Voltage Source Inverter without DC Link Components (in Japanese)“, IEEJ Transactions, Vol. 109-D, No. 9, pp. 637 – 644, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Wei, T. A. Lipo, “A Novel Matrix Converter Topology with Simple Commutation“, in Proceedings of the 36th IEEE IAS’01, Chicago, USA, vol. 3, pp. 1749–1754, Sept. 30 – Oct. 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In order to achieve higher power density and reliability, it makes sense to consider Matrix Converters that achieve three-phase AC-AC conversion without any intermediate energy storage element. Conventional Direct Matrix Converters (Fig. 4) perform voltage and current conversion in one single stage.

There is the alternative option of indirect energy conversion by employing the Indirect Matrix Converter (Fig. 5) or the [[Sparse matrix converter]] which was invented by Prof. Johann W. Kolar from the ETH Zurich. As with the DC-link based VSI and CSI controllers (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), separate stages are provided for voltage and current conversion, but the DC-link has no intermediate storage element. Generally, by employing matrix converters, the storage element in the DC-link is eliminated at the cost of a larger number of semiconductors. Matrix converters are often seen as a future concept for variable speed drives technology, but despite intensive research over the decades they have until now only achieved low industrial penetration. However, citing recent availability of low-cost, high performance semiconductors, one larger drive manufacturer has over past few years been actively promoting matrix converters.&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swamy|first=Mahesh|author2=Kume, Tsuneo|title=Present State and Futuristic Vision of Motor Drive Technology|journal=Power Transmission Engineering|date=Dec 16, 2010|url=http://www.powertransmission.com/issues/1210/swamy.pdf|accessdate=8 October 2016|publisher=www.powertransmission.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''acoustic rheometer''' employs a [[piezo-electric]] [[crystal]] that can easily launch a successive [[wave]] of extensions and contractions into the [[fluid]]. It applies an [[oscillating]] [[extensional stress]] to the system. System response can be interpreted in terms of [[extensional rheology]].
 
:This interpretation is based on a link between [[shear rheology]], [[extensional rheology]] and [[acoustics]]. Relationship between these scientific disciplines was described in details by Litovitz and Davis in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Litovitz, T.A. and Davis, C.M. In "Physical Acoustics", Ed. W.P.Mason, vol. 2, chapter 5, ''Academic Press'', NY, (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known that properties of [[viscoelastic]] fluid are characterised in [[shear rheology]] with a [[shear modulus]] ''G'', which links [[shear stress]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[shear strain]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''
 
::&lt;math&gt; {T_{ij} = G \cdot S _{ij}} &lt;/math&gt;

There is similar linear relationship in [[extensional rheology]] between [[extensional stress]] ''P'', extensional strain ''S'' and extensional modulus ''K'':

::&lt;math&gt; {P = - K \cdot S} &lt;/math&gt;

Detail theoretical analysis indicates that propagation of [[sound]] or [[ultrasound]] through a viscoelastic fluid depends on both shear modulus ''G'' and extensional modulus ''K'',.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, P.M. and Ingard, K.U. "Theoretical Acoustics", ''Princeton University Press''(1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids", ''Elsevier'', (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; It is convenient to introduce a combined [[longitudinal modulus]] ''M'':

::&lt;math&gt; M =M' + M''=K + \frac{4}{3}G&lt;/math&gt;

There are simple equations that express longitudinal modulus in terms of acoustic properties, [[sound speed]] ''V'' and [[attenuation]] α

::&lt;math&gt;   M'= \rho \cdot V^2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;   M''= \frac{2 \rho \alpha V^3}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Acoustic rheometer measures [[sound speed]] and [[attenuation]] of [[ultrasound]] for a set of [[frequencies]] in the [[megahertz]] range. These measurable parameters can be converted into real and imaginary components of ''longitudinal modulus''. 

:Sound speed determines M', which is a measure of system [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. It can be converted into fluid [[compressibility]].
:Attenuation determines M", which is a measure of viscous properties, energy [[dissipation]]. This parameter can be considered as [[extensional viscosity]]
:In the case of [[Newtonian liquid]] attenuation yields information on the [[volume viscosity]]. [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)]] provides relationship among [[attenuation]], [[dynamic viscosity]] and [[volume viscosity]] of the Newtonian fluid.

This type of rheometer works at much higher frequencies than others. It is suitable for studying effects with much shorter [[relaxation time]]s than any other rheometer.

== Introduction ==
Ambio 4 was [[quadrophonic sound]] technology commercialised in the early 1970s that could reproduce the ambience or sound information of a room as well as play stereo.  Ambiophony was an extension of stereo reproduction to enhance the sense of realism and it could be used with nearly all stereo programme materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.beoworld.org/article_view.asp?id=143 |title = Ambiophony, Beoworld | accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was included in receivers, amplifiers and music centres from manufacturers including [[Philips]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RJThgvjoLc |title = Philips Ambio 4| accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferguson Electronics]] and [[Bang and Olufsen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.beoworld.org/prod_details.asp?pid=346 | title=Beomaster 4000 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside mono and stereo playback.  The electronics behind Ambiophony was based on, or similar to, the [[Hafler circuit]].

The '''Austrian Standards Institute''' (formerly {{lang-de|Österreichisches Normungsinstitut}}), abbreviated '''ASI''', is a [[standards organization]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] member body for [[Austria]]. 

== History ==
Its predecessor organization, the ''Österreichischer Normenausschuss für Industrie und Gewerbe'' (Austrian Standards Committee for Industry and Trade), was founded in the [[First Republic of Austria]] on 23 September 1920, with 13 committees developing [[technical standard]]s primarily for [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The first standard was published in 1921 on metric [[screw thread]]s. In 1932, the committee's name was shortened to the ''Österreichischer Normenausschuss'' (Austrian Standards Committee). With the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938, it became a branch office of the German ''[[Deutsches Institut für Normung]]'' (DIN) standards organization, but resumed operations in its own right after [[World War II]], and was a founding ISO member in 1946.

The 1954 Federal Act on Standardization recognized the activities of the committee, and the Act, as amended, serves as its legal basis. The Austrian Standards Committee's name was changed to the Austrian Standards Institute in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.on-norm.at/publish/50.html?&amp;L=1 as-search.at]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2006, the Institute published ON rule ONR 168000, used to calculate the monetary value of a [[brand]].

The Institute is located at Heinestrasse 38, 1020 [[Vienna]].

The '''Battlefield Combat Identification System''' ('''BCIS''') was a question and answer system, in which military combat vehicles were able to communicate via a 38-[[GHz]] [[electronic millimeter wave pulse]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2001/pdf/army/01bcis.pdf|title=BATTLFIELD COMBAT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (BCIS)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was mounted on Abrams Tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=439685|title=The Battlefield Combat Identification System:|last=Jones|first=Chad|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCIS was intended to reduce [[fratricide]], which became a concern during the [[Persian Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/07/27/avoiding-friendly-fire/145f87de-ad20-4c76-b7cb-544ed5a8ade9/|title=AVOIDING FRIENDLY FIRE'|date=1996-07-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The development of BCIS began after the US Army awarded a contract to TRW Inc. of Cleveland in 1993.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 1,200 systems were fielded to the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], TX in June 1999. Production of the system ended in 2003&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; due to the platform’s expense, which was estimated at $100,000 for each installation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navyleague.org/sea_power/nov_03_23.php|title=Navy League of the United States - Citizens in Support of the Sea Services|website=www.navyleague.org|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Fratricide concerns began during the Persian Gulf War, when 35 American troops were killed by friendly fire. During this period, soldiers often used low-tech methods to communicate, such as painting inverted "Vs" on allied vehicles or waving red-lensed flashlights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/13509/99Jun_Grabski.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Assessing the effectiveness of the battlefield combat identification system|last=Grabski|first=Mark|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army requirements for a combat identification system were recognized by the DoD’s Joint Requirements Oversight Council in March 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Operation==

Combat vehicles carried BCIS transmitters and receivers that sent pulses of energy to one another if the vehicles engaged. The encrypted signal identified vehicles as a friend or foe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During operation, a millimeter wave beam was transmitted from the gunner’s station, interrogating a potential target prior to firing.  A BCIS transponder automatically responded with a message, provided in the form of audio and visual signals to the interrogating gunner (i.e. Friend, Friend-at-Range, or Unknown).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=463|title=BCIS (VSX-3(V) Battlefield Combat Identification System)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCIS platform included an interrogator subassembly, a transponder subassembly, an antenna, a processor, display unit, and sight ring indicators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Khan (1968)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somigliana equation===
The above expression for ''g'' has been supplanted by the Somigliana equation (after [[Carlo Somigliana]]):

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi) = G_e \left[ \frac{1+k\sin^2 \varphi}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \sin^2 \varphi }} \right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where,

*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e,\mathbb{G}_p&lt;/math&gt; is the defined gravity at the equator and poles, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{b\mathbb{G}_p-a\mathbb{G}_e}{a\mathbb{G}_e}&lt;/math&gt; (formula constant);

'''Compressed air filters''', often referred to as '''line filters''', are used to remove contaminates from [[compressed air]] after compression has taken place.

When the filer is combined with a [[Pressure regulator|regulator]] and an oiler, it is called an '''air set'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holloway | first = Michael | title = Dictionary of industrial terms | publisher = Wiley John Wiley distributor | location = Hoboken, N.J. Chichester | year = 2013 | isbn = 1118589092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air leaving a standard [[Rotary screw compressor|screw]] or [[Reciprocating compressor|piston]] [[Gas compressor|compressor]] will generally have a high [[water]] content, as well as a high concentration of [[oil]] and other contaminants. There are many different types of filters, suitable for different [[pneumatics]] applications.

==Working principle==
Unfiltered [[compressed air]] frequently contains dust, oil, rust, moisture and other harmful substances, and therefore requires filtration. In the first stage of filtration, the compressed air passes through a tube-shaped mesh filter, which creates a [[coalescence (chemistry)| coalescence]] effect. Here bigger particles are [[adsorbed]] on the filter and the water will condense into larger droplets, which can then pass into the separation chamber. The compressed air is slowed down, which makes the particles condense on a [[honeycomb]]-like pad, allowing the water droplets to travel to the bottom of the drainage system and through an automatic or electric drain valve to the discharge. In the first filtration stage more than 95% of the water droplets, oil and large particles are removed. This practice is most common for removing water, but is also used for removing oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Remove Oil from Compressed Air Lines|url=http://www.laman.com/remove-oil-from-compressed-air-lines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second filtration stage the air is passed through fiber made of cotton, generating thousands of small vortices and accelerating the air. &lt;!--And how does that help? Feel free to add info!--&gt;

==Types of filters==

===Particulate filters===
Particulate compressed air filters are used to remove dust and particles from the air.

===Activated carbon filters===
[[Activated carbon]] filters utilize a composite carbon material to remove gases and odors from the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terminology|url=http://www.vokesair.com/air-filter-guide/terminology|author=Vokes Air|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in factories where food is produced or for [[breathing gas]].

===Coalescing filters===
High oil compressed air coalescing filters remove water and oil aerosols by coalescing the aerosols into droplets. This happens partially because of tortuous path and pressure drop. Coalescers remove both water and oil aerosols from the air stream, and are rated at particulate contamination through direct interception. Filtration of oil, water aerosols, dust and dirt particles to 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm the best achievable in industry.

===Cold coalescing filters===
Cold coalescing filters are coalescing filters operated at around {{convert|35|F|C}}, allowing them to be more effective at removing moisture.

===Compressed intake filters===
Intake filters are the first line of defense in filtering. These filters can remove contaminates down to 0.3&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] and can remove chemical contaminants.

'''Contouring''' is a [[makeup]] technique that uses [[cosmetics]] to define, enhance and sculpt the structure of the face&lt;ref name="teenvogue-how-to"&gt;{{cite news |last=Picardi |first=Phillip |url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-contour-makeup |title=So: What Is Contouring and Why Should You Care? |work=Teen Vogue |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |quote=Contouring is giving shape to an area of the face and enhancing the facial structure through makeup}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other body parts, such as breasts.&lt;ref name="Slate 24 February 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwedel|first1=Heather|title=On the Oscars Red Carpet, Keep an Eye Out for Boob Contouring|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/02/24/boob_contouring_is_the_latest_red_carpet_makeup_trend.html|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=Slate|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contouring is usually produced by placing a warm or cool toned colour that is one or two shades darker than the skin color in areas such as in the hollows of the cheeks, on the side of the nose, and on the temples to give a shadow and slimming effect. It can be complemented with a [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|highlighter]] that is one or two shades lighter than the skin color on areas of the face that is more prominent such as on the apples on the cheeks and the tip of the nose or the t-zone.

== History ==
In the 16th century, contouring was used by Elizabethan stage actors, who would apply chalk and soot to their faces to help audience members read their facial expressions.&lt;ref name="Byrdie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byrdie.com/history-of-contouring/slide9|title=From 1500 to 2015: The Fascinating History of Contouring|website=Byrdie|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, when electricity was invented and lights were widely used, soot was no longer an option. Instead of soot, actors would use greasepaint to help audience members decipher their emotions. In 1800s-1900s, Queen Victoria deemed makeup as vulgar, as only stage actors and prostitutes wore makeup. Makeup could only be purchased in costume stores.&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In the 1920s and 30s, contouring could be seen in the film world. German actress, [[Marlene Dietrich]] would contour her face for her films. She would accentuate the natural lines of her face with shading and sculpting.&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In 1934, makeup artist [[Max Factor Sr.]] was famous for applying makeup for stage actors. He added shading to the face so that it wouldn't appear flat on film. In 1945, he released the first tutorial on how to contour the face, for different face shapes.&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In 1944, Ben Nye, a famous makeup artist, did the makeup for characters in [[Gone with the Wind (film)]] and [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)]]. He then created his own makeup line, which is still popular today.&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In the 1950s, a time of Old Hollywood glamour, features were subtly contoured and shaded. This method was used by such actresses as [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In the 1990s, makeup artist [[Kevyn Aucoin]] was responsible for the sculpted, chiseled look of [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Cindy Crawford]], and [[Janet Jackson]].&lt;ref name="Byrdie" /&gt;

In the 2000s, the practice of "body contouring" – the application of contouring to other parts of the body than the face, such as [[shinbone]]s or breasts ("boob contouring") – became more widely noticed as a result of the increasing number of images of celebrities appearing in [[social media]].&lt;ref name="Slate 24 February 2017" /&gt;

Noggings may be made of timber, steel, or aluminium. If made of timber they are cut slightly longer than the space they fit into, and are driven into place so they fit tightly or are rebated into the [[wall stud]].

The interval between noggings is dictated by local [[building code]]s and by the type of timber used; a typical [[Timber framing|timber-framed house]] in a non-cyclonic area will have two or three noggings per storey between each pair of neighbouring studs.  Additional noggings may be added as grounds for later fixings.

Noggings between vertical studs generally brace the studs against [[buckling]] under load; noggings on floor joists prevent the joists from twisting or rotating under load ([[buckling#Lateral-torsional buckling|lateral-torsional buckling]]), and are often fixed at intervals, in pairs diagonally for that reason.  In floors this type of bracing is also called [[herringbone strutting]].

Noggings provide no bracing effect in [[shear stress|shear]] and are generally supplemented by diagonal bracing to prevent the frame from racking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9103">[[File:Pióro elektryczne.jpg|thumb|right|The complete duplicating outfit including Edison's electric pen.]][[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] '''electric pen''', part of a complete outfit for duplicating handwritten documents and drawings, was the first relatively safe electric-motor-driven office [[small appliance|appliance]] produced and sold in the [[United States]].

==Development==

Edison recognized the possible demand for a high speed copying device after observing the incredible amount of document duplication required of merchants, lawyers, insurance companies, and those of similar occupations.&lt;ref name = Rutgers&gt;"Thomas A. Edison Papers." Electric Pen - The Edison Papers. Rutgers, n.d. Web. 14 Feb. 2017. &lt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/pen.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy this demand, Edison invented the electric pen, which uses a perforating function inspired by the [[printing telegraph]]. Edison and his associate [[Charles Batchelor]] observed that as this device punctured the paper, a mark was left underneath by the chemical solution it utilized. Edison took advantage of this property and built the electric pen around it.&lt;ref name = electricpen&gt;Burns, Bill. "Edison’s Electric Pen." Edison’s Electric Pen. FTL Design, n.d. Web. 14 Feb. 2017. &lt;http://electricpen.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ETHW&gt;Engineering and Technology History Wiki. "Edison's Electric Pen." Edison's Electric Pen - Engineering and Technology History Wiki. Engineering and Technology History Wiki, 14 Sept. 2015. Web. 15 Feb. 2017. &lt;http://ethw.org/Edison's_Electric_Pen&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Development of the electric pen took place in the summer of 1875. US patent 1800,857 for autographic printing was issued to Thomas Edison in 1876, covering the pen, the duplication press, and accessories.

== Design and use ==

The electric pen was the key component of a complete duplicating system, which included the pen, a cast-iron holder with a wooden insert, a [[wet cell]] battery on a cast-iron stand, and a cast-iron flatbed duplicating press with ink roller. All the cast-iron parts were black [[japanned]], with gold striping or decoration. The hand-held electric pen was powered by a wet cell battery, which was wired to an [[electric motor]] mounted on top of a pen-like shaft. The motor drove a reciprocating needle which, according to the manual, could make 50 punctures per second, or 3,000 per minute. The user was instructed to place the stencil on firm [[blotting paper]] on a flat surface, then use the pen to write or draw naturally to form words and designs as a series of minute perforations in the stencil.

Once the [[stencil]] was prepared, it was placed in the flatbed duplicating press with a blank sheet of paper below. An inked roller was passed over the stencil, leaving an impression of the image on the paper. Edison boasted that over 5,000 copies could be made from one stencil.

==Advertising==

===Marketing===

Edison’s main target audience included firms that depended on the duplication of documents to run their business.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; To drive demand, Edison advertised in a circular that was written by the pen itself, in which the pen was called “the “Electro-Autographic Press” and was said to be “the only process yet invented whereby an unlimited number of impressions can be taken with rapidity from ordinary manuscript.”&lt;ref name = Smithsonian&gt;Watson, Bruce. "A Wizard's Scribe." Smithsonian.com. Smithsonian Institution, 01 Aug. 1998. Web. 14 Feb. 2017. &lt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-wizards-scribe-155712387/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Another advertisement made by the pen read “Like Kissing--Every Succeeding Impression is as Good as the First--Endorsed By Every One Who Has Tried It!--Only a Gentle Pressure Used.” with the words floating around an embracing couple.&lt;ref name = Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name = DMA&gt;"Electric Pen." Electric Pen - Dead Media Archive. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Feb. 2017 &lt;http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Electric_Pen&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===

Aside from companies, the electric pen was also marketed to the general public, with other uses for the invention being personal letters, pamphlets, music, contracts, circulars, and architectural and mechanical drawings among other types of documents.&lt;ref name = DMA/&gt;&lt;ref name = Baldwin&gt;Baldwin, Neil. Edison: Inventing the Century. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1875, the pen was at first sold only in the [[East Coast of the United States]] at the starting price of $30. It was further spread to the [[Midwest]], [[British Columbia]], and [[England]] after its rise in popularity, when more than 150 pens were being sold monthly.&lt;ref name = ETHW/&gt;&lt;ref name = Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name = DMA/&gt;&lt;ref name = Baldwin/&gt; The market continued to expand to [[Cuba]] and [[South America]], with [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] being added by 1877.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; However, by 1880, the business for the electric pen started to decline when other inventions that were more efficient soon overtook Edison’s product in the market, causing it to eventually fall into obscurity.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; It is said that roughly 60,000 pens were sold throughout its commercial lifespan in total; however, this number is likely to be made up by Edison in order to give the product more publicity.&lt;ref name = electricpen/&gt;&lt;ref name = ETHW/&gt;

==Drawbacks==

===Battery operation===

The major drawback to Edison’s electric pen was its wet cell battery, which had to be taken care of and maintained by experienced [[telegraphists]].&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt;&lt;ref name = Smithsonian/&gt; Due to its messy nature, it was important for Edison to incorporate batteries that were more acceptable to clerks who had to take care of the pen and its underlying machinery.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; Otherwise, the bankers and insurance people may never take interest in it, as said by Mullarkey, an ex-telegraph operator and New York agent for Edison.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt;

===Competition===

The need for batteries in the electric pen ultimately caused its steady decline, as mechanical pens that did not require batteries to operate took over the market by 1880.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; These pens, along with other cheaper and simpler stencil-making technologies quickly became more popular and widely used, until all were eventually overtaken by the [[typewriter]] by the late 1880s.&lt;ref name = ETHW/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Mimeograph===

Edison started selling the rights to manufacture and market the pens as early as the end of 1876, but it was not until the mid-1880s that the A.B. Dick Company finally ended up with the rights and patent to the invention.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt;&lt;ref name = Smithsonian/&gt; The Chicago manufacturer went on to create the [[mimeograph]], an electric pen spin-off marketed specifically as "Edison’s Mimeograph" under his permission.&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt; Unlike the electric pen, the mimeograph sold with relative success, and the A.B. Dick Company remained in business until 2004.&lt;ref name = electricpen/&gt;

===Tattoo industry===

After its life as a writing implement had ended, the electric pen was adapted to fulfill an entirely different role. In 1891, a [[New York City]] tattoo artist [[Samuel O’Reilly]] repurposed the electric pen’s design to be used as the first electric [[tattoo needle]].&lt;ref name = Rutgers/&gt;&lt;ref name = NYHS&gt;McCarthy, Ryan. "Edison and the Tattoo." New-York Historical Society. N.p., 08 July 2015. Web. 14 Feb. 2017. &lt;http://blog.nyhistory.org/edison-and-the-tattoo/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; What was previously done by hand was now done at a much faster pace thanks to this revolutionary device. Around this time, tattoos were starting to rise as a cultural phenomenon thanks to their popularity among European nobility. O’Reilly took advantage of this and produced an electric tattoo needle to give him the edge in this new market. While O’Reilly enjoyed considerable success in this, his abrupt death in 1908 cut his lucrative life short. O’Reilly’s apprentice Charles Wagner inherited the business from his master.&lt;ref name = NYHS/&gt;

===Modern value===

An October 2015 episode of ''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]'' program ''[[American Pickers]]'' finds a European version Electric Pen in a private Wisconsin collection of early electric devices. The owner says recent auctions have seen other examples sell for between $15,000 and $20,000 USD &lt;ref name = smithauc&gt;Smith Auction Company. "Chester County's Smith Auction Company." Chester County's Smith Auction Company. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular Electric Pen also includes a very rare battery box. The owner sells the Pen to the Pickers for $12,000, which they expect to resell at a higher price.

The '''Electronics Technician (ET) Distance Education program''' provides flexible, skills-based training in [[electronics]]. It has been developed for [[adult learners]] pursuing [[electronics technician]]-level training through independent study, specifically students who cannot attend college full-time because of work or family commitments. The program was developed and launched in 1997 by Dr. [[Colin Simpson (electronics professor)|Colin Simpson]], a best-selling author and electronics professor at [[George Brown College]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Since then, the award-winning &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accc.ca/ftp/pubs/CollegeCanada/CollegeCanada-v3-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009071242/http://www.accc.ca/ftp/pubs/CollegeCanada/CollegeCanada-v3-2.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; program has grown to become the largest of its kind in the world.

With over 10,000 students studying electronics at a distance, the ET [[distance education]] program has effectively broken down the barriers that prevent students from accessing technical course material on-line. Of note is that the program has broken the gender barrier in the study of electronics. Typically, less than 2% of students who study electronics in [[Colleges]] and [[Universities]] are female. In the ET distance education program almost 20% of the student’s are female, which has been attributed to the accessibility of the learning material and the integrative [[multimedia]] courseware which is designed to scaffold student learning and accommodate learning style differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://best.berkeley.edu/~aagogino/fie95/FIE95.4a2.1.agogino.html FIE95 - Agogino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529010442/http://best.berkeley.edu/~aagogino/fie95/FIE95.4a2.1.agogino.html |date=2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1995, Simpson approached [[Joe Koenig]], President of [[Electronics Workbench]] (EWB), with the concept of integrating course material from Simpson’s [[Principles of Electronics]] textbook with laboratory [[simulation software]] developed by EWB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courseweb.xu.edu.ph/courses/files/Electronics%20Workbench%20News%20No_%208.htm Electronics Workbench News No. 8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Learning Management System]] was developed by Logic Design Inc which integrated the course material, multimedia and simulation software, and included real-time testing and assessment. At the time, there was considerable opposition among the electronics education community regarding the use of simulation software for the delivery of electronics curriculum. Many educators felt that a “hands on” methodology was the only valid method of learning electronics, and that simulation was a less-effective substitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/ESM4714/Student_Proj/class03/stillwater/prj/project/sim_pandc.htm Simulation Advantages - Disadvantages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111145/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/ESM4714/Student_Proj/class03/stillwater/prj/project/sim_pandc.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson and Koenig embarked on a series of lectures, conference presentations and meetings with accrediting organizations throughout 1996, where they demonstrated that [[electronics simulation]] software could achieve identical results to laboratory experiments performed with real equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Electronics Magazine, The New Virtual World of Electronics Laboratories, pp. 3-5, Gernsbeck Publishing, New York, October, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 1997 the program received approval and accreditation from the [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities]] and was launched in April, 1997. In its first year, the program enrolled over 500 students from 17 countries, with over 30 companies sponsoring employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcourse.com/press_release_06_08_1998.html Press Release - January 12, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the program received the Program Excellence Award, from the [[Association of Canadian Community Colleges]], a consortium of 155 Colleges. It was the first time a distance education program had earned this award and was noted by ACCC President, Gerald Brown, as a “landmark achievement in the field of distance education”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
In 2003, the program received a $1 million grant from the Government of Ontario for the development of a “[[virtual campus]]” to support students who were enrolled in 85 cities and towns throughout the province. The award was presented by [[TVOntario]] President, [[Isabel Bassett]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobboomcc.canoe.ca/News/2003/03/26/1225158-sun.html Jobboom Career Connection - EDUCATION FLASH - TVO launches online education programs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, the program underwent a significant revision when the laboratory software simulation was changed to [[CircuitLogix]], which included both 2D and 3D simulation. The simulation capability of the new simulation software allowed for further integration of course theory and lab and greatly enhanced the program’s virtual learning environment &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcourse.com/press_release_01_12_2007.html Press Release - January 12, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CircuitLogix3.jpg|CircuitLogix lab simulation used in ET distance ed program.|thumb|left]] --&gt;
In recent years, the program has expanded through partnerships between Colleges across North America, enabling the program to be supported in local areas. In addition to the accreditation offered by Colleges delivering the program, graduates are also eligible for certification by external accrediting organizations such as the [[Electronics Technicians Association]] and the International Society of Certified Engineering Technicians. Colleges who are part of this consortium include: [[Allegany College of Maryland]], [[Allen County Community College]], [[Anne Arundel Community College]], [[Brooklyn College]], [[Thomas Edison State University]], [[Hocking College]], [[Horry-Georgetown Technical College]], [[MiraCosta College]], [[Mount Wachusett Community College]], and [[Valencia Community College]],.

==Pedagogy==
The ET distance education program covers an introductory curriculum in electronics equivalent to a two-year college associate degree. Contents of the program includes [[Electric current|Current]], [[Voltage]], [[Electrical resistance|Resistance]], [[Ohm's Law]], Parallel and Series Circuits, [[Magnetism]], AC/DC Circuits, [[Capacitance]], [[Inductance]], [[Transformers]], [[Resonance]], Filters, [[control relay]]s, [[relay logic]], [[Transistors]], [[Semiconductors]], [[Amplifiers]], [[Integrated Circuits]] and [[Digital electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coned.georgebrown.ca/owa_prod/cewskcrss.P_Certificate?area_code=PA0038&amp;cert_code=CE0185 GBC - Continuing Education - Electronics Technician Certificate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive multimedia program presents twenty-three modules of interactive curriculum using text, video, 2D and 3D animations, photos, audio clips and interactive electronic circuit simulation using CircuitLogix. The simulation software provides more than 400 laboratory projects as part of the curriculum, allowing students to design circuitry, perform tests and work with electronic equipment as though in a real electronics workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobboomcc.canoe.ca/News/2003/12/03/1225393-sun.html Jobboom Career Connection - SCHOOL CONNECTION - Education from a distance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is delivered in an [[asynchronous learning|asynchronous]], self-paced format and allows the student to determine the time required to complete the program. Due to the [[empirical]] nature of electronics curriculum, and the high level of integration of lab simulation software, students are able to successfully complete the course material with a minimum amount of interaction with faculty and staff at the College. When support is required, it is provided through the “virtual campus”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcourse.com/college.html About ETCourse Electronics Technician Training Courses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''equalising beam''', '''equalising lever''' or '''equalising bar'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Or "equalizing" beam,etc.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Ausgleichshebel}} or ''Ausgleichhebel'') links the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] of two or more adjacent axles of a vehicle with more than two axles, especially [[railway]] [[locomotive]]s. Its job is to provide 'compensated' springing,&lt;ref&gt;Semmens, P.W.B. and Goldfinch A. J. (2003). ''How Steam Locomotives Really Work'', Oxford and New York, OUP, pp. 242-243. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860782-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. to ensure an even and [[statically determinate]] distribution of load to all the axles on uneven terrain or poorly laid track. The function of an equalising lever thus corresponds roughly to that of axle compensators or rockers (''Achswippen'').

A '''floodway''' is a [[flood plain]] crossing for a road, built at or close to the natural ground level.&lt;ref name="Vital Link"&gt;{{cite book |first=Leigh |last=Edmonds|author-link=Leigh Edmonds |title=The Vital Link: A History of Main Roads Western Australia 1926–1996 |publisher=University of Western Australia Press |location=Nedlands, Western Australia |year=1997 |isbn=1-875560-87-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are designed to be submerged under water, but withstand such conditions. Typically floodways are used when the flood frequency or time span is minimal, traffic volumes are low, and the cost of a bridge is uneconomic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=MRWA Waterways Section|author2=BG&amp;E Pty Ltd|title=Floodway Design Guide|url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Floodway%20Design%20Guide.PDF|publisher=Main Roads Western Australia|accessdate=15 April 2015|page=4|format=PDF|date=24 April 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415031003/https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Floodway%20Design%20Guide.PDF|archivedate=15 April 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6XnX3UlUb?url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Floodway%20Design%20Guide.PDF |date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=[[Austroads]] | author2=Flavell, David | author3=Audora, Henry | title=Waterway design : a guide to the hydraulic design of bridges, culverts and floodways | publication-date=1994 | publisher=[[Austroads]] | isbn=978-0-85588-440-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – in most cases, in rural areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9434">The [[United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America]] union (UCAPAWA) changed its name to '''Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers''' (FTA) in 1944.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Aaron|last2=Day|first2= Benjamin|last3=Ness|first3=Immanuel|title=The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History|year=2009|publisher=Sharpe|location=Chapel Hill|page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FTA sought to further organize cannery units and realized the best way to do this would be through organizing women and immigrant workers and in 1945 started finding success to these ends.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  The FTA started to experience problems when the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT) began interfering in its organizing efforts.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  The [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|IBT]] was affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and the FTA was affiliated with its rival, the radical, [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  The IBT union was more conservative in regards to women and immigrant workers.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  It did not have much interest in integrating them into the union.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  It was far more concerned with making [[sweetheart deals]] and collecting union dues.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  This willingness to maintain the status quo made the IBT a favorite among [[California]] Processors and growers.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  This meant that they signed more contracts with processors and growers than the FTA, which ultimately undermined the more radical FTA union.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  [[The Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 further damaged the FTA.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  This act stated that [[United States|American]] [[labor force|labor]] [[Trade union|unions]] could not have [[communist]] ties and the FTA had many.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  Because of this act many of the organizers either left the union or were deported.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  It was at this time that the FTA as a whole was expelled from the CIO.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;  This put the IBT in the center of the California [[cannery]] [[industry]] and it remained there for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="Brenner-p445" /&gt;

==Communism and Anti-Communism==
The Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA) have had constant ideological and political battles between the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).  A lot of what caused this constant friction was that the FTA had a lot of members who were involved with various communist parties and/or organizations.  More importantly, "The real active Communist Party leaders within the union."&lt;ref name="Korstad-p325"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korstad|first=Robert|title=Civil Rights Unionism: Tobacco Workers and the Struggle for Democracy in the Mid-Twentieth-Century South|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent active [[Communist Party]] members within the FTA included [[Theodosia Simpson]], [[Velma Hopkins]], [[Viola Brown]], [[Moranda Smith]], [[Christine Gardner]], [[Robert Black (labor unionist)|Robert Black]], [[Clark Sheppard]], [[John Henry Miller]], [[Jethro Dunlap]], and [[Vivian Bruce]].&lt;ref name="Korstad-p325" /&gt; The anti-communist sentiment of not only the more [[conservative]]/[[liberalism|liberal]] [[labor unions]], but the national community at large felt that the "Communist Inspired" militant party members prevented settlements at the time of negotiations.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p325" /&gt; The general sentiment perceived that the tactics the [[Communist Party]] members of the FTA used would "lead to trouble and possibly to race rioting."&lt;ref name="Korstad-p322"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korstad|first=Robert|title=Civil Rights Unionism: Tobacco Workers and the Struggle for Democracy in the Mid-Twentieth-Century South|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillip Murray President]] of the CIO had held strong anti-communist political and theoretical beliefs, but even he himself was convinced that "[[anti-Communism]] played into the hands of labor’s enemies."&lt;ref name="Korstad-p322" /&gt; [[Phillip Murray]] held and shared many of the core beliefs that members of the [[Communist Party]] in the FTA and the FTA in general agreed to.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p322" /&gt; Some of those beliefs included, "continued cooperation between the United States and the Soviet
Union, and he was committed to maintaining the CIO as an inclusive federation of politically diverse industrial unions."&lt;ref name="Korstad-p322" /&gt; Despite having conflict with the FTA, Murray felt that organizing against labor’s enemies was more beneficial to workers as opposed to focusing energy fighting against the FTA whose political and tactics mirrored those of the [[Communist Party]].

==Interracialism==
At a time when big labor unions were racially prejudiced, the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA) took a stance of organizing community members of racial backgrounds. African American and Black members of the FTA held high ethics of racial pride and had held a strong foundation of solidarity that transcended the boundaries of race.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p240"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korstad|first=Robert|title=Civil Rights Unionism: Tobacco Workers and the Struggle for Democracy in the Mid-Twentieth-Century South|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; For African American/Black members of the FTA, the black church had played a huge influence on their politics of [[interracialism]].  The black church held the belief "whites would cast off the sin of [[racism]] and embrace the brotherhood of all people, in part by the secular [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] of a left-led union, and in part by popular [[anticolonialism]]."&lt;ref name="Korstad-p240" /&gt; Organizers of FTA and local black and white leaders were diligent in seeking to break down any racial barriers that would prevent class solidarity from prospering.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p240" /&gt; In 1944, the FTA had found themselves on the tail end of a controversial issue that had arisen in a court hearing that had to do with the contract negotiations between Reynolds and Local 22.  White workers in the [[Employees Association]] were involved in a shouting match that broke out between union leaders, which ultimately resulted in William Deberry being charged with assaulting a white woman. This caused problems for the FTA because the public had predicted that FTA’s principles of "race mixing" would lead to violence and violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Korstad|first=Robert|title=Civil Rights Unionism: Tobacco Workers and the Struggle for Democracy in the Mid-Twentieth-Century South|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Dixie==

Beginning in 1946, in an effort to organize the largely unorganized [[south]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] officials began what is called [[Operation Dixie]].&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korstad|first=Robert|title=Civil Rights Unionism: Tobacco Workers and the Struggle for Democracy in the Mid-Twentieth-Century South|year=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done for multiple reasons, the first being it sought to organize the [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[textile industry]] in order to close the [[Income inequality in the United States|wage gap]] that existed between the North and South stopping the potential flight risk from the North due to the cheap, organized labor that was available in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Nelson|title=State of the Union: A Century of American Labor|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, this effort was also an assault on [[Bourbon Democrats|the Bourbons]] who until then had been the ruling southern power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Nelson|title=State of the Union: A Century of American Labor|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; To start CIO flooded the streets with 200 organizes in what was called the "Holy Crusade" of organizing.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt; This movement quickly inspired the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] to engage in the same organizing efforts beginning a competition between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt;  Out of fear that it could potentially lose some of its less radical unions the FTA joined the organizing efforts.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt;  The FTA was a vital part of [[Operation Dixie]] and its effects can be seen by what it accomplished in North Carolina where they won 25 elections against the AFL.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt;  This was despite the fact that this organizing was done in the midst of a [[Jim Crow]] south.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt;  In the end, it was the Jim Crow laws and the resulting racial strife that contributed to the defeat of this campaign.&lt;ref name="Korstad-p290" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">[[File:Ecrans jeux de role.jpg|thumb|300px|A variety of gamemaster's screens for different role-playing games.]]
A '''gamemaster's (GM) screen''', also called '''[[Dungeon Master|dungeon master]]'s (DM) screen''', is a gaming accessory, usually made out of cardboard, used by the [[gamemaster (tabletop role-playing)|gamemaster]] to hide all the relevant data related to a [[tabletop role-playing game]] session, hiding them from the players in order to not spoil the plot of the story.

==General description==
Very often the front side of the screen just displays an illustration, usually related to the game's subject. The reverse side is most of the times filled with tables, rules and other useful gaming data.

Some role-playing games have an adapted name for their gamemaster's screen. ''Dungeon Master's Screen'' is the term used, for example, for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' gamemaster's screen.

In addition to the official gamemaster's screens sold by professional gaming publishers, some customizable models are also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hammerdog.com/twgs/index.html TWGS, for ''The World's Greatest Screen''], an example of a customizable gamemaster's screen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen'' (S2P10002), Pinnacle Entertainment Group, 2003, 33.00 x 8.50 inches, {{ISBN|9781930855595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The MR1 system is relatively small and stable, and is towed at a depth of 80 to 100 meters.  Because it is not hull-mounted, this data collection system has the ability to withstand rough conditions.&lt;ref name=boiler/&gt;

The HAWAII MR1 also has the capability to measure and collect [[bathymetric]] and [[backscatter]] data simultaneously, and record raw acoustic data 
independently of human supervision. After collecting data, the data can be processed with software available from HMRG.&lt;ref name=boiler/&gt;

The width of a scan produced by the system varies, depending upon whether it is producing a bathymetry swath or a sidescan swath; the swath while recording bathymetry data is 3.4 times the water depth and the swath while recording sidescan data is 7.5 times the water depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HMRG/MR1/mr1swath/index.html HAWAII MR1: Swath Capability]. Retrieved 2009-9-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
The HAWAII MR1 was chosen to be used on an expedition headed by [[Robert Ballard]], the person who discovered the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The goal of the expedition was to find the USS ''Yorktown'', which they did successfully.  Ballard said of the sonar, "It was the [University of Hawaii mapping team's sonar] that enabled us to find it."&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Bruce Appelgate, at the time director of field operations at HMRG, noted that they were fortunate in finding the ship, as it was at the very edge of the MR1's resolution.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The ship was 17,000 feet (5.2&amp;nbsp;km) underwater.&lt;ref name=star /&gt;

The mapping system was also used in the discovery of the HMRG Deep, the second deepest spot in the world (after the [[Challenger Deep]]).&lt;ref name=HMRGdeep/&gt;

This standard supersedes earlier documents such as EN 46001 and EN 46002 (both 1997), the previously published ISO 13485 (1996 and 2003), and ISO 13488 (also 1996). ISO 13485:2016 Certificates meets the requirement of IEC 60601-2-25 : 1993 + A1: 1999 safety of Electrocardiograms. 

The current ISO 13485 effective edition was published on 1 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=59752|title=ISO 13485:2016 - Medical devices -- Quality management systems -- Requirements for regulatory purposes|website=www.iso.org|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is tailored to the industry's quality system expectations and regulatory requirements, an organization does not need to be actively manufacturing medical devices or their components to seek certification to this standard, in contrast to the automotive sector's [[ISO/TS 16949]], where only firms with an active [[request for quotation]], or on the bid list, of an [[International Automotive Task Force]] supply chain manufacturer can seek registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsiamerica.com/en-us/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-schemes/ISO-TS-16949/ISOTS-169492002-Questions-and-answers/|title=IATF 16949:2016 Automotive Quality Management System - BSI America - BSI America|website=www.bsiamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reason for use ==
While it remains a stand-alone document, ISO 13485 is generally harmonized with [[ISO 9001]]. A principal difference, however, is that ISO 9001 requires the organization to demonstrate [[continual improvement]], whereas ISO 13485 requires only that the certified organization demonstrate the quality system is effectively implemented and maintained. Additionally, the ISO 9001 requirements regarding [[customer satisfaction]] are absent from the medical device standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/85096-understanding-iso-13485|title=Understanding ISO 13485|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other specific differences include:

* the promotion and awareness of regulatory requirements as a management responsibility. Examples of market-specific regulatory requirements include 21 CFR 820, the Quality System Regulation for medical devices sold in the United States, enforced by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), or the [[Medical Devices Directive]] 93/42/EEC, required for doing business in the European Union
* controls in the work environment to ensure product safety
* focus on [[risk management]] activities and [[design controls|design control]] activities during product development
* specific requirements for inspection and traceability for implantable devices
* specific requirements for documentation and validation of processes for sterile medical devices
* specific requirements for verification of the effectiveness of [[corrective and preventive action]]s

Compliance with ISO 13485 is often seen as the first step in achieving compliance with European regulatory requirements. The conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device according to [[Directive (European Union)|European Union Directives]] 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC must be assessed before sale is permitted. 
One of the major requirements to prove conformity is the implementation of the Quality Management System according ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and [[ISO 14971]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 9001|url=https://qualitymanagement.co.uk/iso-9001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as "Registrars". Several registrars also act as [[Notified Body]]. 
For those medical devices requiring the pre-market involvement of a Notified Body, the result of a positive assessment from the Notified Body is the certificate of conformity allowing the [[CE mark]] and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union.
A very careful assessment of the company Quality Management System by the Notified Body, together with the review of the required Technical Documentation, is a major element which the Notified Body takes into account to issue the certificate of conformity to the company product(s).

This standard adopted by CEN as EN ISO 13485:2003/AC:2007 is harmonized with respect to the European medical device directives [[Medical Devices Directive|93/42/EEC]], 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/meddevic.html|title=Summary list of titles and references of harmonised standards related to medical devices - DG Enterprise &amp; Industry. European Commission|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201170835/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/meddevic.html|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 13485 is now considered to be inline standard and requirement for medical devices even with "[[Global Harmonization Task Force]] Guidelines" (GHTF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghtf.org|title=GHTF is no longer in operation|website=www.ghtf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHTF guidelines are slowly becoming universal standards for design, manufacture, export and sales of various medical devices. The GHTF has been replaced in the last few years by the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum (IMDRF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdrf.org/|title=International Medical Device Regulators Forum|website=www.imdrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is structured differently from the GHTF as only the regulators, that are primary members of the group, get to make many of the decisions. The IMDRF main membership (the regulators) do want to have non-regulators involved without voting rights and in this way they are hoping to get the process and documents completed quicker than under the GHTF system (regulators &amp; non-regulators were equal in voting rights) that worked reasonably well, but somewhat slow.

This standard adopted by CEN as EN ISO 13485:2012 is harmonized with respect to the European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenelec.eu/dyn/www/f?p=104:110:3534353077576903::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_PROJECT,FSP_LANG_ID:10384,24011,25|title=CENELEC - Standards Development - List of Technical Bodies -|website=www.cenelec.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico has published in October 11, 2012 a national standard as a [[Norma Oficial Mexicana]] (NOM) to control manufacture of medical devices inside the country. NOM-241-SSA1-2012, Buenas Practicas de Fabricación para Establecimientos dedicados a la Fabricación de Dispositivos Médicos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5272051&amp;fecha=11/10/2012|title=NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-241-SSA1-2012, Buenas prácticas de fabricación para establecimientos dedicados a la fabricación de dispositivos médicos.|website=www.dof.gob.mx|access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of application is mandatory in the national territory, for all establishments dedicated to the process of medical devices marketed in the country. The [[Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk|Cofepris]] is the body assigned to its control, verification and to grant the records of compliance to the companies that implement this Standard of Good Manufacturing Practices. This standard is partially in line with ISO 13485: 2003 and ISO 9001: 2008.

In 2017, The Farmacopea de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States Pharmacopoeia), medical industrial sectors and Cofepris are working together for updating NOM-241 Standard, putting special attention on manage of risks during manufacture and regulating by manufacturing lines some of the most important medical devices manufacturing processes. This standard will be published in August 2018, and 180 days after publication it will become mandatory for the industry.

In Spain, medical devices are named in ISO-13485 as "Sanitary Products" as Castellano-language translation of ISO-13485, but in Mexico they are known as "Medical Devices" and correspond to those used in medical practice and that meet the definition established by NOM-241 as: Medical device, to the substance, mixture of substances, material, apparatus or instrument (including the computer program necessary for its proper use or application), used alone or in combination in the diagnosis, monitoring or prevention of human or auxiliary diseases in the treatment of the same and of the disability, as well as the employees in the replacement, correction, restoration or modification of the anatomy or human physiological processes. Medical devices include products of the following categories: medical equipment, prostheses, orthotics, functional aids, diagnostic agents, supplies for dental use, surgical, healing and hygiene products.
ISO 13485:2016 Certificates meets the requirement of IEC 60601-2-25 : 1993 + A1: 1999 safety of Electrocardiograms.

The '''International Federation for Information Processing''' ('''IFIP''') is a global organisation for researchers and professionals working in the field of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to conduct research, develop standards and promote information sharing.

Established in 1960 under the auspices of [[UNESCO]], IFIP is recognised by the United Nations and links some 50 national and international societies and academies of science with a total membership of over half a million professionals. IFIP is based in [[Laxenburg]], [[Austria]] and is an international, non-governmental organisation that operates on a non-profit basis.

== Overview ==
IFIP activities are coordinated by 13 Technical Committees (TCs) which are organised into more than 100 Working Groups (WGs), bringing together over 3,500 ICT professionals and researchers from around the world to conduct research, develop standards and promote information sharing. Each TC covers a particular aspect of computing and related disciplines, as detailed below.

IFIP actively promotes the principle of open access and proceedings for which IFIP holds the copyright are made available electronically via IFIP's Open Access [[Digital Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.ifip.org |title=IFIP Open Access Digital Library |accessdate=November 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Downloading articles from IFIP's Open DL is not only free of charge, but unlike commercial publishers and other professional organisations, IFIP does not charge authors of open access articles to publish in its Open DL.

Conference and workshop organizers who prefer printed proceedings can take advantage of the agreement between IFIP and [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]  and publish their proceedings as part of IFIP's Advances in Information and Communication Technology (AICT) series or in the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] (LNCS) series. Proceedings published by Springer in IFIP's LNCS and AICT series will be included within IFIP's Open DL after an embargo period of three years.

An important activity of the IFIP Technical Committees is to organise and sponsor high quality conferences and workshops in the field of ICT. Sponsoring is generally in the form of Best Paper Awards (BPA) and/or Student Travel Grants (STG). To assist conference and workshop organisers, IFIP has facilities to host conference websites and supports conference management systems such as JEMS, which include export functions that seamlessly integrate with IFIP's Open DL.

== History ==
IFIP was established in 1960 under the auspices of [[UNESCO]], originally under the name of the ''International Federation of Information Processing Societies'' (IFIPS). In preparation, UNESCO had organised the first International Conference on Information Processing, which took place in June 1959 in [[Paris]], and is now considered the first IFIP Congress.

The name was changed to IFIP in 1961. The organisation's original contribution was to define the [[ALGOL 60]] programming language, in one of the first examples of truly international collaboration in computer science, leaving a durable mark on the entire field.

The founding president of IFIP was [[Isaac L. Auerbach]] (1960&amp;ndash;1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor_roll/fame-detail.php?recordID=394 |title=Isaac L Auerbach |publisher=[[IT History Society]] |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403053341/http://ithistory.org/honor_roll/fame-detail.php?recordID=394 |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, IFIP established the International Professional Practice Partnership (IFIP IP3) to lead the development of the global ICT profession."&lt;ref name="ifipnewsmarch2010"&gt;{{cite web | url =   http://www.ifip.org/images/stories/ifip/public/Newsletter/2009to2010/news_mar_2010.pdf | title = IFIP News March 2010 – IP3 News March 2010 | publisher   = [[IFIP]]| accessdate  = April 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =   http://www.ipthree.org/ | title = IP3 -- Leading the Development of the Global IT Profession | publisher   = IP3| accessdate  = April 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical Committees ==
IFIP's activities are centered on its 13 Technical Committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifip.or.at/tcs.htm|title=Technical Committees|publisher=|access-date=2005-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207082507/http://www.ifip.or.at/tcs.htm|archive-date=2005-02-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are divided into Working Groups.  These groups, (with names like "WG 2.4 Software Implementation Technology") organise conferences and workshops, distribute technical papers and promote discussion and research outcomes.

=== IFIP TC6 Communication Systems ===
Established in 1971, IFIP TC6&lt;ref name="TC6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifip.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/ifip/tc/6|title=IFIP - TCs - IFIP TC 6|last=NÃ¶tzold|first=Volker|website=ifip.informatik.uni-hamburg.de|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Communication Systems) is one of the largest TCs within IFIP in terms of activities and revenues. TC6 has nine Working Groups (WGs) as well as a number of Special Interest Groups (SIGs), the majority of which are concerned either with specific aspects of communications systems themselves or with the application of communications systems. In addition, one WG focuses on communications in developing countries. TC6 meets twice a year, in spring and fall, usually co-locating its meetings with a related conference. Examples of TC6 conferences include IFIP Networking, DisCoTec, Middleware, WiOpt, CNSM, Integrated Network Management (IM) and Wireless Days (WD).

Membership of a TC6 WG or SIG is open to leading researchers within the field, independent of the national society within the country of origin. Well-known (past) TC6 members include: Vint Cerf, André Danthine, Donald Davies, Peter Kirstein, Robert (Bob) Metcalfe, Louis Pouzin, Otto Spaniol and Hubert Zimmermann. Each WG or SIG elects a chair and vice-chair for a period of three years. WG and SIG (vice-)chairs are, next to the national representatives and some key researchers, automatically members of TC6.

TC6 is a strong proponent of open access and the driving force behind the IFIP Open Digital Library (DL). The IFIP Open DL is currently operated by TC6 and eventually will move to the INRIA HAL system. To ensure maximum accessibility of accepted papers, several TC6 conferences publish their proceedings not only in the IFIP Open DL, but also in other online systems, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ResearchGate and arXiv.

TC6 supports conferences by providing Best Paper Awards (usually 500 Euro each) as well as Student Travel Grants (usually 750 Euro). Conference organisers who intend to obtain IFIP sponsorship are encouraged to fill-in the online Event Request Form (ERF). Depending on the category and type of event, IFIP may charge fees to conferences to cover the costs of (future) awards as well as the IFIP secretariat.

The working groups of IFIP TC6 are:
* WG 6.1 Architectures and Protocols for Distributed Systems
* WG 6.2 Network and Internetwork Architectures
* WG 6.3 Performance of Communication Systems
* WG 6.4 Internet Applications Engineering
* WG 6.6 Management of Networks and Distributed Systems
* WG 6.8 Mobile and Wireless Communications
* WG 6.9 Communications Systems in Developing Countries
* WG 6.10 Photonic Networking
* WG 6.11 Communication Aspects of the E-World
* WG 6.12 Service-Oriented Systems (Joint with WG 8.10/WG2.14)
In November 2015, a new Special Interest Group on "Internet of People" (IoP) was created.

=== IFIP TC7 System Modeling and Optimization ===
IFIP TC7 was founded in 1972 by  A.V. Balakrishnan,  [[Jacques-Louis Lions|J.L. Lions]] and M. Marchuk.
The aims of this Technical Committee are

=== IFIP TC9 ICT and Society ===

IFIP TC9 on ICT and Society was formed in 1976 to develop greater understanding of how ICT innovation is associated with changes in society and to influence the shaping of socially responsible and ethical policies and professional practices. The main work of the TC9 is conducted through its working groups, which organise regular conferences and events, including the Human Choice and Computers (HCC) conference series.

'''Jean Dabry''' (8 December 1901, [[Avignon]]{{snd}}5 July 1990, [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise|Montmorency]]) was a [[France|French]] [[aviator]] of the [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], then an airline pilot for [[Air France]]. He is buried in the Montmorency cemetery.

== Biography ==
Dabry gained his first officer-rank when he joined the Aéropostale in 1928 as [[navigator]]. Two years later on the 12th April 1930 with [[Jean Mermoz]] as pilot and Léopold Gimié as radio-operator they made a closed circuit length record by [[floatplane]]. The aircraft, a [[Latécoère 28]] fitted with an 600&amp;nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]] engine flew 4 345 [[km]] for 30h25.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k576856t.image.langFR.r=mermoz Le Matin]'', Paris, 13 April 1930, quotidien {{ISSN|1256-0359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 and 13 May 1930 the same crew performed the first crossing of the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]&lt;ref&gt;Carte du trajet suivi ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6266354.image Le Petit Parisien]'', Paris, 14 May 1930, quotidien {{ISSN|0999-2707}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[floatplane]] Laté 28 "Compte de la Vault" fitted with an [[Hispano-Suiza]] engine (600&amp;nbsp;hp). They flew between Saint Louis, Sénégal to Natal ([[Brazil]]). They delivered 130&amp;nbsp;kg of [[mail]] during this 3200&amp;nbsp;km journey.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k576886v/f3.image.r=mermoz.langFR Le Matin]'', Paris, 13 May 1930, quotidien {{ISSN|1256-0359}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the flight two records would be established namely, distance in a straight line for a [[seaplane]] and mail delivery time as they flew for 20 hours and 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5768877.image.langFR.r=mermoz Le Matin]'', Paris, 14 May 1930, quotidien {{ISSN|1256-0359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[captain]] at [[Air France]] in 1936. During his career he made more than 540 crossings of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]]. He became one of the executive directors of the company.  He had logged 16,000 hours of flight time when he left [[Air France]] in 1957.

A '''klismos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: κλισμός) or '''klismos chair''' is a type of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] chair, with curved backrest and tapering, outcurved legs.

==Ancient Greece==
Klismoi are familiar from depictions of [[Ancient Furniture|ancient furniture]] on painted pottery and in bas-reliefs from the mid-fifth century BCE onwards. In epic, ''klismos'' signifies an armchair, but no specific description is given of its form; in ''[[Iliad]]'' xxiv, after Priam's appeal, Achilles rises from his ''thronos'', raises the elder man to his feet, goes out to prepare Hector's body for decent funeral and returns, to take his place on his ''klismos''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed by R.M.Frazer, "The κλισμός of Achilles ''Iliad'' 24.596-98," ''GRBS'' '''12''' (1971:295-301); Frazer interprets the lines as not inconsistent; following ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', the Greek etiquette of hospitality, Achilles gives the ''thronos'' to Priam and takes the more modest ''klismos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vase-painting of a [[satyr]] carrying a klismos chair on his shoulder shows how light such chairs were.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gisela Richter|Gisela M.A. Richter]], ''Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans and Romans'' (New York:Phaidon Press) 1966; klismos chairs are illustrated figs. 169-97; 276, 510-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The curved, tapered legs of the klismos chair sweep forward and rearward, offering stability. The rear legs sweep continuously upward to support a wide concave backrest like a curved tablet, which supports the sitter's shoulders, or which may be low enough to lean an elbow on.

The klismos fell from general favour during the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic period]]; nevertheless, the theatre of Dionysus at the foot of the [[Acropolis]], Athens, of the first century CE, has carved representations of ''klismoi''.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Wanscher, ''The Art of Furniture'' (1966), 16; one illustrated in [[Margarete Bieber]], ''Die Denkmäler zum Theaterwesen im Altertum'' (1920), l, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a klismos is represented in Roman portraits of seated individuals, the sculptures are copies of Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;For example and the seated portrait sculptures in the Capitoline Museums of a female (Wanscher 66-67) and a male (Wanscher 68-69), probably both after 4th-century BCE originals.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the klismos might be due to a design flaw, the legs of the chair are bending outwards and without any further support the legs will spread out and break when sat upon.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Neoclassicism==
The klismos was revived during the second, archaeological phase of European [[neoclassicism]]. Klismos chairs were first widely seen in Paris in the furniture made for the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]] by [[Georges Jacob]] in 1788, to be used as props in David's historical paintings, where the new sense of [[historicism]] required visual authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;The new studio furniture appears in David's ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'', 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be hard to find a French klismos chair earlier than the ones designed by the architect [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]] in 1786 for a decor in the "Etruscan style" for the hôtel Montholon,&lt;ref&gt;Furnished for Mathieu de Montholon (1753–1788) ,''conseiller d'état'', the father of [[Charles Tristan, marquis de Montholon]].&lt;/ref&gt; boulevard Montmartre, and executed by Jacob; the furnishings have disappeared, but the watercolor designs are conserved in the Cabinet des Estampes.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Jarry and Pierre Devinoy, ''Le siège français'' (Fribourg: Office du Livre) 1973: 260 and fig. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Jervis has noted that [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] included the tablet of an approximation of a klismos chair in his ''Penelope Unraveling Her Web'', 1783–84 ([[J. Paul Getty Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jervis, reviewing ''Herculaneum paa Sjoelland'' [1988], in ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''133''' no. 1058 (May 1991:329); ;''[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=930 Getty Guide: ''Penelope Unraveling Her Web''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607104742/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=930 |date=2010-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


In London, early klismos chairs were designed by [[Thomas Hope (1769–1831)|Thomas Hope]] for his house in [[Duchess Street, London|Duchess Street]], London,&lt;ref&gt;One, purchased for the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], was illustrated in "Recent Acquisitions at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge: Supplement to ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''137''' No. 1102 (January 1995:59-64) fig. xix, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; which [[George Beaumont]] had described as early as 1804 as "more a ''Museum'' than anything else";&lt;ref&gt;David Watkin, introduction to ''Thomas Hope: Household Furniture and Interior Decoration'' (New York: Dover Reprints) 1971:xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; klismos chairs were illustrated by Hope in several variations in ''Household Furniture and Interior Decoration'' (1807), the record of his semi-public house-museum.&lt;ref&gt;A klismos chair also appears in his notebook of drawings, c. 1812, now at the [[RIBA]] (David Watkin and Jill Lever, "A Sketch-Book by Thomas Hope", ''Architectural History'' '''23''' (1980: 52-187) no. 42, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Klismos chairs in their purest form furnished Hope's Picture Gallery (pl. II) and the Second Room containing Greek Vases (pl. IV), but the swept legs featured in variations on the classical theme illustrated in other plates. Henry Moses' illustration of genteel company playing cards seated on klismos chairs appeared in Hope's ''Designs of Modern Costume'' (c. 1812).&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated in [[Margaret Jourdain]], ''Regency Furniture'', revised ed. 1965, p. 51, fig. 86. An English klismos chair of about 1807 illustrated by Jourdain (fig. 84) is painted "Etruscan" fashion, in terracotta red and black, in imitation of a painted Greek vase, a color scheme called "Etruscan", owing to misconceptions about Greek vases found in Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the presence of fashionable klismos chairs and a collection of Greek vases, a self-portrait of [[Adam Buck]] and his family, significantly, was formerly thought to represent Thomas Hope.&lt;ref&gt;The painting is reproduced as the dust cover of John Morley, ''Regency Design 1790–1840''(London: Zwemmer) 1993; reviewing the volume in ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''135''' No. 1085 (August 1993:568), Alex Kidson remarked of these iconic trappings representing high culture, "That the modest Buck could have been misidentified as a hugely rich connoisseur, patron and collector, is fascinating and a pointer to an enormous sociological change in the patterns of influence and patronage."&lt;/ref&gt;  Klismos chairs were designed for [[Packington Hall]], Warwickshire, by [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]].&lt;ref&gt;Klismos chairs in European neoclassicism are discussed in ''The Age of Neoclassicism'', exhibition catalog, 1972, under nos. 1592 (a klismos chair designed by the Danish architect [[Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard]], c. 1800-09 (Museum of Decorative Arts, Copenhagen) and 1644.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Philadelphia, the architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] designed a set of klismos chairs for an interior in the most advanced neoclassical taste for William Waln's drawing-room, c. 1808.&lt;ref&gt;One, conserved at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (acc.no. 1994.189) is illustrated by Peter Kenny, in "North America 1700–1900" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''52'''.2, "Recent Acquisitions: A Selection 1993–1994" (Autumn 1994), p 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe's design, painted cream and red on a black background, the "Etruscan" color range,&lt;ref&gt;"I have resolved to decorate his drawing-room frieze," Latrobe wrote his decorative painter, "with [[John Flaxman|Flaxman]]'s Iliad or Odyssey in flat Etruscan colors, giving only outline on a rich ground" (quoted by Kenny 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; included a panel of caning beneath the tablet backrest and legs that splayed outwards to the sides as well as the front. For the [[White House]], Latrobe's designs of 1809 for klismos chairs are cautiously reinforced with stretchers to render them more sturdy.&lt;ref&gt;The watercolor designs conserved by the Maryland Historical Society, are illustrated in Peter L. Fodera, Kenneth N. Needleman and John L. Vitagliano, "The Conservation of a Painted Baltimore Sidechair (ca. 1815) Attributed to John and Hugh Finlay", ''Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'' '''36'''.3 (Autumn - Winter 1997:183-192) fig. 1 p. 184; the painted chair under conservation (fig. 4), attributed to the Finlay workshop of Baltimore, combines klismos-type stiles and outswept rear legs and curved tablet backrest with sturdy turned and tapered front legs.&lt;/ref&gt; A range of early 19th-century American klismos chairs were included in the exhibition "Classical Taste in America, 1800–1840", Baltimore Museum of Art, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;One was illustrated in Nadia Tscherny's review in ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''135''' No. 1087 (October 1993: fig. 51, p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such severely academic revivals might be compromised by more familiar features of the chair-maker's usual practice: an early 19th-century klismos chair by J.E. Höglander, Stockholm&lt;ref&gt;Nordiska Museet, Stockholm; illustrated in Wanscher 1966:376-77.&lt;/ref&gt; has a padded backrest, supported on five slender colonettes,&lt;ref&gt;Colonnettes forming the rails of chairbacks had been a characteristic feature of [[Thomas Sheraton]]'s ''The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing-Book'' Part III 1793; plates 32-34, 36, all dated 1792, and the ''Appendix'' 1794; plates 25, 28, dated 1793, and 49, dated 1794. (Dover reprint, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and the faces of the legs are lightly paneled.

==20th century==
The classicizing phase of [[Modernism]] allied with [[Art Deco]] found the simple lines of the klismos once again in favor: klismos chairs designed by the Danish Edvard Thomspon were illustrated in ''Architekten'', 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in  Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', '''4''' (Spring, 1987:16-29) fig. 7 p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings]] met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, recreating ancient Greek furnishings with some accuracy, including klismos chairs.

The seat was built of four wooden turned staves, [[Mortise and tenon|morticed]] into the legs; a web of cording or leather strips supported a cushion or a pelt. The klismos was a specifically Greek invention, without detectable earlier inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;"This chair possesses a profound originality unusual in the history of furniture" (Ole Wanscher, ''The Art of Furniture:  5000 Years of Furniture and Interiors'', David Hohnen, tr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">The '''Knole settee''' (sometimes known as the '''Knole Sofa''') was made in the 17th century.  It is housed at Knole in Kent, a house owned by the Sackville-Wests since 1605 but now in the care of [[The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|the National Trust]].  It was originally used not as comfortable sofa but as a formal throne on which the monarch would have sat to receive visitors.  It features adjustable side arms and considerable depth of seating, it usually has exposed wooden finials at the rear corner tops, and some exposed wood may be present on the otherwise arms.  The arms, more correctly sides, are of the same height. The side arms are tied to the sofa back by means of heavy decorative braid, often with an elaborate tassel.

==In literature==
A number of references to the Knole sofa are found in literature; for example, Marlowe notes the usage in his book ''Memoirs of a Venus Lackey.''&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Venus Lackey'' By Derek Marlowe, Viking Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  In literature the Knole sofa is sometimes mentioned in the context of a room decorated with fine [[antique furniture]] 
such as in the [[novel]] ''In High Places'',&lt;ref&gt;''In High Places'', Arthur Hailey, Doubleday Publishing (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Knole sofa is positioned in a room with a fine [[Kerman]] antique [[carpet]].

The spelling of Knole sofa is as shown in this sentence and not Knoll, as the name comes from [[Knole House]], [[Sevenoaks, Kent]] UK, which is open to the public and run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-knole |title=Knole |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Trust |accessdate=9 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727121024/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-knole |archivedate=27 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On show is the original Knole Sofa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1231">A '''light-emitting transistor''' or '''LET''' is a form of [[transistor]] that emits light. Higher efficiency than [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) is possible.

==History==
Reported in the January 5, 2004 issue of the journal [[Applied Physics Letters]], [[Milton Feng]] and [[Nick Holonyak]], the inventor of the first practical light-emitting diode (LED) and the first [[semiconductor laser]] to operate in the [[visible spectrum]], made the world's first light-emitting transistor. This hybrid device, fabricated by Feng's graduate student Walid Hafez, had one electrical input and two outputs (electrical output and optical output) and operated at a [[frequency]] of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. The device was made of [[indium gallium phosphide]], [[indium gallium arsenide]], and [[gallium arsenide]], and emitted [[infrared]] [[photon]]s from the base layer.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/first-lightemitting-transistor First Light-Emitting Transistor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/207740 New light-emitting transistor could revolutionize electronics industry&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine electronics devices include [[chartplotter]], [[marine VHF radio]], [[autopilot]] and [[self-steering gear]], [[fishfinder]] and [[sonar]], [[marine radar]], [[GPS]], [[fibre optic gyrocompass]], [[satellite television]], and [[marine fuel management]].

The electronics devices communicate by using a protocol defined by [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] with two standards available, [[NMEA 0183]] ([[serial communication]] network) and [[NMEA 2000]] ([[controller-area network]] based technology). There is also [[IEC 61162|Lightweight Ethernet (LWE)]].

In recent years, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]] has created a new standards suite for "Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship". This is known as [[IEC 61162]] and included NMEA 0183, NMEA 2000 and LWE.

Additionally, different suppliers of marine electronics have their own [[communications protocol]].

*A+T Instruments has ESP Ethernet over Ships Power
*[[B&amp;G]] has FastNet
*[[Furuno]] has NavNet   ("NavNet" refers to a product family, and is not a communications protocol.  Furuno uses industry standard NMEA 0193, NMEA 2000, and standard Ethernet for communications protocol in their products)
*  Nexus has [[Fast_Data_eXchange|FDX]]
*[[Raymarine Marine Electronics|Raymarine]] has [[Seatalk]]
*[[Simrad Yachting|Simrad]] has SimNet
*[[Stowe Marine|Stowe]] has Dataline

==Navigation==
Another important part of marine electronics is the navigation equipment. Here compasses, which includes both gyro compasses and magnetic compasses make up for equipment that is used by the entire shipping industry. 

==Industry==
Some manufacturers specialize more in equipment for commercial vessels such as tankers and general cargo vessels.
This industry is relatively small with worldwide sales of $3.2&amp;nbsp;billion in 2015. The top manufacturer was Japan-based [[Furuno]] with estimated sales of $325&amp;nbsp;million followed closely by Norway-based [[Navico]], a holding company for several current and former industry brands ([[Simrad Yachting]], [[Lowrance Electronics]], [[B&amp;G]], Magellan, Northstar), with revenue of $308&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="mec"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marine bridge system industry valued at US$3.2&amp;nbsp;billion|url=http://www.marinemec.com/news/view,marine-bridge-system-industry-valued-at-us32-billion_43307.htm|work=Marine Electronics &amp; Communications|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounding out the top five are [[Japan Radio Company ]] in third, [[Garmin]] (popular with recreational users) in fourth, and Sam Electronics (a subsidiary of [[Wärtsilä]]).&lt;ref name="mec"/&gt; The next five top manufacturers are [[Transas]], [[Raymarine Marine Electronics]] (a subsidiary of [[FLIR Systems]], Raytheon Anschütz, Sperry Marine, and Tokyo Keiki.&lt;ref name="mec"/&gt;

Other companies outside of the industry's top ten that have a significant presence chartplotters include [[Samyung ENC]], Hummingbird ([[Johnson Outdoors]]), Murphy (Enovation Controls), Naviop, SI-TEX Marine Electronics, and TwoNav.&lt;ref name="newcharts"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Nautical Charts released|url=http://www.navionics.com/en/news/new-nautical-charts-released|work=Navionics|date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''Nelson rules''' are a method in [[process control]] of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules,  for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first postulated by [[Walter A. Shewhart]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc32.htm Engineering Statistics Handbook 6.3.2], NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s.  The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the ''[[Journal of Quality Technology]]'' in an article by [[Lloyd S Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd S. Nelson, "The Shewhart Control Chart—Tests for Special Causes". Journal of Quality Technology 16, no. 4 (October 1984), 238-239. https://doi.org/10.1080/00224065.1984.11978921&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules are applied to a [[control chart]] on which the magnitude of some [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] is plotted against time. The rules are based on the [[mean]] value and the [[standard deviation]] of the samples.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
! Rule|| Description|| Chart Example|| Problem Indicated
|-
|width="75pt"| &lt;center&gt;Rule 1&lt;/center&gt;||width="250pt"| One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.|| [[File:Rule 1 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]||width="250pt"| One sample (two shown in this case) is grossly out of control.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 2&lt;/center&gt; || Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean. || [[File:Rule 2 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| Some prolonged [[systematic bias|bias]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 3&lt;/center&gt; || Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing). ||[[File:Rule 3 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| A [[trend estimation|trend]] exists.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 4&lt;/center&gt; || Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing. ||[[File:Rule 4 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px|]]|| This much [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] is beyond [[Signal noise|noise]].

Note that the rule is concerned with directionality only. The position of the mean and the size of the standard deviation have no bearing.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 5&lt;/center&gt; || Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction.  ||[[File:Rule 5 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control.

The side of the mean for the third point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 6&lt;/center&gt; || Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction. ||[[File:Rule 6 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| There is a strong tendency for samples to be slightly out of control.

The side of the mean for the fifth point is unspecified.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 7&lt;/center&gt; || Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean. ||[[File:Rule 7 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px]]|| With 1 standard deviation, greater variation would be expected.

|-
| &lt;center&gt;Rule 8&lt;/center&gt; || Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.  ||[[File:Rule 8 - Control Charts for Nelson Rules.svg|256x192px |]]|| Jumping from above to below whilst missing the first standard deviation band is rarely random.
|}

The above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value.

A second chart, the moving [[Range (statistics)|range]] chart, can also be used but only with rules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value of '''N''' adjacent points against the time sample of the range.

An example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then the sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4) (2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2) (5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.

Applying these rules indicates when a potential "out of control" situation has arisen. However, there will always be some false alerts and the more rules applied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit one or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some specific "out of control" situation is not detected. Empirically, the detection [[accuracy]] is good.

An '''orienteering map''' is a [[map]] specially prepared for use in [[orienteering]] competitions. It is a [[topographic map]] with extra details to help the competitor [[navigation|navigate]] through the competition area.

These maps are much more detailed than general-purpose topographic maps, and incorporate a standard symbology that is designed to be useful to anyone, regardless of native language. In addition to indicating the [[topography]] of the terrain with contour lines, orienteering maps also show forest density, water features, clearings, trails and roads, earthen banks and rock walls, ditches, wells and pits, fences and power lines, buildings, boulders, and other features of the terrain. Orienteering maps are 1:15&amp;nbsp;000 or 1:10&amp;nbsp;000 [[Scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref name="iof"&gt;Zentai, László, ed. (2000). ''[http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/specs/isom-2000.pdf International Drawing Specifications for Orienteering Maps (ISOM2000)]''. International Orienteering Federation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Orienteering Federation]] (IOF) publishes the standard for orienteering maps, including:
* ISOM (International Specification for Orienteering Maps), used for [[FootO]] forest maps.
* ISSOM (International Specification for Sprint Orienteering Maps), used for [[FootO]] sprint and [[TrailO]] maps.
* ISSkiOM (International Specification for Ski Orienteering Maps), used for [[SkiO]] maps.
* ISMTBOM (International Specification for Mountain Bike Orienteering Maps), used for [[Mountain bike orienteering|MTBO]] maps.

Beacon control points are shown for post-competition analysis; ARDF competitors must find the beacons.]]

==Purpose==
An orienteering map, and a [[compass]], are the primary aids for the competitor to complete an [[course (orienteering)|orienteering course]] of [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]] as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=isom-2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000.pdf

|accessdate=2011-12-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A map that is [[Accuracy and precision|reliable and accurate]] is essential so that a course can be provided which will test the navigational skills of the competitor. The map also needs to be relevant to the needs of the competitor showing the terrain in neither too much nor too little detail.

Because the competition must test the navigational skills of the competitor, areas are sought which have a terrain that is rich in usable features.  In addition, the area should be attractive and interesting.  Notable examples in the US include [[Pawtuckaway State Park]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Valles Caldera]], [[New Mexico]], both having many boulders and boulder fields, and a wide variety of other terrain types.

Orienteering maps are produced by local orienteering clubs and are a valuable resource for the club. Orienteering maps are expensive to produce and the principal costs are: the fieldwork, drawing (cartography), and printing. Each of these can use up valuable resources of a club, be it in manpower or financial costs. Established clubs with good resources e.g. maps and manpower are usually able to host more events.

==History==
[[File:Orienteering map.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Orienteering map]]
In the early days of orienteering, competitors used whatever maps were available; these were typically topographic maps from the national mapping agency. While national mapping agencies update their topographic maps on a regular basis, they are usually not sufficiently up to date for orienteering purposes. Gradually, specially drawn maps have been provided to meet the specific requirements of orienteering.

Maps produced specifically for orienteering show a more detailed and up-to-date description of terrain features. For example, large rocks above the soil surface do not normally appear on topographic maps but can be important features on many orienteering maps.  New features such as fence lines can be important navigational aids and may also affect route choice. Orienteering maps include these new features.

[[Cartographer]] [[Jan Martin Larsen]] was a pioneer in the development of the specialized orienteering map.

==Map content==
The [[map scale]] depends on the purpose of the competition and also the standard used, for example, a map used in a foot orienteering long distance event has scale of 1:15000. The map is printed in six base colours,&lt;ref&gt;[http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ISOM2017_20May2017.pdf ISOM 2017, page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; which cover the main groups: Land forms, rock and boulders, water and [[marsh]], vegetation, and man-made features, and an extra colour for overprinting symbols.
[[File:Land forms orienteering map.svg|thumb|right|200px| Example of different land forms]]

===Brown: Land forms===
Land forms are shown using [[contour line]]s. The contour interval is normally 5 metres, but other interval such as 2 or 2.5 metres may be used in sprint maps. Additional symbols are provided to show e.g. earth bank, [[hill|knoll]], [[Depression (geology)|depression]], small depression, pit, broken ground etc.

===Black: Rock features===
This group covers [[cliff]]s, [[boulder]]s, boulder fields, and boulder clusters etc.

===Blue: Water features===
This group covers lakes, ponds, rivers, water channels, marshes, and wells etc.
[[File:Example distinct vegetation boundary orienteering.png|thumb|right|200px| Vegetation: ''White'' colour is forest, ''yellow'' is open area, and ''green'' indicates reduced runability.]]

===Green/Yellow: Vegetation===&lt;!-- changed to isom wording --&gt;
This group covers vegetation. ''White'' is typically open runnable forest. ''Green'' means a forest of low visibility with reduced running speed, being graded from slow running, through difficult running, to impassable. ''Yellow'' colour shows open areas. Green vertical stripes are used to indicate [[undergrowth]] (slow or difficult running) but otherwise with good visibility.

===Black: Man-made features===
Man-made features include roads, tracks, paths, power lines, stone walls, fences, buildings, etc.

===Technical symbols===
Two technical symbols are required on all maps: [[Magnetic north]] lines printed in blue, and register crosses (these show that the printed colours are coincident).&lt;ref name=isom-2000/&gt;

===Other map information===
&lt;!-- {{Trivia|date=November 2010}} removed 7/1/2009. This section describes the content of a map, principally the symbols that are used to describe the features on the ground. In addition there are other pieces of information e.g. date of publication which need to be on the map but don’t fit into any of those categories. Other information is a proper usage for this article. --&gt;
Other information is required to be on the printed map although the presentation is not specified, e.g. scale, contour interval and scale bar. Good practice requires information such as date of survey, survey scale, copyright information, and proper credit for the people who produced the map (surveyor, cartographer).

[[File:Percorso di orientamento (ita).png|thumb|right|200px|Course]]

===Purple or Red: Overprinting symbols===
Symbols are specified so that a course can be overprinted on the map. It includes symbols for the start, [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]], control numbers, lines between control points, and finish. Extra symbols are available so that information relating to that event may be shown e.g. crossing points, forbidden route, first aid post, and refreshment point etc. These are not permanent features and cannot be included when the map is printed.

===Related activities===
The International Specification for Orienteering Maps&lt;ref name=isom-2000/&gt; sets out the specifications for orienteering maps for use in foot orienteering, together with specifications for the other sports governed by the [[International Orienteering Federation]] (IOF) i.e. mountain bike orienteering, ski orienteering, and trail orienteering. The specifications are mostly the same but with a few sport specific symbols e.g. ski-o needs to distinguish snow-covered roads from cleared roads.

==Mapping process==
The [[cartography|mapping process]] has four main stages: Creation of the base map, [[field work|field-work]], drawing, and printing.

===Base map===
The base map can be a [[topographic map]] made for other purposes e.g. mapping from the National Mapping Agency, or a [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] plot produced from an [[aerial survey]].&lt;!-- Photogrammetry is related to, but different from [[orthophoto]]graphy--&gt;

As [[LIDAR]]-surveying advances, base maps consisting of 1 meter contours and other data derived from the LIDAR data get more common. As these base maps contain large amounts of information the [[cartographic generalization]] becomes important in creating a readable map.&lt;ref name="ICO"&gt;Turka, Janeta (2010). ''[http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/14icom/05-laserscanning_lv.pdf Using Laserscanning in Latvia ]''. 14th International Conference on Orienteering Mapping.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic north===
Cartographers use a [[Map projection|projection]] to project the curved surface of the earth onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7&amp;nbsp;km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of grid north, and magnetic north is about 7° west of grid north. Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about {{frac|1|2}}° in four years.&lt;ref name=magnorth&gt;[United Kingdom] Ordnance Survey, 1:50&amp;nbsp;000 Landranger Series, sheet 144, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map.

===Field-work===
Field-work is carried out using a small part of the base map fixed to a survey board, covered with a piece of draughting film, and drawn with pencils. The final map needs to be drawn with sufficient accuracy so that a feature shown on the map can be identified clearly on the ground by the competitor, thus, field-workers need to locate features with a high level of accuracy, to ensure consistency between map and terrain. Where the map and terrain are inconsistent, the feature becomes unusable: no [[Control point (orienteering)|control point]] can be placed there. Periodic corrections to the map may be necessary, typically vegetation changes in forested areas.

===Drawing (cartography)===

====Corrected topographic maps====
The earliest orienteering maps used existing topographic maps e.g. United Kingdom Ordnance Survey 1:25&amp;nbsp;000 plans. These were cut down to a suitable size, corrected by hand, and then copied.

====Hand-drawn orienteering maps====

=====Hand-drawn maps=====
These were initially drawn by hand on [[tracing paper]] using one sheet for each of the five colours; the various dot or line screens being added using [[dry transfer]] [[Screentone|screens]], for example Letratone manufactured by [[Letraset]] in the UK. The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools. [[Draughting film]] has replaced tracing paper. This is a [[plastic]] waterproof material etched on one side so that the ink will hold.

=====Scribed maps=====
This is the standard process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process makes it easy to produce high quality maps, but it does require a number of specialist tools.

====Computer aided maps (digital cartography)====
Computer software is available to aid in the drawing of digital maps. OCAD is the leading provider. Another one is opensource  OpenOrienteering Mapper application, created by community as free alternative to OCAD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/15icom/06-ts.pdf OpenOrienteering Mapper ICOM Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other computer software is available that will link with OCAD, or with the [[Digital data|digital]] map files, so that courses can be incorporated into the map ready for printing.

===Printing===
Colour maps were sent to commercial printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]]). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs are now in a position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using [[paper size|standard stock sizes of paper]] e.g. [[A4 paper size|A4]] or [[Letter (paper size)|Letter]]. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the [[Paper density|weight]] and the coating affect the usability of the final map.

==Map accuracy and map quality==
'''Map accuracy''' refers to the work of the surveyor (field-worker) and relates not so much to the positional accuracy of the survey but rather to its utility for the competitor. '''Map quality''' refers to the quality of the artwork. Many national bodies{{who|date=October 2017}} have a competition in which awards are made to cartographers after assessment by a national panel.

[[File:Admiralty office Whitehall 1760 D Cunego.jpg|thumb|Room 40 was on the first floor in the northern wing of the [[Admiralty#The Admiralty|The Admiralty's Ripley Building]] ({{small|built 1726}}) in [[Whitehall]]. It was on the same corridor as the office of the [[First Sea Lord]].]]
'''Room 40''', also known as '''40 O.B.''' (Old Building) (latterly '''NID25'''), was the [[cryptanalysis]] section of the British [[Admiralty]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].

The group, which was formed in October 1914, began when [[Henry Oliver|Admiral Oliver]], the Director of [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence]], gave intercepts from the German radio station at [[Nauen]], near [[Berlin]], to Director of Naval Education [[James Alfred Ewing|Alfred Ewing]], who constructed ciphers as a hobby. Ewing recruited civilians such as [[William Montgomery (cryptographer)|William Montgomery]], a translator of theological works from German, and [[Nigel de Grey]], a publisher. It was estimated that during the war Room 40 decrypted around 15,000 intercepted German communications from [[wireless]] and [[telegraph]] traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Electronic Warfare and Signals Intelligence at the Outset of World War I | url= http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/electronic_warfare.pdf | author= Lieutenant Commander James T. Westwood, USN | publisher= NSA | accessdate= 2009-05-04 | quote= After the war, it was estimated that Room 40 had solved some 15,000 German naval and diplomatic communications, a very great number considering that recoveries were hand-generated. | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/68sQIBZPK?url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/electronic_warfare.pdf | archivedate= 3 July 2012 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably the section intercepted and decoded the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], a secret diplomatic communication issued from the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Office]] in January 1917 that proposed a military alliance between [[German Empire|Germany]] and Mexico. Its decoding has been described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I&lt;ref name="BBCHistory2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=The telegram that brought America into the First World War|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC History Magazine|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it played a significant role in drawing the then-Neutral United States into the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= Andrew |last= Andrew |first= Christopher |title= For The President's Eyes Only |year= 1996 |publisher= Harper Collins |isbn= 0-00-638071-9 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Room 40 operations evolved from a captured German naval codebook, the {{lang|de|Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine}} (SKM), and maps (containing coded squares) that Britain's Russian allies had passed on to the Admiralty. The Russians had seized this material from the German cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] after it ran aground off the [[Estonia]]n coast on 26 August 1914. The Russians recovered three of the four copies that the warship had carried; they retained two and passed the other to the British.{{sfn| Massie|2004|pp=314–317}} In October 1914 the British also obtained the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s {{lang|de|Handelsschiffsverkehrsbuch}} (HVB), a codebook used by German naval warships, merchantmen, naval [[zeppelin]]s and [[U-Boat]]s: the [[Royal Australian Navy]] seized a copy from the Australian-German steamer ''Hobart'' on 11 October. On 30 November a British trawler recovered a safe from the sunken German destroyer ''S-119'', in which was found the {{lang|de|Verkehrsbuch}} (VB), the code used by the Germans to communicate with naval attachés, embassies and warships overseas.{{sfn|Massie|2004|pp=314–317}} In March 1915 a British detachment impounded the luggage of [[Wilhelm Wassmuss]], a German agent in Persia and shipped it, unopened, to London, where the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral [[William Reginald Hall|Sir William Reginald Hall]] discovered that it contained the German Diplomatic Code Book, Code No. 13040.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hayat-dawudi iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| Tuchman|1958|pp=20-21}}

The section retained "Room 40" as its informal name even though it expanded during the war and moved into other offices. Alfred Ewing directed Room 40 until May 1917, when direct control passed to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] (later [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]]) [[William Reginald Hall|Reginald 'Blinker' Hall]], assisted by [[William Milbourne James]].{{sfn|Johnson|1997|pp=32}} Although Room 40 successfully decrypted Imperial German communications throughout the First World War, its function was compromised by the Admiralty's insistence that all decoded information would only be analysed by Naval specialists. This meant that, while Room 40 operators could decrypt the encoded messages, they were not permitted to understand or interpret the information themselves.{{sfn|Massie|2004|p=580}}

==Background==
In 1911, a sub-committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] on cable communications concluded that in the event of war with Germany, German-owned submarine cables should be destroyed. In the early hours of 5 August 1914, the cable ship ''Alert'' located and cut Germany's five trans-Atlantic cables, which ran down the [[English Channel]]. Soon after, the six cables running between Britain and Germany were cut.{{sfn|Winkler|2009|pp=848–849}} As an immediate consequence, there was a significant increase in cable messages sent via cables belonging to other countries, and cables sent by wireless. These could now be intercepted, but codes and ciphers were naturally used to hide the meaning of the messages, and neither Britain nor Germany had any established organisations to decode and interpret the messages. At the start of the war, the navy had only one wireless station for intercepting messages, at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]]. However, installations belonging to the Post Office and the [[Marconi Company]], as well as private individuals who had access to radio equipment, began recording messages from Germany.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=2, 8–9}}

Intercepted messages began to arrive at the Admiralty intelligence division, but no one knew what to do with them. Rear-Admiral [[Henry Oliver]] had been appointed Director of the Intelligence division in 1913. In August, 1914, his department was fully occupied with the war and no-one had experience of code breaking. Instead he turned to a friend, [[James Alfred Ewing|Sir Alfred Ewing]], the Director of Naval Education (DNE), who previously had been a professor of engineering with a knowledge of radio communications and who he knew had an interest in ciphers. It was not felt that education would be a priority during the expected few months duration of the war, so Ewing was asked to set up a group for decoding messages. Ewing initially turned to staff of the naval colleges [[Osborne Naval College|Osborne]] and [[Dartmouth Naval College|Dartmouth]], who were currently available, due both to the school holidays and to naval students having been sent on active duty. [[Alastair Denniston]] had been teaching German but later became second in charge of Room 40, then becoming Chief of its successor after the First World War, the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (located at [[Bletchley Park]] during the Second World War).{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=11–12}} 

Others from the schools worked temporarily for Room 40 until the start of the new term at the end of September. These included Charles Godfrey, the Headmaster of Osborne (whose brother became head of naval Intelligence during the Second World War), two Naval instructors, Parish and Curtiss, and scientist and mathematician Professor Henderson from [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Greenwich Naval College]]. Volunteers had to work at code breaking alongside their normal duties, the whole organisation operating from Ewing's ordinary office where code breakers had to hide in his secretary's room whenever there were visitors concerning the ordinary duties of the DNE. Two other early recruits were R. D. Norton, who had worked for the Foreign Office, and [[Richard Herschell, 2nd Baron Herschell|Richard Herschell]], who was a linguist, an expert on Persia and an Oxford graduate. None of the recruits knew anything about code breaking but were chosen for knowledge of German and certainty they could keep the matter secret.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Andrew|1986|p=87}}

==Prelude==
A similar organisation had begun in the Military Intelligence department of the [[War Office]], which become known as [[MI1b]], and Colonel Macdonagh proposed that the two organisations should work together. Little success was achieved except to organise a system for collecting and filing messages until the French obtained copies of German military ciphers. The two organisations operated in parallel, decoding messages concerning the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. A friend of Ewing's, a barrister by the name of Russell Clarke, plus a friend of his, Colonel Hippisley, approached Ewing to explain that they had been intercepting German messages. Ewing arranged for them to operate from the coastguard station at [[Hunstanton]] in Norfolk, where they were joined by another volunteer, [[Leslie Lambert]] (later becoming known as a BBC broadcaster under the name A. J. Alan). Hunstanton and Stockton formed the core of the interception service (known as [[Y Service|'Y' service]]), together with the Post Office and Marconi stations, which grew rapidly to the point it could intercept almost all official German messages. At the end of September, the volunteer schoolmasters returned to other duties, except for Denniston; but without a means to decode German naval messages there was little specifically naval work to do.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=12–14}}

===Capture of the SKM codebook===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-B2501, Kleiner Kreuzer Magdeburg.jpg|thumb|[[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] aground off Odensholm]]
The first breakthrough for Room 40 came with the capture of the {{lang|de|Signalbuch der Kaiserlichen Marine}} (SKM) from the German light cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']]. Two light cruisers, ''Magdeburg'' and [[SMS Augsburg|SMS ''Augsburg'']], and a group of destroyers all commanded by Rear-Admiral Behring were carrying out a reconnaissance of the Gulf of Finland, when the ships became separated in fog. ''Magdeburg'' ran aground on the island of [[Odensholm]] off the coast of Russian-controlled [[Estonia]]. The ship could not be re-floated so the crew was to be taken on board by the destroyer [[SMS V26|SMS ''V26'']]. The commander, {{lang|de|Korvettenkapitän}} Habenicht prepared to blow up the ship after it had been evacuated but the fog began to clear and two Russian cruisers [[Russian cruiser Pallada (1906)|''Pallada'']] and [[Russian cruiser Bogatyr|''Bogatyr'']] approached and opened fire. The demolition charges were set off prematurely, causing injuries amongst the crew still on board and before secret papers could be transferred to the destroyer or disposed of. Habenicht and fifty seven of his crew were captured by the Russians.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=4–5}}

Exactly what happened to the papers is not clear. The ship carried more than one copy of the SKM codebook and copy number 151 was passed to the British. The German account is that most of the secret papers were thrown overboard, but the British copy was undamaged and was reportedly found in the charthouse. The current key was also needed in order to use the codebook. A gridded chart of the Baltic, the ship's log and war diaries were all also recovered. Copies numbered 145 and 974 of the SKM were retained by the Russians while {{HMS|Theseus|1892|6}} was dispatched from [[Scapa Flow]] to Alexandrovosk in order to collect the copy offered to the British. Although she arrived on 7 September, due to mix-ups she did not depart until 30 September and returned to Scapa with Captain Kredoff, Commander Smirnoff and the documents on 10 October. The books were formally handed over to the First Lord, Winston Churchill, on 13 October.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=5–6}}

The SKM by itself was incomplete as a means of decoding messages, since they were normally enciphered as well as coded and those that could be understood were mostly weather reports. Fleet paymaster C. J. E. Rotter, a German expert from the naval intelligence division, was tasked with using the SKM codebook to interpret intercepted messages, most of which decoded as nonsense since initially it was not appreciated that they were also enciphered. An entry into solving the problem was found from a series of messages transmitted from the German Norddeich transmitter, which were all numbered sequentially and then re-enciphered. The cipher was broken, in fact broken twice as it was changed a few days after it was first solved, and a general procedure for interpreting the messages determined.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=14–15}} Enciphering was by a simple table, [[Substitution cipher|substituting one letter with another]] throughout all the messages. Rotter started work in mid October but was kept apart from the other code breakers until November, after he had broken the cipher.{{sfn|Andrew|1986|p=90}}

The intercepted messages were found to be intelligence reports on the whereabouts of allied ships. This was interesting but not vital. Russel Clarke now observed that similar coded messages were being transmitted on [[Shortwave radio|short-wave]], but were not being intercepted because of shortages of receiving equipment, in particular the aerial. Hunstanton was directed to stop listening to the military signals it had been intercepting and instead monitor short-wave for a test period of one weekend. The result was information about the movements of the High Seas Fleet and valuable naval intelligence. Hunstanton was permanently switched to the naval signals and as a result stopped receiving messages valuable to the military. Navy men who had been helping the military were withdrawn to work on the naval messages, without explanation, because the new code was kept entirely secret. The result was a bad feeling between the naval and military interception services and a cessation of cooperation between them, which continued into 1917.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|p=15}}

The SKM (sometimes abbreviated SB in German documents) was the code normally used during important actions by the German fleet. It was derived from the ordinary fleet signal books used by both British and German navies, which had thousands of predetermined instructions which could be represented by simple combinations of signal flags or lamp flashes for transmission between ships. The SKM had 34,300 instructions, each represented by a different group of three letters. A number of these reflected old-fashioned naval operations, and did not mention modern inventions such as aircraft. The signals used four symbols not present in ordinary Morse code (given the names alpha, beta, gamma and rho), which caused some confusion until all those involved in interception learnt to recognise them and use a standardised way to write them.{{sfn|Denniston|2007|p=32}} Ships were identified by a three-letter group beginning with a beta symbol. Messages not covered by the predetermined list could be spelled out using a substitution table for individual letters.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=22–23}}

The sheer size of the book was one reason it could not easily be changed, and the code continued in use until summer 1916. Even then, ships at first refused to use the new codebook because the replacement was too complicated, so the {{lang|de|Flottenfunkspruchbuch}} (FFB) did not fully replace the SKB until May 1917. Doubts about the security of the SKB were initially raised by Behring, who reported that it was not definitely known whether ''Magdeburg's'' code books had been destroyed or not, and it was suggested at the court martial enquiry into the loss that books might anyway have been recovered by Russians from the clear shallow waters where the ship had grounded. [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]], commander in chief of Baltic operations, wrote to the C-in-C of the High Seas Fleet, that in his view it was a certainty that secret charts had fallen into the hands of the Russians, and a probability that the codebook and key had also. The German navy relied upon the re-enciphering process to ensure security, but the key used for this was not changed until 20 October and then not changed again for another three months. The actual substitution table used for enciphering was produced by a mechanical device with slides and compartments for the letters. Orders to change the key were sent out by wireless, and frequently confusion during the changeover period led to messages being sent out using the new cipher and then being repeated with the old. Key changes continued to occur infrequently, only 6 times during 1915 from March to the end of the year, but then more frequently from 1916.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=23–26}}

There was no immediate capture of the FFB codebook to help the Admiralty understand it, but instead a careful study was made of new and old messages, particularly from the Baltic, which allowed a new book to be reconstructed. Now that the system was understood, Room 40 reckoned to crack a new key within three to four days, and to have reproduced the majority of a new codebook within two months. A German intelligence report on the matter was prepared in 1934 by {{lang|de|Korvettenkapitän}} Kleikamp which concluded that the loss of ''Magdeburg's'' codebook had been disastrous, not least because no steps were taken after the loss to introduce new secure codes.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|p=25}}

===Capture of the HVB codebook===
The second important code used by the German navy was captured at the very start of the war in Australia, although it did not reach the Admiralty until the end of October. The German-Australian steamer ''Hobart'' was seized off [[Port Phillip]] Heads near Melbourne on 11 August 1914. ''Hobart'' had not received news that war had broken out, and Captain J. T. Richardson and party claimed to be a quarantine inspection team. ''Hobart's'' crew were allowed to go about the ship but the captain was closely observed, until in the middle of the night he attempted to dispose of hidden papers. The {{lang|de|Handelsverkehrsbuch}} (HVB) codebook which was captured contained the code used by the German navy to communicate with its merchant ships and also within the High Seas Fleet. News of the capture was not passed to London until 9 September. A copy of the book was made and sent by the fastest available steamer, arriving at the end of October.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=3–4}}

The HVB was originally issued in 1913 to all warships with wireless, to naval commands and coastal stations. It was also given to the head offices of eighteen German steamship companies to issue to their own ships with wireless. The code used 450,000 possible four-letter groups which allowed alternative representations of the same meaning, plus an alternate ten-letter grouping for use in cables. Re-ciphering was again used but for general purposes was more straightforward, although changed more frequently. The code was used particularly by light forces such as patrol boats, and for routine matters such as leaving and entering harbour. The code was used by U-boats, but with a more complex key. However, the complications of their being at sea for long periods meant that codes changed while they were away and often messages had to be repeated using the old key, giving immediate information about the new one. German intelligence were aware in November 1914 that the HVB code had fallen into enemy hands, as evidenced by wireless messages sent out warning that the code was compromised, but it was not replaced until 1916.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|p=26}}

The HVB was replaced in 1916 by the {{lang|de|Allgemeinefunkspruchbuch}} (AFB) together with a new method of keying. The British obtained a good understanding of the new keying from test signals, before it was introduced for real messages. The new code was issued to even more organisations than the previous one, including those in Turkey, Bulgaria and Russia. It had more groups than its predecessor but now of only two letters. The first copy to be captured came from a shot-down Zeppelin but others were recovered from sunk U-boats.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=26–27}}

===Capture of the VB codebook===
A third codebook was recovered following the sinking of German destroyer [[SMS S119|SMS ''S119'']] in the [[Battle off Texel]]. In the middle of October 1914, the [[Battle of the Yser]] was fought for control of the coastal towns of Dixmude and Dunkirk. The British navy took part by bombarding German positions from the sea and German destroyers were ordered to attack the British ships. On 17 October Captain [[Cecil H. Fox|Cecil Fox]] commanding the light cruiser [[HMS Undaunted (1914)|''Undaunted'']] together with four destroyers, {{HMS|Lance|1914|6}}, [[HMS Lennox (1914)|''Lennox'']], [[HMS Legion (1914)|''Legion'']] and [[HMS Loyal (1913)|''Loyal'']], was ordered to intercept an anticipated German attack and met four German destroyers ([[SMS S115|''S115'']], [[SMS S117|''S117'']], [[SMS S118|''S118'']], and ''S119'') heading south from Texel with instructions to lay mines. The German ships were outclassed and all were sunk after a brief battle, whereupon the commander of ''S119'' threw overboard all secret papers in a lead-lined chest. The matter was dismissed by both sides, believing the papers had been destroyed along with the ships. However, on 30 November a British trawler dragged up the chest which was passed to Room 40 (Hall later claimed the vessel had been searching deliberately). It contained a copy of the {{lang|de|Verkehrsbuch}} (VB) codebook, normally used by flag officers of the German Navy. Thereafter the event was referred to by Room 40 as "the miraculous draft of fishes".{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=6–7}}

The code consisted of 100,000 groups of 5-digit numbers, each with a particular meaning. It had been intended for use in cables sent overseas to warships and naval attachés, embassies and consulates. It was used by senior naval officers with an alternative ''Lambda'' key, none of which failed to explain its presence on a small destroyer at the start of the war. Its greatest importance during the war was that it allowed access to communications between naval attachés in Berlin, Madrid, Washington, Buenos Aires, Peking, and Constantinople.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=27, 28}}

In 1917 naval officers switched to a new code with a new key ''Nordo'' for which only 70 messages were intercepted, but the code was also broken. For other purposes VB continued in use throughout the war. Re-ciphering of the code was accomplished using a key made up of a codeword transmitted as part of the message and its date written in German. These were written down in order and then the letters in this key were each numbered according to their order of appearance in the alphabet. This now produced a set of numbered columns in an apparently random order. The coded message would be written out below these boxes starting top left and continuing down the page once a row was filled. The final message was produced by taking the column numbered '1' and reading off its contents downward, then adding on the second column's digits, and so on. In 1918 the key was changed by using the keywords in a different order. This new cipher was broken within a few days by Professor [[Walter Horace Bruford]], who had started working for Room 40 in 1917 and specialised in VB messages. Two messages were received of identical length, one in the new system and one in the old, allowing the changes to be compared.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=27–28}}

===Room 40===
In early November 1914 Captain [[William Reginald Hall|William Hall]], son of the first head of Naval Intelligence, was appointed as the new DID to replace Oliver, who had first been transferred to Naval Secretary to the First Lord and then Chief of the Admiralty War Staff. Hall had formerly been captain of the battlecruiser ''[[HMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'' but had been forced to give up sea duties due to ill health. Hall was to prove an extremely successful DID, despite the accidental nature of his appointment.

Once the new organisation began to develop and show results it became necessary to place it on a more formal basis than squatting in Ewing's office. On 6 November 1914 the organisation moved to Room 40 in the [[Admiralty|Admiralty Old Building]], which was by default to give it its name. Room 40 has since been renumbered, but still exists in the original Admiralty Building off Whitehall, London, on the first floor, with windows looking inwards to a courtyard wholly enclosed by Admiralty buildings. Previous occupants of the room had complained that no one was ever able to find it, but it was on the same corridor as the Admiralty boardroom and the office of the First Sea Lord, [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John Fisher]], who was one of the few people allowed to know of its existence. Adjacent was the First Lord's residence (then [[Winston Churchill]]), who was another of those people. Others permitted to know of the existence of a signals interception unit were the [[Second Sea Lord]], the [[Secretary of the Admiralty]], the Chief of Staff (Oliver), the Director of Operations Division (DOD) and the assistant director, the Director of Intelligence Division (DID, Captain [[William Reginald Hall|William Hall]]) and three duty captains. Admiral [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Wilson]], a retired First Sea Lord, had returned to the admiralty to work with the staff and was also included in the secret. The Prime Minister may also have been informed.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=15–19}}

All messages received and decoded were to be kept completely secret, with copies only being passed to the Chief of Staff and Director of Intelligence. It was decided that someone from the intelligence department needed to be appointed to review all the messages and interpret them from the perspective of other information. Rotter was initially suggested for the job, but it was felt preferable to retain him in code breaking and Commander Herbert Hope was chosen, who had previously been working on plotting the movements of enemy ships. Hope was initially placed in a small office in the west wing of the Admiralty in the intelligence section, and waited patiently for the few messages which were approved for him to see. Hope reports that he attempted to make sense of what he was given and make useful observations about them, but without access to the wider information being received his early remarks were generally unhelpful. He reported to Hall that he needed more information, but Hall was unable to help. On 16 November, after a chance meeting with Fisher where he explained his difficulties, Hope was granted full access to the information together with instructions to make twice daily reports to the First Sea Lord. Hope knew nothing of [[cryptanalysis]] or German, but working with the code breakers and translators he brought detailed knowledge of naval procedures to the process, enabling better translations and then interpretations of received messages. In the interests of secrecy the intention to give a separate copy of messages to the DID was dispensed with so that only the Chief of Staff received one, and he was to show it to the First Sea Lord and Arthur Wilson.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=18–20}}

As the number of intercepted messages increased, it became part of Hope's duties to decide which were unimportant and should just be logged, and which should be passed on outside Room 40. The German fleet was in the habit each day of reporting by wireless the position of each ship, and giving regular position reports when at sea. It was possible to build up a precise picture of the normal operation of the High Seas Fleet, indeed to infer from the routes they chose where defensive minefields had been placed and where it was safe for ships to operate. Whenever a change to the normal pattern was seen, it signalled that some operation was about to take place and a warning could be given. Detailed information about submarine movements was available. Most of this information, however, was retained wholly within Room 40 although a few senior members of the Admiralty were kept informed, as a huge priority was placed by the Staff upon keeping secret the British ability to read German transmissions.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=40–42}}

[[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe,]] commanding the Grand Fleet, on three occasions requested from the Admiralty that he should have copies of the codebook which his cruiser had brought back to Britain, so that he could make use of it intercepting German signals. Although he was aware that interception was taking place, little of the information ever got back to him, or it did so very slowly. No messages based upon Room 40 information were sent out except those approved by Oliver personally (except for a few authorised by the First Lord or First Sea Lord). Although it might have been impractical and unwise for code breaking to have taken place on board ship, members of Room 40 were of the view that full use was not being made of the information they had collected, because of the extreme secrecy and being forbidden to exchange information with the other intelligence departments or those planning operations.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=40–42}}

===Signals interception and direction finding===
The British and German interception services began to experiment with [[Direction finding|direction-finding]] radio equipment in the start of 1915. Captain Round, working for Marconi, had been carrying out experiments for the army in France and Hall instructed him to build a direction-finding system for the navy. At first this was sited at Chelmsford but the location proved a mistake and the equipment was moved to Lowestoft. Other stations were built at Lerwick, Aberdeen, York, Flamborough Head and Birchington and by May 1915 the Admiralty was able to track German submarines crossing the North Sea. Some of these stations also acted as 'Y' stations to collect German messages, but a new section was created within Room 40 to plot the positions of ships from the directional reports. A separate set of five stations was created in Ireland under the command of the Vice Admiral at Queenstown for plotting ships in the seas to the west of Britain and further stations both within Britain and overseas were operated by the Admiral commanding reserves.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=69–70}}

The German navy knew of British direction-finding radio and in part this acted as a cover, when information about German ship positions was released for operational use. The two sources of information, from directional fixes and from German reports of their positions, complemented each other. Room 40 was able to observe, using intercepted wireless traffic from Zeppelins which were given position fixes by German directional stations to help their navigation, that the accuracy of British systems was better than their German counterparts. This was explainable by the wider baseline used in British equipment.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|p=70}}

Room 40 had very accurate information on the positions of German ships but the Admiralty's priority remained to keep the existence of this knowledge secret. Hope was shown the regular reports created by the Intelligence Division about German ship whereabouts so that he might correct them. This practice was shortly discontinued, for fear of giving away their knowledge. From June 1915, the regular intelligence reports of ship positions were no longer passed to all flag officers, only to Jellicoe, who was the only person to receive accurate charts of German minefields prepared from Room 40 information. Some information was passed to Beatty (commanding the battlecruisers), [[Reginald Tyrwhitt|Tyrwhitt]] ([[Harwich Force|Harwich destroyers]]) and [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Keyes]] (submarines) but Jellicoe was unhappy with the arrangement. He requested that Beatty should be issued with the ''Cypher B'' (reserved for secret messages between the Admiralty and him) to communicate more freely and complained that he was not getting sufficient information.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=70–72}} 

[[File:Ztel2.jpg|thumb|right|Zimmermann telegram as decoded by Room 40]]

All British ships were under instructions to use radio as sparingly as possible and to use the lowest practical transmission power. Room 40 had benefited greatly from the free chatter between German ships, which gave them many routine messages to compare and analyse, and from the German habit of transmitting at full power, making the messages easier to receive. Messages to Scapa were never to be sent by wireless, and when the fleet was at sea, messages might be sent using lower power and relay ships (including private vessels), to make German interception more difficult. No attempts were made by the German fleet to restrict its use of wireless until 1917 and then only in response to perceived British use of direction finding, not because it believed messages were being decoded.{{sfn|Beesly|1982|pp=70–72}}

==Zimmermann Telegram==
Room 40 played an important role in several naval engagements during the war, notably in detecting major German sorties into the [[North Sea]] that led to the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in 1915 and the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916, as the British fleet was sent out to intercept them. Its most notable contribution was in [[cryptanalysis|decrypting]] the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], a [[telegram]] from the German Foreign Office sent in January 1917 via Washington to its [[ambassador]] [[Heinrich von Eckardt]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=BBC2017&gt;{{cite news|title=Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC|date=17 January 2017|quote=It was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I,&lt;ref name=BBC2017/&gt; and one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events.&lt;ref name=BBCHistory2017&gt;{{cite news|title=The telegram that brought America into the First World War|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC History Magazine|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the telegram's [[plaintext]], [[Nigel de Grey]] and [[William Montgomery (cryptographer)|William Montgomery]] learned of German Foreign Minister [[Arthur Zimmermann]]'s offer to Mexico of United States' territories of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas as an enticement to join the war as a German ally. The telegram was passed to the U.S. by Captain Hall, and a scheme was devised (involving a still unknown agent in Mexico and a burglary) to conceal how its plaintext had become available and also how the U.S. had gained possession of a copy. The telegram was made public by the United States, which [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared war on Germany]] on 6 April 1917, entering the war on the Allied side.&lt;ref name=BBCHistory2017/&gt;

==Staffers==
Other staff of Room 40 included [[Frank Adcock]], [[John Beazley]],&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beazley, Sir John Davidson (1885–1970) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/view/article/30664 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=15 June 2012 |author=Martin Robertson |author2=David Gill |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Francis Birch]], [[Walter Horace Bruford]], [[William Clarke (cryptographer)|William 'Nobby' Clarke]], [[Alastair Denniston]], [[Frank Cyril Tiarks]] and [[Dilly Knox]].

==Merger with Military Intelligence (MI)==
In 1919, Room 40 was deactivated and its function merged with the [[British Army]]'s intelligence unit [[MI1]]b to form the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit was housed at [[Bletchley Park]] during the Second World War and subsequently renamed [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)]] and relocated to [[Cheltenham]].

== Products ==

=== Integra ===
SAF Integra is one of the latest technological developments in the field of microwave data transmission from SAF Tehnika. This next generation microwave radio platform combines antenna, radio part, and the mounting brackets into a single unit. 
Integra has a capacity of up to 1Gbit/s throughput with header compression in 1+0 configuration. The latest modem technology solution enables covering longer distances due to better system gain at 256QAM and with hitless ACM switching up to 1024QAM. With optional ETSI Class 4 antennas Integra may be deployed in a dense microwave environment. The bandwidth range goes from 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 60&amp;nbsp;MHz in single hardware design. Direct radio and antenna integration allows saving the time usually spent on radio-to-antenna assembly and sealing. 
Integra is a light, energy efficient carrier-grade system. Integration of next generation microwave radio with high and super high performance antennas into a single unit translates into a lower total cost of ownership, as well as less time spent on the installation site, and better link reliability even in densely served areas. Its body is made from an EMC-compliant plastic material ensuring complete corrosion resistance surpassing that of the classic microwave antennas. 
The mounting bracket is optimized for wind-load reduction, ensuring a considerably higher wind resistance, which keeps the radio link up even in rugged weather. Another significant addition is the software controlled LED which indicates whether the radio has been synchronized with the remote end and is operating properly.
Built-in multi-core network packet processor enables Carrier Ethernet performance with features like Synchronous Ethernet, header compression, and RADIUS authentication.  Three Gigabit Ethernet ports per radio allow using the built-in high performance Gigabit switch in all-outdoor environment and avoid additional cost of expensive rack-mount switches and facilitate shelter-free installations.

=== Spectrum Compact ===
Spectrum Compact is a handheld microwave spectrum analyzer. Spectrum Compact is a measurement solution for the 6 – 40&amp;nbsp;GHz licensed microwave frequency bands; E-band (70 - 87 GHz) and V-band (56 – 67 GHz) frequencies. Designed specifically for comfortable outdoor use by network engineers in a variety of challenging environments, this battery-powered device is designed for any microwave radio engineer performing equipment installation or gathering data for site planning purposes. The LCD touchscreen ensures smooth and intuitive onsite use, and the SMA connector allows the Spectrum Compact to integrate with any vendors antenna or waveguide system. 
The Spectrum Compact makes it possible to detect existing interference on installed paths or available radio channels with high precision. Data logging of all spectrum scans is available inside of the Spectrum compact with enhanced data processing and analysis available via SAF Tehnika designed PC software. 

=== SG Compact ===
SG Compact is microwave signal generator, which is an essential tool for antenna alignment and testing and top choice for LoS verification applications. Device is perfect for different microwave system analysis and measurement applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8196">{{distinguish-redirect|Signal strength|Signal strength (physics)}}
In [[telecommunications]], particularly in [[radio frequency]], '''signal strength''' (also referred to as '''field strength''') refers to the [[transmitter power output]] as received by a reference antenna at a distance from the transmitting antenna. [[Nominal power|High-powered]] transmissions, such as those used in [[broadcasting]], are expressed in [[Decibel|dB]]-[[millivolt]]s per metre (dBmV/m).  For very low-power systems,  such as [[mobile phone]]s, signal strength is usually expressed in [[Decibel|dB]]-[[microvolt]]s per metre (dBµV/m) or in [[decibel]]s above a reference level of one [[Watt (unit)|milliwatt]] ([[dBm]]).  In broadcasting terminology, 1 mV/m is 1000 µV/m or 60 [[Decibel#Radio power, energy, and field strength|dBµ]] (often written dBu).

;Examples:
*100 dBµ or 100 mV/m: [[blanketing]] interference may occur on some receivers 
*60 dBµ or 1.0 mV/m: frequently considered the edge of a [[radio station]]'s protected area in North America
*40 dBµ or 0.1 mV/m: the minimum strength at which a station can be received with acceptable quality on most receivers

==Relationship to average radiated power==

The electric field strength at a specific point can be determined from the power delivered to the transmitting antenna, its geometry and radiation resistance. Consider the case of a center-fed half-wave [[dipole antenna]] in [[Free-space optical communication|free space]], where the total length L is equal to one half wavelength (λ/2). If constructed from thin conductors, the current distribution is essentially sinusoidal and the radiating electric field is given by

[[Image:lambdaover2-antenna.jpg|frame|Current distribution on antenna of length &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{L} &lt;/math&gt; equal to one half wavelength (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\lambda /2}&lt;/math&gt;).]]

:&lt;math&gt;
E_\theta (r) =
{-jI_\circ\over 2\pi\varepsilon_\circ c\, r}
{\cos\left(\scriptstyle{\pi\over 2}\cos\theta\right)\over\sin\theta}
e^{j\left(\omega t-kr\right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the antenna axis and the vector to the observation point, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{I_\circ}&lt;/math&gt; is the peak current at the feed-point, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\varepsilon_\circ \, = \, 8.85\times 10^{-12} \, F/m }&lt;/math&gt; is the permittivity of free-space, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{c \, = \, 3\times 10^8 \, m/S}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the antenna in meters.  When the antenna is viewed broadside (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\theta \, = \, \pi/2}&lt;/math&gt;) the electric field is maximum and given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
\vert E_{\pi/2}(r) \vert = { I_\circ \over 2\pi\varepsilon_\circ c\, r }\, . 
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this formula for the peak current yields

:&lt;math&gt;
I_\circ = 2\pi\varepsilon_\circ c \, r\vert E_{\pi/2}(r) \vert \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

The average power to the antenna is

:&lt;math&gt; {P_{avg} = {1 \over 2} R_a \, I_\circ^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{R_a = 73.13\,\Omega} &lt;/math&gt; is the center-fed half-wave antenna’s radiation resistance.  Substituting the formula for &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{I_\circ} &lt;/math&gt; into the one for &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{P_{avg}} &lt;/math&gt; and solving for the maximum electric field yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\vert E_{\pi/2}(r)\vert \, = \, {1 \over \pi\varepsilon_\circ c \, r}
\sqrt{{ P_{avg} \over 2R_a}} \, = \, 
{9.91 \over r} \sqrt{ P_{avg} } \quad (L = \lambda /2) \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if the average power to a half-wave dipole antenna is 1&amp;nbsp;mW, then the maximum electric field at 313&amp;nbsp;m (1027&amp;nbsp;ft) is 1 mV/m (60 dBµ).

For a short dipole (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L \ll \lambda /2}&lt;/math&gt;) the current distribution is nearly triangular.  In this case, the electric field and radiation resistance are

:&lt;math&gt;
E_\theta (r) =
{-jI_\circ \sin (\theta) \over 4 \varepsilon_\circ c\, r} \left ( {L \over \lambda} \right )
e^{j\left(\omega t-kr\right)} \, , \quad
R_a = 20\pi^2 \left ( {L \over \lambda} \right )^2 .
&lt;/math&gt;

Using a procedure similar to that above, the maximum electric field for a center-fed short dipole is

:&lt;math&gt;
\vert E_{\pi/2}(r)\vert \, = \, {1 \over \pi\varepsilon_\circ c \, r}
\sqrt{{ P_{avg} \over 160}} \, = \, 
{9.48 \over r} \sqrt{ P_{avg} } \quad (L \ll \lambda /2)\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

==RF signals==

Although there are cell phone base station tower networks across many nations globally, there are still many areas within those nations that do not have good reception. Some rural areas are unlikely to ever be covered effectively since the cost of erecting a cell tower is too high for only a few customers. Even in areas with high signal strength, basements and the interiors of large buildings often have poor reception.

Weak signal strength can also be caused by [[destructive interference]] of the signals from local towers in urban areas, or by the construction materials used in some buildings causing significant attenuation of signal strength. Large buildings such as warehouses, hospitals and factories often have no usable signal further than a few metres from the outside walls.

This is particularly true for the networks which operate at higher [[frequency]] since these are attenuated more by intervening obstacles, although they are able to use [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[diffraction]] to circumvent obstacles.

===Estimated received signal strength===
The estimated received signal strength in an [[active RFID tag]] can be estimated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dBm_e} = -43.0 - 40.0\ \log_{10}\left( \frac{r}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In general, you can take the [[Path loss|path loss exponent]] into account:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mobile Positioning and Tracking: From Conventional to Cooperative Techniques|last = Figueiras|first = João|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2010|isbn = 1119957567|location = |pages = |last2 = Frattasi|first2 = Simone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dBm_e} = -43.0 - 10.0 \ \gamma \ \log_{10}\left( \frac{r}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
!Parameter||Description
|-
|dBm&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;||Estimated received power in active RFID tag
|-
| &amp;minus;43||Minimum received power
|-
| 40||Average path loss per decade for mobile networks
|-
|{{mvar|r}}||Distance mobile device - cell tower
|-
|{{mvar|R}}||Mean radius of the cell tower
|-
|{{mvar|&amp;gamma;}}||Path loss exponent 
|}

The effective [[path loss]] depends on [[Radio frequency|frequency]], [[topography]], and environmental conditions.

Actually, one could use any known ''signal power'' dBm&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at any distance r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as a reference:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dBm_e} = \mathrm{dBm}_0 - 10.0 \ \gamma \ \log_{10}\left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Number of decades===
:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10} ( R / r )&lt;/math&gt; would give an estimate of the number of decades, which coincides with an average path loss of 40 dB/decade.

===Estimate the cell radius===
When we measure cell distance ''r'' and received power {{math|dBm&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} pairs,
we can estimate the mean cell radius as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;R_e = \operatorname{avg}[ \ r \ 10 ^ { ( \mathrm{dBm_m} + 43.0 ) / 40.0 } \ ]&lt;/math&gt;

Specialized calculation models exist to plan the location of a new cell tower, taking into account local conditions and [[radio equipment]] parameters, as well as consideration that [[wireless network|mobile radio signals]] have [[line-of-sight propagation]], unless reflection occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18434">[[File:Intelligent key.JPG|thumb|right|Nissan Intelligent Key]]
A '''smart key''' is an [[electronics|electronic]] access and authorization system that is available either as standard equipment or as an option in several car models. It was first developed by Siemens in 1995 and introduced by Mercedes-Benz under the name "Key-less Go" in 1998 on the W220 [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]], after the design patent was filed by Daimler-Benz on May 17, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9704698-0004&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The smart key allows the driver to keep the [[key fob]] pocketed when unlocking, locking and starting the vehicle. The key is identified via one of several [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] in the car's bodywork and a radio pulse generator in the key housing. Depending on the system, the vehicle is automatically unlocked when a button or sensor on the door handle or trunk release is pressed. Vehicles with a smart-key system have a mechanical backup, usually in the form of a spare key blade supplied with the vehicle. Some manufacturers hide the backup lock behind a cover for styling.

[[File:Push-button ignition switch.jpg|thumb|right|A push-button ignition switch in place of the immobilizer on a [[Mitsubishi RVR]] equipped with the Smart key.]]
Vehicles with a smart-key system can disengage the [[immobiliser|immobilizer]] and activate the [[Ignition system|ignition]] without inserting a key in the ignition, provided the driver has the key inside the car. On most vehicles, this is done by pressing a starter button or twisting an ignition switch.

When leaving a vehicle that is equipped with a smart-key system, the vehicle is locked by either pressing a button on a door handle, touching a capacitive area on a door handle, or simply walking away from the vehicle. The method of locking varies across models.

Some vehicles automatically adjust settings based on the smart key used to unlock the car. User preferences such as seat positions, steering wheel position, exterior mirror settings, climate control (e.g. temperature) settings, and stereo presets are popular adjustments. Some models, such as the [[Ford Escape]], even have settings to prevent the vehicle from exceeding a maximum speed if it has been started with a certain key.

==Insurance standard==
In 2005, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] motor insurance research expert Thatcham introduced a standard for keyless entry, requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more than 10&amp;nbsp;cm from the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcham.org/home.jsp?ugid=2 Thatcham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211112353/http://www.thatcham.org/home.jsp?ugid=2 |date=2007-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an independent test, the [[Nissan March|Nissan Micra]]'s system was found to be the most secure, while certain BMW and Mercedes keys failed, being theoretically capable of allowing cars to be driven away while their owners were refueling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/58364/micras_top_of_the_fobs.html Auto Express: Micra's Top of the Fobs]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these security vulnerabilities, auto theft rates have decreased 7 percent between 2009 and 2010, and the National Insurance Crime Bureau credits smart keys for this decrease.

==SmartKeys==
'''SmartKeys''' was developed by Siemens in the mid-1990s and introduced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in 1997 to replace the infrared security system introduced in 1989. Daimler-Benz filed the first patents for SmartKey on February 28, 1997 in German patent offices, with multifunction switchblade key variants following on May 17, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9701993-0001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9704698-0001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9704698-0002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/gsm/register?GSNR=M9704698-0003&lt;/ref&gt; The device entailed a plastic key to be used in place of the traditional metal key.  Electronics that control locking systems and the ignitions made it possible to replace the traditional key with a sophisticated computerized "Key".  It is considered a step up from [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry]].  The SmartKey adopts the remote control buttons from keyless entry, and incorporates them into the SmartKey fob.

Once inside a Mercedes-Benz vehicle, the SmartKey fob, unlike keyless entry fobs, is placed in the ignition slot where a starter computer verifies the rolling code.  Verified in milliseconds, it can then be turned as a traditional key to start the engine.  The device was designed with cooperation of [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] Automotive and Huf exclusively for Mercedes-Benz, but many luxury manufacturers have implemented similar technology based on the same idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In addition to the SmartKey, Mercedes-Benz now integrates as an option [[Keyless Go]]; this feature allows the driver to keep the SmartKey in their pocket, yet giving them the ability to open the doors, trunk as well as starting the car without ever removing it from their pocket.

The SmartKey's electronics are embedded in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece. The side of the SmartKey also hides a traditional Mercedes-Benz key that can be pulled out from a release at top. The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the [[glovebox]] and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant.  Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons. The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder to communicate with the door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the engine immobilizer system. Original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes. The driver can also point the smart key at the front driver side door while pushing and holding the unlock button on the SmartKey and the windows and the sunroof will open in order to ventilate the cabin.  Similarly, if the same procedure is completed while holding the lock button, the windows and sunroof will close.  In cars equipped with the Active Ventilated Seats, the summer opening feature will activate the seat ventilation in addition to opening the windows and sunroof.

== Keyless Go ==
'''Keyless Go''' (also: Keyless Entry / Go; Passive Entry / Go) is Mercedes' term for an automotive technology which allows a driver to lock and unlock a vehicle without using the corresponding SmartKey buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KEYLESS-GO®|url=https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/owners/videos/detail/videoId-554cd68b2c51d310VgnVCM2000007d184335RCRD|website=Mercedes-Benz USA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a driver enters a vehicle with an equipped Keyless Go SmartKey or Keyless Go wallet-size card, they have the ability to start and stop the engine, without inserting the SmartKey. A [[transponder]] built within the SmartKey allows the vehicle to identify a driver. An additional safety feature is integrated into the vehicle, making it impossible to lock a SmartKey with Keyless Go inside a vehicle.

[[File:KeylessEntryGoCircuitUnits.jpg|thumb|right|Hardware blocks on the Keyless Entry/Go ECU]]
The system works by having a series of LF ([[low frequency]] 125&amp;nbsp;kHz) transmitting antennas both inside and outside the vehicle. The external antennas are located in the door handles. When the vehicle is triggered, either by pulling the handle or touching the handle, an LF signal is transmitted from the antennas to the key. The key becomes activated if it is sufficiently close and it transmits its ID back to the vehicle via RF ([[Radio frequency]] &gt;300&amp;nbsp;MHz) to a receiver located in the vehicle. If the key has the correct ID, the PASE module unlocks the vehicle.

The hardware blocks of a Keyless Entry / Go [[Electronic control unit]] ECU are based on its functionality:
* transmitting low-frequency LF signals via the 125&amp;nbsp;kHz [[power amplifier]] block
* receiving radio frequency RF signals (&gt; 300&amp;nbsp;MHz) from the built-in [[ISM band|ISM]] receiver block
* encrypting and decrypting all relevant data signals (security)
* communicating relevant interface signals with other [[electronic control unit|electronic control units]]
* [[microcontroller]]

== Inside Outside detection ==

The smart key determines if it is inside or outside the vehicle by measuring the strength of the LF fields. In order to start the vehicle, the smart key must be inside the vehicle.

== System reaction times ==

The mark of a good passive entry system is that the user never hits the "wall". This happens when the user pulls the door handle to its full extent before the door is unlocked. The handle has to be released and pulled again to gain access. Good systems have an override feature that allows the doors to be opened more quickly.

== Security requirements ==

It is important that the vehicle can't be started when the user and therefore the smart key is outside the vehicle. This is especially important at fueling stations where the user is very close to the vehicle. The internal LF field is allowed to overshoot by a maximum of 10&amp;nbsp;cm to help minimise this risk. Maximum overshoot is usually found on the side windows where there is very little attenuation of the signal.

[[File:RelayStationAttack.jpg|thumb|right|Relay Station Attack]]
A second scenario exists under the name "relay station attack" (RSA). The RSA is based on the idea of reducing the long physical distance between the car and the regular car owner's SmartKey. Two relay stations will be needed for this: The first relay station is located nearby the car and the second is close to the SmartKey. So on first view, the Keyless Entry / Go ECU and the SmartKey could communicate together. A third person at the car could pull the door handle and the door would open. However, in every Keyless Entry / Go system provisions exist to avoid a successful two-way communication via RSA. Some of the most known are:

* measuring [[group delay]] time to detect illegal high values
* measuring [[third-order intercept point]] to detect illegal [[intermodulation]] products
* measuring [[field strength]] of the [[electric field]]
* measuring the response time of 125&amp;nbsp;kHz [[LC circuit]]
* using a more complex [[modulation]] (i.e. [[quadrature amplitude modulation]]) which can't be demodulated and modulated by a simple relay station

Furthermore, Keyless Entry / Go communicates with other ''Control Units'' within the same vehicle. Depending on the electric car architecture, the following are some ''Control Systems'' that can be enabled or disabled:
* ESCL Electric Steering Column Lock
* EIS Electronic Ignition Switch
* Central door locking system
* [[Immobiliser]]
* [[Engine Control Unit]] (Motor management system)
* BCU Body control unit

== Internal LF field dead spots ==

Dead spots are a result of the maximum overshoot requirement from above. The power delivered to the internal LF antennas has to be tuned to provide the best performance i.e. minimum dead spots and maximum average overshoot. Dead spots are usually near the extremities of the vehicle e.g. the rear parcel shelf.

== Battery Backup ==

If the battery in the smart key becomes depleted, it is necessary for there to be a backup method of opening and starting the vehicle. Opening is achieved by an emergency (fully mechanical) key blade usually hidden in the smart key. On many cars emergency starting is achieved by use of an [[inductive coupling]]. The user either has to put the key in a slot or hold it near a special area on the cockpit, where there is an inductive coil hidden behind which transfers energy to a matching coil in the dead key fob using [[inductive charging]].

Slots have proven to be problematic, as they can go wrong and the key becomes locked in and cannot be removed.  Another problem with the slot is it can't compensate for a fob battery below certain operating threshold.  Most smart key batteries are temperature sensitive causing the fob to become intermittent, fully functional, or inoperative all in the same day.

== Special Cases ==
A Keyless Entry / Go system should be able to detect and handle most of the following cases:

* SmartKey Transponder was forgotten in the rear trunk
* More than one SmartKey is present inside the car
* SmartKey getting lost during the drive
* Smartkey battery low [[Built-in self-test#Automotive|(Limp-Home)]]

== History ==
[[File:KeylessGoSiemensVDO.jpg|thumb|right|The first Keyless Entry / Go ECU of the MB S-Class car series 1998/99]]
The system is based on a technology invented by Siemens VDO called PASE: Passive Start and Entry System. It operates in the [[ISM band]] of radio frequencies. Keyless Entry / Go was introduced first by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in the S-Class car series in 1998.

== Outlook ==
Today a Keyless Entry / Go system is a state-of-the art technology and still has a lot of potential to optimise. Here are some general trends of the advance (AD) and series development (SD):

* SD: reduction of used LF antennas in low-cost compact cars (results in a loss of detection quality)
* AD: using electric field antennas instead of magnetic field antennas (cost reduction)
* AD: using microwave frequencies (radar) instead of an LF and RF combination (more comfort)
* AD: [[Biometric]] [[authentication]] would identify the user and not the SmartKey transponder

==Effectiveness==
A test by [[ADAC]] revealed that 20 car models with Keyless Go could be entered and driven away without the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/94918/tests-uncover-major-security-risk-to-keyless-cars | title=Tests uncover major security risk to keyless cars | publisher=[[Auto Express]] | date=18 March 2016 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Saarinen, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adac.de/_mmm/pdf/Keyless-Diebstahl%20-%20vom%20ADAC%20untersuchte%20Autos%2020160315_257944.pdf Keyless-Diebstahl - vom ADAC untersuchte Autos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327125313/http://www.adac.de/_mmm/pdf/Keyless-Diebstahl%20-%20vom%20ADAC%20untersuchte%20Autos%2020160315_257944.pdf |date=2016-03-27 }} ''[[ADAC]]'', 15 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adac.de/infotestrat/technik-und-zubehoer/fahrerassistenzsysteme/keyless/default.aspx Autos mit Keyless leichter zu klauen] ''[[ADAC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|xHCUpLBGIKQ|ADAC demonstrates keyless theft}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 6,000 cars (about 17 per day) were stolen using keyless entry in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/90328/keyless-car-crime-up-as-gangs-target-vans | title=Keyless car crime up as gangs target vans | publisher=[[Auto Express]] | date=5 February 2015 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Finnerty, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Snow gauge.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A snow gauge.]]

A '''snow gauge''' is a type of instrument used by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]] and [[hydrologist]]s to gather and measure the amount of solid [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (as opposed to liquid precipitation that is measured by a [[rain gauge]]) over a set period of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==History==
The first use of snow gauges were precipitation gauges that was widely used in 1247 during the [[Southern Song dynasty]] to gather meteorological data. The Song Chinese mathematician and inventor [[Qin Jiushao]] records the use of gathering rain and snowfall measurements in the Song mathematical treatise ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]''. The book discusses the use of large conical or barrel-shaped snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures  |last=Selin |first=Helaine  |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-1402045592 |edition=2nd |publication-date=April 16, 2008 |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The snow gauge consists of two parts, a [[copper]] [[drainage basin|catchment]] container and the funnel shaped gauge itself. The actual gauge is mounted on a pipe outdoors and is approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft 11 in) high, while the container is 51.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft 2.25&amp;nbsp;in) long.

==Measurement procedure==
When [[snow]] is collected, the container is removed and replaced with a spare one. The snow is then melted while it is still in the container, and then poured into a glass measuring graduate. While the depth of snow is normally measured in [[centimetres]], the measurement of melted snow ([[snow water equivalent|water equivalent]]) is in [[millimetres]].

An estimate of the snow depth can be obtained by multiplying the water equivalent by ten. However, this multiplier can vary over a wide range (many say the range is 5 to 30, but the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] has quoted a range as wide as 3 to 100), depending on the water content of the snow (how "dry" it is), so this only provides, at best, a rough estimate of snow depth.

==Issues==
The snow gauge suffers from the same problem as that of the [[rain gauge]] when conditions are windy. If the wind is strong enough, then the snow may be blown across the wind gauge and the amount of snow fallen will be under-reported. However, due to the shape and size of the funnel this is a minor problem.

If the wind is very strong and a blizzard occurs then extra snow may be blown into the gauge and the amount of snow fallen will be over-reported. In this case the observer must judge how much of the water is from snow blown into the container and how much is fallen snow.

Another problem occurs when both snow and [[rain]] fall before the observer has time to change the gauge. In all of these cases the observer must judge how much of the water is snow and how much is rain.

==Other snow gauges==

===Automated===
Remote reading gauges, such as used by weather stations, work similarly to rain gauges. They have a large catch area (such as a drum sawn in half, top to bottom) which collects snow until a given weight is collected. When this critical weight is reached, it tips and empties the snow catch. This dumping trips a switch, sending a signal. The collection then repeats. If the catch container has a heater in it, it measures the snow weight accurately. It is also possible to tip based on volume instead of weight, with appropriate fill sensing.

===Snow pillow===
Another snow sensor called a [[snow pillow]] looks like a round bag lying on the ground. Inside the pillow is a liquid such as an environmentally safe{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[antifreeze]].  Usually the snow pillow will be connected to a [[manometer]].  The manometer reading will vary based on how much snow is sitting on the pillow.  This type of sensor works well for many locations but is more difficult to use in areas of hard blowing snow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">Three basic approaches for '''constructing a space elevator''' have been proposed: First, using in-space resources to [[Space manufacturing|manufacture]] the whole cable in space. Second, launching and deploying a first seed cable and successively reinforcing the seed cable by additional cables, transported by climbers. Third, spooling two cables down and then connecting the ends, forming a loop. 

== Early construction concepts ==
There are two approaches to constructing a [[space elevator]]. Either the cable is manufactured in space or it is launched into space and gradually reinforced by additional cables, transported by climbers into space. Manufacturing the cable in space could be done in principle by using an [[asteroid]] or [[Near-Earth object]].&lt;ref&gt;D.V. Smitherman (Ed.), [http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spaceelevator/2000-SpaceElevator-NASA-CP210429.pdf Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium], NASA/CP-2000-210429, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HEIN"&gt;Hein, A.M., [https://www.academia.edu/2111184/A.M._Hein_Producing_a_Space_Elevator_Tether_using_a_NEO_A_Preliminary_Assessment_ Producing a Space Elevator Tether Using a NEO: A Preliminary Assessment], International Astronautical Congress 2012, IAC-2012, Naples, Italy, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

One early plan involved lifting the entire mass of the elevator into [[geostationary orbit]], and lowering one cable downwards towards the Earth's surface while simultaneously another cable is deployed upwards directly away from the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="PEAR"&gt;[http://www.star-tech-inc.com/papers/tower/tower.pdf Pearson, J. (1975). The orbital tower: a spacecraft launcher using the Earth's rotational energy. Acta Astronautica, 2(9), 785-799.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tidal force]]s ([[Gravitational force|gravity]] and [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]]) would naturally pull the cables directly towards and directly away from the Earth and keep the elevator balanced around geostationary orbit. As the cable is deployed, [[Coriolis force]]s would pull the upper portion of the cable somewhat to the West and the lower portion of the cable somewhat to the East; this effect can be controlled by varying the deployment speed.&lt;ref name="PEAR"/&gt;

However, this approach requires lifting hundreds or even thousands of tons on conventional [[rocket]]s, an expensive proposition.

== Cable seeding design ==

[[Bradley C. Edwards]], former Director of Research for the [[Institute for Scientific Research]] (ISR), based in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]] proposed that, if nanotubes with sufficient strength could be made in bulk, a space elevator could be built in little more than a decade, rather than the far future. He proposed that a single hair-like 20-ton 'seed' cable be deployed in the traditional way, giving a very lightweight elevator with very little lifting capacity. Then, progressively heavier cables would be pulled up from the ground along it, repeatedly strengthening it until the elevator reaches the required [[mass]] and [[Strength of materials|strength]]. This is much the same technique used to build [[suspension bridge]]s. The length of this cable is 35,786 km or 35,786,000 m. A 20-ton cable would weigh about 1.12 grams per m.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/472Edwards.html "The Space Elevator: Phase I Study"] by Bradley Carl Edwards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loop elevator design ==
This is a less well developed design, but offers some other possibilities.

If the cable provides a useful tensile strength to density of about 48.1 GPa/(kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or above, then a constant width cable can reach beyond geostationary orbit without breaking under its own weight. The far end can then be turned around and passed back down to the Earth forming a constant width loop, which would be kept spinning to avoid tangling. The two sides of the loop are naturally kept apart by [[coriolis force]]s due to the rotation of the Earth and the loop. By increasing the thickness of the cable from the ground a very quick (exponential) build-up of a new elevator may be performed (it helps that no active climbers are needed, and power is applied mechanically.) However, because the loop runs at constant speed, joining and leaving the loop may be somewhat challenging, and the carrying capacity of such a loop is lower than a conventional tapered design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Current status==
Currently, the cable seeding design and the space manufacturing design are considered. The space manufacturing design would use a carbonacious [[asteroid]] or [[near-Earth object]] for mining its material and producing a [[carbon nanotube]] cable.&lt;ref name = "HEIN"/&gt; The cable would then be transported back to [[geostationary orbit]] and spooled down. Although this approach shifts the construction complexity away from the use of climbers in the cable seeding design, it increases the complexity of the required in-space infrastructure. 

The cable seeding design could be rendered infeasible in case the material strength is considerably lower than was projected by Brad Edwards.&lt;ref name="HEIN"/&gt;

Current technological status of the cable seeding design:

| Strength
| 30-100 Meganewtons/(kg/m)&lt;ref&gt;The specific strength of 100 meganewtons/(kg/m) is for a constant cross section cable and a safety factor of 2.  The ability to build with a constant cross section cable has some advantages, but is not necessary.  Tapering the cable cross section from a maximum at the geosynchronous orbit level to minimums at the bottom and top allows construction with materials having less specific strength.  The minimum specific strength required for a tapered cable depends largely on launch budget and other financial factors.  A 30 meganewton/(kg/m) lower limit has been mentioned as a goal for specific strength to be able to support a reasonably financially feasible space elevator -- the motto of the 2011 Space Elevator Conference was "30 MegaYuris or Bust!".  A "Yuri" here is used as the unit representing one Newton/(kg/m).&lt;/ref&gt;{{CN|date=April 2014}}

[[File:Engineers_Check_Body_Revolution_Model_-_GPN-2000-001473.jpg|thumb|Engineers check an aircraft model before a test run in the Supersonic Wind Tunnel at [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]].]]
[[File:Pitot-Mach4-PSUSWT.jpg|thumb|[[Schlieren photography]] is often used to capture images of gas flow and shock waves in supersonic wind tunnels.  Here, Mach 4 flow over a pitot probe is observed by schlieren optics in the [[Penn State]] Supersonic Wind Tunnel.  The flow direction is left-to-right.]]

A '''supersonic wind tunnel''' is a [[wind tunnel]] that produces [[supersonic]] speeds (1.2&lt;[[Mach number|M]]&lt;5)
The Mach number and flow are determined by the [[nozzle]] geometry. The [[Reynolds number]] is varied by changing the density level (pressure in the settling chamber). Therefore, a high pressure ratio is required (for a supersonic regime at M=4, this ratio is of the order of 10). Apart from that, condensation of moisture or even gas liquefaction can occur if the static temperature becomes cold enough. This means that a supersonic wind tunnel usually needs a drying or a pre-heating facility.
A supersonic wind tunnel has a large power demand, so most are designed for intermittent instead of continuous operation.

==Restrictions for supersonic tunnel operation==

===Minimum required pressure ratio===
Optimistic estimate:
Pressure ratio &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; the total pressure ratio over normal shock at M in test section:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_t}{P_{amb}} \leq\left(\frac{P_{t_1}}{P_{t_2}}\right)_{M_1=M_m}&lt;/math&gt;

Examples:

===Temperature effects: condensation===
Temperature in the test section:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_m}{T_t}=\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_m^2\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;T_t&lt;/math&gt; = 330 K: &lt;math&gt;T_m&lt;/math&gt; = 70 K at &lt;math&gt;M_m&lt;/math&gt; = 4

The velocity range is limited by reservoir temperature

==Power requirements==
The power required to run a supersonic wind tunnel is enormous, of the order of 50 MW per square meter of test section cross-sectional area. For this reason most wind tunnels operate intermittently using energy stored in high-pressure tanks. These wind tunnels are also called intermittent supersonic blowdown wind tunnels (of which a schematic preview is given below). Another way of achieving the huge power output is with the use of a vacuum storage tank. &lt;!-- What are high pressure tanks or vacuum storage tanks? --&gt;  These tunnels are called indraft supersonic wind tunnels, and are seldom used because they are restricted to low Reynolds numbers.  Some large countries have built major supersonic tunnels that run continuously; one is shown in the photo.  
Other problems operating a supersonic wind tunnel include:
*starting and [[unstart]] of the test section (related to maintaining at least a minimum pressure ratio)
*adequate supply of dry air
*wall interference effects due to shock wave reflection and (sometimes) blockage
*high-quality instruments capable of rapid measurements due to short run times in intermittent tunnels
[[File:Supersonic-en.svg|400px]]

Tunnels such as a [[Ludwieg tube]] have short test times (usually less than one second), relatively high Reynolds number, and low power requirements.

{{Taxation}}
'''Tax compliance software''' is software that assists [[tax]] compliance, and may cover [[income tax]], [[corporate tax]], [[VAT]], [[service tax]], [[customs]], [[sales tax]], [[use tax]], or other taxes its users may be required to pay. The software automatically calculates a user's tax liabilities to the government, keeps track of all transactions (in case of [[indirect taxes]]), keeps track of eligible tax credits, etc. The software can also generate forms or filings needed for tax compliance. The software will have pre-defined tax rates and slabs and can allocate income or revenue in the right slab itself. The aim of the software is to provide the user with easy way to calculate tax payment and minimize any [[human error]].
Tax compliance software has been present in developed countries for long in the form of tax calculators mainly for direct taxes, such as income tax and corporate tax. Gradually some more complex and customized tax compliance software has been designed and developed by organizations around the globe.

Tax compliance software can be divided into two main categories: [[direct tax|direct]] and [[indirect tax]] compliance software.

==Direct tax compliance software==
A [[direct tax]] is one paid directly to the government by the persons (juristic or natural) on whom it is imposed (often accompanied by a tax return filed by the taxpayer). Examples include income tax, corporate tax, and transfer tax such as [[estate tax]] and gift tax.
Basic software for income tax in the form of a tax calculator, and are now widely used. For example, the [[Government of India]] provides an income tax calculator&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/taxmanndit/xtras/taxcalc.aspx Income Tax Calculator] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713013252/http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/TaxmannDit/xtras/taxcalc.aspx |date=13 July 2008 }} Retrieved on 20 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; on their website.
[[Corporate tax]] compliance software has also been in existence for years, more often than not within the company's Finance &amp; Accounting software or financial module of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERPs]]. These suites have the facilities to maintain the company's General Ledger, Cash Management, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Fixed Assets along with some basic taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sap.com/solutions/business-suite/erp/financials/featuresfunctions/index.epx Financial Features of SAP ERP] Retrieved on 20 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indirect tax compliance software==
An [[indirect tax]] (such as sales tax, value added tax (VAT), or goods and services tax (GST)) is a tax collected by an intermediary (such as a retail store) from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax (such as the customer). The intermediary later files a tax return and forwards the tax proceeds to government with the return.
Indirect Tax compliance has always been much more complex as compared to the direct taxes. Many indirect tax compliance programs have separate modules for VAT, Service Tax, Customs etc.

===VAT compliance software===
[[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) legislation has a common structure across countries (and states in case of [[India]]). Software must be customized to each country, however, because of differences in the some areas, such as handling of credit of capital goods, sale of scrap and second-hand goods, formats of mandatory submissions and audit exercises.

===Service tax compliance software===
Service tax compliance software often include maintenance of credit registers, handling reverse charges, rebate claims on export of services along with payment of tax and filing of returns.

==Personal Software ==
Some popular [[tax preparation]] software include:
* [[H&amp;R Block Tax Software]]
* [[TaxACT]]
* [[TaxCut]]
* [[TurboTax]]
* [[CompleteTax]]

==See also==
* [[Streamlined Sales Tax Project]]

A '''tedder''' (also called '''hay tedder''') is a machine used in [[Hay#Making and transporting hay|haymaking]]. It is used after cutting and before [[windrow]]ing, and uses moving forks to aerate or "wuffle" the hay and thus speed up the process of hay-making. The use of a tedder allows the hay to dry ("cure") better, which results in improved aroma and color.&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;{{cite book

In an early, simple hay tedder described in 1852 and manufactured in [[Edinburgh]] by the company of Mr. Slight, the two wheels, via a [[spur]] wheel and a [[pinion]], drive a set of light wheels, the "rake wheels"; on these two rake wheels are mounted eight rakes, which pick up and disperse the hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some tedders have the rotating tines enclosed inside a solid structure to increase the force applied to the hay. Other similar machines included ''the wuffler'' and ''the acrobat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhoddssfarm.co.uk/vinomisc.htm Vintage Collection – Non-Ferguson Implements at rhoddssfarm.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The wuffler shuffles the hay in a manner similar to the tedder. The acrobat may be used also for turning, and for rowing hay up ready for [[baler|baling]].

=== Centrifugal rakes ===

On two opposing horizontal gyroscopes, which are pto-driven, are mounted obliquely downward standing tines. These refer to the green waste and throw it back. Due to the rear-mounted collecting baskets a windrowing is as possible with a Rake. Their distribution is low because of the limited job performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoftechnik.at/zetten-heuwender-kreiselheuer/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''test bench''' or '''testing workbench''' is an environment used to verify the correctness or soundness of a design or model.

The term has its roots{{cn|date=May 2018}} in the testing of electronic devices, where an engineer would sit at a lab bench with tools for measurement and manipulation, such as [[oscilloscope]]s, [[multimeter]]s, soldering irons, wire cutters, and so on, and manually verify the correctness of the [[device under test]] (DUT).

In the context of software or firmware or hardware engineering, a test bench is an environment in which the product under development is tested with the aid of software and hardware tools. The software may need to be modified slightly in some cases to work with the test bench but careful coding can ensure that the changes can be undone easily and without introducing bugs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marilynwolf.us/CaC3e/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211533/http://www.marilynwolf.us/CaC3e/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trench Codes ('''a form of [[cryptography]]) were [[code (cryptography)|code]]s used for secrecy by field armies in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = [4.0] Codes &amp; Codebreakers In World War I|url = http://www.vectorsite.net/ttcode_04.html|website = www.vectorsite.net|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the most commonly used codes were simple substitution codes, but due to the relative vulnerability of the [[classical cipher]], trench codes came into existence. (Important messages generally used alternative encryption techniques for greater security.) The use of these codes required the distribution of [[codebook]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to military personnel, which proved to be a security liability since these books could be stolen by enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World War I - National intelligence communities, Sabotage, Communications and cryptology|url = http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Vo-Z/World-War-I.html|website = www.faqs.org|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of [[World War I]] the conflict had settled down into a static battle of attrition, with the two sides sitting in huge lines of fixed earthwork fortifications. With armies generally immobile, distributing codebooks and protecting them was easier than it would have been for armies on the move. However, armies were still in danger of trench-raiding parties who would sneak into enemy lines and try to snatch codebooks. When this happened, an alarm could be raised and a code quickly changed. Trench codes were changed on a regular basis in an attempt to prevent code breakers from deciphering messages.

==French Army==
The [[France|French]] began to develop trench codes in early 1916. They started out as [[telephone]] codes, implemented at the request of a [[general]] whose forces had suffered devastating [[artillery]] bombardments due to indiscretions in telephone conversations between his men. The original telephone code featured a small set of two-letter codewords that were spelled out in voice communications. This grew into a three-letter code scheme, which was then adopted for wireless, with early one-part code implementations evolving into more secure two-part code implementations. The British began to adopt trench codes as well.

==German Army==
The [[Germany|Germans]] started using trench codes in the spring of 1917, evolving into a book of 4,000 codewords that were changed twice a month, with different codebooks used on different sectors of the front. The French codebreakers were extremely competent at cracking [[Encryption|ciphers]] but were somewhat inexperienced at cracking codes, which require a slightly different mindset. It took them time to get to the point where they were able to crack the German codes in a timely fashion.

==U.S. troops==
The Americans were relative newcomers to cryptography when they entered the war, but they did have their star players. One was Parker Hitt, b. 1878,  who before the war had been an [[Army Signal Corps]] instructor. He was one of the first to try to bring [[United States Army|US Army]] cryptology into the 20th century, publishing an influential short work on the subject in 1915 called the Manual for the solution of military ciphers, Publication date 1916, available at https://archive.org/details/manualforsolutio00hittrich. He was assigned to France in an administrative role, but his advice was eagerly sought by colleagues working in operational cryptology. Another Signal Corps officer who would make his mark on cryptology was [[Joseph Mauborgne]], who in 1914, as a [[First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]], had been the first to publish a solution to the Playfair cipher.

When the Americans began moving up to the front in numbers in early 1918, they adopted trench codes and became very competent at their construction, with a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Howard R. Barnes]] eventually learning to produce them at a rate that surprised British colleagues. The Americans adopted a series of codes named after rivers, beginning with "Potomac". They learned to print the codebooks on paper that burned easily and degraded quickly after a few weeks, when the codes would presumably be obsolete, while using a font that was easy to read under trench conditions.

==Communications discipline==
American code makers were often frustrated by the inability or refusal of combat units to use the codes—or worse, to use them properly. A soldier engaged in combat doesn't always feel the need to do things "by the book" even when there are very good reasons to do so, and generals on the front line felt that they had other things to worry about. One codemaker suggested that the best way to address the problem was to publicly hang a few offenders, but he lacked the authority to do so.

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and French were already familiar with such problems in "communications discipline". They hadn't completely solved the problems either, but they had at least managed to get it through the heads of most of their signalmen that if they didn't have time to properly encrypt a message, they shouldn't bother trying; send the message unencrypted, or "in the clear". A partially or badly encrypted message could undermine a cipher or code system, sometimes completely, which made an unencrypted message far preferable.

'''Uptime''' is a [[Measurement|measure]] of system reliability, expressed as the percentage of [[system time|time]] a [[machine]], typically a [[computer]], has been working and available. Uptime is the opposite of [[downtime]].

[[File:Htop-uptime.png|thumb|right|[[Htop]] adds an exclamation mark when uptime is bigger than 100 days]]It is often used as a measure of computer [[operating system]] reliability or stability, in that this time represents the time a computer can be left unattended without [[crash (computing)|crashing]], or needing to be [[booting|rebooted]] for administrative or maintenance purposes.
Conversely, long uptime may indicate negligence, because some critical updates can require reboots on some platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/296861 |title=How to install multiple Windows updates or hotfixes with only one reboot |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
In 2005, [[Novell]] reported a server with a 6-year uptime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/netware/2005/1128nw2.html |title=Marathon servers |publisher=Networkworld.com |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/trench/241.html |title=Cool Solutions: Uptime Workhorses: Still Crazy after all these Years |publisher=Novell.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that might sound unusual, that is actually common when servers are maintained under an industrial context and host critical applications such as banking systems.

[[Netcraft]] maintains the uptime records for many thousands of [[web hosting]] computers.

A server running Novell NetWare has been reported to have been shut down after 16 years of uptime due to a failing hard disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/ |title=Epic uptime achievement unlocked. Can you beat 16 years? |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=1199529 |title=So long to a valiant companion - Ars Technica OpenForum |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determining system uptime==

=== Microsoft Windows ===

====Using systeminfo====
{{Main|systeminfo}}
Users of [[Windows XP editions#Home and Professional|Windows XP Professional]], [[Windows Server 2003]] and [[Windows Vista]] systems can type &lt;code&gt;systeminfo&lt;/code&gt; at the [[Command Prompt (Windows)|Command Prompt]] to display all system information, including the ''System Up Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5826014.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708043004/http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5826014.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title=Tracking down uptime in Windows XP &amp;#124; TechRepublic |publisher=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;systeminfo | findstr "Time:"
System Up Time:            0 Days, 8 Hours, 7 Minutes, 19 Seconds
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note: [[Windows Vista Business 64-bit]] and [[Windows 7]] do not return a "System Up Time" but "System Boot Time" instead. Also note that the exact text and date format is dependent of the language and locale Windows is running.''

''Note: [[Windows 7]]'s "System Boot Time" is not a reliable indicator of boot time.  It does not take into account the time spent in [[Sleep mode|sleep]] or [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernation]] mode.  Hence, the boot time drifts forward every time the computer is left in sleep or hibernate mode.''

====Using net statistics server/workstation====
&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;net statistics workstation | findstr "since"
Server Statistics for \\COMPUTERNAME

Statistics since 8/31/2009 8:52:29 PM
&lt;/source&gt;
The line that start with "Statistics since ..." provides the time that the server was up from. The command "net stats srv" is shorthand for "net statistics server."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yuval Sinay |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555737 |title=How to find Windows uptime? |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2006-10-25 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact text and date format is dependent of the language and locale Windows is running.

====Using Uptime.exe====
Microsoft has also provided a downloadable utility:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/232243 |title=Uptime.exe Tool Allows You to Estimate Server Availability with Windows NT 4.0 SP4 or Higher |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2014-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044710/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/232243 |archive-date=2014-04-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;Uptime
SYSTEMNAME has been up for: 2 day(s), 4 hour(s), 24 minute(s), 47 second(s)
&lt;/source&gt;

''Note: The [[Windows 7]] Uptime.exe utility is not a reliable indicator of total uptime. It gives the same wrong information and boot time as the Task Manager Uptime. It does not take into account the time spent in [[Sleep mode|sleep]] or [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernation]] mode.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} An alternative to the Uptime.exe utility is "net statistics workstation" under "Statistics".

====Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)====
{{Main|Windows Management Instrumentation}}
Uptime can also be determined via WMI from the command-line with &lt;code&gt;wmic&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;wmic os get lastbootuptime
LastBootUpTime
20110508161751.822066+060
&lt;/source&gt;

The timestamp is in the format yyyymmddhhmmss.nnn, so this is a computer that last booted up on 8 May 2011 at 16:17:51.822. WMI can also be used to find the boot time of remote computers as well (Windows permissions allowing), for example with WMIC:

&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;wmic /node:"my-server" os get lastbootuptime
LastBootUpTime
20101219141712.462006+060
&lt;/source&gt;

The text "LastBootUpTime" and the timestamp format are always the same regardless of the language and locale, Windows is running.

WMI can also be used via a programming language such as VBScript or Powershell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blogs.technet.com/heyscriptingguy/archive/2004/09/07/how-can-i-tell-if-a-server-has-rebooted.aspx |title=How Can I Tell if a Server has Rebooted? - Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blogs.technet.com/heyscriptingguy/archive/2005/08/02/how-can-i-determine-the-uptime-for-a-server.aspx |title=How Can I Determine the Uptime for a Server? - Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Using Windows Task Manager====
{{Main|Windows Task Manager}}
[[Image:Win7-tskman-perf.png|thumb|alt=Windows 7 Task Manager Performance tab screenshot.|[[Windows 7]] [[Windows Task Manager|Task Manager]] Performance tab [[screenshot]].]]
Users of [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8]] can see uptime in [[Windows Task Manager]] under the tab Performance. The uptime format is DD:HH:MM:SS

=== FreeDOS ===
The &lt;code&gt;uptime&lt;/code&gt; command is also available for [[FreeDOS]]. The version was developed by M. Aitchison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/repos/pkg-html/uptime.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;span id="coreutils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Linux ===

====Using uptime====
Users of [[Linux]] systems can use the BSD uptime utility, which also displays the system load averages for the past 1, 5 and 15 minute intervals:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ uptime
  18:17:07 up 68 days,  3:57,  6 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.07, 0.06
&lt;/source&gt;

====Using /proc/uptime====
Shows how long the system has been on since it was last restarted:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ cat /proc/uptime
  350735.47 234388.90
&lt;/source&gt;

The first number is the total number of seconds the system has been up. The second number is how much of that time the machine has spent idle, in seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/en-US/Reference_Guide/s2-proc-uptime.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316181615/http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/en-US/Reference_Guide/s2-proc-uptime.html |date=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On multi core systems (and some linux versions) the second number is the sum of the idle time accumulated by each CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/5/11/35 |title=Martin Schwidefsky: Re: [PATCH&amp;#93; Re: /proc/uptime idle counter remains at 0 |publisher=LKML |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BSD ===

====Using uptime====
[[BSD]]-based operating systems such as [[FreeBSD]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[UNIX System V#SVR4|SySVr4]] have the ''uptime'' command (See {{man|1|uptime|FreeBSD}}).
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ uptime
3:01AM  up 69 days,  7:53, 0 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.07, 0.05
&lt;/source&gt;

====Using sysctl====
There is also a method of using ''sysctl'' to call the system's last boot time:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/sysctl.8.html |title=Mac Developer Library |publisher=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ sysctl kern.boottime
kern.boottime: { sec = 1271934886, usec = 667779 } Thu Apr 22 12:14:46 2010
&lt;/source&gt;

=== OpenVMS ===
Users of [[OpenVMS]] systems can type &lt;tt&gt;show system&lt;/tt&gt; at the [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL command prompt]]; the header (first) line of the resulting display includes the system's uptime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parsec.com/openvms/undocumented.php?page=9 |title=OpenVMS Undocumented Features |publisher=Parsec.com |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ show system/noprocess
OpenVMS V7.3-2 on node JACK 29-JAN-2008 16:32:04.67  Uptime  894 22:28:52
&lt;/source&gt;

The uptime is displayed following the &lt;tt&gt;Uptime&lt;/tt&gt; label as days followed by hours:minutes:seconds. In this example, the command qualifier &lt;tt&gt;/noprocess&lt;/tt&gt; simply suppresses the display of per-process detail lines of information.

{{Nihongo|'''''Visco Corporation'''''|株式会社ビスコ}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[software]] company located in, Japan.  It was founded in {{vgy|1982}} by {{nihongo|Tetsuo Akiyama|秋山　哲雄|Akiyama Tetsuo}}, and later became corporate on August 8, {{vgy|1983}} while revealing itself as "Visco" in Japan. They originally developed video games for several platforms from the [[Arcade game|arcade]]s and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], to the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Neo Geo]] in the past. When Visco was one of the companies under the [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] umbrella, some of its titles back then were labeled "Taito". They also teamed up with [[Seta Corporation|Seta]] and [[Sammy Corporation|Sammy]] in developing arcade games powered by the SSV ('''S'''ammy, '''S'''eta and '''V'''isco) [[arcade system board]], until Sammy fully acquired noted game company [[Sega]] under a new company titled [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] in 2004, while Seta's parent company [[Aruze]] announced in December 2008 that Seta decided to close their doors after 23 years of existence. Therefore, the SSV board was no longer being produced. In 2008, Visco began manufacturering [[slot machine]]s for [[casino]]s mostly in other southeast Asian regions. Visco also produced flat screen [[LCD television]]s, which have been sold at major retailers such as [[Walmart]].

Lawrence graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1981. A distinguished flight school graduate, she was designated as a [[Naval Aviator]] in July 1982. Lawrence has more than 1,500 hours of flight time in six different types of [[helicopters]] and has made more than 800 shipboard landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lawrence.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Wendy B. Lawrence (8/2006)|website=www.jsc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; While assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 6 ([[HSC-26|HC-6]]), she was one of the first two female helicopter pilots to make a long deployment to the [[Indian Ocean]] as part of a [[carrier battle group]]. After completion of a master's degree program at MIT and Woods Hole in 1988, she was assigned to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 30 ([[HSL-30]]) as Officer-in-charge of Detachment Alpha. In October 1990, Lawrence reported to the U.S. Naval Academy where she served as a [[physics]] instructor and the novice women’s [[rowing (sport)|crew]] coach.

==NASA career==
[[File:WendyLawrenceTiles.jpg |thumb|Captain Lawrence inspects Space Shuttle tiles (Oct 2003)]]

Selected by [[NASA]] in March 1992, Lawrence reported to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 1992. She completed one year of training and was qualified for flight assignment as a Mission Specialist. Her technical assignments within the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL), Astronaut Office Assistant Training Officer, and Astronaut Office representative for Space Station training and crew support. She flew as the ascent/entry [[flight engineer]] and blue shift orbit pilot on [[STS-67]] (March 2–18, 1995). She next served as Director of Operations for NASA at the [[Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]] in [[Star City, Russia]], with responsibility for the coordination and implementation of mission operations activities in the [[Moscow]] region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. In September 1996 she began training as a crew member for a 4-month mission on the Russian Space Station [[Mir]]. However, she was replaced by [[David Wolf (astronaut)|David Wolf]] due to concerns over minimum size requirements for the Russian [[Orlan space suit|Orlan]] EVA suit. Because of her knowledge and experience with Mir systems and with crew transfer logistics for the Mir, she flew on [[STS-86]] (September 25 to October 6, 1997) and [[STS-91]] (June 2–12, 1998). A veteran of four [[space flight]]s, she logged over 1,200 hours in space. Lawrence was a Mission Specialist on the crew of [[STS-114]]. She was in charge of the transfer of supplies and equipment and operated the Space Station robotic arm on the Return To Flight mission during which the crew tested and evaluated new procedures for the inspection and repair of the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]]. The mission launched on July 26, 2005 and landed on August 9, 2005.

During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.

[[STS-86]] ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' (September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the exchange of U.S. crew members [[Michael Foale|Mike Foale]] and [[David Wolf (astronaut)|David Wolf]], a spacewalk by [[Scott Parazynski]] and [[Vladimir Titov]] to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the [[STS-76]] docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.

[[STS-91]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' (June 2–12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission and marked the conclusion of the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.

[[STS-114]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' (July 26 – August 9, 2005) was the first "Return to Flight" mission following the Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster. Highlights included the first in-flight repair to the orbiter during a [[spacewalk]].  Mission duration was 333 hours, 33 minutes.

A '''zero-energy building''', also known as a '''zero net energy''' ('''ZNE''') building, '''net-zero energy building''' ('''NZEB'''), '''net zero building or zero-carbon building''' is a [[building]] with zero net [[energy consumption]], meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of [[renewable energy]] created on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|title=Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition Paul Torcellini, Shanti Pless, Michael Deru National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Drury Crawley, U.S. Department of Energy.

Shanti Pless and Paul Torcellini. National Renewable Energy Laboratory report: NREL/TP-5500-44586, June 2010.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These buildings consequently contribute less overall [[greenhouse gas]] to the atmosphere than similar non-ZNE buildings.  They do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce [[greenhouse gases]], but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount. A similar concept approved and implemented by the [[European Union]] and other agreeing countries is '''nearly Zero Energy Building''' ('''nZEB'''), with the goal of having all buildings in the region under nZEB standards by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nearly Zero Energy Buildings|publisher= European Union |url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings/nearly-zero-energy-buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Most zero net energy buildings get half or more of their energy from the [[power grid|grid]], and return the same amount at other times.  Buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called "[[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus buildings]]" and buildings that consume slightly more energy than they produce are called "near-zero energy buildings" or "ultra-[[low energy house]]s".

Traditional buildings consume 40% of the total [[fossil fuel]] energy in the US and European Union and are significant contributors of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;Baden, S., et al., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-PF-396-06.pdf "Hurdling Financial Barriers to Lower Energy Buildings: Experiences from the USA and Europe on Financial Incentives and Monetizing Building Energy Savings in Private Investment Decisions."] ''Proceedings of 2006 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings,'' American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Washington DC, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/contents.html ''Annual Energy Review 2006''] 27 June 2007. Accessed 27 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The zero net energy consumption principle is viewed as a means to reduce [[carbon dioxide|carbon emissions]] and reduce dependence on [[fossil fuel]]s and although zero-energy buildings remain uncommon even in [[Developed country|developed countries]], they are gaining importance and popularity. To read about recent examples of newly built houses with zero net energy use and examples of renovated existing houses with a zero net energy use see [[Zero carbon housing|here]]. 

Most zero-energy buildings use the [[electrical grid]] for [[energy storage]] but some are independent of the grid. Energy is usually harvested on-site through energy producing technologies like solar and wind, while reducing the overall use of energy with highly efficient [[HVAC]] and lighting technologies. The zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil fuels increase.

The development of modern zero-energy buildings became possible largely through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and techniques. These include highly insulating spray-foam insulation, high-efficiency solar panels, high-efficiency heat pumps and highly insulating low-E triple-glazed windows.  These innovations have  also been significantly improved by academic research, which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs. 

Zero-energy buildings can be part of a [[smart grid]]. Some advantages of these buildings are as follows:

* Integration of renewable energy resources
* Integration of [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s &amp;ndash; called [[vehicle-to-grid]]
* Implementation of zero-energy concepts

Although the net zero concept is applicable to a wide range of resources such as energy, water and [[zero waste|waste]]. Energy is usually the first resource to be targeted because:

*Energy, particularly electricity and heating fuel like natural gas or heating oil, is expensive. Hence reducing energy use can save the building owner money. In contrast, water and waste are inexpensive.
*Energy, particularly electricity and heating fuel, has a high carbon footprint. Hence reducing energy use is a major way to reduce the building's carbon footprint
* There are well-established means to significantly reduce the energy use and carbon footprint of buildings. These include: adding insulation, using heat pumps instead of furnaces, using low-E double or triple glazed windows and adding solar panels to the roof. 
*There are government sponsored subsidies and tax breaks for installing heat pumps, solar panels, triple-glazed windows and insulation that greatly reduce the cost of getting to a net-zero energy building for the building owner. For instance in the U.S., there are federal tax credits for solar panels, state incentives (which vary by state but are listed [http://www.dsireusa.org here]) for solar panels, heat pumps and highly insulating triple-glazed windows. Some states, such as Massachusetts, also offer zero-interest or low-interest loans to allow building owners to purchase heat pumps, solar panels and triple-glazed windows that they otherwise could not afford. The cost of getting an existing house to net-zero energy has been reported as being 5-10% of the value of the house. A 15% return on investment has been reported. See [https://greenzerocarbonhome.com/2018/06/how-much-money-did-we-save-and-how-much-carbon-dioxide-did-we-cut/ here]  for details. 

==Definitions==
Despite sharing the name "zero net energy", there are several definitions of what the term means in practice, with a particular difference in usage between North America and Europe.&lt;ref name=zebdef&gt;{{cite web |first1=P. |last1=Torcellini |first2=S. |last2=Pless |first3=M. |last3=Deru |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf |title=Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=June 2006 |accessdate=June 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Zero net site energy use:  In this type of ZNE, the amount of energy provided by on-site [[renewable energy]] sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building.  In the United States, “zero net energy building” generally refers to this type of building.

; Zero net source energy use:  This ZNE generates the same amount of energy as is used, including the energy used to transport the energy to the building.  This type accounts for energy losses during [[electricity generation]] and [[Electric power transmission|transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;US DOE 2015 [https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/09/f26/A%20Common%20Definition%20for%20Zero%20Energy%20Buildings.pdf A Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;  These ZNEs must generate more electricity than zero net site energy buildings.

; Net zero energy emissions: Outside the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a ZEB is generally defined as one with zero net energy emissions, also known as a ''zero carbon building'' or ''zero emissions building''. Under this definition the [[carbon emissions]] generated from on-site or off-site fossil fuel use are balanced by the amount of on-site [[renewable energy]] production.  Other definitions include not only the carbon emissions generated by the building in use, but also those generated in the construction of the building and the [[embodied energy]] of the structure.  Others debate whether the carbon emissions of [[commuting]] to and from the building should also be included in the calculation.Recent work in New Zealand has initiated an approach to include building user transport energy within zero energy building frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Housing and Transportation: Towards a Multi-scale Net Zero Emission Housing Approach for Residential Buildings in New Zealand|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610215013284|journal = Energy Procedia|date = 2015-08-01|pages = 2826–2832|volume = 75|series = Clean, Efficient and Affordable Energy for a Sustainable Future: The 7th International Conference on Applied Energy (ICAE2015)|doi = 10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.560|first = Dekhani|last = Nsaliwa|first2 = Robert|last2 = Vale|first3 = Nigel|last3 = Isaacs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Net zero cost:  In this type of building, the cost of purchasing energy is balanced by income from sales of electricity to the grid of electricity generated on-site. Such a status depends on how a utility credits net electricity generation and the utility rate structure the building uses.

; Net off-site zero energy use:  A building may be considered a ZEB if 100% of the energy it purchases comes from renewable energy sources, even if the energy is generated off the site.

; Off-the-grid:[[Off-the-grid]] buildings are stand-alone ZEBs that are not connected to an off-site energy utility facility. They require [[distributed generation|distributed renewable energy generation]] and energy storage capability (for when the sun is not shining, wind is not blowing, etc.).  An energy [[Autarky|autarkic]] house is a building concept where the balance of the own energy consumption and production can be made on an hourly or even smaller basis. Energy autarkic houses can be taken off-the-grid.

; Net zero-energy building: Based on scientific analysis within the joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings”&lt;ref name="Task40_Annex52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://task40.iea-shc.org/ |title=Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings |work=International Energy Agency: Solar Heating and Cooling Programme |year=2014 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a methodological framework was set up which allows different definitions, in accordance with country’s political targets, specific (climate) conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions: The overall conceptual understanding of a Net ZEB is an energy efficient, grid connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand (see figure 1[[File:Net ZEB balance concept.png|thumbnail|right|Figure 1: The Net ZEB balance concept: balance of weighted energy import respectively energy demand (x-axis) and energy export (feed-in credits) respectively (on-site) generation (y-axis)]]).&lt;br/&gt;The wording “Net” emphasizes the energy exchange between the building and the energy infrastructure. By the building-grid interaction, the Net ZEBs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure. This connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings. The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament and the Council of the EU (16.06.2010): Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD 2010), Article 9: Member States shall ensure that: (a) by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero- energy buildings; and (b) after 31 December 2018, new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are nearly zero-energy buildings&lt;/ref&gt; evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.&lt;ref&gt;Salom, Jaume; Widen, Joakim; Candanedo, Jose A.; Sartori, Igor; Voss, Karsten; Marszal, Anna Joanna (2011): Understanding Net Zero Energy Buildings: Evaluation of Load Matching and Grid Interaction Indicators. Proceedings of Building Simulation 2011: 12th Conference of International Building Performance Simulation Association. Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this balance procedure several aspects and explicit choices have to be determined:
* The building system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even off-site, see&lt;ref&gt;Marszal, Anna Joanna; Heiselberg, Per; Bourelle, Julien; Musall, Eike; Voss, Karsten; Sartori, Igor; Napolitano, Assunta (2011): Zero Energy Building – A Review of definitions and calculation methodologies. In: Energy and Buildings 43 (4), pages 971–979&lt;/ref&gt;) respectively how many buildings are included in the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, central services, electric vehicles, and embodied energy, etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.
* The weighting system converts the physical units of different energy carriers into a uniform metric (site/final energy, source/primary energy renewable parts included or not, energy cost, equivalent carbon emissions and even energy or environmental credits) and allows their comparison and compensation among each other in one single balance (e.g. exported PV electricity can compensate imported biomass). Politically influenced and therefore possibly asymmetrically or time dependent conversion/weighting factors can affect the relative value of energy carriers and can influence the required energy generation capacity.
* The balancing period is often assumed to be one year (suitable to cover all operation energy uses). A shorter period (monthly or seasonal) could also be considered as well as a balance over the entire life cycle (including embodied energy, which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses).
* The energy balance can be done in two balance types: 1) Balance of delivered/imported and exported energy (monitoring phase as self-consumption of energy generated on-site can be included); 2) Balance between (weighted) energy demand and (weighted) energy generation (for design phase as normally end users temporal consumption patterns -e.g. for lighting, appliances, etc.- are lacking). Alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable. This can be seen either as a load/generation balance or as a special case of import/export balance where a “virtual monthly self-consumption” is assumed (see figure 2 [[File:Different types of balance.png|thumbnail|right|Figure 2: The Net ZEB balance concept: Graphical representation of the different types of balance: import/export balance between weighted exported and delivered energy, load/generation balance between weighted generation and load, and monthly net balance between weighted monthly net values of generation and load]] and compare&lt;ref name="Consistent Definition Framework"&gt;Sartori, Igor; Napolitano, Assunta; Voss, Karsten (2012): Net Zero Energy Buildings: A Consistent Definition Framework. In: Energy and Buildings (48), pages 220–232&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Beside the energy balance, Net ZEBs can be characterized by their ability to match the building's load by its energy generation (load matching) or to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grid infrastructure (grind interaction). Both can be expressed by suitable indicators which are intended as assessment tools only.

The most cost-effective steps toward a reduction in a building's energy consumption usually occur during the design process.&lt;ref name=energypyr&gt;Vieira, R., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-PF-401-06/ "The Energy Policy Pyramid – A Hierarchal Tool For Decision Makers".], Fifteenth Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates, July 24–26, 2006 Orlando, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve efficient energy use, zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice. Successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested [[passive solar]], or artificial/fake conditioning, principles that work with the on-site assets. Sunlight and solar heat, prevailing breezes, and the cool of the earth below a building, can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means. ZEBs are normally optimized to use [[passive solar]] heat gain and shading, combined with [[thermal mass]] to stabilize [[diurnal temperature variation]]s throughout the day, and in most climates are [[superinsulation|superinsulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Frej| first = Anne, editor| title = Green Office Buildings: A Practical Guide to Development| publisher = Urban Land Institute| year = 2005| pages = 138–142| isbn = 978-0-87420-937-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] today.

Sophisticated 3-D [[building energy simulation]] tools are available to model how a building will perform with a range of design variables such as building orientation (relative to the daily and seasonal position of the [[sun]]), window and door type and placement, overhang depth, insulation type and values of the building elements, air tightness ([[weatherization]]), the efficiency of heating, cooling, lighting and other equipment, as well as local climate. These simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built, and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building [[cost benefit analysis]], or even more appropriate – life cycle assessment.

Zero-energy buildings are built with significant [[energy-saving]] features.  The [[heating]] and cooling loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment (such as heat pumps rather than furnaces. Heat pumps are about four times as efficient as furnaces) added [[building insulation|insulation]] (especially in the attic and in the basement of houses), high-efficiency windows (such as low-E triple-glazed windows), draft-proofing, high efficiency appliances (particularly modern high-efficiency refrigerators), high-efficiency LED lighting, passive solar gain in winter and passive shading in the summer, natural [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and other techniques.  These features vary depending on [[climate zone]]s in which the construction occurs.  Water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures, [[heat recovery]] units on waste water, and by using solar water heating, and high-efficiency water heating equipment.  In addition, [[daylighting]] with [[Skylight (window)|skylights]] or solartubes can provide 100% of daytime illumination within the home. Nighttime illumination is typically done with [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] and [[LED lamp|LED]] lighting that use 1/3 or less power than incandescent lights, without adding unwanted heat. And [[miscellaneous electric loads]] can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or [[standby power]]. Other techniques to reach net zero (dependent on climate) are [[Earth sheltered building]] principles, superinsulation walls using [[straw-bale construction]], Vitruvianbuilt pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading.

Once the energy use of the building has been minimized it can be possible to generate all that energy on site using roof-mounted solar panels. See examples of zero net energy houses [[Zero carbon housing|here]].

Zero-energy buildings are often designed to make dual use of energy including that from [[white goods]]. For example using [[refrigerator]] exhaust to heat domestic water, ventilation air and shower drain [[heat exchanger]]s, office machines and computer servers, and body heat to heat the building.  These buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings may exhaust outside. They may use [[heat recovery ventilation]], [[hot water heat recycling]], [[combined heat and power]], and [[absorption chiller]] units.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Energy harvest==
ZEBs harvest available energy to meet their electricity and heating or cooling needs. By far the most common way to harvest energy is to use roof-mounted solar photovoltaic panels that turn the sun's light into electricity.  Energy can also be harvested with solar thermal collectors (which use the sun's heat to heat water for the building). Heat pumps either ground-source (otherwise known as geothermal) or air-sourced can also harvest heat and cool from the air or ground near the building. Technically heat pumps move heat rather than harvest it, but the overall effect in terms of reduced energy use and reduced carbon footprint is similar. In the case of individual houses, various [[microgeneration]] technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building,  using [[solar cell]]s or [[wind turbine]]s for electricity, and [[biofuel]]s or [[solar thermal collector]]s linked to a [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) for space heating. An STES can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground. To cope with fluctuations in demand, zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the [[electricity grid]], export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus, and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced.&lt;ref name=zebdef/&gt; Other buildings may be fully [[autonomous building|autonomous]].

[[Energy harvesting]] is most often more effective (in cost and resource utilization) when done on a local but combined scale, for example, a group of houses, [[cohousing]], local district, village, etc. rather than an individual basis.  An energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of [[electrical transmission]] and [[electricity distribution]] losses. On-site energy harvesting such as with roof top mounted solar panels eliminates these transmission losses entirely. These losses amount to about 7.2%–7.4% of the energy transferred.&lt;ref&gt;Powerwatch. [http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/energy/graham.asp Domestic Energy Use in the UK.] 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy harvesting in [[commerce|commercial]] and [[Industry|industrial]] applications should benefit from the [[topography]] of each location. However, a site that is free of shade can generate large amounts of solar powered electricity from the building's roof and almost any site can use geothermal or air-sourced heat pumps.  The production of goods under net zero fossil energy consumption requires locations of [[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[microhydro]], [[Solar energy|solar]], and [[wind]] resources to sustain the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment-ecology.com/energy-and-architecture/152-zero-energy-buildings.html |title=Zero-Energy Buildings }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero-energy neighborhoods, such as the [[BedZED]] development in the [[United Kingdom]], and those that are spreading rapidly in [[California]] and [[China]], may use [[distributed generation]] schemes. This may in some cases include [[district heating]], community chilled water, shared wind turbines, etc. There are current plans to use ZEB technologies to build entire off-the-grid or net zero energy use cities.

===The "energy harvest" versus "energy conservation" debate===
One of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between [[energy conservation]] and the distributed point-of-use harvesting of [[renewable energy]] ([[solar energy]], [[wind energy]] and [[thermal energy]]). Most zero energy homes use a combination of these strategies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

As a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems, wind turbines, etc., there are those who suggest that a ZEB is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy harvesting technologies. Entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations where photovoltaic (PV) subsidies are significant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/ Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency (DSIRE) Home.] 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but many so called "Zero Energy Homes" still have utility bills. This type of energy harvesting without added energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current price of electricity generated with photovoltaic equipment (depending on the local price of power company electricity),&lt;ref name=zebeconomics&gt;P. Eiffert. [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/31977.pdf Guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Building-Integrated Photovoltaic Power Systems]. Prepared for [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;. The cost, energy and carbon-footprint savings from conservation (e.g., added insulation, triple-glazed windows and heat pumps) compared to those from on-site energy generation (e.g., solar panels) have been published for an upgrade to an existing house [https://greenzerocarbonhome.com/2018/06/how-much-money-did-we-save-and-how-much-carbon-dioxide-did-we-cut/ here].

Since the 1980s, [[passive solar building design]] and [[passive house]] have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, this can be accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;Spiegel, Jan Allen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/20Rgreen.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=energy%20star&amp;st=nyt&amp;scp=14 "The House that Green Built."] ''New York Times''. 20 April 2008. Last retrieved: 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building.&lt;ref name=zebeconomics/&gt; A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A {{convert|100000|BTU|MJ|abbr=on}} high [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7&amp;nbsp;kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for [[off-the-grid]] night-time operation. [[Passive cooling]], and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.

===Occupant behavior===
The energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants. The acceptance of what is considered comfortable varies widely. Studies of identical homes have shown dramatic differences in energy use in a variety of climates. An average widely accepted ratio of highest to lowest energy consumer in identical homes is about 3, with some identical homes using up to 20 times as much heating energy as the others &lt;ref&gt;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13796708.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming [[thermostat]]s, varying levels of [[over-illumination|illumination]] and hot water use, window and shading system operation and the amount of [[miscellaneous electric load|miscellaneous electric devices]] or [[plug load]]s used.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Energy Pyramid Ref&lt;/ref&gt;

== Utility concerns ==
Utility companies are typically legally responsible for maintaining the electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities, neighborhoods, and individual buildings. Utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel, and in some cases own electrical infrastructure on private land as well. Utilities have expressed concern that the use of Net Metering for ZNE projects threatens the Utilities base revenue, which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for. Utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain Net Metering laws may saddle non-ZNE homes with higher utility costs, as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while ZNE home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve ZNE status. This creates potential equity issues, as currently, the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households. A possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid, which would force ZNE home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use.

Additional concerns exist that local distribution as well as larger transmission grids have not been designed to convey electricity in two directions, which may be necessary as higher levels of distributed energy generation come on line. Overcoming this barrier could require extensive upgrades to the electrical grid, however this is not believed to be a major problem until renewable generation reaches much higher levels of penetration than currently realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greeneconomypost.com/renewable-energy-variability-problem-12006.htm|title=Renewable Energy Has a Variability Problem|date=2010-11-30|website=The Green Economy Post: Green Careers, Green Business, Sustainability|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development efforts==
Wide acceptance of zero-energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations, the development of recognized standards, or significant increases in the cost of conventional energy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Google photovoltaic campus and the Microsoft 480-kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on U.S. Federal, and especially California, subsidies and financial incentives. California is now providing US$3.2 billion in subsidies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/|title=Go Solar California|website=www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings.

Their first report, a survey of key players in real estate and construction, indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by 300 percent. Survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are 19 percent of the worldwide total, in contrast to the actual value of roughly 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council for Sustainable Development, August 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165247/http://wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MjU5MTI/ ''Energy Efficiency in Buildings: Business Realities and Opportunities''] Retrieved: 2007-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influential zero-energy and low-energy buildings===
Those who commissioned construction of passive houses and zero-energy homes (over the last three decades) were essential to iterative, incremental, cutting-edge, technology innovations. Much has been learned from many significant successes, and a few expensive failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goyal|first1=K. K.|title=Renewable Energy|date=July 14, 2009|publisher=Mahaveer &amp; Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-8377-243-3|page=Influential Zero-and Low-Energy Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeak-3vlaRQC&amp;pg=PT175&amp;lpg=PT175&amp;dq=Those+who+commissioned+construction+of+passive+houses+and+zero-energy+homes+(over+the+last+three+decades)+were+essential+to+iterative,+incremental,+cutting-edge,+technology+innovations.+Much+has+been+learned+from+many+significant+successes,+and+a+few+expensive+failures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rtd2TJefEq&amp;sig=Xf5O0ZkjA87EFP3x4BPqHJCYHa4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIoO-at_mAyAIVgtkeCh0GMAKS#v=onepage&amp;q=Those%20who%20commissioned%20construction%20of%20passive%20houses%20and%20zero-energy%20homes%20(over%20the%20last%20three%20decades)%20were%20essential%20to%20iterative%2C%20incremental%2C%20cutting-edge%2C%20technology%20innovations.%20Much%20has%20been%20learned%20from%20many%20significant%20successes%2C%20and%20a%20few%20expensive%20failures&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zero-energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other [[low-energy building]] designs. Among these, the Canadian [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] and the [[Germany|German]] ''[[passive house]]'' standards have been internationally influential. Collaborative government demonstration projects, such as the superinsulated Saskatchewan House, and the [[International Energy Agency|International Energy Agency's]] ''[[IEA Task 13|Task 13]]'', have also played their part.

===Net Zero Energy Building Definition===
The U.S. [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) published a groundbreaking report titled Net-Zero Energy Buildings: A Classification System Based on Renewable Energy Supply Options.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This is the first report to lay out a full spectrum classification system for Net Zero/Renewable Energy buildings that includes the full spectrum of Clean Energy sources, both on site and off site.  This classification system identifies the following 4 main categories of Net Zero Energy Buildings/Sites/Campuses:
*NZEB:A &amp;mdash; A footprint renewables Net Zero Energy Building
*NZEB:B &amp;mdash; A site renewables Net Zero Energy Building
*NZEB:C &amp;mdash; An imported renewables Net Zero Energy Building
*NZEB:D &amp;mdash; An off-site purchased renewables Net Zero Energy Building
Applying this U.S. Government Net Zero classification system means that every building "can" become Net Zero with the right combination of the key Net Zero Technologies - PV (solar), GHP (geothermal heating and cooling, thermal batteries), EE (energy efficiency), sometimes Wind, and Electric Batteries.  A graphical exposé of the scale of impact of applying these NREL guidelines for Net Zero can be seen in the graphic at Net Zero Foundation titled "Net Zero Effect on U.S. Total Energy Use"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netzerofoundation.org/|title=Net Zero Foundation|website=netzerofoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a possible 39% U.S. total fossil fuel use reduction by changing U.S. Residential and Commercial buildings to Net Zero, 37% savings if we still use Nat. Gas for cooking at the same level.

===Net Zero Carbon Conversion Example===
Many well known universities have professed to want to completely convert their energy systems off of fossil fuels.  The very idea that one could convert a whole campus off of fossil fuels has to date only been theoretical.  Capitalizing on the continuing developments in both [[Photovoltaics]] and [[Geothermal heat pump]] technologies, and in the advancing [[Battery (electricity)|Electric Battery]] field, complete conversion to a carbon free energy solution is now possible.  An example of this is in the Net Zero Foundation's proposal at MIT to take that campus completely off fossil fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatecolab.org/contests/2016/mit-climate-mitigation-solutions/c/proposal/1329510|title=100% Net Zero Carbon Plan, 60% NZ Effectively Free, Expert Team Ready! - MIT Climate Mitigation Solutions 2016 - Climate CoLab|website=Climate CoLab}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposal shows the coming application of Net Zero Energy Buildings technologies at the [[Distributed generation|District Energy]] scale.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
* isolation for building owners from future energy price increases
* increased comfort due to more-uniform interior temperatures (this can be demonstrated with comparative [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] maps)
* reduced requirement for energy [[austerity]]
* reduced [[total cost of ownership]] due to improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]
* reduced total net monthly [[cost of living]]
* reduced risk of loss from grid blackouts
* improved reliability – photovoltaic systems have 25-year warranties and seldom fail during weather problems – the 1982 photovoltaic systems on the Walt Disney World EPCOT Energy Pavilion are still working fine today, after going through three recent hurricanes
* extra cost is minimized for new construction compared to an afterthought retrofit
* higher resale value as potential owners demand more ZEBs than available supply
* the value of a ZEB building relative to similar conventional building should increase every time energy costs increase
* future legislative restrictions, and carbon emission taxes/penalties may force expensive retrofits to inefficient buildings
* contribute to the greater benefits of the society, e.g. providing sustainable renewable energy to the grid, reducing the need of grid expansion

===Disadvantages===
* initial costs can be higher – effort required to understand, apply, and qualify for ZEB subsidies, if they exist.
* very few designers or builders have the necessary skills or experience to build ZEBs&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;
* possible declines in future utility company renewable energy costs may lessen the value of capital invested in energy efficiency
* new [[photovoltaic]] [[solar cells]] equipment technology price has been falling at roughly 17% per year – It will lessen the value of capital invested in a solar electric generating system – Current subsidies will be phased out as photovoltaic mass production lowers future price
* challenge to recover higher initial costs on resale of building, but new energy rating systems are being introduced gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingenergyireland.ie/ |title=Building Energy Rating Ireland |publisher=Buildingenergyireland.ie |date= |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* while the individual house may use an average of net zero energy over a year, it may demand energy at the time when peak demand for the grid occurs.  In such a case, the capacity of the grid must still provide electricity to all loads.  Therefore, a ZEB may not reduce the required power plant capacity.
* without an optimised thermal envelope the embodied energy, heating and cooling energy and resource usage is higher than needed. ZEB by definition do not mandate a minimum heating and cooling performance level thus allowing oversized renewable energy systems to fill the energy gap.
* solar energy capture using the house envelope only works in locations unobstructed from the sun. The solar energy capture cannot be optimized in north (for northern hemisphere, or south for southern Hemisphere) facing shade, or wooded surroundings.

===Zero energy building versus green building===
The goal of [[green building]] and [[sustainable architecture]] is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a building's negative impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/greenbuilding/pubs/about.htm "Green Building,"] 16 Apr. 2008.  Accessed on: 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero energy buildings achieve one key green-building goal of completely or very significantly reducing energy use and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for the life of the building. Zero energy buildings may or may not be considered "green" in all areas, such as reducing waste, using [[recycling|recycled]] building materials, etc.  However, zero energy, or net-zero buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other "green" buildings that require imported energy and/or fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants.

Because of the design challenges and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), designers must apply holistic design principles, and take advantage of the free naturally occurring assets available, such as passive solar orientation, natural ventilation, daylighting, thermal mass, and night time cooling.

====Certification====
Many [[green building]] certification programs do not require a building to have net zero energy use, only to reduce energy use a few percentage points below the minimum required by law. Green Globes involves check lists that are measurement tools, not design tools. Inexperienced designers or architects may cherry-pick points to meet a target certification level, even though those points may not be the best design choices for a specific building or climate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  In November, 2011, the International Living Future Institute (ILFI) developed the Net Zero Energy Building Certification. In 2017, the ILFI simplified the certification program and renamed it Zero Energy Building Certification.

==Worldwide==

===International initiatives===
Between 2008 and 2013, researchers from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA were working together in the joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings” under the umbrella of International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar Heating and Cooling Program (SHC) Task 40 / Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC, formerly ECBCS) Annex 52&lt;ref name="Task40_Annex52" /&gt; in order to bring the Net ZEB concept to market viability. The joint international research and demonstration activities are divided in subtasks. The objective is to develop a common understanding, a harmonized international applicable definition framework (Subtask A, see definitions methodology “Net Zero Energy Building” above), design process tools (Subtask B), advanced building design and technology solutions and industry guidelines for Net ZEBs (Subtask C). The scope encompasses new and existing residential and non-residential buildings located within the climatic zones of the participating countries.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], researchers have recently developed a new approach to the construction of visually-clear solar energy harvesting windows suitable for industrialization and applications in net-zero energy buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, M. et al. Photonic microstructures for energy-generating clear glass and net-zero energy buildings. Sci. Rep. 6, 31831; doi: 10.1038/srep31831 (2016). &lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production of several prototype batches of solar windows has started in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tu_qG21R08|title=ClearVue power generating glass 5 fans|first=|last=Victor Rosenberg|date=24 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the December 2017, the State of Queensland has more than 30% of households with rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The average size of Australian rooftop solar PV system has exceeded 3.5kW. In Brisbane (capital city of Queensland), households with 6kW rooftop PV system and reasonable energy rating (5~6 stars for Australian National House Energy Rating NatHERS) can achieve net zero total energy target or even positive energy&lt;ref&gt;W.

In 2012 [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]], [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] and [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)]] summarized the road map for Low-carbon Society which contains the goal of ZEH and ZEB to be standard of new construction in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standard-project.net/smarthouse/zeh.html|title=ゼロエネルギー住宅（ZEH）とは|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

* In December 2017, the [[BC Energy Step Code]] entered into legal force in British Columbia. Local British Columbia governments may use the standard to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

* In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/BuildSmart-infographic_EN_accessible.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy. The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of Canadian buildings in pursuit of a net zero energy ready level of performance.

The [[buildABILITY Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://buildability.ca/work/ecoenergy-innovation-initiative-with-owens-corning/&lt;/ref&gt; project management team will be working to assess and resolve challenges in relation to site planning, construction, equipment, grid connections, cost, trade capability, warranty, reliability, sales, marketing, and homebuyer information/education. Five home builders across four provinces will build at least 25 Net Zero Energy (NZE) homes by March 2016 as part of this project. The five selected builders participating in this initiative are: Mattamy Homes Limited (Calgary, Alberta); Construction Voyer (Laval, Quebec); Minto Communities (Ottawa, Ontario); Provident Development Inc.

====Energy Free Home Challenge====
In 2007, the philanthropic [[Siebel Foundation]] created the Energy Free Home Foundation. The goal was to offer $20 million in global incentive prizes to design and build a 2,000 square foot (186 square meter) three-bedroom, two bathroom home with (1) net-zero annual utility bills that also has (2) high market appeal, and (3) costs no more than a conventional home to construct.&lt;ref&gt;Goals of the Siebel Foundation Energy Free Home Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan included funding to build the top ten entries at $250,000 each, a $10 million first prize, and then a total of 100 such homes to be built and sold to the public.

Beginning in 2009, [[Thomas Siebel]] made many presentations about his Energy Free Home Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.forbes.com/fvn/tech/zero-energy-homes|title=Forbes Video|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siebel Foundation Report stated that the Energy Free Home Challenge was "Launching in late 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvgroup.com/Siebel_08AR_web.pdf|title=2008 Siebel Foundation Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''California'''

* The State of California has proposed that all new low- and mid-rise residential buildings, and all new commercial buildings, be designed and constructed to ZNE standards beginning in 2020 and 2030, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/uploadedFiles/CPUC_Public_Website/Content/Utilities_and_Industries/Energy/Energy_Programs/Demand_Side_Management/EE_and_Energy_Savings_Assist/ZNERESACTIONPLAN_FINAL_060815.pdf|title=California Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=California Energy Commission|access-date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=4125|title=Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan|website=www.cpuc.ca.gov|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements, if implemented, will be promulgated via the California Building Code, which is updated on a three-year cycle and which currently mandates some of the highest energy efficiency standards in the United States. California is anticipated to further increase efficiency requirements by 2020, thus avoiding the trends discussed above of building standard housing and achieving ZNE by adding large amounts of renewables. The California Energy Commission is required to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove that new regulations create a net benefit for residents of the state. There has yet to be publicly released analysis of the impact that ZNE standards may have to construction, real estate, and energy prices in the state. Debate exists as to if the state's stringent efficiency requirements are directly responsible for the apparent "flatlining" of residential electricity use in the state since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|date=2013-01-01|title=California Energy Efficiency: Lessons for the Rest of the World, or Not?|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/geo/guwopa/gueconwpa~13-13-03.html|publisher=Georgetown University, Department of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is relevant to ZNE codes, as it remains to be seen via models or in practice what overall effect the proliferation of ZNE buildings will have on overall electricity use in the state, and at what cost.
* West Village, located on the [[University of California, Davis|University of California campus in Davis, California]], was the largest ZNE-planned community in North America at the time of its opening in 2014.&lt;ref name="Home {{!}} UC Davis West Village"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westvillage.ucdavis.edu|title=Home {{!}} UC Davis West Village|website=westvillage.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 UC Davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center, pool, gym, restaurant and convenience store. Office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related University programs. The project was a public-private partnership between the university and West Village Community Partnership LLC, led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco, a private developer, who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design, construction, and implementation of the $300 million project, which is intended to be market-rate housing for Davis. This is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve ZNE at no added cost to themselves or to the residents. Designed and modeled to achieve ZNE, the project uses a mixture of passive elements (roof overhangs, well-insulated walls, radiant heat barriers, ducts in insulated spaces, etc.) as well as active approaches (occupancy sensors on lights, high-efficiency appliances and lighting, etc.). Designed to out-perform California's 2008 Title 24 energy codes by 50%, the project produced 87% of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation.&lt;ref name="Home {{!}} UC Davis West Village"/&gt; The shortcoming in ZNE status is attributed to several factors, including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters, which have since been fixed. Occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated, with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area. One of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads (MEL, or plug loads) in the form of mini-refrigerators, lights, computers, gaming consoles, televisions, and other electronic equipment. The university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving ZNE status. These approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the site's renewable energy capacity, which is a 4 MW photovoltaic array per the original design. The West Village site is also home to the Honda Smart Home US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hondasmarthome.com|title=Honda Smart Home US|last=Honda|website=Honda Smart Home US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a beyond-ZNE single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management, lighting, construction, and [[water efficiency]].

The remaining energy demand is met with renewable energy from its building-integrated photovoltaic array. In 2009, building owner and occupant Integrated Design Associates (IDeAs) recorded actual measured energy use intensity of 21.17 kbtu/sf-year, with 21.72 kbtu/sf-year produced, for a net of −0.55 kbtu/sf-yr.
