The '''2003 Etobicoke gas explosion''' was a disaster which occurred on April 24, 2003, after a backhoe operated by [[Enbridge]] contractor Precision breached a pipeline on Bloor Street in the [[Etobicoke]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The resulting explosion destroyed a nearby two-story mixed commercial and residential building killing seven persons and injured another four. Enbridge and several other companies were fined for the disaster in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/16/enbridge-gas-fined-in-deadly-etobicoke-explosion/]&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion was the worst pipeline disaster in Canada since the [[LaSalle Heights Disaster]] in 1965. A memorial garden was dedicated at the site of the explosion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/20446-etobicoke-memorial-garden-honours-seven-lost-in-explosion/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aaron Lynch''' (February 18, 1957 – November 14, 2005) was an American writer, best known for his book ''Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society''.

==Biography==
After obtaining bachelor's degrees in mathematics and philosophy from the [[University of Illinois]], Lynch accepted a position in 1979 as an engineering physicist at [[Fermilab]] where he spent some time working on the [[PDP-11]] hardware project.  In his spare time, he worked on developing his thesis into a book, which he planned to title ''Abstract Evolution.''

Lynch worked extensively on the theoretical underpinnings of idea self-replication, developing a symbolic language and deriving mathematics from epidemiologic formulae to describe idea transmission through populations.  While conducting a literature search for his book, Lynch discovered the work of anthropologist [[F.T. Cloak]] on socially transmitted technology in birds, and a brief proposal for a field of [[Memetics]] in [[Richard Dawkins]]' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', although Lynch was not aware of these authors' work until after his own theory was substantially developed.   Early chapters of his book came to the attention of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who featured it in his ''[[Scientific American]]'' column ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' in 1983.  The first draft of the book was complete as early as 1984.  A grant from a former colleague who had become a video-technology millionaire enabled Lynch to leave Fermilab in 1990 and concentrate full-time on writing.

In the early 1990s, he contributed theoretical and mathematical models on idea transmission to the ''Journal of Ideas'', the first scholarly journal dedicated to memetics.

Lynch's book, after considerable revision, was eventually published in 1996 as ''Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society''.

In 1998, Lynch's "Units, Events and Dynamics in Memetic Evolution" provided much of the scholarly theoretical work omitted from "Thought Contagion".  The paper detailed precise conceptual definitions of memetic terms, symbolic language to model idea replication, and mathematics to model population level idea transmission summarizing a decade of his conceptual work.

In August 2004, Lynch appeared to accuse ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine and [[Seth Godin]] of plagiarism, claiming his complaint was backed, or even encouraged, by an unnamed 'major writers organization'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/soundoff/reader_comment.html?cid=595&amp;sortBy=desc Fastcompany] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron Lynch died on November 14, 2005, at the age of 47, from [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] [[encephalopathy]] after taking an overdose of an opiate-based pain killer, described as an accident in the Cook County, Illinois Coroner's Report. His remains are buried in Homewood Gardens in [[Homewood, Illinois]].

==Outline of Lynch's theory==
{{essay|date=October 2012}}
Lynch first developed the themes of ''[[Thought]] Contagion'' in his 1979 undergraduate senior thesis entitled "Abstract [[Evolution]]." The thesis explored the notion that an idea which can influence [[human behavior]] may blindly evolve the capacity to influence its own prevalence in the human population by motivating its human hosts to engage in behavior that spreads the idea.  Just as a [[virus]] which elicits sneezes from its human host is more likely to survive by passing from host to host than a similar but non-sneeze-provoking virus, Lynch hypothesized that an [[idea]] which stimulated its host to [[proselytize]], e.g., "Go and make disciples of all nations" ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 28:19), would be more likely to survive and become popular than an idea which did not elicit such activity.  He identified other mechanisms which might also increase an idea's [[market share]] and longevity, such as influencing the human host to produce more children than it otherwise would, to instruct one's children in the belief earlier and more rigorously than one otherwise might, to isolate or effectively immunize oneself or one's children from exposure to competing ideas, to actively impede the communications of nonbelievers, or to utilize mass communications [[mass media|media]] to spread the idea to people that the host would never personally meet.

[[Cultural anthropology]] had long held that cultural beliefs and information—i.e., socially propagated ideas—survive and propagate because of the survival value they provide to the human groups that adopt them.  Lynch embraced this notion of host-benefiting idea propagation, but his analysis added to this the notion that ideas could also propagate at the expense of their human hosts.  He noted, for example, that beliefs which induced their hosts into [[self-sacrifice]] before sufficiently large audiences (e.g. earlier [[Christians]] refusing to worship the Emperor and [[martyr|dying serenely]] in Roman arenas or [[Islamist]] suicide bombers taping farewell videos for posthumous broadcast to worldwide audiences) could survive or even multiply just by capturing one or more hosts to replace the one it sacrificed.

Lynch questions whether ideas might be "shopping" for humans as well as vice versa, and asked whether humans own their most cherished beliefs or the beliefs own them.  However, Lynch stopped short of suggesting that ideas have consciousness, will or planning abilities.  To Lynch, ideas were information encoded in human [[neuron]]s or other media. Like [[computer virus]]es, they are the products of human thinking and are in no way aware of or deliberating controlling their self-replicating abilities.  However, unlike computer viruses, ideas often evolve new or improved contagious properties without intentional [[human]] design, through copying infidelity mutations or recombination into powerful new belief sets.  According to Lynch, [[Natural selection]] determines which ideas survive and propagate successfully through human populations and which lose market share to the point of extinction.

Lynch's thesis offered an explanation for how not only [[Truth|true]] and useful ideas, but also unprovable or even [[False (logic)|false]] notions with sufficiently "contagious" properties could, over generations, become the predominant beliefs of whole societies.  While he insisted that the contagiousness of ideas was largely independent of their [[truth value]], as he immersed himself in this analysis, his frequently uttered motto became, "People don't learn from each other's mistakes.  They learn each other's mistakes."

==Reception and criticism==
Lynch's work encountered mixed reception among academics and among other [[meme]]ticists.  Some typical criticisms include the following:

# Lynch's work is theoretical, as yet unproven by empirical or computer simulation research.
# Lynch cites few of the works within the historic literature of [[social science]] which foreshadow a theory of social contagion.
# Some memeticists dispute his definition of the meme (see [[memetics]] article).

Lynch addressed such criticism in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/3/lynch.html JASSS] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advanced Distribution Automation''' (ADA) is a term coined by the [[IntelliGrid]] project in [[North America]] to describe the extension of intelligent control over electrical power grid functions to the distribution level and beyond.  It is related to distribution automation that can be enabled via the [[smart grid]].  The electrical power grid is typically separated logically into transmission systems and distribution systems.  [[Electric power transmission]] systems typically operate above 110kV, whereas [[Electricity distribution]] systems operate at lower voltages.  Normally, electric utilities with [[SCADA]] systems have extensive control over transmission-level equipment, and increasing control over distribution-level equipment via distribution automation.  However, they often are unable to control smaller entities such as [[Distributed energy]] resources (DERs), buildings, and homes.  It may be advantageous to extend control networks to these systems for a number of reasons:

* [[Distributed generation]] is increasingly important in power grids around the world.  This generation can help to support local power grids in the presence of blackouts, and ease the load on long-distance transmission lines, but it can also destabilize the grid if not managed correctly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybusinessreports.com/articles/view.asp?id=47 Advanced Distribution Automation]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually, utility control centers are unable to manage distributed generators directly, and this may be a valuable capability in the future.
* Industrial and residential loads are increasingly controlled through [[demand response]].  For example, during periods of peak electrical demand in the summer, the utility control centers may be able to raise the thermostats of houses enrolled in a load reduction program, to temporarily decrease electrical demand from a large number of customers without significantly affecting their comfort.  Customers are usually compensated for their participation in such programs.
* To enable [[demand side management]], where homes, businesses, and even electric vehicles may be able to receive real-time pricing (RTP) signals from their distribution companies and dynamically adjust their own energy consumption profiles to minimize costs.  This would also preserve customer autonomy and mitigate privacy issues.
* To further the penetration and quality of self-healing, which reduces or eliminates outage time through the use of sensor and control systems embedded in the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Smart grid#Self-healing|Smart Grid Self Healing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of Advanced Distribution Automation is real-time adjustment to changing loads, generation, and failure conditions of the distribution system, usually without operator intervention.  This necessitates control of field devices, which implies enough information technology (IT) development to enable automated decision making in the field and relaying of critical information to the utility control center. The IT infrastructure includes real-time data acquisition and communication with utility databases and other automated systems.  Accurate modeling of distribution operations supports optimal decision making at the control center and in the field.

Automated control of devices in distribution systems is closed-loop control of switching devices, voltage controllers, and capacitors based on recommendations of the distribution optimization algorithms.

Distribution System Reliability: Distribution Automation currently increased system reliability, and new technology such as solid state transformers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universaltransformer.com/ Solid State Universal Intelligent Transformer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing Utilization of Existing Infrastructure: As a component of ADA infrastructure, the new system concepts will enable more efficient operation of the power system, allowing closer control of voltage profiles (e.g. conservation voltage reduction, closely related to [[voltage optimisation]]) and maximization of energy throughput.

Distribution System of the Future: The new system concepts will enable ADA functions in the distribution system that contribute to outage prevention and recovery, optimal system performance under changing conditions, and reduced operating costs.
Distribution automation technologies are commercially available for wide scale utility deployment. The key is identifying and unlocking the values which provide the best return on investment in ways that can be measured by utilities. Applications which may have greatest potential are operations and efficiency, management of peak loads via [demand response], predictive technologies and communications for equipment, and system restoration technologies.

New transformer technologies are being considered by EPRI,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/Portfolio/PDF/2008_P124.pdf EPRI 2008 Program 124 Advanced Distribution Automation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195223/http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/Portfolio/PDF/2008_P124.pdf |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including solid state transformers that can reduce power losses due to step-up and step-down voltages conversion.

[[Image:Myla32rp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Metallized polyethylene terephthalate|metallized boPET]] film, 32 layers of ~14&amp;nbsp;µm thickness each]]

'''BoPET''' ('''biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate''') is a [[polyester]] film made from stretched [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) and is used for its high [[tensile strength]], [[chemical stability|chemical]] and [[Shape|dimensional]] [[strength of materials|stability]], [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]], [[reflectivity]], gas and aroma barrier properties, and [[electrical insulation]].

A variety of [[company (law)|companies]] manufacture boPET and other polyester films under different [[brand name]]s. In the UK and US, the most well-known trade names are '''Mylar''', '''Melinex''', and '''Hostaphan'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BXpwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 |page=48 |title= Biaxial Stretching of Film: Principles And Applications |author= Mark T. DeMeuse |publisher= Elsevier |year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BoPET film was developed in the mid-1950s, originally by [[DuPont]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI), and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:
*  Izard, Emmette Farr, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02534028&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D2534028.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2534028%2526RS%3DPN%2F2534028&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Production of polyethylene terephthalate"], U.S. patent no. 2,534,028 (filed: 1948 May 13 ; issued:  1950 December 12).
*  Adams, John Francis Edward ; Gerber, Kenneth George ; Holmes-Walker, William Anthony, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03177277&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D3177277.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3177277%2526RS%3DPN%2F3177277&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film"], U.S. patent no. 3,177,277 (filed: 1957 May 10 ; issued: 1965 April 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 [[Eastman Kodak]] used Mylar as a support for photographic film and called it "ESTAR Base".&lt;ref name="KodakESTAR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kodak HCF Film/ESTAR Base |url=https://www.kodak.com/uploadedFiles/Corporate/Industrial_Materials_Group/E4058_HCFFilm.pdf |website=www.kodak.com |publisher=[[Eastman Kodak Company]] |accessdate=2018-08-24 |format=PDF |date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very thin and tough film allowed {{convert|6000|ft|adj=on}} reels to be exposed on long-range [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance flights.&lt;ref&gt;"Eyes In The Sky", Dino A. Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|978 1 59114 082 5}}, pp. 102, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[NASA]] launched [[Project Echo#Echo 2|Echo II]], a {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} diameter balloon constructed from a {{convert|9|µm|in|}} thick mylar film sandwiched between two layers of {{convert|4.5|µm|in|}} thick aluminum foil bonded together.&lt;ref&gt;Staugaitis, C. &amp; Kobren, L. "Mechanical And Physical Properties of the Echo II Metal-Polymer Laminate (NASA TN D-3409)", NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture and properties ==
[[Image:Polyethylene terephthalate.svg|thumb|280px|Chemical structure of polyethylene terephthalate]]

The manufacturing process begins with a film of molten [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) being [[Plastics extrusion|extruded]] onto a chill roll, which quenches it into the amorphous state.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE. This is not shown as an archive of the original link because the AMPEF.com domain has been taken over by a mindless link farm as of ~Dec 2017 --&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120191738/http://www.ampef.com:80/technology2.html |title=Process Flow|work=Ampef.com|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then biaxially oriented by [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]]. The most common way of doing this is the sequential process, in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction, i.e. [[orthogonality|orthogonally]] to the direction of travel, in a heated oven. It is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously, although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate. Draw ratios are typically around 3 to 4 in each direction.

Once the drawing is completed, the film is "heat set" or [[crystal]]lized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above {{convert|200|C}}. The heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane. The orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented PET film, which has a typical [[Young's modulus]] of about 4 GPa. Another important consequence of the molecular orientation is that it induces the formation of many crystal nuclei. The crystallites that grow rapidly reach the boundary of the neighboring crystallite and remain smaller than the wavelength of visible light. As a result, biaxially oriented PET film has excellent clarity, despite its [[semicrystalline]] structure.

If it were produced without any additives, the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up, similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked. To make handling possible, microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the PET to roughen the surface of the film.

Biaxially oriented PET film can be [[Metallised film|metallized]] by [[vapor deposition]] of a [[Thin-film deposition|thin film]]  of [[evaporation|evaporated]] [[aluminium]], [[gold]], or other metal onto it. The result is much less permeable to gases (important in [[Modified atmosphere|food packaging]]) and reflects up to 99% of light, including much of the [[infrared]] spectrum. For some applications like food packaging, the aluminized boPET film can be laminated with a layer of [[polyethylene]], which provides sealability and improves [[puncture resistance]]. The polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the PET side shiny.

Other coatings, such as conductive [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO), can be applied to boPET film by [[sputter deposition]].

== Applications ==
Uses for boPET polyester films include, but are not limited to:

=== Flexible packaging and food contact applications ===
* Laminates containing metallized boPET foil (In technical language called printin or laminate web substrate) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss, achieving long [[shelf life]]. Examples are coffee "foil" packaging and pouches for convenience foods.
* White boPET web substrate is used as lidding for dairy goods such as [[yogurt]].
* Clear boPET web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals. Due to its excellent heat resistance, it can remain on the package during microwave or oven heating.
* Roasting bags
*[[Metallised film]]s
* Laminated sheet metal (aluminum or steel) used in the manufacture of cans ([[bisphenol A]]-free alternative to lacquers)

===Covering over paper===
* A clear overlay on a [[map]], on which notations, additional [[data]], or copied data, can be drawn without damaging the map
* Metallized boPET is used as a mirror-like decorative surface on some book covers, T-shirts, and other flexible cloths.
* Protective covering over buttons/pins/[[badge]]s
* The glossy top layer of a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] photographic print
* As a backing for very fine [[sandpaper]]
* boPET film is used in bagging [[comic books]], in order to best protect them during storage from environmental conditions (moisture, heat, and cold) that would otherwise cause paper to slowly deteriorate over time. This material is used for [[Archival science|archival quality]] storage of documents by the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb.loc.gov/preserv/supply/specific.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604010156/http://lcweb.loc.gov/preserv/supply/specific.html|date=June 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (specifically Mylar® type D)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jampaper.com/blog/what-is-mylar-paper/|title=What is Mylar Paper - More Than Just Decoration|work=Jampaper.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several major library comic book research collections, including the Comic Art Collection at [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Randall W. |title=A Practicing Comic-Book Librarian Surveys His Collection and Craft |journal=Serials Review |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=49&amp;ndash;56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While boPET is widely (and effectively) used in this archival sense, it is not immune to the effects of fire and heat and could potentially melt, depending on the intensity of the heat source, causing further damage to the encased item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myacpl.org/node/618 |title=Albany library's entire collection exposed to smoke &amp;#124; Athens County Public Libraries |publisher=Myacpl.org |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, [[collectible card game|trading card]] decks (such as ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game|Pokémon]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'') are packaged in pouches or sleeves made of metallized boPET. It can also be used to make the holographic artwork featured on some cards, typically known as "holos", "foils", or "holofoils".
*For protecting the spine of important documents, such as [[medical records]].

===Insulating material===
* An [[Electrical insulation|electrical insulating]] material
* [[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] for houses and tents, reflecting thermal radiation
* Five layers of metallized boPET film in NASA's [[spacesuit]]s make them [[radiation]] resistant and help regulate temperature.
* Metallized boPET film [[Space blanket|emergency blankets]] conserve a [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] victim's body heat.
* As a thin strip to form an airtight seal between the control surfaces and adjacent structure of aircraft, especially [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s.
* Light insulation for indoor gardening.
* [[Fire shelter]]s, used by [[wildland firefighter]]s.
* [[Fire proximity suit|Aluminized proximity suits]] used by fire fighters for protection from the high amount of heat release from fuel fires.
* Used in sock and glove liners to lock in warmth

===Solar, marine and aviation applications===
* Metallized boPET is intended to be used for [[solar sail]]s as an alternative [[spacecraft propulsion|means of propulsion]] for [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cosmos 1|Cosmos&amp;nbsp;1]]
* Metallized boPET [[Sun|solar]] curtains reflect sunlight and heat away from windows.
* Aluminized, as an inexpensive [[solar eclipse]] viewer, although care must be taken, because invisible fissures can form in the metal film, reducing its effectiveness.
* High performance [[sail]]s for [[sailboat]]s, [[Hang gliding|hang gliders]], [[Paragliding|paragliders]] and [[Kitesurfing|kites]]
* Use boPET films as the back face of the PV modules in solar panels
* Metallized boPET as a reflector material for solar cooking stoves
* To bridge control surface gaps on [[sailplane]]s (gliders), reducing [[profile drag]]

===Science===
* Amateur and professional visual and telescopic [[solar filter]]s. BoPET films are often annealed to a glass element to improve thermal conductivity, and guarantee the necessary flat surface needed for even telescopic solar observation. Manufacturers will typically use films with thicknesses of {{convert|280|-|500|um}}, in order to give the films better resilience. {{convert|250|um|adj=on}} thickness films with a heavy aluminium coating are generally preferred for naked-eye Solar observation during eclipses.
* Films in annular ring mounts on gas-tight cells, will readily deform into spherical mirrors. [[Photomultiplier]] [[cosmic-ray]] observatories often make use of these mirrors for inexpensive large (1.0 m and above), lightweight mirror surfaces for sky-sector low and medium energy cosmic ray research.
* As a light diaphragm material separating gases in hypersonic shock and expansion tube facilities.
* As a [[beamsplitter]] in [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]], typically with [[laser]] applications. Film thicknesses are often in the 500 micrometre range.
* Coating around [[Hematocrit|hematocrit tubes]].
* Insulating material for a cryocooler radiation shield.
* As a window material to confine gas in detectors and targets in [[nuclear physics]].
* In CT scanners it acts as a physical barrier between the xray-tube, detector ring and the patient allowing negligible attenuation of the xray beam when active.
* Spacecraft are insulated with a metallized BoPET film.
* The material for solar sails of spacecraft.

===Electronic and acoustic applications===
* Carrier for flexible printed circuits.
* boPET film is often used as the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] material in [[headphones]], [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]s and [[microphone]]s.
* boPET film has been used in the production of [[banjo]] &amp; [[drumhead]]s since 1958 due to its durability and acoustical properties when stretched over the bearing edge of the drum. They are made in single- and double-ply versions, with each ply being {{convert|2|-|10|mil}} in thickness, with a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface, originally used by the company [[D'Addario|Evans]].
* boPET film is used as the substrate in practically all [[magnetic tape|magnetic recording tape]]s and [[floppy disk]]s.
* Metallized boPET film, along with other plastic films, is used as a [[dielectric]] in foil [[capacitor]]s.
* Clear boPET bags are used as [[packaging]] for audio media such as [[compact disc]]s and [[vinyl record]]s.
* Clear and white boPET films are used as core layers and overlays in [[Smart Card]]s.

===Printing Mediums===
* Before the widespread adoption of CAD, [[engineering drawings]] or [[architectural drawing]]s were plotted onto sheets of boPET film, known as [[drafting film]]. The boPET sheets become legal documents from which copies or [[blueprint]]s are made. boPET sheets are more durable and can withstand more handling than [[bond paper]]. Although "[[whiteprint|blueprint]]" duplication has fallen out of use, mylar is still used for its archival properties, typically as a record set of plans for building departments to keep on file.
* [[Transparency (projection)|Overhead transparency film]] for [[photocopier]]s or [[laser printer]]s (boPET film withstands the high heat).

===Other===
* [[Balloon]]s, metallic balloons.
* Route information signs, called [[rollsign]]s or destination blinds, displayed by public transport vehicles
* For materials in [[kite flying|kite]]s
* Covering [[glass]] to decrease probability of shattering
* In theatre effects as [[confetti]].
* As the adhesive strip to attach the string to a [[teabag]]
* One of the many materials used as windsavers or valves for [[valved harmonica]]s
* On farmland and domestic gardens, highly reflective aluminized PET film ribbons are used to keep birds away from plants.
* Measuring tape
* Protecting [[pinball]] machine playfields from wear
* Used in dentistry when restoring teeth with composite.
* In [[nail polish]], as a coloured and finely shredded additive to create a glitter effect.
* Numismatics - The product is used instead of PVC for safe coin storage. Chemical composition is more conducive to the metals coins are made of i.e Silver &amp; Copper (Coins used to be stored in PVC sleeves which damage coins when exposed for longer periods due to chlorine being released.)

It was named after the two [[Germans|German]] scientists [[Max Born]] and [[Fritz Haber]], who developed it in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. C. Morris and E. L. Short ''Nature'' 1969, ''224'', 950-952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Born ''[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]'' 1919, ''21'', 679-685.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Haber ''[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft ]]'' 1919, ''21'', 750-768.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also independently formulated by [[Kasimir Fajans]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Fajans ''[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft ]]'' 1919, ''21'', 714-722.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle is concerned with the formation of an [[ionic compound]] from the reaction of a [[metal]] (often a [[Alkali metal|Group I]] or [[Alkaline earth metal|Group II]] element) with a [[halogen]] or other non-metallic element such as [[oxygen]].

Born–Haber cycles are used primarily as a means of calculating [[lattice energy]] (or more precisely [[enthalpy]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The difference between energy and enthalpy is very small and the two terms are interchanged freely in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;), which cannot otherwise be measured directly. The [[lattice enthalpy]] is the [[enthalpy]] change involved in the formation of an ionic compound from gaseous ions (an [[exothermic process]]), or sometimes defined as the energy to break the ionic compound into gaseous ions (an [[endothermic process]]). A Born–Haber cycle applies [[Hess's law]] to calculate the lattice enthalpy by comparing the [[standard enthalpy change of formation]] of the ionic compound (from the elements) to the enthalpy required to make gaseous ions from the [[Chemical element|elements]].

This latter calculation is complex. To make gaseous ions from elements it is necessary to atomise the elements (turn each into gaseous atoms) and then to ionise the atoms. If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its [[bond dissociation enthalpy]] (see also [[bond energy]]). The energy required to remove one or more [[electron]]s to make a [[cation]] is a sum of successive [[ionization energy|ionization energies]]; for example, the energy needed to form Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Electron affinity]] is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.

The Born–Haber cycle applies only to fully ionic solids such as certain [[alkali halide]]s. Most compounds include covalent and ionic contributions to chemical bonding and to the lattice energy, which is represented by an extended Born-Haber thermodynamic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;H. Heinz and U. W. Suter ''[[Journal of Physical Chemistry B]]'' 2004, ''108'', 18341-18352.&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Born–Haber cycle can be used to estimate the polarity and the atomic charges of polar compounds.

==Example: Formation of lithium fluoride==
[[Image:Born-haber cycle LiF.svg|450px|thumb|Born–Haber cycle for the standard enthalpy change of formation of [[lithium fluoride]]. ΔH&lt;sub&gt;latt&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; in the text.]]

The enthalpy of formation of [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF) from its elements lithium and fluorine in their stable forms is modeled in five steps in the diagram:

# Enthalpy change of atomization enthalpy of lithium
# Ionization enthalpy of lithium
# Atomization enthalpy of fluorine
# Electron affinity of fluorine
# Lattice enthalpy

The same calculation applies for any metal other than lithium or any non-metal other than fluorine.

The sum of the energies for each step of the process must equal the enthalpy of formation of the metal and non-metal, &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_{f}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math chem&gt;\Delta H_{f} = V + \frac{1}{2}B + \mathit{IE}_\ce{M} - \ce{EA}_\ce{X} + U_L&lt;/math&gt;

*{{mvar|V}} is the [[enthalpy of sublimation]] for metal atoms (lithium)
*{{mvar|B}} is the bond energy (of F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The coefficient 1/2 is used because the formation reaction is Li + 1/2 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → LiF.
*&lt;chem&gt;\mathit{IE}_M&lt;/chem&gt; is the [[ionization energy]] of the metal atom: &lt;chem&gt;{M} + \mathit{IE}_{M} -&gt; {M+} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;
*&lt;chem&gt;\mathit{EA}_X&lt;/chem&gt; is the [[electron affinity]] of non-metal atom X (fluorine)
*&lt;math&gt;U_L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[lattice energy]] (defined as exothermic here)

The net enthalpy of formation and the first four of the five energies can be determined experimentally, but the lattice energy cannot be measured directly.  Instead, the lattice energy is calculated by subtracting the other four energies in the Born–Haber cycle from the net enthalpy of formation.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs. ''Chemistry: The Molecular Science.'' 3rd edition. 2008.  {{ISBN|0-495-10521-X}}. pages 320–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''cycle''' refers to the fact that one can also equate to zero the total enthalpy change for a cyclic process, starting and ending with LiF(s) in the example. This leads to 
:&lt;math chem&gt;  0 = - \Delta H_{f} + V + \frac{1}{2}B + \mathit{IE}_\ce{M} - \mathit{EA}_\ce{X} + U_L&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to the previous equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3085">'''Bumping''' is a phenomenon in chemistry where homogenous liquids [[Boiling|boiled]] in a [[test tube]] or other container will [[superheating|superheat]] and, upon [[nucleation]], rapid boiling will expel the liquid from the container. In extreme cases, the container may be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Cause ==
Bumping occurs when liquids are heated or has its pressure reduced very rapidly, typically in smooth, clean glassware. The hardest part of bubble formation is the formation of the small bubble; once a bubble has formed, it can grow quickly. Because the liquid is typically above its boiling point, when the liquid finally starts to boil, a large vapor [[Liquid bubble|bubble]] is formed that pushes the liquid out of the test tube, typically at high speed. This rapid expulsion of boiling liquid poses a serious hazard to others and oneself in the [[Laboratory|lab]]. Furthermore, if a liquid is boiled and cooled back down, the chance of bumping increases on each subsequent boil, because each heating cycle progressively de-gasses the liquid, reducing the number of remaining nucleation sites.

== Prevention ==
The most common way of preventing bumping is by adding one or two [[boiling chips]] to the reaction vessel. However, these alone may not prevent bumping and for this reason it is advisable to boil liquids in a [[boiling tube]], a [[boiling flask]], or an [[Erlenmeyer flask]]. In addition, heating test tubes should never be pointed towards any person, just in case bumping does occur. Whenever a liquid is cooled below its boiling point and re-heated to a boil, a new boiling chip will be needed, as the pores in the old boiling chip tend to fill with solvent, rendering it ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CHEM 2401 Lab Manual|last=Moya-Barrios|first=Reinaldo|publisher=Dalhousie University Chemistry Department|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sealed capillary tube can also be placed in a boiling solution to provide a nucleation site, reducing the bumping risk and allowing its easy removal from a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirring a liquid also lessens the chances of bumping, as the resulting vortex breaks up any large bubbles that might form, and the stirring itself creates bubbles.

'''Davydov soliton''' is a quantum [[quasiparticle]] representing an excitation propagating along the [[protein]] [[α-helix]] self-trapped [[amide|amide I]].  It is a solution of the Davydov [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist [[Alexander Davydov]]. The Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I [[vibration]]s with the [[hydrogen bond]]s that stabilize the [[α-helix]] of [[protein]]s. The elementary excitations within the α-helix are given by the [[phonon]]s which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice, and the [[exciton]]s which describe the internal [[amide|amide I]] excitations of the [[peptide group]]s. Referring to the atomic structure of an α-helix region of protein the mechanism that creates the Davydov soliton ([[polaron]], [[exciton]]) can be described as follows: [[vibration]]al [[energy]] of the [[carbonyl|C=O]] [[stretching]] (or [[amide|amide I]]) [[oscillator]]s that is localized on the α-helix acts through a phonon coupling effect to distort the structure of the α-helix, while the helical distortion reacts again through phonon coupling to trap the amide I oscillation energy and prevent its dispersion. This effect is called ''self-localization'' or ''self-trapping''.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"&gt;{{cite journal

Davydov's [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is formally similar to the [[Polaron#Polaron theory|Fröhlich-Holstein Hamiltonian]] for the interaction of electrons with a polarizable lattice. Thus the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the [[energy operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}+\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}+\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the motion of the amide I excitations between adjacent sites; &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes
the [[vibration]]s of the [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]]; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the interaction of the amide I excitation with the lattice.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1977"/&gt;

The [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,\alpha}E_{0}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-J\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n+1,\alpha}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n-1,\alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+L\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha+1}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[w(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})^{2}+\frac{\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}^{2}}{M}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement operator]] from the equilibrium position of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum operator]] of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, M is the [[mass]] of each [[peptide group]], and &lt;math&gt;w=19.5&lt;/math&gt; N m&lt;math&gt;^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Elasticity (physics)|effective elasticity coefficient]] of the lattice (the [[spring constant]] of a [[hydrogen bond]]).

Finally, the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{int}}=\chi\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi=-30&lt;/math&gt; pN is an anharmonic parameter arising from the coupling between the [[quasiparticle]] (exciton) and the lattice displacements (phonon) and parameterizes the strength of the [[exciton]]-[[phonon]] [[interaction]]. The value of this parameter for [[α-helix]] has been determined via comparison of the theoretically calculated absorption line shapes with the experimentally measured ones.&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro2005"&gt;

The mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov's soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory. In this context the Davydov's soliton corresponds to a [[polaron]] that is (i) ''large'' so the continuum limit approximation is justified, (ii) ''acoustic'' because the self-localization arises from interactions
with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) ''weakly coupled'' because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt;

The Davydov soliton is a ''quantum quasiparticle'' and it obeys [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. Thus any model that does not impose translational invariance is flawed by construction.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt; Supposing that the Davydov soliton is localized to 5 turns of the [[α-helix]] results in significant uncertainty in the [[velocity]] of the [[soliton]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=133&lt;/math&gt; m/s, a fact that is obscured if one models the Davydov soliton as a classical object.

There are three possible fundamental approaches towards Davydov model:&lt;ref name="Takeno1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro1997"&gt;

[[File:Carboxylic acid dimers.png|right|thumb|Dimers of [[carboxylic acid]]s are often found in vapour phase.]]
A '''dimer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|m|ər}}) (''[[wikt:di-|di-]]'', "two" + ''[[wikt:-mer|-mer]]'', "parts") is an [[oligomer]] consisting of two [[monomer]]s joined by bonds that can be either strong or weak, [[Covalent bond|covalent]] or [[Intermolecular force|intermolecular]]. The term ''homodimer'' is used when the two molecules are identical (e.g. A-A) and ''heterodimer'' when they are not (e.g. A-B). The reverse of dimerisation is often called [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]]. When two oppositely charged ions associate into dimers, they are referred to as ''Bjerrum pairs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adar|first=Ram M.|last2=Markovich|first2=Tomer|last3=Andelman|first3=David|date=2017-05-17|title=Bjerrum pairs in ionic solutions: A Poisson-Boltzmann approach|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4982885|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=146|issue=19|pages=194904|doi=10.1063/1.4982885|issn=0021-9606|arxiv=1702.04853|bibcode=2017JChPh.146s4904A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noncovalent dimers ==
[[Carboxylic acid]]s form dimers by hydrogen bonding of the acidic hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen when [[anhydrous]]. For example, [[acetic acid]] forms a dimer in the gas phase, where the monomer units are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s. Under special conditions, most OH-containing molecules form dimers, e.g. the [[water dimer]].

Borane ("BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;") occurs as the dimer [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), due to the high [[Lewis acid]]ity of the [[boron]] center.

[[Excimer]]s and [[exciplex]]es are [[Excited state|excited]] structures with a short lifetime. For example, [[noble gas]]es do not form stable dimers, but do form the [[excimer]]s Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, Kr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* and Xe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* under high pressure and electrical stimulation.

== Covalent dimers ==
[[File:Dicyclopentadiene structure.svg|thumb|right|100px|The dimer of [[cyclopentadiene]] although this might not be readily apparent on initial inspection]]
[[File:1,2-dioxetane.png|thumb|right|100px|[[1,2-dioxetane]], one of two [[formaldehyde]] dimers. As evidenced by this molecule's bonds, covalent dimers are usually not structurally similar to their [[Monomer|monomers]].]]
[[Molecular]] dimers are often formed by the reaction of two identical compounds e.g.: 2A → A-A. In this example, [[monomer]] "A" is said to dimerise to give the dimer "A-A". An example is a [[diaminocarbene]], which dimerise to give a [[tetraaminoethylene]]:
:2 C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Carbene]]s are highly reactive and readily form bonds.

[[Dicyclopentadiene]] is an asymmetrical dimer of two [[cyclopentadiene]] molecules that have reacted in a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] to give the product. Upon heating, it "cracks" (undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction) to give identical monomers:
:C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2  C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

Many nonmetallic elements occur as dimers: [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], the [[halogen]]s, i.e. [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]] and [[iodine]]. Noble gases can form dimers linked by [[van der Waals bond]]s, for example [[dihelium]] or [[diargon]]. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] occurs as a mercury(I) cation (Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), formally a dimeric ion. Other metals may form a proportion of dimers in their vapour. Known metallic dimers include [[dilithium|Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[disodium|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[dipotassium|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[dirubidium|Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[dicaesium|Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Many small organic molecules, most notably [[formaldehyde]], easily form dimers. The dimer of formaldehyde (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is [[dioxetane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Polymer chemistry==
In the context of [[polymer]]s, "dimer" also refers to the [[degree of polymerization]] 2, regardless of the stoichiometry or [[condensation reaction]]s. 

This is applicable to [[disaccharide]]s. For example, [[cellobiose]] is a dimer of [[glucose]], even though the formation reaction produces [[water]]:
: 2C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Here, the dimer has a stoichiometry different from the pair of monomers.

Amino acids can also form dimers, which are called [[dipeptide]]s.  An example is [[glycylglycine]], consisting of two [[glycine]] molecules joined by a [[peptide bond]].  Other examples are [[aspartame]] and [[carnosine]].

== Biochemical dimers ==
[[Pyrimidine dimers]] are formed by a [[photochemical reaction]] from pyrimidine [[DNA base]]s. This cross-linking causes [[Mutation|DNA mutation]]s, which can be [[carcinogenic]], causing [[skin cancer]]s.

The '''Dodge Caravan''' is a minivan manufactured and marketed by [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] (and predecessor Chrysler companies) and marketed under the [[Dodge]] brand.  Introduced for the 1984 model year, it is the longest-used nameplate currently in use by Chrysler.  Introduced as the Dodge version of the [[Chrysler minivans]] alongside the [[Plymouth Voyager]] (and the later [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]), the Dodge Caravan is currently in its fifth generation of production.

Largely marketed in the United States and Canada, outside North America, the Dodge Caravan was marketed as the [[Chrysler Voyager]].  In North America, the Grand Caravan served as the basis for the [[Volkswagen Routan]] assembled by Chrysler.  Since 1984, more than 11 million Chrysler minivans (including rebadged variants and export versions) have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews24h.com/Auto-Industry/Chrysler/2885.html|title=Chrysler LLC Celebrates 25th Anniversary of the Minivan|publisher=Autonew24h.com|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its 1983 introduction, the Dodge Caravan has been assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]], in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada; prior to 2010, [[Saint Louis Assembly]] (in [[Fenton, Missouri]]) was an additional source of production.    {{TOC limit|2}}

[[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. [[Henry Ford II]] rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan – a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the [[Chrysler S platform]], an extended derivative of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The [[Renault Espace]] launched in Europe the same year, and Chrysler began selling the Chrysler Voyager in Europe four years later.

During the 1960s, Dodge did sell a small cargo van adapted for passenger use, called the [[Dodge A100]] which was discontinued in 1970 and replaced by the larger, fullsized [[Dodge B-series van]] in 1971.

Interior trim, controls, and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform, and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front-wheel-drive, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. There were three trim levels: base, SE, and LE.

Base vans came equipped for five passengers in two rows of seating. The LE came with seven passengers standard in three rows of seating. The base van had two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a three-person bench seat in the second row. The seven-passenger came with two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a two-person bench seat in the second row, and a three-person bench seat in the back row. The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable, and the large three-person bench could also be installed in the second row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five person seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were easy to operate though removing and replacing the seats typically required two adults. A front low-back 60/40 split bench, accommodating a third front passenger in the middle, was offered in the SE trim level in 1985 only, allowing for a maximum of eight passengers. This configuration was subsequently dropped. Base model curb weight 2,910 lbs.

Safety features consisted of 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers, with simple lap belts for the rear five. Seats on base models and cloth-trimmed SEs had no headrests, which were not mandated due to the van's "light truck" legal status. However, the two front seats were equipped with non-adjustable headrests on the LE model and in conjunction with vinyl upholstery on the SE. Side-impact reinforcements were mandated, and were at all seating positions front and rear. Neither [[airbags]] nor [[anti-lock braking system]]s were available.

Access to the rear rows of seating was by a large passenger-side sliding door enabling easy access in confined situations, e.g., parking. Because only one sliding door was offered, the smaller 2nd row bench seat was shifted to the driver's side of the van, facilitating passenger access to the 3rd row seat. To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the rear seat, the seat could be adjusted forward in two increments, the first of which removed roughly {{convert|6|in|mm}} of legroom from the back row passengers, and the second of which would push the bench all the way to the back of the 2nd row, making the seats unusable. The seat back of the rear bench could also be folded forward, providing a flat cargo shelf. The smaller 2nd row bench was not adjustable, nor foldable; it could only be removed entirely.

Cargo access to the rear was via a hatchback, similar to the one on the K platform station wagons. The hatch was hinged at the top and held open by gas struts.

A long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Caravan, was introduced in May 1987. It allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat.

A cargo version of the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also introduced for 1984, with a flat floored cargo space four feet tall and with four feet between the wheel wells. The load capacity was {{convert|1700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=popmen&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Popular Mechanics]] | last = Witzenburg | first = Gary | date = September 1983 | volume = 160 | number = 3 | issn = 0032-4558 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | page = 162 | title = Detroit '84 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and was then discontinued after 1995. It was initially available with the short wheelbase; a long-wheelbase variant was introduced alongside the Grand Caravan. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out bi-parting doors (with or without windows), similar to those of more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.

===Transmissions===
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with all [[inline-four engine]]s, including the turbocharged 2.5-liter (this was a rare combination). The Plymouth Voyager, which was a rebadged version of the Caravan, was also available with a manual transmission. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country, which was a more luxurious repackaged version of the Caravan, had no manual transmission option. Manual transmissions were not available on V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

The [[V6 engine|V6]] engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated [[TorqueFlite]], until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] four-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-four engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

===Engines===
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered in the Caravan&amp;nbsp;– both [[inline-4]] engines with 2 barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K Platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L, an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6&amp;nbsp;L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower.

In mid-1987, the base 2.2&amp;nbsp;L I4 was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5&amp;nbsp;L]] I4, which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] I4 was replaced with the new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

[[File:Dodge V6 EFI fender badge.jpg|thumb|right|Fender badge originally used on V6 equipped Caravans]]
Shortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5&amp;nbsp;L producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 upped its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}} that same year, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3 L&amp;nbsp;V6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year. In these years, the ES model debuted (short wheelbase only) to highlight the new engines, the turbo 2.5 in particular. The ES was introduced to the long wheelbase Grand Caravan for 1991 and continued throughout 2003, before it was discontinued and replaced with the SXT.

From 1991 through 1995, the Caravan used the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler AS platform]]; they were the last minivans derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The increasing popularity of the short wheelbase Caravan had a dramatic effect on the captive import from Mitsubishi, called the [[Dodge Colt Vista]], and was no longer imported to North America starting in 1991.

The second generation had features including:
* "Quad Command" bucket seating (1991)
* Integrated [[child safety seats]] (1991, MY1992), improved design with recliners (1993, MY1994)
* Available [[anti-lock brakes]] (1991)
* First driver's side [[airbag]] in a minivan (1991) and first dual front airbags (1994)
* First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards (1993, MY1994)
* All-wheel drive was introduced for the minivan. (1991)

1992 models included revised roof-racks and doorhandles. 1993 marked the final year for optional woodgrain and wire wheels on higher level models. 1994 models had a redesigned interior, with slightly different seat contours/fabrics, along with a new dash, in order to accommodate a passenger-side air bag.

1994 exterior trim changes included a body colored grill and moldings on certain models, as well as the addition of a one-year only "10th Anniversary Edition" package. Available as an option on a mid-level Caravan and Grand Caravan (also offered on Voyager models as well), the  package featured 2-tone paint schemes, which included a contrasting light gray colored lower break, along with a gold fender badge. Only select colors were available on this model.

[[File:Dodge-Caravan minivan.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Caravan, the short-wheelbase version]]

The third-generation Chrysler minivans were available in long- and short– wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.

In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation |year=2003 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=9780814330913 |page=300 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show]] using the [[Chrysler S platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf |title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States and Canada (the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]] had introduced the first four-door non-[[Compact MPV|compact minivan]] for the United States &amp; Canada in 1994, although the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors). With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Seating innovation|''Easy Out Roller Seats'']]. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models.

Base models of the Caravan were offered in most states with either a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder or the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[6G72|Mitsubishi 6G72]] [[V6 engine]], except in several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi did not meet emissions standards. In those areas, the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine was offered as the V6 option from 1997 through 2000.

The 1996 Caravan, along with the Plymouth Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country won the North American Car of the Year award. The Caravan itself won ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] 1996 and appeared on the [[Car and Driver Ten Best]] for 1996 and 1997. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year only 15th anniversary "Platinum Edition", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the "2000+" and "Millennium" package, however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The Caravan received minor updates in 1997 for the 1998 model year. These changes came in the form of new colors, new wheels for trims above SE, new interior fabric, optional heated seats and a new design for the optional auto-dimming rear view mirror. In calendar year 1998, the Caravan's HVAC vents on the driver's side and center of the dashboard were updated to have a more conventional design. Later that year, the 1999 Caravan received new front styling on all trims above SE, while the Sport and ES models received even sportier styling. The ES model was the first minivan to receive the "AutoStick" transmission and 17&amp;nbsp;inch wheels. A [[cargo net]] between the driver and front passenger seats was added. Color keyed door and lift-gate handles were standard across the whole range, in addition to a new keyless entry remote. Base and SE models had options for a spoiler as well as color keyed bumpers and trim (grey or color molded bumpers and trim were standard). The driver's side sliding door became standard. Chrysler had updates of the Plymouth Voyager in 1996 for the 1997 model year and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country in 1997 for the 1998 model year, prior to the 1998–2007 [[DaimlerChrysler]] era; it was the only exterior update of the NS Dodge Caravan.

===Engines===
* 1996–2000 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]], {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, {{convert|167|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} (Canadian vans beginning in 1999 included a 3.0 L V6 as standard equipment)

===Concepts===
Other plans for this model year included three minivan concepts all to be made in the Windsor Assembly, the Dodge Caravan R/T, Voyager XG, and the [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica 1999 concept]]. The Caravan R/T (originally ESS) was to include the most powerful engine ever for a minivan, rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW}}. It had two [[Dodge Viper]] hoodscoops, a brushed aluminum instrument panel, racing-style pedals, and black and white rubber flooring.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Voyager XG was more rugged, featured a diesel engine and manual transmission, and included many outdoor amenities, such as a built-in ice pack.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Chrysler Pacifica, based on the Town &amp; Country, was more luxurious, had power leather seats and footrests, overhead bins and lighting, an [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]] grille, and roof-long skylights. The skylight feature was used by [[Nissan]] in the [[Nissan Quest|Quest]]. The Pacifica actually did come to be in 2004, based on the fifth generation Caravan, except that it became a [[crossover SUV]] rather than a minivan; the nameplate was eventually applied to a minivan in 2016.

==={{Visible anchor|Dodge Caravan EPIC}}===
{{main|Dodge EPIC}}
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

===Crash test results===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler RS platform]] and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work was done by Brandon Faurote from January 1997 and reached production approval in 1998.

In addition to other detailed changes, power sliding doors and a power hatch became available as options. The [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] 3.0 L V6, which no longer met emissions standards in California and the northeastern U.S., was discontinued, and a more powerful 3.8L engine, based on the 3.3L, became available. All Wheel Drive continued to be offered on high end models. Other innovative available features included remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob.

In the 2002 model year, [[DaimlerChrysler]] stopped using the "DODGE" badges on the front doors, like with all Dodge vehicles.

In 2003, the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17&amp;nbsp;inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16&amp;nbsp;inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls.

2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.

2005 changes to the Caravan included a revised grille, new foglight fascia, and a system of in-floor folding second and third row seats, marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Stow 'N Go seating|''Stow 'n Go seating'']].

Production of this generation continued in China from 2008, when the Taiwanese [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] production line was relocated there, until late 2010 when the fifth generation Chrysler Voyager was introduced to the Chinese market. The Caravan was subsequently replaced by the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]], although a page for the Caravan still exists on the Dodge China site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dodge.cn/caravan/index.html |title=Home page |publisher=Chrysler China |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Caravan was produced alongside the Town &amp; Country, now using the Grand Voyager nameplate, by [[Soueast]], and did not share any aesthetic components with the North American Caravan aside from the wheels. Instead, the Chinese Caravan was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, aside from the lack of chrome trim on the exterior door panels, and used a modified version of the Town &amp; Country front bumper with a Dodge grille. Chinese vans were equipped with [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines, and came in three trim levels: Classic, SXT, and Luxury.

===IIHS results===
The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]
's 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

The fifth generation van had debuted at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]] with exterior styling by [[Ralph Gilles]]. Beginning with Generation V in model year 2008, Chrysler only made the long wheelbase Grand Caravan. With discontinuation of the short-wheelbase Caravan, Dodge offered the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] rather than a [[minivan]]. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada,&lt;ref name="CAdriver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Drive: 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan Canada "Value Package" |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Jil |last=McIntosh |date=February 25, 2008 |url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2008-dodge-grand-caravan-canada-value-package/ |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title = Minivan sales slow, hit by gas prices and image |work=USA Today |first=Dee-Ann |last=Durbin |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-06-06-2536673535_x.htm |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new six-speed [[automatic transmission]] became standard with the 3.8 L [[V6 engine|V6]] and the new 4.0 L V6. The four-speed [[automatic transmission]] is standard with the 3.3 L Flex-Fuel V6. This generation of Grand Caravan and its Town &amp; Country counterpart were not available with an all-wheel-drive system. The previously unavailable [[Electronic Stability Control]] was made standard on this generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=Iihs-Hldi |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Swivel 'n Go seating|''Swivel'n Go'']] seating, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with built in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third row video screens, powered second row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. The gear shift lever moved to the instrument panel, the location used by competitors.

The market shifted briefly away from minivans and SUVs with the gasoline price spikes of the earlier part of 2008. This trend began to reverse itself towards the fall of 2008.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; In 2009 and 2010 the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be the top selling minivan in Canada, with over 60% of the market's monthly sales.

''Automotive News'' reported that, from January to October in 2010, Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets. The number of returned ex-rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped fourfold between July to October, depressing prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans by as much as 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101115/RETAIL04/311159986/1251 |title=High fleet sales rates take toll |publisher=Automotive News |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the 3.8 L and 4.0 L engines were paired with Chrysler's 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See [[Ultradrive#62TE]]).

In Canada (2008–2010) the 3.3 L was the standard engine across the range, combined with the 4-speed 41TE automatic transmission. The 4.0 L engine and six-speed combination was available as an option on only the top of the range SXT models. In 2011 the six-speed transmission was specified as standard on the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country|Town &amp; Country]].

===2011 model year update===
[[File:2011 Dodge Grand Caravan -- 06-24-2011.jpg|thumb|Post-facelift 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan]]

The Grand Caravan underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This dramatically improved handling in both the Chrysler and Dodge.

All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] 3.6-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new "double-crosshair" grille on the Grand Caravan and a new chrome grille for the Town &amp; Country.

Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new [[LED]] ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features.&lt;ref name="allpar-2011" /&gt;

For 2012, a new, basic style trim called "AVP" was introduced, while some features previously unavailable for "SE" (like touch navigation panel) become available as options (The "SE" now also received a floor console, similar to the one available for "SXT"). The same year, the front logo design was changed the two slanted rectangles in red to match the rest of the Dodge lineup. For 2013, the "AVP" trim starting MSRP reduced by $1,000 from the year before.

===2014 model year update===
[[File:'14 Dodge Grand Caravan (MIAS '14).jpg|thumb|2014 Dodge Grand Caravan 30th Anniversary Edition on display at the [[Montreal Auto Show]], 22 January 2014]]

For the 2014 model year, three new packages are introduced: American Value Package (US; Canada Value Package in Canada), Blacktop package (US only) and the 30th Anniversary Edition. They are all different sets of the SE and SXT trims, and include new luxury features for basically the same price. The Grand Caravan AVP also gained easy-clean floor mats that came with the optional second-row Stow'n Go seats (standard on SE, SXT and R/T).

The "Blacktop package", based on SE and SXT, came equipped with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black headlamp bezels, an all-black interior including headliner, door panels and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps.

The "SE 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SE trim, came equipped with 17-inch satin carbon aluminum wheels, body-color heated exterior mirrors, 30th Anniversary badging on the front fenders, silver accent stitching and piano black accents throughout, black cloth seats, a black leather-wrapped steering wheel, black leather-wrapped shift knob, black headliner and overhead console, bright heating and air conditioning trim bezels, power second- and third-row windows, and 30th Anniversary logo on the key fob

The "SXT 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SXT trim, was packaged with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with satin carbon pockets, bright chrome roof rack, bright window trim moldings, fog lamps, automatic headlamps and special 30th Anniversary badging, Black Torino leatherette seats with premium suede inserts and silver accent stitching, power 10-way driver's seat, piano black accent trim bezels, and bright chrome accents throughout.

Both 30th Anniversary Editions included an available special body color, Granite Crystal Pearl Coat, a customized gauge cluster with 30th Anniversary badging, as well as the UConnect Handsfree Group ([[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio with a one-year subscription, [[Bluetooth]] streaming audio and voice command and an auto-dimming rear view mirror). The vehicles arrived at dealerships at Q3 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=14744&amp;mid=5 |title=2014 Dodge Grand Caravan Celebrates Its 30th Birthday With Even More Desirable Content and Value |publisher=Chrysler LLC |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/113090462367/dodge-grand-caravan-and-chrysler-town--country-receive |title=Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country receive 30th Anniversary Editions |publisher=Worldcarfans.com |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.caranddriver.com/chrysler-group-celebrates-30-years-of-minivans-with-30th-anniversary-edition-grand-caravan-and-town-country/ |first=Ron |last=Sessions |title=Chrysler Group Celebrates 30 Years of Minivans with 30th Anniversary Edition Grand Caravan and Town &amp; Country |publisher=Blog.caranddriver.com |date=September 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained standard auto headlamps with black bezels and the Security Group featuring remote start and security alarm.

A small 2017 model year update yields SE, SE Plus, SXT, and GT models. The 6.5" Touchscreen (Radio 430 and 430 NAV) became standard equipment. (Navigation is standard on GT and optional on SXT.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodge.com/2017/grand-caravan/technology/index.html |title=2017 Dodge Grand Caravan Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 model year update===
FCA unveiled the [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Chrysler Pacifica]], a new crossover minivan for the 2017 model year, at the 2016 [[North American International Auto Show]].

===Europe===
Originally from 2007 to June 1, 2011, the van was known in Europe as the Chrysler G. Voyager, but since June 1, 2011, it has been known in the UK and Ireland as a Chrysler G. Voyager and in the rest of Europe as a Lancia Voyager. For the European market, the Lancia/Chrysler Voyager will be available in three trim levels (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and two choices of engine: a {{convert|283|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 3.6-liter V6 petrol unit and a 2.8-liter CRD diesel with particulate filter as standard delivering {{convert|163|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-lancia-grand-voyager-minivan-is.html |title=New Lancia Grand Voyager Minivan is a Rebadged Chrysler, and Yes, this Picture Too Appears to be a Chop |date=February 14, 2011 |publisher=Carscoop |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volkswagen Routan ===
{{main|Volkswagen Routan}}
[[File:Routan.jpg|thumb|Volkswagen Routan SE]]
Beginning with Generation V, Volkswagen began marketing the Volkswagen Routan, a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler RT platform]] minivan with revised styling and content, for the North American market. The original contract between Chrysler and Volkswagen called for five years of production (through 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/news/report-volkswagen-routan-minivan-production-ends-191045/ |title=Report: Volkswagen Routan Minivan Production Halted Temporarily |first=Jake |last=Holmes |date=December 12, 2012 |work=Automobile magazine |accessdate= April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Routan, made at [[Windsor Assembly]] alongside the Grand Caravan, debuted in 2008 at the Chicago Auto Show. Sales began in autumn of 2008, and features neither Chrysler's [[Dodge Caravan#Stow'n Go seating|Stow'n Go]] nor [[Dodge Caravan#Swivel 'n Go|Swivel'n Go]] seating systems. When the Chrysler and Dodge badged versions received new features for 2011, not all were shared with the Routan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/reviews/healey/2011-03-17-2011-Volkswagen-Routan-Test-Drive-Healey.htm |title=Volkswagen's Routan has some smooth hustle |date=March 18, 2011 |first=James |last=Healey |work=USAToday |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seating features==
The Caravan has incorporated numerous seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1991, Dodge introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats on 1992 models. These seats continued as an available option through Generation V until they were discontinued in 2010.

===Easy-Out Roller Seats===
In 1995, Dodge introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning, marketed as ''Easy-Out Roller Seats''. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, to simplify installation. Ergonomic levers at the seat backs release the floor latches single-handedly, without tools, and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seat backs were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two and three person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2000, second and third row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three-person 50/50 split "bench"&amp;nbsp;– with each section weighing under {{convert|50|lb|abbr=on}}. The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V – where certain models featured a two-person bench ''and'' the under-floor compartments from the ''Stow'n Go'' system.

All the [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variants]] of the Chrysler minivans use the Easy Out Roller Seats on their second row seating, where not the Stow and Go system.

===Stow 'N Go seating===
In 2004, Dodge introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as ''Stow 'N Go'' and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher =Ameinfo.com |url= http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |date=February 12, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers initially used an [[Erector Set]] to visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=PRnewswire – Chrysler Group |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-brings-minivan-segments-only-stow-n-go-seating-and-storage-system-to-market-in-just-18-months-58686772.html |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; but precluded [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] (AWD).

The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.media.chrysler.com"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;id=129 |title=Stow 'N Go Seating and Storage System Solidifies Dodge Caravan as the Leader in Minivan Sales and Innovations |publisher=Chrysler Group |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award,&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |publisher=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm |date=November 10, 2004 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was never offered on the [[Volkswagen Routan]], the [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

For model year 2011 Chrysler revised the system, rebranding it as "Super Stow 'n Go". New pivoting head restraints with taller seatbacks and a revised folding mechanism (marketed as "single action") improved stowage ease&amp;nbsp;– with the head restraints folding on themselves automatically and the entire seat automatically folding down to a position just over its floor recess.

===Swivel 'n Go seating===
Dodge introduced a seating system in 2007, marketed as ''Swivel 'n Go''. In the seating system, two full size second row [[Swivel seat|seats swivel]] to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats. The Swivel 'n Go seating system includes the third row seating from the Stow 'n Go system. The system is offered on the Dodge Grand Caravan and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], but not the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

These Swivel 'n Go Seats are manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by [[Toyo Seat]] USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

"Swivel 'n Go" was dropped after the 2010 model year and is no longer an option on 2011 and later Chrysler and Dodge vans. However, the seats can still be installed by modifying the van with a few basic tools and parts{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. However, it is impossible to install the table.

==Production==
The long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan with ''Stow 'n Go'' seats are built in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada at [[Windsor Assembly]] (WAP Plant 3) by members of [[Canadian Auto Workers]] Local 444. Both wheelbase models were also produced in [[Fenton, Missouri]] at [[Saint Louis Assembly]] by members of the [[United Auto Workers]] Local 110 until 31 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/corporate/factories.html |title=Chrysler factories, offices, and testing grounds, 1925–2010 |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5245">An '''edge-localized mode''' (“ELM”) is a disruptive [[instability]] occurring in the edge region of a [[tokamak]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] due to the quasi-periodic relaxation of a transport barrier{{clarify|date=December 2015}} previously formed during an {{nobr|L → H}} transition (i.e., in {{nobr|[[high-confinement mode|H-mode]]).}} This phenomenon was first observed in the [[ASDEX Upgrade|ASDEX tokamak]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.|first=Wagner,|last2=A.R.|first2=Field,|last3=G.|first3=Fussmann,|last4=J.V.|first4=Hofmann,|last5=M.E.|first5=Manso,|last6=O.|first6=Vollmer,|last7=José|first7=Matias,|date=1990|title=Recent results of H-mode studies on ASDEX|journal=13th International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion|volume=|pages=|hdl=10198/9098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of edge-localized modes poses a major challenge in [[Magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic fusion]] research with tokamaks, as these instabilities can damage wall components (in particular [[divertor]] plates) by ablating them away due to their extremely high energy transfer rate (GW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/a-third-dimension-helps-tokamak-fusion-reactor-avoid-wall-destroying-instability/|title=A third dimension helps Tokamak fusion reactor avoid wall-destroying instability|last=Lee|first=Chris|date=13 Sep 2018|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation and modeling==
In 2006 an initiative (called Project Aster) was started to simulate a full ELM cycle including its onset, the highly non-linear phase, and its decay. However, this did not constitute a “true” ELM cycle, since a true ELM cycle would require modeling the slow growth after the crash, in order to have a second ELM. In 2015, results of the first simulation to demonstrate repeated ELM cycling was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orain|first=François|last2=Bécoulet|first2=M|last3=Morales|first3=J|last4=Huijsmans|first4=G T A|last5=Dif-Pradalier|first5=G|last6=Hoelzl|first6=M|last7=Garbet|first7=X|last8=Pamela|first8=S|last9=Nardon|first9=E|date=2014-11-28|title=Non-linear MHD modeling of edge localized mode cycles and mitigation by resonant magnetic perturbations|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|volume=57|issue=1|pages=014020|doi=10.1088/0741-3335/57/1/014020|issn=0741-3335}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key element to obtaining repeated relaxations was to include diamagnetic effects in the model equations. Diamagnetic effects have also been shown to expand the size of the parameter space in which solutions of repeated [[Tokamak sawtooth|sawteeth]] can be recovered compared to a resistive MHD model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=F D|last2=Leblond|first2=D|last3=Lütjens|first3=H|last4=Luciani|first4=J-F|date=2010-11-30|title=Oscillation regimes of the internal kink mode in tokamak plasmas|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|volume=53|issue=1|pages=015011|doi=10.1088/0741-3335/53/1/015011|issn=0741-3335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and control==
Research involving prevention of edge localized mode formation is underway. A paper was recently published that suggested a novel method of countering this phenomenon by injecting static magnetic noisy energy into the containment field as a containment-stabilization regime; this may decrease ELM amplitude.{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[ASDEX Upgrade]] has had some success using pellet injection to increase the frequency and thereby decrease the severity of ELM bursts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Control in practice==
As of late 2011, several research facilities have demonstrated active control or suppression of ELMs in tokamak plasmas. For example, the [[KSTAR|KSTAR tokamak]] uses specific asymmetric three-dimensional magnetic field configurations to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/198/950|title=KSTAR announces successful ELM suppression|author=Kwon, Eunhee|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Jong-Kyu|last2=Jeon|first2=YoungMu|last3=In|first3=Yongkyoon|last4=Ahn|first4=Joon-Wook|last5=Nazikian|first5=Raffi|last6=Park|first6=Gunyoung|last7=Kim|first7=Jaehyun|last8=Lee|first8=HyungHo|last9=Ko|first9=WonHa|first10=Hyun-Seok|last10=Kim|first11=Nikolas C.|last11=Logan|first12=Zhirui|last12=Wang|first13=Eliot A.|last13=Feibush|first14=Jonathan E.|last14=Menard|first15=Michael C.|last15=Zarnstroff|date=2018-09-10|title=3D field phase-space control in tokamak plasmas|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0268-8|issn=1745-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11453">'''Fanno flow''' is the [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] flow through a constant area duct where the effect of [[friction]] is considered.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.H., ''The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow, Volume 1'', Ronald Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compressible flow|Compressibility]] effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to [[incompressible flow]]. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow is assumed to be steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.

For a flow with an upstream [[Mach number]] greater than 1.0 in a sufficiently long enough duct, deceleration occurs and the flow can become [[choked flow|choked]]. On the other hand, for a flow with an upstream Mach number less than 1.0, acceleration occurs and the flow can become choked in a sufficiently long duct. It can be shown that for flow of calorically perfect gas the maximum [[entropy]] occurs at [[Mach number|''M'']]&amp;nbsp;= 1.0. Fanno flow is named after [[Gino Girolamo Fanno]].

==Theory==
[[Image:Fanno1.PNG|thumb|500px|'''Figure 1''' A Fanno Line is plotted on the dimensionless H-ΔS axis.]]
The Fanno flow model begins with a [[differential equation]] that relates the change in Mach number with respect to the length of the duct, ''dM/dx''.  Other terms in the differential equation are the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''γ'', the [[Fanning friction factor]], ''f'', and the [[hydraulic diameter]], ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{dM^2}{M^2} = \frac{\gamma M^2}{1 - M^2}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\frac{4f}{D_h}dx &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the Fanning friction factor is a constant along the duct wall, the differential equation can be solved easily.&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, R.D., Biblarz, O., ''Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, B.K., and Koenig, K., ''Compressible Fluid Dynamics with Personal Computer Applications'', Prentice Hall, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  One must keep in mind, however, that the value of the Fanning friction factor can be difficult to determine for [[supersonic]] and especially [[hypersonic]] flow velocities.  The resulting relation is shown below where ''L*'' is the required duct length to choke the flow assuming the upstream Mach number is supersonic.  The left-hand side is often called the Fanno parameter.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{4fL^*}{D_h} = \left(\frac{1 - M^2}{\gamma M^2}\right) + \left(\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma}\right)\ln\left[\frac{M^2}{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Equally important to the Fanno flow model is the dimensionless ratio of the change in entropy over the [[Specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] at constant pressure, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta S = \frac{\Delta s}{c_p} = \ln\left[M^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\left(\left[\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right]\left[1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right]\right)^\frac{-(\gamma + 1)}{2\gamma}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The above equation can be rewritten in terms of a static to stagnation temperature ratio, which, for a calorically perfect gas, is equal to the dimensionless enthalpy ratio, ''H'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ H = \frac{h}{h_0} = \frac{c_pT}{c_pT_0} = \frac{T}{T_0} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta S = \frac{\Delta s}{c_p} = \ln\left[\left(\frac{1}{H} - 1\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{2}{\gamma - 1}\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{2\gamma}\left(\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma}\left(H\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The equation above can be used to plot the Fanno line, which represents a locus of states for given Fanno flow conditions on an ''H''-''ΔS'' diagram.  In the diagram, the Fanno line reaches maximum entropy at ''H''&amp;nbsp;= 0.833 and the flow is choked.  According to the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], entropy must always increase for Fanno flow.  This means that a subsonic flow entering a duct with friction will have an increase in its Mach number until the flow is choked.  Conversely, the Mach number of a supersonic flow will decrease until the flow is choked.  Each point on the Fanno line corresponds with a different Mach number, and the movement to choked flow is shown in the diagram. 

The Fanno line defines the possible states for a gas when the mass flow rate and total enthalpy are held constant, but the momentum varies. Each point on the Fanno line will have a different momentum value, and the change in momentum is attributable to the effects of friction.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomena of Fluid Motions, R. S. Brodkey, p187, R. S. Brodkey (pub), 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Fanno flow relations==
[[Image:Fanno Properties.PNG|thumb|400px|'''Figure 2''' Common thermodynamic property ratios plotted as a function of Mach number using the Fanno flow model.]]
As was stated earlier, the area and mass flow rate in the duct are held constant for Fanno flow.  Additionally, the [[stagnation temperature]] remains constant.  These relations are shown below with the * symbol representing the throat location where choking can occur.  A stagnation property contains a 0 subscript.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= A^* = \mbox{constant} \\
T_0 &amp;= T_0^* = \mbox{constant} \\
\dot{m} &amp;= \dot{m}^* = \mbox{constant} 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Differential equations can also be developed and solved to describe Fanno flow property ratios with respect to the values at the choking location.  The ratios for the pressure, density, temperature, velocity and stagnation pressure are shown below, respectively.  They are represented graphically along with the Fanno parameter.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{p}{p^*} &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)}} \\
\frac{\rho}{\rho^*} &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)} \\
\frac{T}{T^*} &amp;= \frac{1}{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)} \\
\frac{V}{V^*} &amp;= M\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)}} \\
\frac{p_0}{p_0^*} &amp;= \frac{1}{M}\left[\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\left(\gamma - 1\right)}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Fanno flow through a nozzle.png|thumb|500px|'''Figure 3''' A supersonic nozzle leading into a constant area duct is depicted.  The initial conditions exist at point 1.  Point 2 exists at the nozzle throat, where ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 1.  Point 3 labels the transition from isentropic to Fanno flow.  Points 4 and 5 give the pre- and post-shock wave conditions, and point E is the exit from the duct.]]
[[File:H-S graph of a Fanno flow.png|thumb|500px|'''Figure 4''' The ''H''-''S'' diagram is depicted for the conditions of Figure 3. Entropy is constant for isentropic flow, so the conditions at point 1 move down vertically to point 3.  Next, the flow follows the Fanno line until a shock changes the flow from supersonic to subsonic.  The flow then follows the Fanno line again, almost reaching a choked condition before exiting the duct.]]
[[File:Fanno-Rayleigh confrontation graph.png|thumb|500px|'''Figure 5''' Fanno and Rayleigh Line Intersection Chart.]]
The Fanno flow model is often used in the design and analysis of nozzles.  In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with isentropic flow, while the constant area section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow.  For given upstream conditions at point 1 as shown in Figures 3 and 4, calculations can be made to determine the nozzle exit Mach number and the location of a [[normal shock]] in the constant area duct.  Point 2 labels the nozzle throat, where ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 1 if the flow is choked.  Point 3 labels the end of the nozzle where the flow transitions from isentropic to Fanno.  With a high enough initial pressure, supersonic flow can be maintained through the constant area duct, similar to the desired performance of a blowdown-type [[supersonic wind tunnel]].  However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct.  If a shock wave is present, the flow transitions from the supersonic portion of the Fanno line to the subsonic portion before continuing towards ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 1.  The movement in Figure 4 is always from the left to the right in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.

The Fanno flow model is also used extensively with the [[Rayleigh flow]] model.  These two models intersect at points on the enthalpy-entropy and Mach number-entropy diagrams, which is meaningful for many applications.  However, the entropy values for each model are not equal at the sonic state.  The change in entropy is 0 at ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 1 for each model, but the previous statement means the change in entropy from the same arbitrary point to the sonic point is different for the Fanno and Rayleigh flow models.  If initial values of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined, a new equation for dimensionless entropy versus Mach number can be defined for each model.  These equations are shown below for Fanno and Rayleigh flow, respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta S_F &amp;= \frac{s - s_i}{c_p} = \ln\left[\left(\frac{M}{M_i}\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\left(\frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_i^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma}\right] \\
\Delta S_R &amp;= \frac{s - s_i}{c_p} = \ln\left[\left(\frac{M}{M_i}\right)^2\left(\frac{1 + \gamma M_i^2}{1 + \gamma M^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma}\right]
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 5 shows the Fanno and Rayleigh lines intersecting with each other for initial conditions of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 3.  The intersection points are calculated by equating the new dimensionless entropy equations with each other, resulting in the relation below.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_i^2\right)\left[\frac{M_i^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M_i^2\right)^2}\right] = \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\left[\frac{M^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M^2\right)^2}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The intersection points occur at the given initial Mach number and its post-[[normal shock]] value.  For Figure 5, these values are ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 3 and 0.4752, which can be found the normal shock tables listed in most compressible flow textbooks.  A given flow with a constant duct area can switch between the Fanno and Rayleigh models at these points.

These goals are being promoted by activities which are managed and developed through six program areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/program-areas.78.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council Program Areas |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; forests, [[chain of custody]], [[social policy]], [[monitoring and evaluation]], [[quality assurance]] and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carafina.us/eco-friendly|title=Forest Stewardship Council Standards|publisher=Carafina.us|accessdate=2015-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708125355/http://carafina.us/eco-friendly|archivedate=8 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It claims that forests managed to its standards offer benefits to both local and wider communities and these are said to include cleaner air and water, and a contribution to mitigating the effects of [[climate change]].

Directly or indirectly, FSC addresses issues such as [[illegal logging]], [[deforestation]] and [[global warming]] and some reports indicate positive effects on economic development, [[environmental conservation]], poverty alleviation and social and political [[empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/where/russia/publications/index.cfm?uNewsID=18510|title=The effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK.

== History ==

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]], half of the world’s forests have already been altered, [[forest degradation|degraded]], destroyed or converted into other land uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/site/28679/en/ |title=UN FAO facts and figures |publisher=Fao.org |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010175438/http://www.fao.org/forestry/site/28679/en |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the remaining forests today suffer from [[Illegal logging|illegal exploitation]] and otherwise poor management. FSC was established as a response to these concerns over global [[deforestation]].

[[Tropical deforestation]] as a global concern rose to prominence in the 1980s and can be somewhat attributed to a fight for action by [[environmentalist]]s and northern countries over the need to protect tropical woodland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphreys|first=David|title=Forest politics: the evolution of international cooperation |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=9781853833786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirton, John J., and Trebilcock, M.J. 2004"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Kirton | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Trebilcock | editor-first2 = Michael J. | title = Hard choices, soft law: voluntary standards in global trade, environment, and social governance | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, Hants, England Brookfield, Vermont, USA | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780754609667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, a number of other economic and regulatory mechanisms such as financial aid, policy frameworks and trade conventions were established in the fight against deforestation. These include the [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|International Tropical Timber Agreement]] (1983), the [[CITES|Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species]] (1975) and the [[Global Environment Facility]] (1991). Despite the increased level of concern on the run-up to the [[1992 Earth Summit]] held in Rio de Janeiro, tensions between the North and the global South over access to finance and technology for the preservation of forests protracted negotiations.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=David|title=The Politics of ‘Avoided Deforestation’: Historical Context and Contemporary Issues|journal=International Forestry Review|year=2008|volume=10|issue=3|pages=433–442|doi=10.1505/ifor.10.3.433| url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1505/ifor.10.3.433 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Northern countries had hoped for a legally binding convention the resulting [[Statement of Forest Principles]] represents the "mean position of the lowest common denominator"&lt;ref name="Humphreys" /&gt; and is voluntary. Disappointed with the outcome of the Earth Summit, NGOs such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) began to turn their attention to industry for a more meaningful governance-orientated resolution to the problem of deforestation.&lt;ref name="Murphy, D.F. and Bendell, J 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Murphy, D.F.  |author2=Bendell, J|title=The Earthscan reader in Business and Sustainable Development|year=2001|publisher=Earthscan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the Earth Summit, social groups, NGOs and industries were also beginning to consult on the issue of deforestation. In America the consultation process that eventually led to the establishment of the FSC was initiated in 1990 and concluded in the confirmation of support for the development of a voluntary worldwide certification and accreditation governance system that would cover all forest types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/our-history.17.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Our History |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] WWF began to facilitate action through the establishment of the [http://gftn.panda.org/newsroom/?199205/The-WWF-1995-Group-a-Network-is-Born 1995 Group], recruiting organisations that had been spurred on by instances of direct action and [[boycott]]ing over the sale of [[tropical timber|tropical wood]] to form an NGO-business partnership.&lt;ref name="Murphy, D.F. and Bendell, J 2001"/&gt; Through stakeholder involvement it became apparent that a standard-setting body would be required to verify the source of wood products and define [[sustainable forestry|sustainable forest management]]. After 18 months of consultation in ten different countries, the Forest Stewardship Council was finally established in 1993.
{{bias|date=December 2017}}
The failure of governments to reach any notable form of consensus in the form of an internationally reaching and legally binding agreement caused both disillusionment and an opportunity for change through the involvement of civil society and business actors to form "soft law".&lt;ref name="Kirton, John J., and Trebilcock, M.J. 2004" /&gt; As such the establishment of the Forest Stewardship Council as the response to this disillusionment also represents a global shift from government to [[environmental governance|governance]] and its creation is a primary example of the use of market and economic factors to create movement on a global [[environmental issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tollefson, Chris, Gale, Fred and Haley, David|title=Setting the Standard: Certification, Governance, and the Forest Stewardship Council|year=2008|publisher=UBC|location=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolving historical context in which the FSC was formed is theorised to reflect a much broader skepticism towards state power and as a consequence a shift away from traditional state-centric forms of regulation. That said, although the FSC transcends national boundaries, the state continues to play a part in the regulatory landscape of the domestic forest and as such the FSC must develop appropriate domestic governance to reflect this.&lt;ref name="Kirton, John J., and Trebilcock, M.J. 2004"/&gt;

== Structure and governance ==

FSC is an international membership organization with a governance structure based on participation, democracy, equity and transparency.&lt;ref name="ic.fsc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/governance.14.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council® · Governance |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a platform for [[forest owner]]s, [[timber industry|timber industries]], social groups and [[environmental organization]]s to come together to find solutions to improve forest management practices.

It is governed by its members, who join either as individuals or as representatives of organisations; they come from diverse backgrounds including environmental NGOs, the [[timber trade]], community forest groups and [[forest certification]] organizations. Members apply to join one of three chambers – environmental, social and economic; each chamber is divided into northern and southern sub-chambers and votes are weighted to ensure that north and south each have 50%; this system is designed to ensure that influence is shared equally between different interest groups, without having to limit the number of members.&lt;ref name="ic.fsc.org"/&gt;

FSC has three levels of decision making bodies: The General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/general-assembly.239.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council ® · General Assembly |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/board-of-directors.210.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council ® · Board of Directors |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/director-general.211.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council ® · Director General |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The General Assembly, which takes place every three years, is made up of the three membership chambers and is the highest decision-making body in FSC. The most recent General Assembly took place in 2014. Every member has the right to attend, formulate and submit motions, and vote. The General Assembly represents an opportunity for everybody to share, learn, establish new alliances and exchange and explore business opportunities to create a better future of the forests.

*The FSC Board of Directors is accountable to the FSC members. It is made up of nine elected individuals who are FSC members and advocates. One member of the Board of Directors is elected from each sub-chamber of the General Assembly.

*The Executive Director runs FSC on a day-to-day basis with the support of a multi-cultural professional team at the FSC International Center. He or she is accountable to the FSC Board of Directors.

While the FSC International Center is based in Bonn, Germany, it has a decentralized network of FSC Network Partners&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;July 2012, Procedure for the operation of the FSC Network FSC-PRO-60-001 V1-0 EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that promote responsible forest management on behalf of FSC. FSC Network Partners include FSC National Offices, FSC National Representatives and FSC National Focal Points.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Standards, certification and accreditation ==

=== Standards development===

FSC is a global [[forest certification]] system established for forests and [[forest product]]s; from the perspective of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] this voluntary mechanism can be regarded as one of the more interesting initiatives of the last decade to promote better [[forest management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/fscsummaryanalysisallcountries.pdf |title=The effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK; WWF (2005) |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of alternative national and regional forest certification bodies also exist around the globe
It has 10 Principles and associated Criteria (FSC P&amp;C) that form the basis for all FSC forest management standards and certification. FSC International sets the framework for developing and maintaining international, national and sub-national standards. This is intended to ensure that the process for developing FSC policies and standards is transparent, independent and participatory.

In February 2012 the membership approved the first major revision to the FSC P&amp;C, in order to bring its certification up to date.&lt;ref name="igi.fsc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igi.fsc.org/ |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council ® · Getting Started |publisher=Igi.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review and revision of the FSC P&amp;C began in 2008 and gathered feedback from many FSC members and other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/what-was-the-process-for-the-review-and-revision-of-the-revised-pc.455.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council ® · What was the process for the review and revision of the revised P&amp;C? |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |date=2008-09-03 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This revision also marked the start of a process of developing baseline requirements for each of the revised Criteria;&lt;ref name="igi.fsc.org"/&gt; These requirements - called International Generic Indicators (IGIs) - are intended to ensure consistent application of the FSC P&amp;C across all countries. Where national standards are not currently established, the IGIs will be used as interim standards.

=== Forest management certification ===
Forest management certification is a voluntary process for verifying responsible forest practices. It is up to a forest owner, or representative of a group of forest owners and operators, to initiate the certification process by requesting an independent certifier to inspect the forest and to see if the management meets the FSC requirements, encapsulated in the FSC P&amp;C.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Only an FSC accredited certification body can evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards, and only continuous compliance can assure that certificate holders can keep their certificates; these holders are charged  an annual fee to renew their accreditation.

The FSC P&amp;C apply to all tropical, [[temperate forest|temperate]] and [[boreal forest]]s and many to plantations and partially replanted forests. Though mainly designed for forest management for timber products, they are also largely relevant for non-timber products (e.g. Brazil nuts) and other environmental services such as clean water and air and [[carbon sequestration]]. The FSC Principles are a complete package and their sequence does not represent an ordering of priority. Prior to the revision process which ended in February 2012, the FSC P&amp;C were the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|+
|No.||Principle
|-
| 1|| Compliance with all applicable laws and international treaties.
|-
| 2|| Demonstrated and uncontested, clearly defined, long–term land tenure and use rights.
|-
| 3|| Recognition and respect of [[indigenous people]]’s rights.
|-
| 4|| Maintenance or enhancement of long-term social and economic [[well-being]] of forest workers and local communities and respect of worker’s rights in compliance with [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) conventions.
|-
| 5|| Equitable use and sharing of benefits derived from the forest.
|-
| 6|| Reduction of [[environmental impact]] of [[logging]] activities and maintenance of the ecological functions and integrity of the forest.
|-
| 7|| Appropriate and continuously updated management plan.
|-
| 8|| Appropriate monitoring and assessment activities to assess the condition of the forest, management activities and their social and environmental impacts.
|-
| 9|| Maintenance of [[High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs)]] defined as forests containing environmental and social values that are considered to be of outstanding significance or critical importance.
|-
| 10|| In addition to compliance with all of the above, [[plantation]]s must contribute to reduce the pressures on and promote the restoration and conservation of natural forests.

|}

The Revised P&amp;C were approved in February 2012 but will not be used for audit until the FSC IGIs are also complete. The full text of the revised P&amp;C can be found on the FSC website &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/the-revised-pc.191.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council· The Revised P&amp;C |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the basic principles are listed below.

# The Organization shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and nationally-ratified international treaties, conventions and agreements.
# The Organization shall maintain or enhance the social and economic wellbeing of workers.
# The Organization shall identify and uphold indigenous peoples’ legal and customary rights of ownership, use and management of land, territories and resources affected by management activities.
# The Organization shall contribute to maintaining or enhancing the social and economic wellbeing of local communities
# The Organization shall efficiently manage the range of multiple products and services of the Management Unit to maintain or enhance long term economic viability and the range of environmental and social benefits.
# The Organization shall maintain, conserve and/or restore ecosystem services and environmental values of the Management Unit, and shall avoid, repair or mitigate negative environmental impacts.
# The Organization shall have a management plan consistent with its policies and objectives and proportionate to scale, intensity and risks of its management activities. The management plan shall be implemented and kept up to date based on monitoring information in order to promote [[adaptive management]]. The associated planning and procedural documentation shall be sufficient to guide staff, inform affected stakeholders and interested stakeholders and to justify management decisions.
# The Organization shall demonstrate that, progress towards achieving the management objectives, the impacts of management activities and the condition of the Management Unit, are monitored and evaluated proportionate to the scale, intensity and risk of management activities, in order to implement adaptive management.
# The Organization shall maintain and/or enhance the High Conservation Values in the Management Unit through applying the [[precautionary]] approach.
# Management activities conducted by or for The Organization for the Management Unit shall be selected and implemented consistent with The Organization’s economic, environmental and social policies and objectives and in compliance with the Principles and Criteria collectively.

FSC accredited certification bodies certify and audit each individual forest management operation. If the forest management is in full compliance with FSC requirements, the FSC certificate is awarded. If the forest management is not fully compliant, pre-conditions are noted which must be fulfilled before the FSC certificate can be awarded. If minor non-compliances are noted, the certificate can be issued with conditions that have to be met within a clearly determined timeframe.

Once certification is awarded, FSC accredited certification bodies audit each FSC certificate at least once a year. If during these audits the certification body finds that a company has non-compliances with FSC requirements, Corrective Action Requests (CARs) are issued and the company is required to make the prescribed changes within a given timeframe or lose its FSC certificate. Depending on the seriousness of the infringement, the timeline can go from one year for minor administrative infringements to immediate action for major infringements.

=== Chain of Custody certification ===

The FSC [[chain of custody|Chain of Custody]] (CoC) system allows the tracking of FSC certified material from the forest to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/chain-of-custody-certification.39.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Chain of Custody Certification |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a method by which companies can show their commitment to the environment and responsible forest management. Only companies that have FSC chain of custody certification are allowed to use the FSC [[trademark]]s and labels to promote their products. The FSC label therefore provides a link between responsible production and responsible consumption and helps the consumer to make socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions.

Once a forest is certified it is important to be able to trace the products that come from it throughout the supply chain to ensure that any claims on the origin of the product are credible and verifiable. FSC chain of custody certification is a voluntary process. It is a tracking system that allows manufacturers and traders to demonstrate that timber comes from a forest that is responsibly managed in accordance with the FSC P&amp;C. It tracks the flow of certified wood through the supply chain and across borders through each successive stage - including processing, transformation and manufacturing - all the way to the final product. It is up to a company to initiate the certification process by requesting the services of an independent certification body to inspect its internal tracking procedures. Only FSC-accredited certification bodies can evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards. Companies committing to FSC include home-improvement or DIY companies, publishers and retailers, amongst many others.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

All operations that want to produce an FSC certified product or want to make corresponding sales claims must comply with FSC’s international standards for chain of custody. An operation must specify the range of products they wish to sell as FSC certified and promote with the FSC trademark. The certification body inspects the operation to ensure that controls are in place to identify eligible sources for the specified product range and to prevent certified and recycled material from mixing with material from unacceptable sources. If an operation complies with FSC standards, the company is issued an FSC chain of custody certificate. Major failure to comply with the standard will normally disqualify the candidate from certification or lead to de-certification.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Controlled Wood certification ===

The FSC Mix label was introduced in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/controlled-wood.40.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Controlled Wood |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows manufacturers to mix FSC certified material with uncertified materials in FSC labelled products under controlled conditions. It aims to avoid the use of wood products from "unacceptable" sources in FSC labelled products. Unacceptable sources include illegally harvested wood, wood harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights, wood harvested in HCV forests and wood harvested from areas where [[genetically modified tree]]s are planted.

===Accreditation===

To maintain independence between the standards it sets and the operations seeking certification of both kinds, FSC does not conduct certification audits itself. FSC has developed rigorous procedures and standards to evaluate whether organizations of certifiers (certification bodies) can provide independent and competent evaluation (certification) services. This process is known as ‘accreditation’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/accreditation.28.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Accreditation |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential certification body must gain FSC accreditation to be able to evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards. To become FSC accredited, certifiers have to comply with an extensive set of rules and procedures which are verified by ASI -  Accreditation Services International GmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.accreditation-services.com/ | publisher = Accreditation Services International }}&lt;/ref&gt; - an international third-party accreditation body, which also serves as sole accreditation body for other sustainability standards such as [[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC]] and [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil|RSPO]]. This includes an office audit and the witnessing of one or more trial audits in the field. ASI monitors accredited certification bodies to ensure the appropriateness of their operations can be continuously guaranteed.

To control the continued implementation of FSC rules and procedures, every year ASI conducts at least one office and one field assessment for each FSC accredited certification body. The exact number and distribution of ASI assessments takes a number of complex factors into account (geographic areas, policies or products that carry increased risk) and the number of FSC certificates handled by an accredited certification body, and is meant to ensure that the certification services delivered by the certifier meet the requirements of the FSC.

Some summaries of ASI surveillance audits are publicly available on the ASI website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.accreditation-services.com |title=ASI-Accreditation Services International GmbH |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an FSC accredited certification body is found to not fully comply with FSC rules and procedures, nonconformities (NCs) are raised (see above).

===Facts and figures ===

In September 2012, some 165 million hectares were certified to FSC’s Principles and Criteria in 80 countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/facts-figures.19.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Facts &amp; Figures |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 24,000 FSC Chain of Custody certificates were active in 107 countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The FSC website has statistics on regional distributions, ownership and forest type and numbers of FSC certificates &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; representing all valid forest management and chain of custody certificates.

=== Costs ===

The expenses for successful forest management certification typically are divided into:

* Costs for an enhancement of sustainability;
* Costs for audits (these are controlled by third parties); and
* Secondary costs (e.g. losses of stumpage revenues).&lt;ref&gt;European Forest Institute. "Certification Information Service: Source Book." Section 1, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FSC Friday ===

FSC Friday is a once-a-year-event dedicated to the celebration of forests around the globe, and the promotion of responsible forest management worldwide. The first international FSC Friday took place in Bonn on 25 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/FSC-Friday/126717584040480 |title=Welcome to Facebook - Log In, Sign Up or Learn More |publisher=Facebook.com |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On FSC Friday, people are invited to investigate what’s in their shopping basket, and look for the FSC logo. Events related to FSC Friday take place around the world with companies and supporters promoting the FSC logo and what it stands for.  FSC Friday in 2010 took place on 24 September and the following week. Events took place at FSC certified forests, schools, universities and community centers around the world, including the United Kingdom, Austria, South Africa, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, France, India, Wales, Switzerland and Singapore.

== Support and criticism of FSC certification ==

=== Support ===

FSC has around 850 members. The range of member organizations illustrates the diversity of support for FSC. Members include
* several international [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/campaigning/what_wood_you_choose/ |title=What Wood You Choose? - WWF UK |publisher=Wwf.org.uk |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101083300/http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/campaigning/what_wood_you_choose/ |archivedate=1 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxfam/NOVIB;
* smaller, national NGOs, often with a conservation or environmental focus, such as the US [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[Spanish Ornithological Society]] and [[Cameroon Environmental Watch]];
* civil society organizations with a community development focus, such as the [[Foundation for People and Community Development]] (Papua New Guinea) and the [[Mountain Association for Community Development]] (USA);
* [[forestry]]-focused research organizations, such as the [[Forestry Science and Research Institute]] (Brazil);
* [[certification organization]]s, such as KPMG Forest Certification Solutions (Canada), Forest Eco Certification (India) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestecocertification.com/|title=Home Front Page|author=|date=|website=forestecocertification.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Wood Certification Ltd (India);
* [[private companies]] in the forestry, timber and [[paper industry|paper industries]], such as [[Mondi]] (South Africa) [[Sun Wood Industries]] (Thailand) and [[IKEA]] (Sweden);

FSC is a member of the [[International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling]] (ISEAL) Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/ |title=ISEAL - International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance - ISEAL Alliance Home Page |publisher=Isealalliance.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association of voluntary international standard setting and certification organizations focused on social and environmental issues. Since 2006, FSC has complied with ISEAL’s Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/our-work/codes-of-good-practice |title=Our Codes of Good Practice |publisher=ISEAL Alliance |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at assuring high standards for credible behavior in ethical trade.

In 2009, FSC began a pilot project with [[Fairtrade]] International (FLO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/our_vision.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO) / About us / Our vision |publisher=Fairtrade.net |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130222845/http://www.fairtrade.net/our_vision.html |archivedate=30 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to help community-based and small-scale timber producers get a fair price for their products and gain visibility in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = FSC Factsheet | url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/2012-01_Fairtrade_and_FSC_factsheet_final.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Fairtrade]] | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first jointly labelled FSC-FLO products went onto the market in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekobai.com/analysis/update/96/first-flo-and-fsc-dual-certified-products-due-on-market-this-autumn-june-2011/ |title=First FLO and FSC dual-certified products due on market this Autumn (June 2011) &amp;#124; Read organic Market Analysis &amp; Business News |publisher=Ekobai.com |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSC also works in liaison with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). It contributes to the ISO’s committees on sustainable criteria for [[bioenergy]], [[environmental auditing]] and [[environmental labelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/organizations_in_liaison/organizations_in_liaison_details.htm?id=9891&amp;LiaisonList=True |title=Organizations in liaison |publisher=ISO |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Since it was founded, FSC has been criticized for a range of different reasons.

In recent years, a number of well-known NGOs and environmental organizations have canceled their support for FSC. These include [[FERN]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;FERN statement to the Forest Stewardship Council: Why FERN is withdrawing its FSC membership (2 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth UK]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2008/09/22/Friends_of_the_Earth |title=Friends of the Earth EWNI: "FSC not recommended" |publisher=FSC-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Wood (environmental organisation)|ROBINWOOD]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2009/03/17/Key_German_NGO_quits |title=Key German NGO quits FSC in disgust at plantation certifications |publisher=FSC-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Swedish Society for Nature Conservation]] (SSNC) (2011),&lt;ref name="fsc-watch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2011/06/17/FSC__Greenwashing__F |title=FSC "Greenwashing" Forest Exploitation in Africa |publisher=FSC-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller groups such as [[Rettet den Regenwald|Rainforest Rescue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/tropical-timber/faq |title=Facts about tropical timber |publisher=Rainforest-rescue.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Association for the Ecological Defence of Galicia]] (ADEGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2008/05/28/Another_NGO_quits_FS |title=Another NGO quits FSC in protest against NORFOR plantations |publisher=FSC-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other NGO members, instead of withdrawing support, have critically evaluated FSC’s performance and made recommendations to improve the credibility of the organization. These include [[Greenpeace International]], whose 2008 report ‘Holding the line with FSC’ focused on controversial certificates and ways forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/holding-the-line-with-fsc/|title=Holding the line with FSC|author=|date=|website=Greenpeace International|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version of the report was released in 2011, which concluded that some progress had been made. But it also identified ongoing weaknesses, including lack of guidance on HCVFs and activities in controversial areas like the [[Congo Basin]] and problems with the Controlled Wood label, the Chain of Custody system and logo integrity.  The report concluded with 10 immediate changes needed to "restore FSC’s credibility".&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/forests/2011/Holding%20the%20Line%20Reloaded%20-%20Nov%202010.pdf|title=Holding the Line Reloaded}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve its process for tracking FSC certified products and maintaining the veracity of FSC claims, FSC is currently developing an Online Claims Platform (http://claims-forum.fsc.org/) and is pursuing opportunities for fiber testing.  Chamber-balanced Working Groups have been established to strengthen the Controlled Wood system and the Chain of Custody standard, and options are being pursued to address the performance of certification bodies.

Greenpeace International announced on 3/26/18 that it is not renewing its membership in the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) (https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/15589/greenpeace-international-to-not-renew-fsc-membership/)

FSC has been harshly criticized by Simon Counsel, one of its founding members, now the director of the [[Rainforest Foundation Fund|Rainforest Foundation]]. In 2008, he described the FSC as the "[[Enron]] of Forestry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc.org/fileadmin/web-data/public/document_center/publications/fact_sheets/Complaints_procedure-EN.pdf?PHPSESSID=d4f26a0f22bb39797d920a4a1f34095c |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Home |publisher=Fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited case studies from six countries [reference needed] which suggested that in these cases FSC was not properly controlling accredited auditors or certifiers. The FSC reviewed the certificates in question, and showed that some of the initial investigations were justified. This resulted in the removal of the license to certify from the Thai company, Forest Industry Organisation.

FSC-Watch is a website critical of FSC which is run by a group of people, including Simon Counsel, who are concerned about what they perceive as the constant and serious erosion of the FSC's reliability and credibility. Its website offers a wide range of extensive and detailed criticisms of FSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsc-watch.org/ |title=Fsc-Watch |publisher=Fsc-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSC-Watch commonly accuses FSC of practices that are a form of [[greenwashing]].&lt;ref name="fsc-watch.org"/&gt;

In 2008, the EcoEarth/Rainforest Portal, an Internet ecological news aggregation service, publicly questioned the FSC-endorsed policy of old-growth forest logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Glen Barry on March 5, 2008 1:21 PM |url=http://www.rainforestportal.org/issues/2008/03/alert_stop_the_forest_liars_ce.asp |title=Rainforest Protection Issues: ALERT: Stop the Forest Liars: "Certified" Old-Growth Rainforest Logging Does NOT Protect Biodiversity, Ecosystems or Climate |publisher=Rainforestportal.org |date=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asserted that research does not support the idea that this type of logging is [[carbon positive]] or sustainable, though these views are disputed.

Critics are encouraged to file complaints and disputes against FSC in case of any differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/complaints-resolution.306.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Complaints Resolution |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But complainants must meet a number of conditions to be able to file complaints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/overview.151.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Overview |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is disputed whether the FSC takes effective action even in the case of some formal complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsc-watch.org/archives/2012/03/26/FSC_Complaints_Panel |title=FSC Complaints Panel says organisation 'needs to control certifiers better': SmartWood "undermines" the FSC |publisher=FSC-Watch |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, FSC has implemented a series of actions to strengthen its stakeholder engagement process, including the establishment of a Quality Assurance Unit within FSC, time-bound dispute resolution procedures and a web-based portal for tracking disputes (https://ic.fsc.org/dispute-resolution.139.htm).

====Preference for bigger companies====
Some critics{{who|date=January 2013}} point out that FSC certification has a linked set of weaknesses: that it is not suited for small businesses, that it is anti-competitive and that therefore in a wider view it is counter-ecological:

* Only large businesses with rigid structures can afford the process of assessment and maintenance of the schemes.
* Certification schemes are anti-competitive because they favor larger firms over smaller ones.
* This bias towards large companies is counter-ecological as it promotes a model of a few massive suppliers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Fewer local companies mean that goods have to travel farther, and the resources and skills of local communities degrade.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Partly in response to these criticisms, to make certification more accessible to [[small and medium-sized business]]es, FSC instituted the Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests (SLIMF) initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.fsc.org/options-for-certification.167.htm |title=FSC Forest Stewardship Council · Options for Certification |publisher=Ic.fsc.org |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and group certification. SLIMF adapts the FSC system to the realities and needs of small and low intensity forest operations by offering special streamlined procedures, with less rigorous requirements for a number of its forest management criteria. SLIMF are defined as forests of 100 [[hectare]]s or less. Group certification allows a group of forest owners to share certification costs. A documented success of group certification in a developing country involved smallholder farmers growing [[acacia]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer|first=Matthew|title=Group Forest Certification for Smallholders in Vietnam: An Early Test and Future Prospects|journal=Human Ecology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=5–14|doi=10.1007/s10745-011-9451-6 |date = February 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-011-9451-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, farmers were able to sell group certified wood at a premium versus comparable non-certified wood. In October 2012, worldwide, 8.7% of FSC certificates were held by community-owned forests.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; SLIMF and group certification are intended to allow FSC to promote responsible forest management in small-scale forests as well as large ones.

====Resolute Forest Products====
The world's largest manager of FSC certified forests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.ca/?10961/Resolute-Forest-Products-Now-Worlds-Largest-Manager-of-Forest-Stewardship-Council-Certified-Forests |title=World Wildlife Federation Congratulates Resolute Forest Products |publisher=Wwf.ca |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resolute Forest Products]], has been accused of illegal logging on Barriere Lake [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] territory and of violating indigenous rights. In July 2012, members of the Algonquin community in southern Quebec staged a camp to observe and deter the logging of their unceded territory. In an interview Michel Thusky, an elder of the Barriere Lake Algonquin, had this to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The worst thing about it is they have gotten the Forest Stewardship Council Certification for their products. That is a total shame... They [Resolute Forest Products] cut last Tuesday and we interrupted them. We asked them to stop until we have a meaningful consultation. We extended our respect but they failed. On July 9th they sent a riot squad and many police officers, what they call Sûreté du Québec, security of Quebec.
They put conditions on us. They put a blockade on us, in the Algonquin birth place. If we go past a certain line, they say they will arrest us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/07/13/sustainable-colonialism-in-the-boreal-forest/ |title=McSpadden, Russ; "Sustainable Colonialism", Counter Punch, August 2012 |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The firm has a different view of related events, stating that their "right to harvest in the area [had] been approved by the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife (Quebec)|QMNRW]], following appropriate consultation with the Barrière Lake Algonquin band council."&lt;ref&gt;[http://resolutefp.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=28238&amp;item=130649 "Resolute Forest Products Provides Clarity About its Woodlands Operations Near Barrière Lake, Quebec" &amp;#91;press release&amp;#93;, Resolute Forest Products, July 18, 2012.] Accessed: January 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== FSC as market-driven environmental governance ==

Because it works outside of state regulations, some academics have classified FSC as an example of a non-state market driven (NSMD) form of environmental governance.&lt;ref name=Cashore&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cashore | first = Benjamin | title = Legitimacy and the privatization of environmental governance: how Non–State Market–Driven (NSMD) governance systems gain rule–making authority | journal = [[Governance (journal)|Governance]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–529 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1468-0491.00199 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0491.00199 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it uses the market to drive the [[sustainable management]] of forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cashore | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Auld | first2 = Graeme | last3 = Newsom | first3 = Deanna | title = Governing through markets forest certification and the emergence of non-state authority | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780300133110 }}
*''See also'': {{citation | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = Steven | last2 = Cashore | first2 = Benjamin | contribution = Nonstate global governance: is forest certification a legitimate alternative to a global forest convention? | editor-last1 = Kirton | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Trebilcock | editor-first2 = Michael J. | title = Hard choices, soft law: voluntary standards in global trade, environment, and social governance | pages = 33–64 | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, Hants, England Brookfield, Vermont, USA | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780754609667 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://environment.yale.edu/files/biblio/YaleFES-00000156.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; As Cashore (2002) observes the FSC network does not have the political authority of a traditional nation state and no one can be fined or imprisoned for failing to comply with its regulations. In addition, governments are forbidden from being members of the FSC and their only engagement with FSC is as land owners. The authority of the FSC is determined by the approval of external audiences, such as environmental NGOs.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"/&gt;

The FSC Label is an example of the use of  public purchasing power to create shifts in industry and regulate the negative environmental impacts of deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Maurie J. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = Joseph | title = Exploring sustainable consumption: environmental policy and the social sciences | publisher = Pergamon | location = Amsterdam New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780080439204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSC Label ‘works’ by providing an incentive for responsible forestry in the market place. It offers manufacturers a competitive advantage and thereby increases market access to new markets and maintains access to existing ones.

Non-state market-driven methods are often used because of allegations of ‘state failure’ in managing the environment. In the neoliberal view, market based methods are seen as one of the most effective and efficient ways to meet environmental goals. The market is seen as the key mechanism for producing the maximum social good and governance networks are seen as the most efficient way to regulate environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R. A. W. | author-link = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Understanding governance: policy networks, governance, reflexivity, and accountability | publisher = Open University Press | location = Buckingham Philadelphia | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780335197279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSC transnational NGO network demonstrates theories of [[global governance]], more specifically in governance network theory. FSC is an example of how [[network governance]] can create change in industry and encourage organizations to improve the sustainability of industrial forestry practices. As Bäckstrand (2008) states, the FSC governance network brings together private companies, organizations and civil society in a non-hierarchical fashion, to voluntarily address certain goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bäckstrand | first = Karin | title = Accountability of networked climate governance: the rise of transnational climate partnerships | journal = [[Global Environmental Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 74–102 | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | doi = 10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.74 | date = August 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.74 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to governance network theory, actors in the network are dependent on each other and collaborate to reach specific goals, through exchanging information or resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Eva | last2 = Torfing | first2 = Jacob | title = Theories of democratic network governance | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781403995285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the chamber system, governance of FSC has checks at local, national and international levels which mean that it includes interests regardless of their geographical location. This gives FSC some advantages over state governance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Fred|title=Regulating the market in an era of globalisation: global governance via the Forest Stewardship Council|publisher=[[Australasian Political Studies Association]]|year=2006 |oclc = 897009777 |url =http://www.unece.lsu.edu/certificate_eccos/documents/2007July/ce_017.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, as a governance network, FSC members share knowledge, environmental goals and  knowledge of what those goals entail. This means that they coordinate effectively, improving the process and outcomes of the environmental policies they pursue. Moreover, knowledge sharing and collaboration enables the FSC network to deal with complex and interrelated issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Eva |last2=Triantafillou|first2= Peter | title = The politics of self-governance | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | location = Farnham, England Burlington, Vermont | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780754692812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critiques however suggest that network governance does not always work this way. Network governance theory suggests that partnerships should be equal, but inequalities of power within networks can result in hierarchical relationships determined by more dominant actors. Within FSC, lareger international actors may have a stronger influence than smaller stakeholders, meaning that the FSC governance network may not represent all participants fairly. FSC has instituted the chamber system to try and tackle this imbalance.

Furthermore, actors in networks operate as representatives of certain groups but also as individuals with their own agendas and values, and members in the FSC network are usually motivated by pragmatic rather than moral considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Klooster | first = Dan | title = Environmental certification of forests: the evolution of environmental governance in a commodity network | journal = Journal of Rural Studies, special issue: Certifying Rural Spaces: Quality-Certified Products and Rural Governance | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 403–417 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.08.005 | date = October 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.08.005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Sorenson and Torfing (2005) argue that for governance networks to achieve their goals they should be controlled by democratically elected politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Eva | last2 = Torfing | first2 = Jacob | title = The democratic anchorage of governance networks | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–218 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2005.00129.x | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2005.00129.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although formerly there were no elections in the FSC governance system, reforms mean that the Board of Directors is now democratically elected by the membership chambers.

== Competing certification schemes ==

There are a number of certification schemes for forest management apart from FSC certification.&lt;ref name="whyfsc.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=WhyFSC |url=http://whyfsc.com/index1.asp?menu=7&amp;sub=101 |title=WhyFSC Genuine responsible forest management FSC |publisher=Whyfsc.com |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main competing forest certification system is the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC), established by a number of stakeholders, including associations of the forest industry, pulp-and-paper production and forest owners in response to the creation and increasing popularity of FSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Reference 24 | url = http://www.pefc.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; PEFC has been criticized for having little influence from local people or environmental organizations, lack of transparency and non-objective requirements.&lt;ref name="whyfsc.com"/&gt;

Other certification schemes include [[American Forest and Paper Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A comparison of the American Forest &amp; Paper Association's sustainable forestry initiative and the Forest Stewardship Council's certification system | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155734/http://www.yale.edu/forestcertification/pdfs/auditprograms.pdf | archive-date = 13 May 2013 | url = http://www.yale.edu/forestcertification/pdfs/auditprograms.pdf | publisher = [[American Forest and Paper Association]] | date = June 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Malaysian Timber Certification Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtcc.com.my/ |title=Malaysian Timber Certification Council |publisher=Mtcc.com.my |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Forestry Standard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestrystandard.org.au/ |title=Australian Forestry Standard |publisher=Forestrystandard.org.au |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keurhout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keurhout.nl/en |title=Keurhout |publisher=Keurhout.nl |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gas exchange''' is the physical process by which gases move passively by [[Diffusion#Diffusion vs. bulk flow|diffusion]] across a surface. For example, this surface might be the air/water interface of a water body, the surface of a gas bubble in a liquid, a gas-permeable [[membrane]], or a [[biological membrane]] that forms the boundary between an organism and its extracellular environment.

Gases are constantly consumed and produced by [[Metabolism|cellular and metabolic reactions]] in most living things, so an efficient system for gas exchange between, ultimately, the interior of the cell(s) and the external environment is required. Small, particularly unicellular organisms, such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[protozoa]], have a high [[Surface-area-to-volume ratio|surface-area to volume ratio]]. In these creatures the gas exchange membrane is typically the [[cell membrane]]. Some small multicellular organisms, such as [[flatworm]]s, are also able to perform sufficient gas exchange across the [[skin]] or [[cuticle]] that surrounds their bodies. However, in most larger organisms, which have a small surface-area to volume ratios, specialised structures with convoluted surfaces such as [[gill]]s, [[alveolus|pulmonary alveoli]] and [[Leaf#Mesophyll|spongy mesophyll]] provide the large area needed for effective gas exchange. These convoluted surfaces may sometimes be internalised into the body of the organism. This is the case with the alveoli, which form the inner surface of the [[mammal]]ian [[lung]], the spongy mesophyll, which is found inside the leaves of [[Euphyllophyte|some kinds of plant]], or the gills of those [[mollusc]]s that have them, which are found in the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] cavity.

In [[aerobic organism]]s, gas exchange is particularly important for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], which involves the uptake of [[oxygen]] ({{Chem|O|2}}) and release of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{Chem|CO|2}}). Conversely, in [[photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthetic organisms]] such as most [[Embryophyte|land plants]], uptake of carbon dioxide and release of both oxygen and water vapour are the main gas-exchange processes occurring during the day. Other gas-exchange processes are important in less familiar organisms: ''e.g.'' carbon dioxide, [[methane]] and [[hydrogen]] are exchanged across the cell membrane of [[methanogen|methanogenic archaea]]. In [[nitrogen fixation]] by [[diazotroph]]ic bacteria, and [[denitrification]] by [[heterotrophic]] [[bacteria]] (such as ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' and various [[pseudomonadaceae|pseudomonads]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carlson | first1 = C.

==Physical principles of gas-exchange==

===Diffusion and surface area===

The exchange of gases occurs as a result of [[Molecular diffusion|diffusion]] down a concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region in which they are at high concentration to one in which they are at low concentration. Diffusion is a [[Laws of thermodynamics|passive process]], meaning that no energy is required to power the transport, and it follows [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick’s Law]]: {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;J = -D \frac{d \varphi}{d x} &lt;/math&gt;

In relation to a typical biological system, where two compartments ('inside' and 'outside'), are separated by a membrane barrier, and where a gas is allowed to spontaneously diffuse down its concentration gradient:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

* ''J'' is the flux, the [[amount of substance|amount of gas]] diffusing per unit area of membrane per unit time. Note that this is already scaled for the area of the membrane.
* ''D'' is the [[mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]], which will differ from gas to gas, and from membrane to membrane, according to the size of the gas molecule in question, and the nature of the membrane itself (particularly its [[viscosity]], [[temperature]] and [[hydrophobicity]]).
* ''φ'' is the [[Thermodynamic activity|concentration]] of the gas.
* ''x'' is the position across the thickness of the membrane.
* d''φ''/d''x'' is therefore the concentration gradient across the membrane. If the two compartments are individually well-mixed, then this is simplifies to the difference in concentration of the gas between the inside and outside compartments divided by the thickness of the membrane.
* The negative sign indicates that the diffusion is always in the direction that - over time - will destroy the concentration gradient, ''i.e.'' the gas moves from high concentration to low concentration until eventually the inside and outside compartments reach [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]].

[[File:Fick's Law for gas-exchange surface.png|center|'''Fig. 1.''' Fick's Law for gas-exchange surface]]

'''Fig. 1.''' Fick's Law for gas-exchange surface

Gases must first dissolve in a liquid in order to diffuse across a [[membrane]], so all biological gas exchange systems require a moist environment.&lt;ref name="Piiper1971"&gt;{{Cite journal| authors=Piiper J, Dejours P, Haab P &amp; Rahn H| title= Concepts and basic quantities in gas exchange physiology| journal =[[Respiration Physiology]]| volume=13| year=1971| pages=292–304| doi=10.1016/0034-5687(71)90034-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the higher the concentration gradient across the gas-exchanging surface, the faster the rate of diffusion across it. Conversely, the thinner the gas-exchanging surface (for the same concentration difference), the faster the gases will diffuse across it.&lt;ref name="Kety1951"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Kety SS| title= The theory and applications of the exchange of inert gas at the lungs and tissues| journal =[[Pharmacological Reviews]]| volume=3|year=1951| pages=1–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the equation above, ''J'' is the [[flux]] expressed per unit area, so increasing the area will make no difference to its value. However, an increase in the available surface area, will increase the ''amount'' of gas that can diffuse in a given time.&lt;ref name="Kety1951"/&gt; This is because the amount of gas diffusing per unit time (d''q''/d''t'') is the product of ''J'' and the area of the gas-exchanging surface, ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d q}{d t} = J A&lt;/math&gt;
 
[[Unicellular organism|Single-celled organisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[amoeba]]e do not have specialised gas exchange surfaces, because they can take advantage of the high surface area they have relative to their volume. The amount of gas an organism produces (or requires) in a given time will be in rough proportion to the volume of its [[cytoplasm]]. The volume of a unicellular organism is very small, therefore it produces (and requires) a relatively small amount of gas in a given time. In comparison to this small volume, the surface area of its [[cell membrane]] is very large, and adequate for its gas-exchange needs without further modification. However, as an organism increases in size, its surface area and volume do not scale in the same way. Consider an imaginary organism that is a cube of side-length, ''L''. Its volume increases with the cube (''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of its length, but its external surface area increases only with the square (''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of its length. This means the external surface rapidly becomes inadequate for the rapidly increasing gas-exchange needs of a larger volume of cytoplasm. Additionally, the thickness of the surface that gases must cross (d''x'' in Fick's Law) can also be larger in larger organisms: in the case of a single-celled organism, a typical cell membrane is only 10&amp;nbsp;nm thick;&lt;ref name="Scneiter1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneiter|first1=R|last2=Brügger|first2=B|last3=Sandhoff|first3=R|last4=Zellnig|first4=G|last5=Leber|first5=A|last6=Lampl|first6=M|last7=Athenstaedt|first7=K|last8=Hrastnik|first8=C|last9=Eder|first9=S|last10=Daum|first10=G|last11=Paltauf|first11=F|last12=Wieland|first12=FT|last13=Kohlwein|first13=SD|title=Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis of the lipid molecular species composition of yeast subcellular membranes reveals acyl chain-based sorting/remodeling of distinct molecular species en route to the plasma membrane.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=1999|volume=146|issue=4|pages=741–54|pmid=10459010|doi=10.1083/jcb.146.4.741|pmc=2156145}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in larger organisms such as [[Nematode|roundworms]] (Nematoda) the equivalent exchange surface - the cuticle - is substantially thicker at 0.5 &amp;micro;m.&lt;ref name="Cox1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=G.

===Interaction with circulatory systems===

[[File:Comparison of con- and counter-current flow exchange.jpg|300px|thumb|right|'''Fig. 2.'''  A comparison between the operations and effects of a '''cocurrent and a countercurrent flow exchange system''' is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams respectively. In both it is assumed (and indicated) that red has a higher value (e.g. of temperature or the partial pressure of a gas) than blue and that the property being transported in the channels therefore flows from red to blue. Note that channels are contiguous if  effective exchange is to occur (i.e. there can be no gap between the channels).]]

In [[multicellular]] organisms therefore, specialised respiratory organs such as gills or lungs are often used to provide the additional surface area for the required rate of gas exchange with the external environment. However the distances between the gas exchanger and the deeper tissues are often too great for diffusion to meet gaseous requirements of these tissues. The gas exchangers are therefore frequently coupled to gas-distributing [[circulatory system]]s, which transport the gases evenly to all the body tissues regardless of their distance from the gas exchanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frozenevolution.com/xii5-multicellular-organisms-can-overcome-certain-evolutionary-constraints-imposed-unicellular-organ |title=Frozen Evolution |last=Flegr |first=Jaroslav |website=Frozen Evolution |access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some multicellular organisms such as [[flatworm]]s (Platyhelminthes) are relatively large but very thin, allowing their outer body surface to act as a gas exchange surface without the need for a specialised gas exchange organ. Flatworms therefore lack gills or lungs, and also lack a circulatory system. Other multicellular organisms such as [[sponges]] (Porifera) have an inherently high surface area, because they are very porous and/or branched. Sponges do not require a circulatory system or specialised gas exchange organs, because their feeding strategy involves one-way pumping of water through their porous bodies using [[flagellum|flagellated]] [[choanocyte|collar cells]]. Each cell of the sponge's body is therefore exposed to a constant flow of fresh oxygenated water. They can therefore rely on diffusion across their cell membranes to carry out the gas exchange needed for respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/the-respiratory-system-39/systems-of-gas-exchange-219/the-respiratory-system-and-direct-diffusion-830-12073/ |title=The respiratory system and direct diffusion |website=Boundless |access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In organisms that have circulatory systems associated with their specialized gas-exchange surfaces, a great variety of systems are used for the interaction between the two.

In a [[countercurrent flow]] system, air (or, more usually, the water containing dissolved air) is drawn in the ''opposite'' direction to the flow of blood in the gas exchanger. A countercurrent system such as this maintains a steep concentration gradient along the length of the gas-exchange surface (see lower diagram in Fig. 2). This is the situation seen in the [[Fish gill|gills]] of fish and [[Gill|many other aquatic creatures]].&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; The gas-containing environmental water is drawn unidirectionally across the gas-exchange surface, with the blood-flow in the gill capillaries beneath flowing in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|title= Biology|edition= Second|publisher= Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc|location= Redwood City, California|date= 1990|pages=836–838|isbn=0-8053-1800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes1972"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Hughes GM| title=Morphometrics of fish gills| journal=[[Respiration physiology]]| volume=14| year=1972| pages=1–25| doi=10.1016/0034-5687(72)90014-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=storer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storer|first1=Tracy I.|last2=Usinger|first2=R.

Cocurrent flow gas exchange systems are not known to be used in nature.

==Mammals==

Mainly found in the lung, the pulmonary alveoli are spherical outcroppings of the respiratory bronchioles and are the.png|thumb|300 px|'''Fig. 3.'''  An alveolus (plural: alveoli, from Latin alveus, "little cavity"), is an anatomical structure that has the form of a hollow cavity. They occur in the mammalian lung. They are spherical outcroppings of the respiratory bronchioles and are the primary sites of gas exchange with the blood.]]
The gas exchanger in mammals is internalized to form lungs, as it is in most of the larger land animals.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Gas exchange occurs in microscopic dead-end  air-filled sacs called [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where a very thin membrane (called the [[blood-air barrier]]) separates the blood in the alveolar capillaries (in the walls of the alveoli) from the alveolar air in the sacs.

===Exchange membrane===
[[File:Alveolar wall.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|'''Fig. 4.'''  A histological cross-section through an alveolar wall showing the layers through which the gases have to move between the blood plasma and the alveolar air. The dark blue objects are the nuclei of the capillary [[endothelial]] and alveolar type&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;[[epithelial]] cells (or type&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;[[pneumocyte]]s). The two red objects labeled "RBC" are [[red blood cell]]s in the alveolar capillary blood.]]

The membrane across which gas exchange takes place in the alveoli (i.e. the blood-air barrier) is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2&amp;nbsp;μm thick).&lt;ref name=grays /&gt; It consists of the [[Pneumocytes|alveolar epithelial cells]], their [[basement membrane]]s and the [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]] of the pulmonary capillaries (Fig. 4).&lt;ref name=grays /&gt;&lt;ref name="s-cool"&gt;{{Cite web| title= Gas Exchange in humans| url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/biology/gas-exchange/revise-it/gas-exchange-in-humans| accessdate= 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large surface area of the membrane comes from the folding of the membrane into about 300 million alveoli, with diameters of approximately 75-300&amp;nbsp;µm each. This provides an extremely large surface area (approximately 145&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) across which gas exchange can occur.&lt;ref name=grays /&gt;

===Alveolar air===

The scale on the left, and the blue line, indicate the partial pressures of carbon dioxide in kPa, while that on the right and the red line, indicate the partial pressures of oxygen, also in kPa (to convert kPa into mm Hg, multiply by 7.5).]]

[[File:Alveolus.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|'''Fig. 6.''' A diagrammatic histological cross-section through a portion of lung tissue showing a normally inflated [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]] (at the end of a normal exhalation), and its walls containing the [[Pulmonary circulation|alveolar capillaries]] (shown in cross-section). This illustrates how the alveolar capillary blood is completely surrounded by alveolar air. In a normal human lung all the alveoli together contain about 3 liters of alveolar air. All the alveolar capillaries contain about 100 ml blood.]]

[[Atmosphere of Earth|Air]] is brought to the alveoli in small doses (called the [[tidal volume]]), by [[breathing]] in ([[inhalation]]) and out ([[exhalation]]) through the [[Respiratory tract|respiratory airways]], a set of relatively narrow and moderately long tubes which start at the nose or mouth and end in the alveoli of the lungs in the chest. Air moves in and out through the same set of tubes, in which the flow is in one direction during inhalation, and in the opposite direction during exhalation.

During each inhalation, at rest, approximately 500&amp;nbsp;ml of fresh air flows in through the nose. Its is warmed and moistened as it flows through the nose and [[pharynx]]. By the time it reaches the trachea the inhaled air's temperature is 37&amp;nbsp;°C and it is saturated with water vapor. On arrival in the alveoli it is diluted and thoroughly mixed with the approximately  2.5–3.0&amp;nbsp;liters of air that remained in the alveoli after the last exhalation. This relatively large volume of air that is semi-permanently present in the alveoli throughout the breathing cycle is known as the [[functional residual capacity]] (FRC).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

At the beginning of inhalation the airways are filled with unchanged alveolar air, left over from the last exhalation. This is the [[Dead space (physiology)|dead space]] volume, which is usually about 150&amp;nbsp;ml.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dead space volume - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095704195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first air to re-enter the alveoli during inhalation. Only after the dead space air has returned to the alveoli does the remainder of the tidal volume (500&amp;nbsp;ml - 150&amp;nbsp;ml = 350&amp;nbsp;ml) enter the alveoli.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; The entry of such a small volume of fresh air with each inhalation, ensures that the composition of the FRC hardly changes during the breathing cycle (Fig. 5).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; The alveolar [[Pulmonary gas pressures|partial pressure of oxygen]] remains very close to 13–14&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (100&amp;nbsp;mmHg), and the [[Pulmonary gas pressures#Partial pressure of carbon dioxide|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] varies minimally around 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (40&amp;nbsp;mmHg) throughout the breathing cycle (of inhalation and exhalation).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; The corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21&amp;nbsp;kPa (160&amp;nbsp;mmHg) and 0.04&amp;nbsp;kPa (0.3&amp;nbsp;mmHg) respectively.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;
[[File:Gas exchange.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|'''Fig. 7.''' A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the alveolar capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood leaving the lung on the right). All the gas tensions are in kPa. To convert to mm Hg, multiply by 7.5.]]

This alveolar air, which constitutes the FRC, completely surrounds the blood in the alveolar capillaries (Fig. 6). Gas exchange in mammals occurs between this alveolar air (which differs significantly from fresh air) and the blood in the alveolar capillaries. The gases on either side of the gas exchange membrane equilibrate by simple diffusion. This ensures that the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood leaving the alveolar capillaries, and ultimately circulates throughout the body, are the same as those in the FRC.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

The marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the [[functional residual capacity]] is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by long, narrow, tubes (the airways: [[nose]], [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], [[trachea]], [[bronchi]] and their branches and sub-branches down to the [[bronchioles]]). This anatomy, and the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath, provides mammals with a "portable atmosphere", whose composition differs significantly from the [[Great Oxygenation Event|present-day ambient air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lovelock |first1=James | title=Healing Gaia: Practical medicine for the Planet|pages=21–34, 73–88|location=New York |publisher=Harmony Books |publication-date=1991|isbn= 0-517-57848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the air in the FRC is carefully monitored, by measuring the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. If either gas pressure deviates from normal, reflexes are elicited that change the rate and depth of breathing in such a way that normality is restored within seconds or minutes.&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

===Pulmonary circulation===
{{Main |Pulmonary circulation}}
All the blood returning from the body tissues to the right side of the [[heart]] flows through the [[Pulmonary circulation|alveolar capillaries]] before being pumped around the body again. On its passage through the lungs the blood comes into close contact with the alveolar air, separated from it by a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2&amp;nbsp;μm thick.&lt;ref name=grays /&gt; The gas pressures in the blood will therefore rapidly equilibrate with those in the [[alveoli]], ensuring that the arterial blood that circulates to all the tissues throughout the body has an [[Blood gas tension|oxygen tension]] of 13−14&amp;nbsp;kPa (100&amp;nbsp;mmHg), and a [[Blood gas tension|carbon dioxide tension]] of 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (40&amp;nbsp;mmHg). These arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|homeostatically controlled]]. A rise in the arterial &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.

Since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; of, on average, 6&amp;nbsp;kPa (45&amp;nbsp;mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13&amp;nbsp;kPa (100&amp;nbsp;mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3&amp;nbsp;liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; of also about 6&amp;nbsp;kPa (45&amp;nbsp;mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (40&amp;nbsp;mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the functional residual capacity necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every  5 seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the continuous monitoring of the arterial blood gas tensions (which accurately reflect partial pressures  of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air) by the [[Aortic body|aortic bodies]], the [[Carotid body|carotid bodies]], and the [[Central chemoreceptors|blood gas and pH sensor]] on the anterior surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the [[bronchioles]] and [[Pulmonary circulation|pulmonary capillaries]], and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.

It is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3 liters alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of [[hyperventilation]], respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; has returned to 5.3&amp;nbsp;kPa (40&amp;nbsp;mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide “waste”. In fact the total concentration of carbon dioxide in arterial blood  is about 26&amp;nbsp;mM (or 58&amp;nbsp;ml per 100 ml),&lt;ref name=ciba&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. | last2=Lentner |first2=C. | chapter= Blood – Inorganic substances| title= in: Scientific Tables | edition= Seventh |location=Basle, Switzerland |publisher=CIBA-GEIGY Ltd. |publication-date=1970 |page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9&amp;nbsp;mM (or 20&amp;nbsp;ml per 100 ml blood).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt; This large concentration of carbon dioxide plays a pivotal role in the [[Acid-base homeostasis|determination and maintenance of the pH of the extracellular fluids]]. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body’s extracellular fluid [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and  [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH homeostats]]

If these homeostats are compromised, then a [[respiratory acidosis]], or a [[respiratory alkalosis]] will occur.

Oxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with [[hemoglobin]]. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four [[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous iron]]-containing [[heme]] groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule each the blood is said to be “saturated” with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (through the addition of water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by [[carbonic anhydrase]], an [[enzyme]] inside the [[red blood cell]]s.&lt;ref name="Raymond&amp;Swenson2000"&gt;{{Cite journal| authors=Raymond H &amp; Swenson E| title=The distribution and physiological significance of carbonic anhydrase in vertebrate gas exchange organs| journal=[[Respiration physiology]]| volume=121| year=2000| pages=1–12| doi=10.1016/s0034-5687(00)00110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction can go in either direction depending on the prevailing partial pressure of carbon dioxide. A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as [[carbamino]] groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26&amp;nbsp;mM (or 58&amp;nbsp;ml/100 ml),&lt;ref name=ciba /&gt; compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9&amp;nbsp;mM (or 20&amp;nbsp;ml/100 ml blood).&lt;ref name=tortora1 /&gt;

Gills are specialised organs containing [[Gill filament|filaments]], which further divide into [[lamella (anatomy)|lamellae]]. The lamellae contain [[capillaries]] that provide a large surface area and short diffusion distances, as their walls are extremely thin.&lt;ref name="Newstead1967"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Newstead James D | title=Fine structure of the respiratory lamellae of teleostean gills| journal=[[Cell and Tissue Research]]| volume=79| year=1967| pages=396–428| doi=10.1007/bf00335484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill rakers are found within the exchange system in order to filter out food, and keep the gills clean.

Gills use a [[countercurrent flow]] system that increases the efficiency of oxygen-uptake (and waste gas loss).&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name=storer/&gt; Oxygenated water is drawn in through the mouth and passes over the gills in one direction while blood flows through the lamellae in the opposite direction. This [[countercurrent exchange|countercurrent]] maintains steep concentration gradients along the entire length of each capillary (see the diagram in the [[Gas exchange#Interaction with circulatory systems|"Interaction with circulatory systems"]] section above). Oxygen is able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water.&lt;ref name="Hughes1972"/&gt; The deoxygenated water will eventually pass out through the [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]] (gill cover). Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt;

===Amphibians===
Amphibians have three main organs involved in gas exchange: the lungs, the skin, and the gills, which can be used singly or in a variety of different combinations. The relative importance of these structures differs according to the age, the environment and species of the amphibian. The skin of amphibians and their larvae is highly vascularised, leading to relatively efficient gas exchange when the skin is moist. The larvae of amphibians, such as the pre-metamorphosis [[tadpole]] stage of [[frog]]s, also have external [[gills]]. The gills are absorbed into the body during [[metamorphosis]], after which the lungs will then take over. The lungs are usually simpler than in the [[amniote|other land vertebrates]], with few internal septa and larger alveoli; however, toads, which spend more time on land, have a larger alveolar surface with more developed lungs. To increase the rate of gas exchange by diffusion, amphibians maintain the concentration gradient across the respiratory surface using a process called [[buccal pumping]].&lt;ref name="Brainerd"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=E. L.  |date=1999 |title=New perspectives on the evolution of lung ventilation mechanisms in invertebrates|journal=Experimental Biology Online |volume=4 |issue= 2|pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/s00898-999-0002-1 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower floor of the mouth is moved in a "pumping" manner, which can be observed by the naked eye.

===Reptiles===
All [[reptile]]s breathe using lungs. In [[squamate]]s (the [[lizards]] and [[snakes]]) ventilation is driven by the [[core (anatomy)|axial musculature]], but this musculature is also used during movement, so some squamates rely on [[buccal pumping]] to maintain gas exchange efficiency.&lt;ref name ="reptiles"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=E.

[[File:Cross-current exchanger.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|'''Fig. 9.'''  A diagrammatic representation of the cross-current respiratory gas exchanger in the lungs of birds.

Birds have [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|lungs but no diaphragm]]. They rely mostly on [[air sacs]] for [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. These air sacs do not play a direct role in gas exchange, but help to move air unidirectionally across the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs. During inhalation, fresh air is taken from the trachea down into the posterior air sacs and into the [[parabronchi]] which lead from the posterior air sacs into the lung. The air that enters the lungs joins the  air which is already in the lungs, and is drawn forward across the gas exchanger into anterior air sacs. During exhalation, the posterior air sacs force air into the same [[parabronchi]] of the lungs, flowing in the same direction as during inhalation, allowing continuous gas exchange irrespective of the breathing cycle. Air exiting the lungs during exhalation joins the air being expelled from the anterior air sacs (both consisting of "spent air" that has passed through the gas exchanger) entering the trachea to be  exhaled  (Fig. 10).&lt;ref name=AvResp /&gt; Selective [[bronchoconstriction]] at the various bronchial branch points ensures that the air does not ebb and flow through the bronchi during inhalation and exhalation, as it does in mammals, but follows the paths described above.

The unidirectional airflow through the parabronchi exchanges respiratory gases with a ''crosscurrent'' blood flow (Fig. 9).&lt;ref name="graham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AvResp"/&gt; The partial pressure of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;) in the parabronchioles declines along their length as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffuses into the blood. The capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi.  When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air, but lower than that of the inhaled air.&lt;ref name= graham /&gt;&lt;ref name=AvResp /&gt;

==Plants==
Gas exchange in plants is dominated by the roles of carbon dioxide, oxygen and [[water vapor]]. {{Chem|CO|2}} is the only carbon source for [[autotroph]]ic growth by [[photosynthesis]], and when a plant is actively photosynthesising in the light, it will be taking up carbon dioxide, and [[transpiration|losing water vapor]] and oxygen. At night, plants [[cellular respiration|respire]], and gas exchange partly reverses: water vapor is still lost (but to a smaller extent), but oxygen is now taken up and carbon dioxide released.&lt;ref name = "Whitmarsh_1999"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Singhal GS, Renger G, Sopory SK, Irrgang KD, Govindjee | title = Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis | chapter = Chapter 2: The Basic Photosynthetic Process | vauthors = Whitmarsh J, Govindjee | year = 1999 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-7923-5519-9 | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=dqSuoOtDM1cC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;f=false | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leaf anatomy.svg|thumb|400 px|'''Fig. 11.''' A stylised cross-section of a [[euphyllophyte]] plant leaf, showing the key plant organs involved in gas exchange]]
Plant gas exchange occurs mostly through the leaves. Gases diffuse into and out of the intercellular spaces within the leaf through pores called [[stomata]], which are typically found on the lower surface of the leaf. Gases enter into the photosynthetic tissue of the leaf through dissolution onto the moist surface of the palisade and spongy [[mesophyll]] cells. The spongy mesophyll cells are loosely packed, allowing for an increased surface area, and subsequently an increased rate of gas-exchange. Uptake of carbon dioxide necessarily results in some loss of water vapor,&lt;ref name=" K. Raschke, 1976"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=K. Raschke | title= How Stomata Resolve the Dilemma of Opposing Priorities | journal =[[Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B]]| volume=273 |year=1976  | pages=551–560 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1976.0031| bibcode=1976RSPTB.273..551R}}&lt;/ref&gt; because both molecules enter and leave by the same stomata, so plants experience a gas exchange dilemma: gaining enough {{Chem|CO|2}} without losing too much water. Therefore, water loss from other parts of the leaf is minimised by the waxy cuticle on the leaf's [[epidermis]]. The size of a stoma is regulated by the opening and closing of its two [[guard cell]]s: the turgidity of these cells determines the state of the stomatal opening, and this itself is regulated by water stress. Plants showing [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] are drought-tolerant [[xerophyte]]s and perform almost all their gas-exchange at night, because it is only during the night that these plants open their stomata. By opening the stomata only at night, the water vapor loss associated with carbon dioxide uptake is minimised. However, this comes at the cost of slow growth: the plant has to store the carbon dioxide in the form of [[malic acid]] for use during the day, and it cannot store unlimited amounts.&lt;ref name="Ting2985"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.36.060185.003115|title=Crassulacean Acid Metabolism|year=1985|last1=Ting|first1=I P|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=595–622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:portable gas exchange measurements.jpg|thumb|right|alt=see adjacent text| '''Fig. 12.'''  High precision gas exchange measurements reveal important information on [[plant physiology]]]]

Gas exchange measurements are important tools in plant science: this typically involves sealing the plant (or part of a plant) in a chamber and measuring changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide with an [[infrared gas analyzer]]. If the environmental conditions ([[humidity]], {{Chem|CO|2}} concentration, light and [[temperature]]) are fully controlled, the measurements of {{Chem|CO|2}} uptake and water release reveal important information about the {{Chem|CO|2}} [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[transpiration]] rates.

==Invertebrates==

The mechanism of gas exchange in invertebrates depends their size, feeding strategy, and habitat (aquatic or terrestrial).

[[File:Porifera body structures 01.png|thumb|'''Fig. 13.'''  Diagram representing the body structure of Porifera. The diagram shows the mechanism of water uptake for sponges. Yellow: [[pinacocytes]], red: choanocytes, grey: [[mesohyl]], pale blue: water flow]]

The [[sponge]]s (Porifera) are sessile creatures, meaning they are unable to move on their own and normally remain attached to their [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]]. They obtain nutrients through the flow of water across their cells, and they exchange gases by simple diffusion across their cell membranes. Pores called [[Ostium (sponges)|ostia]] draw water into the sponge and the water is subsequently circulated through the sponge by cells called [[choanocyte]]s which have [[flagellum|hair-like structures]] that move the water through the sponge.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D. (2001) ''Invertebrate Zoology'' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coral reef at palmyra.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 14.'''  Cnidarians are always found in aquatic environments, meaning that their gas exchange involves absorbing oxygen from water.]]

The [[cnidarian]]s include [[corals]], [[sea anemones]], [[jellyfish]] and [[hydras]]. These animals are always found in aquatic environments, ranging from fresh water to salt water. They do not have any dedicated [[respiratory organs]]; instead, every cell in their body can absorb oxygen from the surrounding water, and release waste gases to it. One key disadvantage of this feature is that cnidarians can die in environments where water is [[water stagnation|stagnant]], as they deplete the water of its [[oxygen]] supply.&lt;ref name="cnidarians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/cnidaria-respiratory-system.html |title= Cnidarian Respiratory System|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=study.com |access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corals often form symbiosis with other organisms, particularly photosynthetic [[dinoflagellate]]s. In this [[symbiosis]], the [[coral]] provides shelter and the other organism provides nutrients to the coral, including oxygen.

[[File:Giant roundworm (265 11) Cross-section.jpg|thumb|180 px|left|'''Fig. 15.''' Cross section of a nematode.]]

The [[nematode|roundworms]] (Nematoda), [[flatworm]]s (Platyhelminthes), and many other small invertebrate animals living in aquatic or otherwise wet habitats do not have a dedicated gas-exchange surface or circulatory system. They instead rely on [[diffusion]] of {{Chem|CO|2}} and {{Chem|O|2}} directly across their cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/nematode-respiratory-system.html |title= Nematode Respiratory System|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=study.com |access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rspp.weebly.com/platyhelminthes.html |title= Platyhelminthes Respiratory System|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=http://rspp.weebly.com|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cuticle is the [[semi-permeable]] outermost layer of their bodies.

Other aquatic invertebrates such as most [[mollusc]]s (Mollusca) and larger [[crustacean]]s (Crustacea) such as [[lobster]]s, have gills analogous to those of fish, which operate in a similar way.

[[File:Actias selene 5th instar spiracles sjh.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|'''Fig. 16.''' Photographic representation of spiracles.]]
Unlike the invertebrates groups mentioned so far, [[insect]]s are usually terrestrial, and exchange gases across a moist surface in direct contact with the atmosphere, rather than in contact with surrounding water. The insect's [[exoskeleton]] is impermeable to gases, including water vapor, so they have a more specialised gas exchange system, requiring gases to be directly transported to the tissues via a complex network of tubes. This respiratory system is separated from their circulatory system. Gases enter and leave the body through openings called [[spiracle]]s, located laterally along the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]. Similar to plants, insects are able to control the opening and closing of these spiracles, but instead of relying on [[turgor pressure]], they rely on [[muscle contraction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=N. J. |last2=Harrison |first2= J. B. |date=1986 |title= Junctions and the cytoskeleton in insect tissues |journal=Journal of Cell Biology |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages= A69-A69 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[muscle contractions|contractions]] result in an insect's abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called [[tracheae]], which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect's body. These branches terminate in specialised [[tracheole|tracheole cells]] which provides a thin, moist surface for efficient gas exchange, directly with cells.&lt;ref&gt;Klowden, M. J. 2007. Physiological systems in insects. Elsevier/Academic Press. pp. 440-442&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Governess cart''' is a small two-wheeled horse-drawn [[cart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |title=All Drawn by Horses

  |publisher=[[David &amp; Charles]]
  |ref=Arnold, All Drawn by Horses
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their distinguishing feature is a small tub body, with two opposed inward-facing seats. They could seat four, although there was little room for four large adults. The driver sat sideways on one of these seats. The centre rear of the body was lowered, or else had a small hinged door, and there was a step beneath. The wheels were of moderate size, always fitted with mud guards, and usually carried on [[elliptical spring]]s. The axle was either straight or [[dropped axle|dropped]], giving a low, stable, centre of gravity. 

The purpose of the cart was to be light enough to be drawn by a well-tempered pony or [[cob (horse)|cob]], who would be gentle enough, according to the [[mores]] of the time, to be handled by a [[lady#British_usage|lady]]. This gave rise to the cart's name, as they were frequently used by [[governess]]es to transport their child charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governess rode in the cart with the passengers, where they could easily be observed. The cart was also relatively safe, being difficult to either fall from, overturn, or to injure oneself with either the horse or wheels.

The governess cart was a relatively late development in [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, appearing around 1900 as a substitute for the [[dogcart]]. These were a similar light cart, but their high exposed seats had a poor safety record for passengers, particularly children, falling from them.

The '''IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society''' ('''NPSS''') is a transnational group of about 3000 professional engineers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieee-npss.org IEEE NPSS Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IEEE]]-affiliated Society sponsors five major annual, and 12 biennial conferences and symposia.  It also sponsors or co-sponsor four [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]s.

The IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization with more than 420,000 members in around 160 countries.

==History of the NPSS==
In 1947, the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) formed the [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Studies]] Committee to assess the role of the IRE in the field. Two years later, the Professional Group on Nuclear Science was formed. In 1954 the first issue of the Transactions on Nuclear Science appeared, increasing to four issues per year in 1956.

In 1963 the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) merged with the IRE to form the [[IEEE]], and the AIEE Nucleonics Committee and the Committee on Nucleaonic and Radiation Instruments merged with the IRE Professional Group on Nuclear Science on October 29, 1963, to become the Nuclear Science Group of the IEEE.

In 1972, the scope of the group was widened to include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma sciences]], and the group became a Society, its name changing to the Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/IEEE_Nuclear_and_Plasma_Sciences_Society_History |title=IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society History |author=IEEE Global History Network |year=2011 |publisher=IEEE History Center |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ieee-tps.png|thumb|258px|Transactions on Plasma Science, cover|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 14 March 2008}}]] --&gt;

===Transactions on Nuclear Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=23 TNS Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The first issue of the Transactions on Nuclear Science first appeared in 1954, the number of issues rising to four per year in 1956 and bimonthly in 2017. In 2005, the journal was ranked No.3 for [[impact factor]] in Nuclear Science &amp; Engineering by Thomson. The journal focuses on instrumentation for the detector and measurement of ionizing radiation, particle accelerators and their controls, nuclear medicine and its application, effects of radiation on materials, components, and systems, nuclear reactor instrumentation and controls as well as measurement of radiation in space.

===Transactions on Plasma Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=27 TPS Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The first issue of the Transactions on Plasma Science appeared in 1973. The 'Tennessee Orange,' cover color was picked by Igor Alexeff, Professor, University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Published bimonthly, its scope includes all aspects of the theory and application of plasma science, and regularly features "Special issues" (e.g. eight in 2004). Between 2000-2004, the journal was ranked No.10 for [[impact factor]] in "Physics - Fluids &amp; Plasmas" by Thomson.&lt;ref&gt;Journals Ranked by Impact, "[http://www.in-cites.com/research/2006/may_8_2006-2.html What's New in Research: May 8, 2006]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactions on Medical Imaging&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee-tmi.org/ TMI Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The journal encourages papers on the imaging of body structures, usually ''in situ'', rather than microscopic biological entities. In the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) from Thomson, which ranks journals by their [[impact factor]], in 2005, the journal was ranked:

*No.1 in Imaging Science &amp;  Photographic Technology
*No.2 in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering
*No.3 in Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications
*No.3 in Biomedical Engineering
*No.6 in Radiology, Nuclear Medicine &amp; Medical Imaging

=== Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences&lt;ref&gt;[https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/trpms TRPMS Submission Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The journal is co-sponsored by NPSS and the [[IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society|Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society]] (EMBS) and focuses on technology and application areas related to radiation- and plasma-based medical sciences. The first issue has been published in January 2017.

'''Indoor air pollution in developing nations'''  is a significant form of [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] (IAP) that is little known to those in the [[developed world]].

Three billion people in [[developing countries]] across the globe rely on [[biomass]], in the form of [[wood]], [[charcoal]], [[Manure|dung]], and [[crop residue]], as their domestic cooking fuel. Because much of the cooking is carried out indoors in environments that lack proper ventilation, millions of people, primarily poor women and children face serious health risks. Globally, 4.3 million deaths were attributed to exposure to IAP in developing countries in 2012, almost all in low and middle income countries.  The South East Asian and Western Pacific regions bear most of the burden with 1.69 and 1.62 million deaths, respectively. Almost 600,000 deaths occur in Africa, 
200,000 in the Eastern Mediterranean region, 99,000 in Europe and 81,000 in the Americas. The remaining 19,000 deaths occur in high income countries.&lt;ref name="WHO1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burden of disease from Indoor Air Pollution for 2012|url=http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/FINAL_HAP_AAP_BoD_24March2014.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the rate of dependence on biomass fuel is declining, this dwindling resource will not keep up with population growth which could ultimately put environments at even greater risk.

Over the past several decades, there have been numerous studies investigating the air pollution generated by traditional household solid fuel combustion for space heating, lighting, and cooking in developing countries. It is now well established that, throughout much of the developing world, indoor burning of solid fuels (biomass, coal, etc.) by inefficient, often insufficiently vented, combustion devices results in elevated exposures to household air pollutants. This is due to the poor combustion efficiency of the combustion devices and the elevated nature of the emissions. In addition, they are often released directly into living areas.&lt;ref name="Long et al., 2014"&gt;[http://cornerstonemag.net/evolution-of-cleaner-solid-fuel-combustion/], Long, C., Valberg, P., 2014. Evolution of Cleaner Solid Fuel Combustion, Cornerstone, http://cornerstonemag.net/evolution-of-cleaner-solid-fuel-combustion/&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke from traditional household solid fuel combustion commonly contains a range of incomplete [[combustion products]], including both fine and coarse [[particulates|particulate matter]] (e.g., [[PM2.5|PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[PM10|PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a variety of organic air pollutants (e.g., [[formaldehyde]], [[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]], [[benzene]], [[acetaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[phenols]], [[pyrene]], [[benzopyrene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene]], [[dibenzopyrenes]], [[dibenzocarbazole]]s, and [[cresols]]).&lt;ref name="Long et al., 2014"/&gt; In a typical solid fuel stove, about 6–20% of the solid fuel is converted into toxic emissions (by mass). The exact quantity and relative composition is determined by factors such as the fuel type and moisture content, stove type and operation influencing the amount.&lt;ref name="Long et al., 2014"/&gt;

While many pollutants can evolve, most measurements have been focused on breathing-zone exposure levels of particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO), which are the main products of incomplete combustion and are considered to pose the greatest health risks. Indoor PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure levels have been consistently reported to be in the range of hundreds to thousands of micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, CO exposure levels have been measured to be as high as hundreds to greater than 1000 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). A recent study of 163 households in two rural Chinese counties reported geometric mean indoor PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations of 276 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (combinations of different plant materials, including wood, tobacco stems, and corncobs), 327 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (wood), 144 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (smoky coal), and 96 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (smokeless coal) for homes using a variety of different fuel types and stove configurations (e.g., vented, unvented, portable, fire pit, mixed ventilation stove).&lt;ref name="Long et al., 2014"/&gt;

==Implications==

===Health implications===
Rural Kenya has been the site of various applied research projects to determine the intensity of emissions that commonly occur from use of biomass fuels, particularly wood, dung, and crop residue. [[Smoke]] is the result of the incomplete [[combustion]] of [[solid fuel]] which women and children are exposed to up to seven hours each day in closed environments.&lt;ref name="PASmoke2"&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/?id=smoke_report_2 Smoke's increasing cloud across the globe], ''Practical Action'', accessed 5 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
These emissions vary from day to day, season to season and with changes in the amount of airflow within the residence. Exposure in poor homes far exceeds accepted safety levels by as much as one hundred times over.&lt;ref name="PASmoke2" /&gt; Because many Kenyan women utilize a three-stone fire, the worst offender, one kilogram of burning wood produces tiny particles of soot which can clog and irritate the bronchial pathways. The smoke also contains various poisonous gases such as [[aldehydes]], [[benzene]], and [[carbon monoxide]]. Exposure to IAP from combustion of solid fuels has been implicated, with varying degrees of evidence, as a causal agent of several diseases.&lt;ref name="WHO1" /&gt;  Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) are the leading causes of disease and death from exposure to smoke. [[Cataracts]] and [[blindness]], [[lung cancer]], [[tuberculosis]], premature births and low birth weight are also suspected of being caused by IAP.

===Women and gender===

Women and girls are largely responsible for collecting fuel-wood for cooking in most households, particularly in rural communities and in refugee camps. This increases their vulnerability to incidences of violence, including beating and bodily injury, assault, and rape. This time could be spent in more productive ways such as attending school or income production – improved cookstove interventions in refugee camps have shown significant decreases in fuelwood collection times reported by women. Moreover, removing the need for women to collect fuelwood also significantly reduces reported rapes during firewood collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of the Dadaab Firewood Project, Kenya|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b33105d4.html|website=UNHCR|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of biomass coupled with inefficient cooking apparatus leads to a web of social and environmental concerns which directly links to the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]]. Women and girls also make up the majority of deaths from household air pollution (HAP), which has been shown to affect nearly three billion people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander|first1=Donee A., et al|title=Pregnancy Outcomes and Ethanol Cook Stove Intervention: A Randomized-Controlled Trial in Ibadan, Nigeria|journal=Environment International|date=2018|volume=111|pages= 152–163|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2017.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing traditional kerosene/firewood stoves with cleaner ethanol stoves in Nigeria has been shown to mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes from HAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burning Opportunity: Clean Household Energy for Health, Sustainable Development, and Wellbeing of Women and Children|url=http://www.who.int/indoorair/publications/burning-opportunities/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions==
[[File:Solar-Panel-Cooker-in-front-of-hut.jpg|thumb| [[Solar cooker]]s use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking.]]

===Early interventions===
Unfortunately, finding an affordable solution to address the many effects of IAP – improving combustion, reducing smoke exposure, improving safety and reducing labor, reducing fuel costs, and addressing sustainability – is complex and in need of continual improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duflo E, Greenstone M, Hanna R |title=Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2008 |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to improve [[Biomass Cook Stoves|cook stoves]] in the past, beginning in the 1950s, were primarily aimed at minimizing [[deforestation]] with no concern for IAP, though the effectiveness of these efforts to save firewood is debatable. Various attempts had various outcomes. For example, some improved stove designs in Kenya significantly reduced particulate emissions but produced higher [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions. Flues to remove smoke were difficult to design and were fragile.

===Improved success===

Current improved interventions however, include smoke hoods which operate in much the same manner as flues, to extract smoke, but are found to reduce levels of IAP more effectively than homes that relied solely on windows for ventilation.&lt;ref name="Cairncross1"&gt;
[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/healthenvirondiseaseguidenote.pdf Health, Environment And The Burden Of Disease: A Guidance Note] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625140240/http://www2.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/healthenvirondiseaseguidenote.pdf |date=25 June 2007 }}, Cairncross, S., O'neill, D., McCoy., A., Sethi, D. 2003. DFID. Accessed 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some features of newly improved stoves include a chimney, enclosing the fire to retain heat, designing a pot holder to maximize heat transfer, dampers to control air flow, a ceramic insert to reduce heat loss, and multi-pot systems to allow for cooking multiple dishes.

Stoves are now known to be one of the least-cost means to achieve the combined objective of reducing the health burden of IAP and in some areas reducing environmental stress from biomass harvesting.&lt;ref name="Kammen1"&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/old-site/Kammen-GatesGrandChal-stoves.doc Healthy Stoves and Fuels for Developing Nations and the Global Environment], Kammen, D. 2003. Accessed 12 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some success in installation of interventions, including improved cook stoves, has been achieved primarily due to an interdisciplinary approach which includes multiple stakeholders. These projects have discovered that key [[socio-economic]] issues must be addressed to ensure the success of intervention programs. A multitude of complex issues indicate improved stoves are not merely a tool to save fuel.

===Successful interventions===

The following information represents one successful intervention known as the Kenya Smoke and Health Project (1998–2001)&lt;ref name="SPpdf1"&gt;[http://practicalaction.org/docs/advocacy/Smoke_Project.pdf Kenya Smoke and Health Project], ITDG. 1998-2001. Accessed 5 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which involved fifty rural households in two separate regions, [[Kajiado]] and West Kenya. These areas were chosen due to different climate, geographic, and [[cultural]] implications. Community participation was the primary focus for this project and as a result, those involved indicated the results far exceeded their expectations. Local women's groups and, in the case of the project in West Kenya, men were actively involved. By involving the end-users the project resulted in more widespread acceptance and created the further benefit of providing local income.

Three key interventions were discussed and disseminated; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces, adding smoke hoods over the cooking area, or the option of installing an improved cook stove such as the [[Upesi stove]]. Smoke hoods are free-standing units that act like flues or chimneys in their effort to draw smoke out of the dwelling. They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP. The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to heavy-gauge galvanized sheet metal and manufactured locally. This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project. The Upesi stove, made of clay and kiln-fired, was developed by [[Practical Action]] and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes. Because this stove was designed and adapted for local needs it produced several winning features. Not only does it cut the use of fuel-wood by approximately half, and reduce exposure to household smoke, it also empowers local women by creating employment as they are the ones who make and market the stoves. These women's groups gain access to technical training in production and marketing and enjoy higher wage earnings and improved [[social status]] as a result of the introduction of this improved stove.

Various benefits were realized including improved health; the most important aspect to each of the villagers involved. The people reported less internal heat allowing for better sleep, fewer [[headaches]] and less [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], less eye irritation and coughs and [[dizziness]]. Safety increased due to the smoke hoods preventing goats and children from falling into the fire and less [[soot]] contamination was observed, along with snakes and rodents not entering the home. Windows allowed for the ability to view cattle from indoors, and also reduced [[kerosene]] needs due to improved interior lighting. Overall, the indoor environment improved greatly from various simple things that are taken for granted in modern western homes. Greater indoor light also allows for more income generation for women as they can do beadwork by the window when weather doesn't allow for this work outdoors. Children also benefit from increased lighting for homework.

[[Interpersonal relationships]] developed among the women due to the project, and men better supported their wives initiative when the end result benefited them as well. While initial efforts to improve stoves were limited in success, current efforts are more successful due to the recognition that sustainable domestic energy resources are "central to reducing poverty and hunger, improving health…and improving the lives of women and children"&lt;ref name="SPpdf1" /&gt; The optimal short-term goal in minimizing rural poverty is to provide inexpensive and acceptable solutions to the local people. Not only can stoves contribute to this intervention, but the use of cleaner fuels will also provide further benefits.

Similar improved-stove projects have proven successful in other regions of the world. Improved stoves installed as part of the Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) study in Guatemala were found to be acceptable to the population and produce significant health benefits for both mothers and children.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley. Randomized exposure study of pollution indoors and respiratory effects (RESPIRE). http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/guat/page.asp?id=15. Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers in the intervention group had lower blood pressure and reductions in eye discomfort and back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCracken JP, Smith KR, Diaz A, Mittleman MA, Schwartz J |title=Chimney stove intervention to reduce long-term wood smoke exposure lowers blood pressure among Guatemalan women |journal=Environ.

Chronic respiratory effects of childhood exposure to respirable particulate matter (CRECER). http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/guat/page.asp?id=1. Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Program on Improved Chulhas in India has also had some success in encouraging the use of improved stoves among at-risk populations. Begun in the mid-1980s, this program provides subsidies to encourage families to purchase the longer-lasting chulhas and have a chimney installed. A 2005 study showed that stoves with chimneys are associated with a lower incidence of cataracts in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pokhrel AK, Smith KR, Khalakdina A, Deuja A, Bates MN |title=Case-control study of indoor cooking smoke exposure and cataract in Nepal and India |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=34 |pages=709–10 |year=2005 |pmid=15833790 |issue=3 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the available information from India is more of a characterization of the issue and there is less data available from intervention trials.

China has been particularly successful at encouraging the use of improved stoves, with hundreds of millions of stoves installed since the beginning of the project in the early 1980s. The government very intentionally targeted poorer, rural households, and by the late 1990s nearly 75% of such households contained "improved kitchens."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, KR. Household monitoring project in China. Environmental Health Sciences Department website. http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/hem/page.asp?id=29. Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 review of 3500 households showed an improvement in indoor air quality in intervention households characterized by lower concentrations of small particles and carbon monoxide in household air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Edwards RD, Liu Y, He G, Yin Z, Sinton J, Peabody J, etal |title=Household CO and PM measured as part of a review of China's National Improved Stove Program |journal=Indoor Air. |volume=17 |pages=189–203 |year=2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00465.x |pmid=17542832 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program in China involved intervention on a large scale, but the cost of stoves was heavily subsidized so it is not known if its success could be replicated.

==Environmental impacts==
Mortality and burden of disease are not the only detrimental effects from utilizing inefficient energy technology such as the combustion of biomass. Kenya's pre-dominant energy source is biomass, providing more than 90 per cent of rural household energy needs, about one-third in the form of charcoal and the rest from firewood.&lt;ref name="VillagePdf"&gt;[http://www.ke.undp.org/KenyaEnrgyAtlasFinal-UN.pdf Global Village Energy Partnership, Nairobi, Kenya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613071848/http://www.ke.undp.org/KenyaEnrgyAtlasFinal-UN.pdf |date=13 June 2007 }}, UNDP. 2005. Accessed 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass energy sourced primarily from [[savannah]] woodlands includes firewood for inhabitants and charcoal for urban use. A small percentage is sourced by neighboring communities from closed and protected forests which are generally found in high population density areas.&lt;ref name="VillagePdf" /&gt; While biomass harvesting in sensitive areas is problematic, it is now determined that the great majority of biomass clearing is due to [[agricultural expansion]] and land conversion.&lt;ref name="Kammen1" /&gt; Approximately 38% of households 'in high agro-ecological zones' utilize agricultural waste due to frequent shortages of conventional fuel-wood.&lt;ref name="VillagePdf" /&gt; Use of crop residue and animal waste for domestic energy has detrimental results on [[soil quality]] and agricultural and livestock productivity. These materials are ultimately not available as soil conditioners, [[organic fertilizer]], and livestock [[fodder]], not to mention the "cumulative effects on national food security".&lt;ref name="VillagePdf" /&gt;

Most farmers are aware however, that when agricultural waste and dung are not used for energy, they are important elements to maintaining soil fertility. One of the most efficient ways to utilize crop waste and dung for domestic energy is to produce [[briquettes]]. The process of compacting the material into a donut shape creates more efficient combustion which contributes to reduced emission levels. A simple device allows for this process and it can be done locally.

===Sustainable options===

Large-scale combustion of biomass is only feasible if carried out in a sustainable manner. Concern is paramount for regeneration of [[renewable]] and sustainable fuel-wood sources if it is to continue to be available long-term. Attempts at sustainable solutions in Kenya could include developing [[energy crop]]s (trees and shrubs) which would also provide additional income for farmers. This solution would benefit cropland or rangeland prone to [[erosion]] and flooding as the root systems and leaf litter would enhance soil stability.&lt;ref name="VillagePdf" /&gt; Careful selection of regenerating varieties would be most sustainable because soil stability is not disrupted due to tilling and planting. Some people view this solution as a way to further exploit forests, but with proper management of forest resources this could be a viable solution.

Fuels and cook stove technology can be assessed on two factors: energy efficiency and emissions in the household. High-performing efficient stoves can improve environmental outcomes to an extent even with unclean fuels (such as firewood and biomass). According to a study comparing environmental, social, and economic life cycle impacts of cooking fuels, with more efficient stoves “more of the heating value of the fuel is converted into useful cooking energy and therefore less fuel must be produced, transported, and burned to deliver the same amount of cooking.”&lt;ref name="cleancookstoves.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparative Analysis of Fuels for Cooking|url=http://cleancookstoves.org/resources/502.html.|publisher=Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sustainable options include liquid and gas fuels that are combusted in high-performing efficient stoves. For instance, [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] produced from cellulosic/non-food feedstocks (wood, agricultural residue) has lower environmental life cycle impacts compared to ethanol produced from sugar and starch materials. [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], though made from non-renewable fossil fuels, still has lower negative environmental impacts than traditional fuels – thus even though it is not a sustainable alternative, it creates far less emissions impacts than traditional fuels.&lt;ref name="cleancookstoves.org"/&gt;

==Challenges==

===Supply===
There exist trade-offs between efficiency and sustainability on the supply side of the cook stoves and fuels market. While developing cook stoves that use efficient and clean fuel sources is environmentally ideal, often this is not a viable solution due to barriers to scaling up production and consumption of these fuels. For instance, electric stoves are cited as emission-free ‘clean’ alternatives to biomass at the household level. 
&lt;ref name="openknowledge.worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22521|publisher=Open Knowledge Repository, World Bank, Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, negative externalities still exist - ambient air pollution in areas near power plants still poses a health risk, while the generation of electricity in India and China (countries largely dependent on coal for electricity generation) still poses significant environmental risks. Moreover, only households that are connected to the electric grid in a country or region will have access to electricity for household energy consumption, thereby excluding a large swathe of rural communities.

===Demand===
On the demand side, challenges exist in terms of creating an enabling environment for cook stove acquisition. Incorporating culturally sensitive behavior change techniques (BCTs) into demand interventions is necessary to foster large-scale behavior change, as discussed below. The other prohibitive aspect of cook stove interventions that do not involve paternalistic good provision is the high up-front costs of improved stoves. Consumers at the bottom of the income pyramid are often the target end-users of these improved technologies, but due to a lack of collateral or isolation, they do not have access to traditional forms of consumer finance and credit. Innovations in business models and the increased proliferation of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are addressing these issues – however, MFIs face challenges of scaling up.

===Government intervention===
Given the negative externalities associated with unclean cook stove technology – the negative impact on women and girls; lack of environmental sustainability; and increased risk of diseases associated with HAP – there is a strong case for government intervention. For instance, one form of intervention could be direct subsidies linked to health and climate impacts – for example, targeted subsidies carbon markets. The provision of public goods such as consumer education, access to consumer finance would also be beneficial interventions. Subsidies towards investment in R&amp;D for cleaner technologies and fuels, as well as for the implementation of a baseline standards and testing framework for cleanliness and efficiency (also provision of a public good), is necessary to create an effective and sustainable supply chain.

[[File:Market for improved stove use.png|thumb|Positive consumption externalities from improved cook stove use, justifying external intervention]]

==Developments==
There have been significant developments in energy efficient cooking solutions, such as the Wonderbag, which can also significantly reduce fuel requirements for residential cooking. Improvements in technology have allowed for the use of more sustainable cooking solutions with traditional fuels, such as the BioLite Home Stove, a biomass stove which reduces fuel consumption by 50% and emissions by up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioLite Home Stove|url=https://global.bioliteenergy.com/products/homestove}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in business models have also allowed for cook stove suppliers to “dramatically improve both manufacturer and end-user economics, while achieving high levels of health and environmental benefits.”&lt;ref name="openknowledge.worldbank.org"/&gt; For instance, Inyeneri is a for-profit energy company in Rwanda that operates as more as a ‘cooking fuel utility company’. Its model successfully addresses a number of problems with stove adoption including prohibitively high upfront stove costs, consumer tendency to combine new and old cooking solutions, and lack of commercial viability of these enterprises. Additionally, innovations in mobile technology have allowed companies like PayGo Energy in Kenya and KopaGas in Tanzania to overcome the cost barrier that low-income consumers face, including the high up-front cost of stoves and the inaccessibility of purchasing fuels in small quantities (a form of the [[poverty penalty]]). MFIs have also begun to turn their attention to clean energy access, as seen with the success of the USAID-funded Renewable Energy Microfinance and Microenterprise Program (REMMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy Microfinance and Microenterprise Program (REMMP)|url=http://arcfinance.org/projects/remmp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education interventions and behaviour change techniques==
Educational intervention can contribute to reducing exposure to smoke by implementing behaviour change techniques that people to the dangers and encourage a willingness to alter living and cultural practices which could have a significant impact on mitigating exposure to IAP. Behavior change is one aspect of influencing demand that can be achieved through targeted social marketing campaigns, which are usually of two types: either mass market campaigns, or focused approaches at the local and household level that employ demonstrations and follow up visits. Studies show that mass marketing campaigns do in fact increase awareness of risks of household air pollution, but are often unsuccessful in raising purchases of improved stoves.

Design of these interventions must be undertaken with the knowledge that “consumer needs and preferences are complex and are influenced by many contextual and social factors that require a deep understanding of culture, going beyond technology and economics.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bishop|first1=S|last2=Pursnani|first2=P|last3=Sumpter|first3=C|title=Social marketing in India: lessons learned from efforts to foster demand for cleaner cookstoves|url=https://www.shellfoundation.org/ShellFoundation.org_new/media/Shell-Foundation-Reports/shell_founation_social_marketing_in_india.pdf|publisher=London: Shell Foundation; 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors include intra-[[gender issues]], felt needs, cultural significance of food, and religious and cultural beliefs. Evidence of one successful government intervention was revealed by China who, between 1980 and 1995, disseminated 172 million improved cookstoves. This effort proved more successful due to the inclusion of local users, particularly women, who were involved in the design and fieldwork process.

==Primary intervention for children==
Children up to five years of age spend 90% of their time at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mukesh Dherani|title= Indoor air pollution from unprocessed solid fuel use and pneumonia risk in children aged under five years: a systematic review and meta-analysis no.5 Genebra |journal=Bull World Health Organ|volume=86 |issue=1 |date=May 2008 |pages=321–416|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/5/07-044529-ab/en/index.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, 50% of pneumonia deaths among children under five years of age are due to particulate matter inhaled from indoor air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zheng, Li|title=Evaluation of exposure reduction to indoor air pollution in stove intervention projects in Peru by urinary biomonitoring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites|journal=Environment International|volume=37 |issue=7 |date=October 2011 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412011000961 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2011.03.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many homes around the world used solid fuels for cooking.

==Kenya and modern energy==
{{see also|Renewable energy in Africa}}
As of 2004, Kenya has shown a willingness to undertake biomass energy issues with the understanding that consumption is associated with indoor air pollution and environmental degradation.&lt;ref name="VillagePdf" /&gt; Suggestions from the [[United Nations Development Programme]] include establishing an institution that will deal exclusively with biomass energy by developing [[policy]] guidelines on sustainable firewood, charcoal, and modern biomass such as cleaner fuels and [[wind]], [[solar power|solar]], and small scale [[hydropower]]. Short-term solutions rest in more efficient domestic energy use by way of improved cook stoves which provide more affordable options in the near future than a complete shift to nonsolid fuels. Long-term solutions rest on transition to modern cleaner fuels and alternative energy sources within a broad international and national policy and economic agenda. Government support for long-term solutions is feasible as witnessed by current efforts in [[Zambia]] to develop policy to promote biofuels.

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya
annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the country's electric grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further action==
National and international effort must be stepped up to advance short and long term solutions for the millions of women and children who suffer from poverty and disease as a result of indoor air pollution. Scientists predict the African continent will be the first to experience the [[effects of global warming]] where widespread poverty will put millions at further risk due to their limited capabilities to adapt. The potential is great for a more sustainable Africa with commitment from within and outside the region. [[Pneumonia]] is the number one killer of children in the world and indoor air pollution is a strongly significant risk factor for severe pneumonia. The global health community designated 2 November to be [[World Pneumonia Day]] in order to raise awareness about the disease and its causes.

'''Jillian Marsh''' was raised in the coal-mining town of [[Leigh Creek]], in [[South Australia]]’s [[Flinders Ranges]], and she has had a long interest in mining issues and indigenous communities. In 1998 Marsh received the prestigious [[Jill Hudson Environmental Award]] for her work in educating people living near the [[Beverly Uranium Mine]] about the toxic dangers of [[uranium mining]]. In 2004 Marsh won a Doctoral candidacy at [[Adelaide University]]’s Geographical and Environmental Studies Department. Her PhD research topic is ''A Look at the Approval of Beverley Mine and the Ways that Decisions are Made When Mining Takes Place in Adnyamathanha Country''.  In 2008, Jillian Marsh received the [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/nomframe.htm 2008 Nuclear-Free Future Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207021624/http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/nomframe.htm |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2286645.htm  Mining plan has SA Aborigines worried]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/1999/354/19202 Indigenous people oppose Beverley uranium mine]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''joule thief''' is a minimalist self-oscillating [[boost converter|voltage booster]] that is small, low-cost, and easy to build, typically used for driving small loads. This circuit is also known by other names such as ''[[blocking oscillator]]'', ''joule ringer'', ''vampire torch''.

It can use nearly all of the energy in a single-cell [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]], even far below the voltage where other circuits consider the battery fully discharged (or "dead"); hence the name, which suggests the notion that the circuit is ''stealing'' energy or "[[joule]]s" from the source - the term is a [[pun]] on the age-old expression "jewel thief".

The circuit is a variant of the [[blocking oscillator]] that forms an unregulated voltage boost converter. The output voltage is increased at the expense of higher current draw on the input, but the integrated (average) current of the output is lowered and brightness of a luminescence decreased.

==History==

===Prior art===
The joule thief is not a new concept.  Basically, it adds an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] to the output of a self-oscillating voltage booster, which was patented many decades ago.

This is achieved by using a [[JFET]], which does not require the forward biasing of a PN junction for its operation, because it is used in the [[depletion mode]]. In other words, the drain–source already conducts, even when ''no'' bias voltage is applied. This patent was intended for use with [[thermoelectric power source]]s.

===Kaparnik===
In November 1999 issue of ''[[Everyday Practical Electronics]]'' (''EPE'') magazine, the "Ingenuity Unlimited" (reader ideas) section had a novel circuit idea entitled ''"One Volt LED - A Bright Light"'' by {{nowrap|Z. Kaparnik}} from [[Swindon]], Wilts, UK. Three example circuits were shown for operating LEDs from supply voltages below 1.5 Volts. The basic circuits consisted of a transformer-feedback ZTX450 NPN transistor voltage converter based on the blocking oscillator.  Kaparnik acknowledged the concept predated [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Kaparnik1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everyday Practical Electronics|url=http://www.epemag3.com/projects-legacy.html|date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitchell===
In 2002,&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Make a joule thief|url=http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/joule.htm|accessdate=28 June 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020829123244/http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/joule.htm|archive-date=2002-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name "'''Joule Thief'''" was coined by Clive Mitchell&lt;ref name="Mitchell3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Clive's ''YouTube'' channel |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K53beWYdIpc |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given to his variant of Kaparnik's circuit (from 1999 EPE magazine) which consisted of a single cell, a single BC549 [[NPN transistor#NPN|NPN transistor]], a coil with two windings, a single resistor (typically 1000 ohms), and a single white [[LED]]. Clive originally named the circuit "''Vampire Torch''", because it sucked the last remnants of life from a battery.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"/&gt;

Mitchell's newer circuit is essentially the same as Kaparnik's older circuit, except for component values:
*The Kaparnik schematic showed a resistor value of 10K though he stated that lower resistance, such as 2K, would produce higher currents; where as Mitchell's schematic showed only a 1K resistor in his schematic.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"/&gt;
*Kaparnik stated that an NPN transistor with lower V&lt;sub&gt;ce(sat)&lt;/sub&gt; yielded better results. He tested three transistors: ZTX450 at 73% efficiency, ZTX650 at 79% efficiency, BC550 at 57% efficiency. Mitchell showed only the BC549 in his schematic.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"/&gt;

==Description of operation==
[[File:Joule_thief_schematic_de.svg|250px|thumb|Example of a joule thief circuit driving an LED. The coil consists of a standard [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] [[magnetic core#Toroidal core|toroid core]] with two windings of 20 turns each using {{nowrap|0.15 mm}} (0.006 inch) diameter wire {{nowrap|(38 [[Standard wire gauge|swg]])}} (34-35 [[American wire gauge|AWG]]). The circuit can utilize an input voltage down to about {{nowrap|0.35 V}} and can run for weeks using a {{nowrap|1.5 V}} [[AA battery|LR6/AA]]. The battery voltage is usually {{nowrap|1.5 V}}. The resistor is {{nowrap|~1 kΩ}}, {{nowrap|1/4 W}}. The [[transistor]] could be a 2N3904, BC547B, 2SC2500, BC337, 2N2222, 2N4401 or other NPN. V&lt;sub&gt;ceo&lt;/sub&gt;= 30&amp;nbsp;V, P= 0.625&amp;nbsp;W. A white [[light-emitting diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;= 3.2&amp;nbsp;V might be used.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"/&gt;
[[File:Joule thief waveform.jpg|thumb|The waveform of an operating joule thief, showing a 30% duty cycle at approximately {{nowrap|40 kHz}}]] ]]
{{See also|Blocking oscillator}}

The circuit works by rapidly switching the transistor. Initially, current begins to flow through the resistor, secondary winding, and base-emitter junction (see diagram) which causes the transistor to begin conducting collector current through the primary winding. Since the two windings are connected in opposing directions, this induces a voltage in the secondary winding which is positive (due to the winding polarity, see [[dot convention]]) which turns the transistor on with higher bias. This self-stroking/positive-feedback process almost instantly turns the transistor on as hard as possible (putting it in the saturation region), making the collector-emitter path look like essentially a closed switch (since V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; will be only about 0.1 volts, assuming that the base current is high enough). With the primary winding effectively across the battery, the current increases at a rate proportional to the supply voltage divided by the inductance. Transistor switch-off takes place by different mechanisms dependent upon supply voltage.

The gain of a transistor is not linear with V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;. At low supply voltages (typically 0.75 V and below) the transistor requires a larger base current to maintain saturation as the collector current increases. Hence, when it reaches a critical collector current, the base drive available becomes insufficient and the transistor starts to pinch off and the previously described positive feedback action occurs turning it hard off.

To summarize, once the current in the coils stops increasing for any reason, the transistor goes into the cutoff region (and opens the collector-emitter "switch"). The magnetic field collapses, inducing however much voltage is necessary to make the load conduct, or for the secondary-winding current to find some other path.

When the field is back to zero, the whole sequence repeats; with the battery ramping-up the primary-winding current until the transistor switches on.

If the load on the circuit is very small the rate of rise and ultimate voltage at the collector is limited only by stray [[capacitance]]s, and may rise to more than 100 times the supply voltage. For this reason, it is imperative that a load is always connected so that the transistor is not damaged. Because V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; is mirrored back to the secondary, failure of the transistor due to a small load will occur through the reverse V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; limit for the transistor being exceeded (this occurs at a much lower value than V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;max).

The transistor dissipates very little energy, even at high oscillating frequencies, because it spends most of its time in the fully on or fully off state, so either voltage over or current through the transistor is zero, thus minimizing the switching losses.

The switching frequency in the example circuit opposite is about {{nowrap|50 kHz}}. The light-emitting diode will blink at this rate, but the [[persistence of vision|persistence]] of the human eye means that the blinking will not be noticed.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"/&gt;

===Simple voltage regulation===
[[File:Joule thief schematic const voltage de.svg|thumb|right|Joule thief with regulated output voltage]]
A simple modification of the previous schematic replaces the LED with three components to create a simple [[Zener diode#Voltage regulator|zener diode based voltage regulator]]. Diode D1 acts as a [[half-wave rectifier]] to allow capacitor C to charge up only when a  higher voltage is available from the joule thief on the left side of diode D1. The [[Zener diode]] D2 limits the output voltage.

A better solution is shown in the next schematic example.

{{clear}}
===Closed-loop regulated joule thief===
[[File:Regulated_Joule_Thief.png|250px|thumb|right|A closed-loop regulated joule thief]]
When a more constant output voltage is desired, the joule thief can be given a closed-loop control. In the example circuit, the [[Schottky diode]] D1 blocks the charge built up on capacitor C1 from flowing back to the switching transistor Q1 when it is turned on. A 5.6 Volt [[Zener diode]] D2 and transistor Q2 forms the feedback control: when the voltage across the capacitor C1 is higher than the threshold voltage formed by Zener voltage of D2 plus the base-emitter turn-on voltage of transistor Q2, transistor Q2 is turned on diverting the base current of the switching transistor Q1, impeding the oscillation and prevents the voltage across capacitor C1 from rising even further. When the voltage across C1 drops below the threshold voltage Q2 turns off, allowing the oscillation to happen again. If the load requires even lower ripple, in this example some delicate digital circuitry like a microcontroller, a [[linear regulator]] can be used after this to smooth the ripple out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulated Joule Thief: why it works?|url=https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/151684/regulated-joule-thief-why-it-works|website=Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1355">In [[plasma physics]], the '''Lundquist number''' (denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[dimensionless]] ratio which compares the timescale of an [[Alfvén wave]] crossing to the timescale of resistive diffusion. It is a special case of the [[Magnetic Reynolds number]] when the [[Alfvén wave|Alfvén velocity]] is the typical velocity scale of the system, and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{Lv_A}{\eta} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the typical length scale of the system, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic diffusivity]] and &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Alfvén wave|Alfvén velocity]] of the plasma.  

High Lundquist numbers indicate highly conducting plasmas, while low Lundquist numbers indicate more resistive plasmas.  Laboratory plasma experiments typically have Lundquist numbers between &lt;math&gt;10^2-10^8&lt;/math&gt;, while in astrophysical situations the Lundquist number can be greater than &lt;math&gt;10^{20}&lt;/math&gt;.  Considerations of Lundquist number are especially important in [[magnetic reconnection]].

'''Magnesium diboride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a dark gray, water-insoluble solid.  The compound has attracted attention because it becomes [[superconductor|superconducting]] at T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 39K.  In terms of its composition, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; differs strikingly from most superconductors of comparable T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'s, which feature transition metals.

==Superconductivity==
Magnesium diboride's superconducting properties were discovered in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35065039|year=2001|last1=Nagamatsu|first1=Jun|last2=Nakagawa|first2=Norimasa|last3=Muranaka|first3=Takahiro|last4=Zenitani|first4=Yuji|last5=Akimitsu|first5=Jun|journal=Nature|volume=410|issue=6824|pages=63–4|pmid=11242039|title=Superconductivity at 39 K in magnesium diboride|bibcode = 2001Natur.410...63N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[critical temperature#Superconductivity|critical temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of {{convert|39|K|0}} is the highest amongst [[conventional superconductor]]s. Among conventional ([[BCS theory|phonon-mediated]]) superconductors, it is unusual. Its electronic structure is such that there exist two types of [[electrons]] at the [[Fermi level]] with widely differing behaviours, one of them ([[Sigma bond|sigma-bonding]]) being much more strongly superconducting than the other ([[Pi bond|pi-bonding]]). This is at odds with usual theories of phonon-mediated superconductivity which assume that all electrons behave in the same manner. Theoretical understanding of the properties of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has nearly been achieved by modelling two energy gaps. In 2001 it was regarded as behaving more like a metallic than a [[cuprate superconductor]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/35065559|arxiv=cond-mat/0102216 |year=2001 |last1=Larbalestier |first1=D.

===Semi-Meissner state===
Using [[BCS theory]] and the known energy gaps of the pi and sigma bands of electrons (2.2 and 7.1 meV, respectively), the pi and sigma bands of electrons have been found to have two different [[coherence length]]s (51&amp;nbsp;nm and 13&amp;nbsp;nm, respectively).&lt;ref name=Moshchalkov&gt;{{cite journal| author = Moshchalkov, V. V.|title = Type-1.5 Superconductors| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 102| issue = 11| page = 117001|year =2009| doi =10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.117001| pmid=19392228| bibcode=2009PhRvL.102k7001M|arxiv = 0902.0997 |last2 = Menghini|first2 = Mariela|last3 = Nishio|first3 = T.|last4 = Chen|first4 = Q.|last5 = Silhanek|first5 = A.|last6 = Dao|first6 = V.|last7 = Chibotaru|first7 = L.|last8 = Zhigadlo|first8 = N.|last9 = Karpinski|first9 = J.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[London penetration depth]]s are 33.6&amp;nbsp;nm and 47.8&amp;nbsp;nm. This implies that the [[Ginzburg-Landau parameter]]s are 0.66±0.02 and 3.68, respectively. The first is less than 1/{{radic|2}} and the second is greater, therefore the first seems to indicate marginal type I superconductivity and the second type II superconductivity.

It has been predicted that when two different bands of electrons yield two quasiparticles, one of which has a coherence length that would indicate type I superconductivity and one of which would indicate type II, then in certain cases, vortices attract at long distances and repel at short distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Babaev, Egor |authorlink1=Egor Babaev |author2=Speight, Martin  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.72.180502|arxiv=cond-mat/0411681|title= Semi-Meissner state and neither type-I nor type-II superconductivity in multicomponent systems|year=2005|journal=Physical Review B|volume=72|issue=18|pages=180502|bibcode = 2005PhRvB..72r0502B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the potential energy between [[vortices]] is minimized at a critical distance. As a consequence there is a conjectured new phase called the [[semi-Meissner state]], in which vortices are separated by the critical distance. When the applied flux is too small for the entire superconductor to be filled with a lattice of vortices separated by the critical distance, then there are large regions of type I superconductivity, a Meissner state, separating these domains.

Experimental confirmation for this conjecture has arrived recently in MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; experiments at 4.2 Kelvin. The authors found that there are indeed regimes with a much greater density of vortices. Whereas the typical variation in the spacing between Abrikosov vortices in a type II superconductor is of order 1%, they found a variation of order 50%, in line with the idea that vortices assemble into domains where they may be separated by the critical distance. The term [[type-1.5 superconductor|type-1.5 superconductivity]] was coined for this state.&lt;ref name=Moshchalkov/&gt;

==Synthesis==
Magnesium diboride was synthesized and its structure confirmed in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Preparation and Structure of Magnesium Boride, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|author1=Jones, Morton E.  |author2=Marsh, Richard E. 
 |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume = 76 |issue = 5| page = 1434| year = 1954|doi = 10.1021/ja01634a089}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest synthesis involves high temperature reaction between [[boron]] and [[magnesium]] powders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Formation begins at 650&amp;nbsp;°C; however, since magnesium metal melts at 652&amp;nbsp;°C, the reaction may involve diffusion of magnesium vapor across boron grain boundaries. At conventional reaction temperatures, [[sintering]] is minimal, although grain recrystallization is sufficient for Josephson [[quantum tunnelling]] between grains.

Superconducting magnesium diboride wire can be produced through the [[powder-in-tube]] (PIT) ''ex situ'' and ''in situ'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;B.A.Glowacki, M.Majoros, M.Vickers, J.E.Evetts, Y.Shi and I.McDougall, Superconductivity of powder-in-tube MgB2 wires, Superconductor Science and Technology, 14 (4) 193 (April 2001) | DOI: 10.1088/0953-2048/14/4/304&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''in situ'' variant, a mixture of boron and magnesium is reduced in diameter by conventional [[wire drawing]]. The wire is then heated to the reaction temperature to form MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the ''ex situ'' variant, the tube is filled with MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powder, reduced in diameter, and sintered at 800 to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. In both cases, later hot isostatic pressing at approximately 950&amp;nbsp;°C further improves the properties.

An alternative technique, disclosed in 2003, employs reactive liquid infiltration of magnesium inside a granular preform of boron powders and was called Mg-RLI technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactive sintering from elements|author = Giunchi, G.| journal = IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity|volume = 13|pages = 3060–3063|date = 6 August 2002|doi = 10.1109/TASC.2003.812090|issue = 2 |last2 = Ceresara|first2 = S.|last3 = Ripamonti|first3 = G.|last4 = Chiarelli|first4 = S.|last5 = Spadoni|first5 = M.|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2003ITAS...13.3060G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method allowed the manufacture of both high density (more than 90% of the theoretical density for MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) bulk materials and special hollow fibers. This method is equivalent to similar melt growth based methods such as the [[Infiltration and Growth Processing method]] used to fabricate bulk YBCO superconductors where the non-superconducting Y2Ba1Cu1O5 is used as granular preform inside which YBCO based liquid phases are infiltrated to make superconductive YBCO bulk. This method has been copied and adapted for MgB2 superconductor and rebranded as [[Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration]]. The process of Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration in a boron preform to obtain MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been a subject of patent applications by Edison S.p.A. (Italy).

[[Hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition]] (HPCVD) has been the most effective technique for depositing magnesium diboride (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) thin films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films by hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition|author = Xi, X.X.| journal = Physica C|volume = 456|pages = 22–37|date = 14 February 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.physc.2007.01.029|bibcode = 2007PhyC..456...22X |last2 = Pogrebnyakov|first2 = A.V.|last3 = Xu|first3 = S.Y.|last4 = Chen|first4 = K.|last5 = Cui|first5 = Y.|last6 = Maertz|first6 = E.C.|last7 = Zhuang|first7 = C.G.|last8 = Li|first8 = Qi|last9 = Lamborn|first9 = D.R.|last10 = Redwing|first10 = J.M.|last11 = Liu|first11 = Z.K.|last12 = Soukiassian|first12 = A.|last13 = Schlom|first13 = D.G.|last14 = Weng|first14 = X.J.|last15 = Dickey|first15 = E.C.|last16 = Chen|first16 = Y.B.|last17 = Tian|first17 = W.|last18 = Pan|first18 = X.Q.|last19 = Cybart|first19 = S.A.|last20 = Dynes|first20 = R.C.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surfaces of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films deposited by other technologies are usually rough and [[non-stoichiometric]]. In contrast, the [[HPCVD]] system can grow high-quality ''in situ'' pure MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films with smooth surfaces, which are required to make reproducible uniform [[Josephson effect|Josephson junctions]], the fundamental element of superconducting circuits.

==Electromagnetic properties==
Properties depend greatly on composition and fabrication process. Many properties are anisotropic due to the layered structure. 'Dirty' samples, e.g., with oxides at the crystal boundaries, are different from 'clean' samples.&lt;ref name="Eisterer"/&gt;

*The highest superconducting transition temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is 39 K.

===Improvement by doping===
Various means of doping MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon (e.g. using 10% [[malic acid]]) can improve the [[upper critical field]] and the maximum current density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hossain, M S A|title=Significant enhancement of H&lt;sub&gt;c2&lt;/sub&gt; and Hirr in MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; bulks at a low sintering temperature of 600&amp;nbsp;°C|doi=10.1088/0953-2048/20/8/L03|year=2007|journal=Superconductor Science and Technology|volume=20|issue=8|pages=L51|bibcode = 2007SuScT..20L..51H |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The excellent superconducting properties of in situ powder-in-tube processed MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tapes with both ethyltoluene and SiC powder added|doi=10.1088/0953-2048/20/6/L02|year=2007|author=Yamada, H|journal=Superconductor Science and Technology|volume=20|issue=6|pages=L30|last2=Uchiyama|first2=N|last3=Matsumoto|first3=A|last4=Kitaguchi|first4=H|last5=Kumakura|first5=H|bibcode = 2007SuScT..20L..30Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;
(also with [[polyvinyl acetate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physc.2007.05.046|arxiv=0708.3885|title= Effect of PVA doping on flux pinning in Bulk MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|year=2007|last1=Vajpayee|first1=A|last2=Awana|first2=V|last3=Balamurugan|first3=S|last4=Takayamamuromachi|first4=E|last5=Kishan|first5=H|last6=Bhalla|first6=G|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|volume=466|pages=46–50|bibcode = 2007PhyC..466...46V }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

5% doping with carbon can raise H&lt;sub&gt;c2&lt;/sub&gt; from 16 to 36 T while lowering ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; only from 39 K to 34 K. The maximum critical current (''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is reduced, but doping with TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can reduce the decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/details.asp?articleID=2542 |title=MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Properties Enhanced by Doping with Carbon Atoms|work=Azom.com|date=June 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Doping MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Ti is patented.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Yong ''et al.''

The maximum critical current (''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) in magnetic field is enhanced greatly (approx double at 4.2 K) by doping with ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholar.ilib.cn/Abstract.aspx?A=kxtb-e200621018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120215030242/http://scholar.ilib.cn/Abstract.aspx?A=kxtb-e200621018|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-02-15|title=Doping effects of ZrC and ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the powder-in-tube processed MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tapes|author=Ma, Y.|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|year=2006|volume=51|issue=21|pages=2669–2672|doi=10.1007/s11434-006-2155-4|bibcode=2006ChSBu..51.2669M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even small amounts of doping lead both bands into the type II regime and so no semi-Meissner state may be expected.

==Thermal conductivity==
MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a multi-band superconductor, that is each Fermi surface has different superconducting energy gap. For MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, sigma bond of boron is strong, and it induces large s-wave superconducting gap, and pi bond is weak and induces small s-wave gap.&lt;ref Name="Band"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citebase.org/fulltext?format=application%2Fpdf&amp;identifier=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Acond-mat%2F0201517 |title=Thermal conductivity of single crystalline MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.66.014504|year=2002|last1=Sologubenko|first1=A.

The quasiparticle states of the vortices of large gap are highly confined to the vortex core.
On the other hand, the quasiparticle states of small gap are loosely bound to the vortex core. Thus they can be delocalized and overlap easily between adjacent vortices.&lt;ref Name="DOS"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.71.23|title=Field Dependence of Electronic Specific Heat in Two-Band Superconductors|year=2002|author=Nakai, Noriyuki|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=71|pages=23|last2=Ichioka|first2=Masanori|last3=MacHida|first3=Kazushige|arxiv = cond-mat/0111088 |bibcode = 2002JPSJ...71...23N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such delocalization can strongly contribute to the thermal conductivity, which shows abrupt increase above H&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref Name="Band"/&gt;

==Possible applications==

===Superconductors===
Superconducting properties and low cost make magnesium diboride attractive for a variety of applications.&lt;ref Name="Vinod"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Prospects for MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors for magnet application|doi=10.1088/0953-2048/20/1/R01|year= 2007|last1= Vinod|first1= K|last2= Kumar|first2= R G Abhilash|last3= Syamaprasad|first3= U|journal= Superconductor Science and Technology|volume= 20|pages= R1–R13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those applications, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powder is compressed with silver metal (or 316 stainless steel) into wire and sometimes tape via the [[Powder-in-tube|PIT]] process.

In 2006 a 0.5 tesla open [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] [[superconducting magnet]] system was built using 18&amp;nbsp;km of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; wires. This MRI used a closed-loop [[cryocooler]], without requiring externally supplied cryogenic liquids for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbussuperconductors.com/Press%20release.pdf |format=PDF |title=First MRI system based on the new Magnesium Diboride superconductor |publisher=Columbus Superconductors |accessdate=2008-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630110339/http://www.columbussuperconductors.com/Press%20release.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physica C: Superconductivity |volume=456 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.physc.2007.01.030 |title=Development of ''ex situ'' processed MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; wires and their applications to magnets |first1=Valeria |last1=Braccini |last2=Nardelli |first2=Davide |last3=Penco |first3=Roberto |last4=Grasso |first4=Giovanni |pages=209–217 |issue=1–2 |bibcode=2007PhyC..456..209B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"...the next generation MRI instruments must be made of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coils instead of [[niobium-titanium|NbTi]] coils, operating in the 20–25 K range without liquid helium for cooling. ...
Besides the magnet applications MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conductors have potential uses in superconducting transformers, rotors and transmission cables at temperatures of around 25 K, at fields of 1 T."&lt;ref Name="Vinod"/&gt;

The [[IGNITOR]] [[tokamak]] is designed to use MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for its poloidal coils.&lt;ref name=I-FS&gt;[http://www2.lns.mit.edu/ignitorproject/Ignitor@MIT/Fact_Sheet.html Ignitor fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin coatings can be used in superconducting radio frequency cavities to minimize energy loss and reduce the inefficiency of liquid helium cooled niobium cavities.

Because of the low cost of its constituent elements, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has promise for use in superconducting low to medium field magnets, electric motors and generators, fault current limiters and current leads.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics===

Unlike elemental boron whose combustion is incomplete through the glassy oxide layered impeding oxygen diffusion, magnesium diboride burns completely when ignited in oxygen or in mixtures with oxidizers.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, E.-C.; Weiser, V. and Roth, E. (2011), Combustion behaviour of Binary Pyrolants based on Mg, MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si and Polytetrafluoroethylene, ''EUROPYRO 2011'', Reims, France&lt;/ref&gt; Thus magnesium boride has been proposed as fuel in [[ram jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J.

'''Relative molecular mass''' or '''molecular weight''' is the mass of a [[molecule]]. It is calculated as the sum of the [[atomic weight|relative atomic masse]]s of each constituent [[chemical element|element]] multiplied by the number of [[atom]]s of that element in the [[molecular formula]]. The molecular mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, determines [[stoichiometry]]. For large molecules such as [[protein]]s, methods based on [[viscosity]] and light-scattering can be used to determine molecular mass when [[crystallographic]] data are not available.

== Definitions ==
Both atomic and molecular masses are usually obtained relative to the mass of the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C (carbon 12), which by definition&lt;ref name="IUPAC1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | title = Atomic Weights of the Elements 1979 | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1980/pdf/5210x2349.pdf | doi = 10.1351/pac198052102349 | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | year = 1980 | volume = 52 | pages = 2349–84 | issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is equal to 12. For example, the molecular mass of [[methane]], whose molecular formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is calculated as follows:
:{| class="wikitable plainrowheaders"
!  !! Atomic mass       !! Number !! Total mass
|-
| C || {{Atomic mass|C}} || 1      || {{Atomic mass|C}}
|-
| H || {{Atomic mass|H}} || 4      || {{Molecular mass|H|4}}
|-
| CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ||      ||        || {{Molecular mass|C|1|H|4}} 
|}
A more proper term would be "relative molecular mass". However the adjective 'relative' is omitted as it is universally assumed that atomic and molecular masses are relative to the mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. Relative atomic and molecular mass values are [[dimensionless]] but are given the "unit" [[Dalton (unit)|Dalton]] (formerly [[atomic mass unit]]) to indicate that the number is equal to the mass of one molecule divided by {{frac|1|12}} of the mass of one atom of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. The mass of 1 [[mole (chemistry)|mol]] of substance is designated as [[molar mass]]. By definition, it has the unit [[gram (unit)|gram]].

In the example above the atomic mass of carbon is given as 12.011, not 12. This is because naturally occurring carbon is a mixture of the [[isotope]]s &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C which have relative atomic masses of 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Moreover, the proportion of the isotopes varies between samples, so 12.011 is an average value. By contrast, there is less variation in naturally occurring hydrogen so the average atomic mass is known more precisely. The precision of the molecular mass is [[Propagation of uncertainty|determined]] by precision of the least precise atomic mass value, in this case that of carbon. In high-resolution [[mass spectrometry]] the isotopomers &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are observed as distinct molecules, with molecular masses of 16 and 17, respectively. The intensity of the mass-spectrometry peaks is proportional to the isotopic abundances in the molecular species. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can also be observed with molecular mass of 17.

== Determination ==
=== Mass spectrometry ===
{{main|Mass spectrometry}}
In mass spectrometry, the molecular mass of a small molecule is usually reported as the [[monoisotopic mass]], that is, the mass of the molecule containing only the most common isotope of each element. Note that this also differs subtly from the molecular mass in that the choice of isotopes is defined and thus is a single specific molecular mass of the many possible. The masses used to compute the monoisotopic molecular mass are found on a table of isotopic masses and are not found on a typical periodic table. The average molecular mass is often used for larger molecules since molecules with many atoms are unlikely to be composed exclusively of the most abundant isotope of each element. A theoretical average molecular mass can be calculated using the [[standard atomic weight]]s found on a typical periodic table, since there is likely to be a statistical distribution of atoms representing the isotopes throughout the molecule. This however may differ from the true average molecular mass of the sample due to natural (or artificial) variations in the isotopic distributions.

=== Hydrodynamic methods ===
To a first approximation, the basis for determination of molecular mass according to [[Mark–Houwink equation|Mark–Houwink relations]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Hiemenz C., and Lodge P. Timothy. Polymer Chemistry. Second ed. Boca Raton: CRC P, 2007. 336, 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt; is the fact that the [[intrinsic viscosity]] of [[solutions]] (or [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]]) of macromolecules depends on volumetric proportion of the dispersed particles in a particular solvent. Specifically, the hydrodynamic size as related to molecular mass depends on a conversion factor, describing the shape of a particular molecule. This allows the apparent molecular mass to be described from a range of techniques sensitive to hydrodynamic effects, including [[dynamic light scattering|DLS]], [[size exclusion chromatography|SEC]] (also known as [[Gel permeation chromatography|GPC]] when the eluent is an organic solvent), [[viscometry]], and diffusion ordered [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (DOSY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johnson Jr., C. S. |journal=[[Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy]]|year=1999| volume=34|pages=203–256|title=Diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: principles and applications |doi=10.1016/S0079-6565(99)00003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent [[Hydrodynamic radius|hydrodynamic size]] can then be used to approximate molecular mass using a series of macromolecule-specific standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neufeld, R. |author2=Stalke, D. |journal=[[Chem. Sci.]]|year=2015| volume=6|pages=3354–3364|title=Accurate Molecular Weight Determination of Small Molecules via DOSY-NMR by Using External Calibration Curves with Normalized Diffusion Coefficients |doi=10.1039/C5SC00670H|url=http://goedoc.uni-goettingen.de/goescholar/bitstream/handle/1/11975/c5sc00670h.pdf?sequence=1}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this requires calibration, it's frequently described as a "relative" molecular mass determination method.

=== Static light scattering ===
It is also possible to determine absolute molecular mass directly from light scattering, traditionally using the [[Zimm plot|Zimm method]]. This can be accomplished either via classical [[static light scattering]] or via [[multi-angle light scattering]] detectors. Molecular masses determined by this method do not require calibration, hence the term "absolute". The only external measurement required is [[Static light scattering#Theory|refractive index increment]], which describes the change in refractive index with concentration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155398">'''Compounds of nickel''' are chemical compounds containing the element [[nickel]] which is a member of the [[group 10 element|group 10]] of the [[periodic table]]. Most compounds in the group have an [[oxidation state]] of +2. Nickel is classified as a [[transition metal]] with nickel(II) having much chemical behaviour in common with iron(II) and cobalt(II). Many salts of nickel(II) are [[isomorphous]] with salts of [[magnesium]] due to the [[ionic radii]] of the cations being almost the same. Nickel forms many [[coordination complex]]es. [[Nickel tetracarbonyl]] was the first pure metal carbonyl produced, and is unusual in its volatility. [[Metalloprotein]]s containing nickel are found in biological systems.

Nickel forms simple binary compounds with non metals including [[halogens]], [[chalcogenides]], and [[pnictides]]. Nickel ions can act as a cation in salts with many acids, including common [[oxoacid]]s Salts of the hexaaqua ion (Ni•6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) are especially well known. Many double salts containing nickel with another cation are known. There are organic acid salts. Nickel can be part of a negatively charged ion (anion) making what is called a nickellate. Numerous quaternary compounds (with four elements) of nickel have been studied for super conductivity properties, as nickel is adjacent to copper and iron in the periodic table can can form compounds with the same structure as the [[high-temperature superconductor]]s that are known.

==General==

{{Empty section|date=February 2017}}

==Colour==
Most of the common [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] of nickel are green due to the presence of hexaaquanickel(II) ion, Ni(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Geometry==
Nickel atoms can connect to surrounding atoms or ligands in a variety of ways. Six coordinated nickel is the most common and is [[octahedral]], but this can be distorted if ligands are not equivalent. For four coordinate nickel arrangements can be square planar, or [[tetrahedral]]. Five coordinated nickel is rarer.

==Magnetism==
Some nickel compounds are [[ferromagnetic]] at sufficiently low temperatures. In order to show magnetic properties the nickel atoms have to be close enough together in the solid structure.

==Binary compounds==
A binary compound of nickel contains one other element. Substances that contain only nickel atoms are not actually compounds.

In a [[noble gas matrix]], nickel can form [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]], a molecule with two nickel atoms: Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=barrett/&gt; Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a bonding energy of 2.07±0.01&amp;nbsp;eV. For Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; the bond energy is around 3.3&amp;nbsp;eV. Nickel dimers and other clusters can also be formed in a gas and plasma phase by shooting a powerful laser at a nickel rod in cold helium gas.&lt;ref name=lian91&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lian |first1=Li |last2=Su |first2=C.-X. |last3=Armentrout |first3=P.B. |title=The bond energy of Ni+2 |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |date=May 1991 |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=168–172 |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(91)87135-X|bibcode=1991CPL...180..168L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxides===
Nickel oxides include [[Nickel(II) oxide]] and [[Nickel(III) oxide]].

===Hydroxides===
Nickel hydroxides are used in [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|Nickel–metal hydride]] batteries.
Nickel(II) hydroxide Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the main hydroxide of nickel is coloured apple green. It is known as the mineral [[theophrastite]].
[[Nickel oxide hydroxide|β-NiO(OH)]] is a black powder with nickel in the +3 oxidation state. It can be made by oxidising [[nickel nitrate]] in a cold alkaline solution with [[bromine]]. A [[Mixed valency|mixed oxidation state]] hydroxide Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is made if oxidation happens in a hot alkaline solution. A Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; hydroxide: nickel peroxide hydrate NiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, can be made by oxidising with alkaline peroxide. It is black, and unstable and oxidises water.

Nickel(II) sulfate can crystallise with six water molecules yielding [[Retgersite]] or with seven making [[Morenosite]] which is isomorphic to Epsom salts.

Nickel sulfite can be formed by bubbling sulfur dioxide through nickel carbonate suspended in water. A solution is formed that slowly loses sulfur dioxide, and which crystallises nickel sulfite hexahydrate.

Nickel trifluoroacetate tetrahydrate exists, as well as two emerald green acid trifluoroacetates, a bridged trinuclear form [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and a hydrated acid form [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;](CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; both with triclinic crystal form. The first has density 2.205 and the second 2.124.

[[Nickel naphthenate]] is used as a fuel additive to suppress smoke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SALOOJA |first1=K.

Nickel terephthalate can be made by a double decomposition of sodium terephthalate and nickel nitrate. Nickel terephthalate precipitates. Its solubility is 0.38 g/100g water at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. In ammonium hydroxide a violet solution forms. Boiling acetic acid converts the nickel to nickel acetate. The terephthalate converts to a basic salt when boiled in water. Understating this compound is important when reducing coloured contaminants in polymers made from terephthalate.&lt;ref name="sherif"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherif |first1=Fawzy G. |title=Heavy Metal Terephthalates |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Product Research and Development |date=1 September 1970 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=408–412 |doi=10.1021/i360035a026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double salts==
Nickel is one of the metals that can form [[Tutton's salts]]. The singly charged ion can be any of the full range of potassium, rubidium, cesium, ammonium (NH4), or thallium.&lt;ref name="Wang2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Xia  |author2=Xinxin Zhuang  |author3=Genbo Su  |author4=Youping He |year=2008 |title=A new ultraviolet filter: Rb2Ni (SO4)2·6H2O (RNSH) single crystal |journal=Optical Materials |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=233–236 |issn=0925-3467 |doi=10.1016/j.optmat.2008.03.020 |url=http://ir.fjirsm.ac.cn/bitstream/350002/5857/1/Wang-2008-A%20new%20ultraviolet%20fi.pdf|bibcode=2008OptMa..31..233W  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a mineral the ammonium nickel salt, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, can be called nickelboussingaultite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nickelboussingaultite: Nickelboussingaultite mineral information and data. |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2896.html |website=www.mindat.org |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With sodium, the double sulfate is nickelblödite Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from the [[blödite family]]. Nickel can be substituted by other divalent metals of similar sized to make mixtures that crystallise in the same form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nickelblödite: Nickelblödite mineral information and data. |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2890.html |website=www.mindat.org |accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickel forms double salts with Tutton's salt structure with [[tetrafluoroberyllate]] with the range of cations of ammonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montgomery |first1=H. |title=Diammonium nickel bis(tetrafluoroberyllate)hexahydrate |journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B  |date=15 September 1980 |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=2121–2123 |doi=10.1107/S0567740880008060}}&lt;/ref&gt; potassium, rubidium, cesium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rây |first1=Nirmalendunath |title=Fluoberyllate und ihre Analogie mit Sulfaten.

Anhydrous salts of the formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be termed metal nickel triusulfates, belong to the family of [[langbeinites]]. The known salts include (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and those of Tl and Cs are predicted to exist.

Some minerals are double salts, for example [[Nickelzippeite]] Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; · 16H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O which is isomorphic to [[cobaltzippeite]], [[magnesiozippeite]] and [[zinczippeite]], part of the [[zippeite]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nickelzippeite: Nickelzippeite mineral information and data. |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2898.html |website=www.mindat.org |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Double hydrides of nickel exist, such as Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reilly |first1=James J. |last2=Wiswall |first2=Richard H. |title=Reaction of hydrogen with alloys of magnesium and nickel and the formation of Mg2NiH4 |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |date=November 1968 |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=2254–2256 |doi=10.1021/ic50069a016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickel can enter into metal oxygen clusters with other high oxidation state elements to form polyoxometalates.  These may stabilise higher oxidation states of nickel, or show catalytic properties.

Nickel tetracarbonyl was the first discovered organonickel compound. It was discovered that carbon monoxide corroded a nickel reaction chamber valve.

Heteroleptic bitmetallic ethoxides have more than one variety of alkoxy group, e.g. Ni[(μ-OPr&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;)(μ-OBu&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;)Al(OBu&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is a purple solid.

Oxoalkoxides contain extra oxygen in addition to the alcohol. With only nickel, none are known, but with antimony an octanuclear molecule exists [Ni&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(μ4-O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(μ3-OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(-OEt)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(EtOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Don C. |last2=Mehrotra |first2=R.

===Aryloxy compounds===
There are many nickel compounds with the formula template Ni(OAr)XL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni(OAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. L is a ligand with phosphorus or nitrogen atoms. OAr is a phenol group or O- attached to an aromatic ring. Often an extra molecule of the phenol is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen attached to nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Don C. |last2=Mehrotra |first2=R.

===μ-bonded molecules===
Others include cyclododecatriene nickel.

===Sulfur rings===

Nickel bis-dithiobenzoate can form a violet coloured sodium salt.&lt;ref name="jolly1-1"/&gt;

Two bisperfluoromethyl-l,2-dithietene molecules react with nickel carbonyl to make a double ring compound with nickel linked to four sulfur atoms. This contains four trifluoromethyl groups and is dark purple. Instead of this methyl or phenyl can substitute. These can be made by substituted acetylenes with sulfur on nickel carbonyl, or on nickel sulfide. Bis-diphenyldithiene nickel has a planar structure&lt;ref name="jolly1-18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jolly |first1=P. W. |last2=Wilke |first2=G. |title=The organic chemistry of nickel |date=1974 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=0-12-388401-2 |volume=1 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nickel chalcogen cluster compound===

A hexameric compound [Ni(SR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is produced in the reaction of nickel carbonyl with [[dialkyl sulfide]]s (RSR).&lt;ref name="jolly1-18"/&gt;

Nickel can be part of a cubane-type cluster with iron and [[chalcogen]]s. The metal atoms are arranged in a tetrahedron shape, with the sulfur or selenium making up another tetrahedron that combines to make a cube. For example, the [NiFe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(SEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is a dianion that has a tetraethyl ammonium salt. Similar ion clusters are [NiFe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(SEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and [NiFe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SEt)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ciurli |first1=Stefano |last2=Ross |first2=Paul K. |last3=Scott |first3=Michael J. |last4=Yu |first4=Shi Bao |last5=Holm |first5=R.

[Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; has a cube with Ni(IV)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at its core, and then the nickel atoms are bridge across the cube faces by five Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; chains and one Se&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; chain. It is formed as a tetraethylammonium salt, from Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, Se, NEt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and nickel dixanthate in [[dimethylformamide]] as a solvent. This reaction also produces (NEt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McConnachie |first1=Jonathan M. |last2=Ansari |first2=Mohammad A. |last3=Ibers |first3=James A. |title=Synthesis and characterization of nickel chalcogenide [Ni4Se4(Se3)5(Se4)]4- anion, a Ni(IV) cubane species |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=August 1991 |volume=113 |issue=18 |pages=7078–7079 |doi=10.1021/ja00018a079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrosyl compounds===

When liquid nickel carbonyl is dissolved in liquid hydrogen chloride, it can react with [[nitrosyl chloride]] to form a dimer Ni(NOCl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This then decomposes to Ni(NO)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is polymeric.&lt;ref name="jolly1-1"/&gt;

Nickel carbonyl reacting with [[nitric oxide]] yields blue coloured mononitrosyl nickel NiNO. With cyclohexane as well, pale blue Ni(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)NO is produced with nitrous oxide as a side product. With cyclopentadiene as well, π-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NiNO is produced.&lt;ref name="jolly1-1"/&gt;

==History==
The company is named after a Cree Indian word, ''niska'' meaning "[[Canada goose]]" indicating the company’s root as the Canadian developer of the first major trading point for natural gas in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niskapartners.com/about-us/history/|title=Official Website Company History|date=|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the company acquired the former Manchester Gas Storage facility in [[Oklahoma]], which was renamed Salt Plains Gas Storage, which is one of the three facilities that make up for AECO Hub. The company operated its business under the name, Niska Gas Storage, in 2006 when the natural gas storage business was acquired by [[Riverstone Holdings]] LLC. Four years later, the company launched an Initial Public Offering&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Policy issues==

A few issues affect most of the green parties around the world, and can often inhibit global cooperation. Some affect structure, and others affect policy:

*[[Anti-nuclear]]
*[[Bioregionalism]]
*[[Biosafety]]
*[[Biosecurity]]
*[[Electoral reform]]
*[[Fundi (politics)|Fundamentalism]] vs. [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]]

*[[Prometheanism]]
*[[Rainforest destruction]]
*[[Safe trade]]

On matters of [[ecology]], [[extinction]], [[biosafety]], [[biosecurity]], [[safe trade]] and [[health security]], "[[Green party|Greens]]" generally agree.  There are very substantial policy differences between and among Green Parties in various countries and cultures, and a continuing debate about the degree to which natural ecology and human needs align.  Agreement on particular issues is often reached using a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus decision making]] process.

==Organizations==

'''Paul Nikolai Kogerman''' ({{osd|5 December|1891|23 November}} in [[Tallinn]] – 27 July 1951 in Tallinn) was an [[Estonia]]n [[chemist]] and founder of modern research in [[oil shale]].

Paul Kogerman was born into a family of gas factory worker (and former sailor).  He went to an elementary school in 1901–1904 and a town school in 1904–1908. After town school Kogerman earned a living by teaching in church manors near Tallinn.&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;  In 1913, he was graduated from the Alexander Gymnasium in Tallinn (Reval) as an extern. Starting in 1913, he studied at the [[University of Tartu]], graduating from its Department of Chemistry in 1918.&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt;  In the [[Estonian War of Independence]] he fought in a unit of Tallinn teachers.&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;  In 1919–1920 he got a state scholarship to study at the [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chemistry&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1921 he was given a qualification of [[chemical technologist]] by the [[University of London]] and in 1922 he received the degree of [[Master of Science]]s.&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1921 to 1936, Kogerman was active at the [[University of Tartu]]. After the defence of his Master's thesis on the thermal decay of oil-shale, he was elected docent of Organic Chemistry of the University in 1922.  He went on to become extraordinary professor in 1924 and full professor in 1925.&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt;  In 1926 and 1933 he was guest lecturer at the [[ETH Zürich]] and in 1927–1928 at [[Harvard University]]. In 1934, he defended, in [[Zürich]], his doctoral thesis on the combining and [[Polymerization|polymerization reactions]] of the isolated [[Covalent bond|double bond]] [[diene]]s.&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Kogerman was professor of organic chemistry at the [[Tallinn University of Technology]], in 1936–1939 he was also a rector of the University.  In 1938, Kogerman was selected to the newly established [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] and in 1946 reselected after re-establishment of the Academy as the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. He was the president of the [[Estonian Naturalists' Society]] in 1929–1936.

The '''Pelamis Wave Energy Converter''' was a technology that used the motion of [[ocean surface wave]]s to create electricity. The machine was made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass; it is this motion which is used to generate electricity.

Developed by the now defunct &lt;ref name=admin2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-30151276|title=Wave power firm Pelamis calls in administrators|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scottish company [[Pelamis Wave Power]] (formerly Ocean Power Delivery), the Pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid, when it was first connected to the UK grid in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on EMEC activities, resource description, and characterisation of wave-induced velocities in a tidal flow|url=http://www.emec.org.uk/EWTEC7_EMEC.pdf'|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelamis Wave Power then went on to build and test five additional Pelamis machines: three first-generation P1 machines, which were tested in a farm off the coast of Portugal in 2009, and two second-generation machines, the Pelamis P2, were tested off Orkney between 2010 and 2014. The company went into administration in November 2014, with the [[intellectual property]] transferred to the [[Scottish Government]] body [[Wave Energy Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wave Energy Scotland Briefing Note|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0048/00483663.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The Pelamis machine is an offshore wave energy converter, operating in water depths greater than 50m.  The machine consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints. As waves pass along the length of the machine, the sections move relative to one another. The wave-induced [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of the sections is resisted by [[hydraulic cylinder]]s which pump high pressure oil through [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic motors]] via smoothing [[hydraulic accumulators]]. The hydraulic motors drive [[electrical generator]]s to produce electricity. Electricity from all the joints is fed down a single [[umbilical cable]] to a junction on the [[sea bed]]. Several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable.

==Principle==

The Pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter.   The machine responds to the curvature of the waves (their shape) rather than the wave height. As waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking, this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves.

==Projects==

===P2 Pelamis Testing at EMEC===

The P2 Pelamis design was Pelamis Wave Power's second generation Pelamis machine.  The Pelamis P2 is 180m long, 4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight.  Consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints, the design is longer and fatter than the previous P1 design.

In 2010, Pelamis Wave Power began tests of the first Pelamis P2 machine at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]], Orkney, Scotland. The machine was owned by the German utility company, [[E.ON]], and was the UK's first commercial supply contract in the [[marine energy]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Waves|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/05/17144639|publisher=''[[Scottish Government]]''|accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 Pelamis Wave Power announced a second order for a P2 machine, from [[ScottishPower]] Renewables, part of [[Iberdrola Renovables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ScottishPower Renewables Purchase Pelamis Wave Power Device|url=http://www.scottishpowerrenewables.com/pages/press_releases.asp?article=63&amp;date_year=2010|publisher=''ScottishPowerRenewables.com''|accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second machine was first installed at EMEC in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ScottishPower Renewables at EMEC|url=http://www.pelamiswave.com/our-projects/project/2/ScottishPower-Renewables-at-EMEC|publisher=''www.pelamiswave.com''|accessdate=2013-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115094548/http://www.pelamiswave.com/our-projects/project/2/ScottishPower-Renewables-at-EMEC|archivedate=2013-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two utility companies announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the P2 Pelamis technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Major Energy Players Join Forces on Wave Power|url=http://www.newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&amp;listcatid=32&amp;listitemid=4529|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129005733/http://newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&amp;listcatid=32&amp;listitemid=4529|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-11-29|publisher=''New Energy Focus''|accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the company, the P2-001 device was acquired by [[Wave Energy Scotland]], having completed over 15,000 hours of operation. The device was decommissioned in April 2016 and sold to the Orkney Island Council for £1. The other device, P2-002 was sold to the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] for use as a test rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dismantling Pelamis P2 001 in Orkney|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/growth-sectors/energy/wave-energy-scotland/news-and-events/news/dismantling-pelamis-p2-001-in-orkney.html|publisher=Wave Energy Scotland|accessdate=13 November 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects Formerly in Development===
E.ON and ScottishPower Renewables announced plans to build larger projects using Pelamis machines in the waters off Orkney's west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ScottishPower Renewables To Develop Major Marine Power Sites In The Pentland Firth|url=http://www.scottishpower.com/PressReleases_2018.htm|publisher=ScottishPower Renewables|accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies won leases in 2010 from [[The Crown Estate]], who own the seabed around the UK, for projects of up to 50MW. The "Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters Leasing Round" was the world's first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Milestone' for wave energy plans|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8564662.stm|publisher= ''news.bbc.co.uk'' | date=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototype Pelamis Machine===
[[Image:Pelamis at EMEC.jpg|thumb|The Pelamis Prototype machine at EMEC, Orkney, Scotland, 2007]]

Pelamis Wave Power tested their first full-scale prototype at the [[European Marine Energy Centre]] in [[Orkney]], Scotland between 2004 and 2007. The machine, which was rated at 750&amp;nbsp;kW, was the world's first offshore [[wave power]] machine to generate electricity into the grid system.

The prototype was 120m long and 3.5m in diameter. It consisted of four tube sections linked by three, shorter, and power conversion modules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development History|url=http://www.pelamiswave.com/development-history|publisher=Pelamis Wave Power|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aguçadoura Wave Farm===

{{Main article|Aguçadoura Wave Farm}}

In 2008 Pelamis tested three first generation, P1 Pelamis waves at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]]. Located off the northwest coast of [[Portugal]] near [[Póvoa de Varzim]], the farm had an installed capacity of 2.25MW and was the world's first multiple machine wave power project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wave energy contract goes abroad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4563077.stm|publisher=''[[BBC Scotland]]''|accessdate=2008-08-06 | date=2005-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was part funded by Portuguese utility [[Enersis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pelamis Offshore Wave Energy in Portugal|url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/pelamis-offshore-wave-energy-portugal/|publisher=''Alternative Energy''|date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time owned by Australian global investment company [[Babcock &amp; Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Babcock &amp; Brown acquires Enersis for €490mn|url=http://www.newratings.com/en/main/company_headline.m?&amp;id=1163434|accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm first generated electricity in July 2008 but was taken offline in November 2008 at the same time as Babcock &amp; Brown encountered financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big boys' greed pulls us all down|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/paul-sheehan/australias-richest-man-youre-having-a-laugh-/2008/10/26/1224955851150.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Nijkamp''' (born 26 February 1946) is a Dutch [[economist]], Professor of [[Regional science|Regional Economics]] and [[Economic geography|Economic Geography]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], a fellow of the [[Tinbergen Institute]] and President of the Governing Board of the Netherlands Research Council (NWO). He is ranked among the [http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html top 100 economists] in the world according to [[Research Papers in Economics|IDEAS/RePEc]], and is by far the most prolific economist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.dnbworks.html IDEAS/RePEc Number of Distinct Works]&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his career at the VU university Nijkamp faced accusations of (self)plagiarism&lt;ref name="sahadat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3572791/2014/01/07/VU-verzweeg-maandenlang-plagiaatzaak-bij-economie.dhtml|title=VU verzweeg maandenlang plagiaatzaak bij economie|last=Sahadat|first=Ianthe|date=7 January 2014|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VU-appointed investigators have criticised referencing methods in some of his work.&lt;ref name="AV15"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.advalvas.vu.nl/nieuws/commissie-kraakt-nijkamp-vu-vindt-dat-te-hard Commissie kraakt Nijkamp - VU vindt dat te hard], ''Advalvas'', 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Dalfsen]], Overijssel, Nijkamp received his [[Master of Science|MSc]] in [[Econometrics]] and Regional Economics in 1970, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Regional Economics in 1972, both from the [[Erasmus University]], [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].

He has honorary doctorates from the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] and the [[National Technical University of Athens]]. He is a winner of the [[Spinozapremie]] (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/1996 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 1996 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Prize in Regional Science, and Founder's Medal of the Regional Science Association International.

He has been member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/4597 |title=Peter Nijkamp |language=Dutch |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2013, the PhD thesis of one of his students was withdrawn one day before the scheduled defence. It consisted almost entirely of papers jointly written with Nijkamp. An internal investigation at the VU determined that some of these papers were recycled versions of yet earlier papers, with other co-authors, who had not been cited properly and this might be considered a form of plagiarism. The VU's rector, Frank van der Duyn Schouten, stated that Nijkamp had acted improperly but had not committed plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3573444/2014/01/07/Rector-VU-wat-Nijkamp-deed-was-geen-diefstal.dhtml|title=Rector VU: wat Nijkamp deed, was geen diefstal|last=Sahadat|first=Ianthe|date=7 January 2014|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student involved was allowed to adapt the thesis and the graduation ceremony took place in 2014.

Following extensive press reports that claimed to have found cases of [[self-plagiarism]] in Nijkamp's work&lt;ref name="remie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/01/07/vier-voorbeelden-van-het-zelfplagiaat-van-topeconoom-nijkamp/|title=Vier voorbeelden van het (zelf)plagiaat van topeconoom Nijkamp - nrc.nl|last=Remie|first=Mirjam|date=7 January 2014|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5288/Onderwijs/article/detail/3573858/2014/01/08/Onderzoek-60-procent-publicaties-VU-econoom-bevat-zelfplagiaat.dhtml|title=Onderzoek: 60 procent publicaties VU-econoom bevat 'zelfplagiaat'|date=8 January 2014|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an analysis by an anonymous whistleblower, the VU announced it would investigate Nijkamp's entire publishing record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observantonline.nl/English/Home/Articles/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2057/VU-investigates-plagiarism-by-Nijkamp VU investigates plagiarism by Nijkamp], observantonline.nl, retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It would also inquire with the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] on the boundary between self-plagiarism and "self-citation".

The investigation committee concluded in March 2015 that Nijkamp had re-used earlier publications in new papers on a certain scale, without proper referencing and the committee qualified this as "questionable research practice".&lt;ref name="AV15" /&gt; The VU accepted some, but not all, of the committee conclusions.&lt;ref name="AV15" /&gt; In a separate investigation the Dutch National Board on Research Integrity found Nijkamp "careless" but not in breach of scientific integrity. It also found university regulations on self-citation insufficient at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.advalvas.vu.nl/nieuws/integriteitsorgaan-vu-onzorgvuldig-gehandeld-zaak-nijkamp Integriteitsorgaan: 'VU onzorgvuldig gehandeld in zaak Nijkamp'], ''Advalvas'', 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nijkamp himself stated that the investigation committee's methodology and selection of publications is too thin a base for any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nijkamp-response.pdf ‘Zelfplagiaat’-rapport van de Commissie-Zwemmer: Broddelwerk over fictieve peanuts], Nijkamp's response, via retractionwatch.com, retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulsed power''' is the science and technology of accumulating [[energy]] over a relatively long period of time and releasing it very quickly, thus increasing the instantaneous power.

==Overview==
Energy is typically stored within [[electrostatic field]]s ([[capacitor]]s), [[magnetic field]]s ([[inductor]]), as mechanical energy (using large [[flywheel]]s connected to special purpose high current [[alternator]]s), or as chemical energy (high-current lead-acid [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], or [[explosives]]). By releasing the stored energy over a very short interval (a process that is called energy compression), a huge amount of peak power can be delivered to a [[External electric load|load]]. For example, if one [[joule]] of energy is stored within a capacitor and then evenly released to a load over one second, the average power delivered to the load would only be 1 watt. However, if  all of the stored energy were released within one [[microsecond]], the average power over one second would still be one watt, but the instantaneous peak power would be one [[megawatt]], a million times greater.  Examples where pulsed power technology is commonly used include [[radar]], [[particle accelerator]]s, ultrastrong [[magnetic field]]s, [[fusion power|fusion]] research, [[electromagnetic pulse]]s, and high power pulsed [[laser]]s.

==History==
Pulsed Power was first developed during [[World War II]] for use in [[Radar]]. Radar requires short high power pulses. After the war, development continued in other applications, leading to the super pulsed power machines at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].

[[Image:Synchro.JPG|frame|Schematic of a synchro transducer.
The complete circle represents the rotor.  The solid bars represent the cores of the windings next to them. Power to the rotor is connected by slip rings and brushes, represented by the circles at the ends of the rotor winding. As shown, the rotor induces equal voltages in the 120° and 240° windings, and no voltage in the 0° winding. [Vex] does not necessarily need to be connected to the common lead of the stator star windings. |right]]

[[Image:Synchros.svg|frame|Simple two-synchro system.|right]]

A '''synchro''' (also known as '''Selsyn''' and by other brand names) is, in effect, a [[transformer]] whose primary-to-secondary coupling may be varied by physically changing the relative orientation of the two windings.  Synchros are often used for measuring the angle of a rotating machine such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] platform. In its general physical construction, it is much like an electric motor. The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]], is excited by an [[alternating current]], which by [[electromagnetic induction]], causes currents to flow in three Y-connected secondary windings fixed at 120 degrees to each other on the [[stator]].  The relative magnitudes of secondary currents are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator, or the currents can be used to directly drive a receiver synchro that will rotate in unison with the synchro transmitter. In the latter case, the whole device may be called a '''selsyn''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''self'' and ''synchronizing''). 

[[Image:Synchro-standing.jpg|thumb|A picture of a synchro transmitter]]

== Uses ==
Synchro systems were first used in the control system of the [[Panama Canal]] in the early 1900s to transmit lock gate and valve stem positions, and water levels, to the control desks.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Panama Canal; An Engineering Treatise. A Series Of Papers Covering In Full Detail The Technical Problems Involved In The Construction Of The Panama Canal - Geology, Climatology, Municipal Engineering; Dredging, Hydraulics, Power Plants, Etc. Prepared By Engineers And Other Specialists In Charge Of The Various Branches Of The Work And Presented At The International Engineering Congress, San Francisco, California|year=1916|author=Goethals, George W|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Synchro-connections.jpg|thumb|View onto the connection description of a synchro transmitter]]
[[Fire-control system]] designs developed during [[World War II]] used synchros extensively, to transmit angular information from guns and sights to an [[Analog computer|analog fire control computer]], and to transmit the desired gun position back to the gun location.  Early systems just moved indicator dials, but with the advent of the [[amplidyne]], as well as motor-driven high-powered hydraulic servos, the fire control system could directly control the positions of heavy guns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/USNAVY/CHAPTER-10-D.html "Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1", 1957, U.S. Navy Manual, Chapter 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller synchros are still used to remotely drive indicator gauges and as rotary position sensors for aircraft control surfaces, where the reliability of these rugged devices is needed.
Digital devices such as the [[rotary encoder]] have replaced synchros in most other applications.  

Selsyn motors were widely used in [[motion picture]] equipment to synchronize [[movie camera]]s and [[sound recording]] equipment, before the advent of [[crystal oscillators]] and [[microelectronics]].

Large synchros were used on naval warships, such as destroyers, to operate the steering gear from the wheel on the bridge.

== Synchro system types ==
There are two types of synchro systems:  Torque systems and control systems.

In a torque system, a synchro will provide a low-power mechanical output sufficient to position an indicating device, actuate a sensitive switch or move light loads without power amplification.  In simpler terms, a torque synchro system is a system in which the transmitted signal does the usable work.  In such a system, accuracy on the order of one degree is attainable.

In a control system, a synchro will provide a voltage for conversion to torque through an amplifier and a servomotor.  Control type synchros are used in applications that require large torques or high accuracy such as follow-up links and error detectors in servo, automatic control systems (such as an autopilot system).  In simpler terms, a control synchro system is a system in which the transmitted signal controls a source of power which does the usable work.

Quite often, one system will perform both torque and control functions.  Individual units are designed for use in either torque or control systems.  Some torque units can be used as control units, but control units cannot replace torque units.&lt;ref&gt;"MIL-HDBK-225A, ''Synchros.

== Operation ==
On a practical level, synchros resemble motors, in that there is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, [[slip ring]]s and [[brush (electric)|brush]]es connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.

Synchros designed for terrestrial use tend to be driven at 50 or 60 [[hertz]] (the [[Mains electricity|mains]] [[frequency]] in most countries), while those for marine or aeronautical use tend to operate at 400 hertz (the frequency of the on-board [[electrical generator]] driven by the engines).

Single phase units have five wires: two for an exciter winding (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed to the other synchros in the system, and provide the power and information to align the shafts of all the receivers. Synchro transmitters and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of selsyns, used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240 V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60 V AC also.

Synchro transmitters are as described, but 50 and 60-Hz synchro receivers require rotary dampers to keep their shafts from oscillating when not loaded (as with dials) or lightly loaded in high-accuracy applications.

A different type of receiver, called a control transformer (CT), is part of a position servo that includes a servo amplifier and servo motor. The motor is geared to the CT rotor, and when the transmitter's rotor moves, the servo motor turns the CT's rotor and the mechanical load to match the new position. CTs have high-impedance stators and draw much less current than ordinary synchro receivers when not correctly positioned.

Synchro transmitters can also feed synchro to digital converters, which provide a digital representation of the shaft angle.

== Synchro variants ==
So called 'brushless synchros' use [[rotary transformer]]s (that have no magnetic interaction with the usual rotor and stator) to feed power to the rotor. These transformers have stationary primaries, and rotating secondaries. The secondary is somewhat like a spool wound with magnet wire, the axis of the spool concentric with the rotor's axis. The "spool" is the secondary winding's core, its flanges are the poles, and its coupling does not vary significantly with rotor position. The primary winding is similar, surrounded by its magnetic core, and its end pieces are like thick washers. The holes in those end pieces align with the rotating secondary poles.

For high accuracy in gun fire control and aerospace work, so called multi-speed synchro data links were used. For instance, a two-speed link had two transmitters, one rotating for one turn over the full range (such as a gun's bearing), while the other rotated one turn for every 10 degrees of bearing. The latter was called a 36-speed synchro. Of course, the gear trains were made accordingly. At the receiver, the magnitude of the 1X channel's error determined whether the "fast" channel was to be used instead. A small 1X error meant that the 36x channel's data was unambiguous. Once the receiver servo settled, the fine channel normally retained control.

For very critical applications, three-speed synchro systems have been used.

So called multispeed synchros have stators with many poles, so that their output voltages go through several cycles for one physical revolution. For two-speed systems, these do not require gearing between the shafts.

Differential synchros are another category. They have three-lead rotors and stators like the stator described above, and can be transmitters or receivers. A differential transmitter is connected between a synchro transmitter and a receiver, and its shaft's position adds to (or subtracts from, depending upon definition) the angle defined by the transmitter. A differential receiver is connected between two transmitters, and shows the sum (or difference, again as defined) between the shaft positions of the two transmitters. There are synchro-like devices called transolvers, somewhat like differential synchros, but with three-lead rotors and four-lead stators.

A [[resolver (electrical)|resolver]] is similar to a synchro, but has a stator with four leads, the windings being 90 degrees apart physically instead of 120 degrees. Its rotor might be synchro-like, or have two sets of windings 90 degrees apart. Although a pair of resolvers could theoretically operate like a pair of synchros, resolvers are used for computation.

A special T-connected transformer arrangement invented by Scott ([[Scott-T transformer|"Scott T"]]) interfaces between resolver and synchro data formats; it was invented to interconnect two-phase AC power with three-phase power, but can also be used for precision applications.

'''Thorium''' is a weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] metallic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Th''' and [[atomic number]] 90. Thorium is silvery and [[tarnish]]es black when it is exposed to air, forming [[thorium dioxide]]; it is moderately hard, [[malleable]], and has a high [[melting point]]. Thorium is an electropositive [[actinide]] whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 [[oxidation state]]; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.

All known thorium [[isotope]]s are unstable. The most stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, has a half-life of 14.05&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;years, or about the [[Hubble time|age of the universe]]; it decays very slowly via [[alpha decay]], starting a [[decay chain]] named the [[thorium series]] that ends at stable &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;[[Lead|Pb]]. In the universe, thorium and [[uranium]] are the only two radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as [[primordial nuclide|primordial elements]].{{efn|[[Bismuth]] is very slightly radioactive, but its half-life (1.9{{e|19}} years) is so long that its decay is negligible even over geological timespans.}} It is estimated to be over three times more [[natural abundance|abundant]] than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from [[monazite]] sands as a by-product of extracting [[rare-earth metal]]s.

Thorium was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist [[Morten Thrane Esmark]] and identified by the Swedish chemist [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]], who named it after [[Thor]], the [[list of Germanic deities|Norse god]] of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. In the second half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity.

Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in [[TIG welding]] electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. It was also a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in [[gas mantle]]s, but these uses have become marginal. It has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in [[nuclear reactor]]s, and several [[thorium fuel cycle#Reactors|thorium reactors]] have been built.

==Bulk properties==
Thorium is a moderately [[hardness (materials science)|soft]], [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the [[periodic table]], it lies to the right of [[actinium]], to the left of [[protactinium]], and below [[cerium]]. Pure thorium is very [[Ductility|ductile]] and, as normal for metals, can be [[cold-rolling#Cold rolling|cold-rolled]], [[Swaging|swaged]], and [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawn]].{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} At room temperature, thorium metal has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] crystal structure; it has two other forms, one at high temperature (over 1360&amp;nbsp;°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100&amp;nbsp;GPa; [[tetragonal crystal system|body-centred tetragonal]]).{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}}

Thorium metal has a [[bulk modulus]] (a measure of resistance to compression of a material) of 54&amp;nbsp;[[gigapascal|GPa]], about the same as [[tin]]'s (58.2&amp;nbsp;GPa). [[Aluminium]]'s is 75.2&amp;nbsp;GPa; copper's 137.8&amp;nbsp;GPa; and mild steel's is 160–169&amp;nbsp;GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gale |first=W. F. |last2=Totemeier |first2=T. C. |title=Smithells Metals Reference Book |year=2003 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |isbn=978-0-08-048096-1 |language=en |via=|pp=15-2–15-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorium is about as hard as soft [[steel]], so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.&lt;ref name="Yu. D. Tretyakov"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Yu. D. |editor-last=Tretyakov|title= Non-organic chemistry in three volumes| publisher= Academy|date= 2007|volume= 3|series= Chemistry of transition elements|isbn= 978-5-7695-2533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorium is nearly half as dense as [[uranium]] and plutonium and is harder than either of them.&lt;ref name="Yu. D. Tretyakov"/&gt; It becomes [[superconductor|superconductive]] below 1.4&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]].{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} Thorium's [[melting point]] of 1750&amp;nbsp;°C is above both those of actinium (1227&amp;nbsp;°C) and protactinium (1568&amp;nbsp;°C). At the start of [[period 7 element|period 7]], from [[francium]] to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), because the number of delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to [[plutonium]], where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6: this trend is due to the increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding.&lt;ref name="Yu. D. Tretyakov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johansson/&gt; (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.)&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson |first1=B. |last2=Abuja |first2=R. |last3=Eriksson |first3=O. |last4=Wills |first4=J.

The properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually [[thorium dioxide]] (ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;11.66&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; calculated from thorium's [[lattice parameter]]s, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and protactinium (15.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), part of a trend across the early actinides.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}}

Thorium can form [[alloy]]s with many other metals. Addition of small proportions of thorium improves the mechanical strength of [[magnesium]], and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms [[eutectic mixture]]s with [[chromium]] and uranium, and it is completely [[miscibility|miscible]] in both solid and liquid [[state of matter|states]] with its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] cerium.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}}

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of thorium}}
All but two elements up to [[bismuth]] (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being [[technetium]] and [[promethium]] (elements 43 and 61). All elements from [[polonium]] (element 84) onward are measurably [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th is one of the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] and [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]]) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;years, about three times the [[age of the earth]], and slightly longer than the [[age of the universe]].

===Radiometric dating===
Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: [[uranium–thorium dating]], based on the decay of [[uranium-234|&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U]] to &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th to &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th.{{efn|The name ''ionium'' for &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised to be the same element and were given different names.}} These rely on the fact that &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th is a primordial radioisotope, but &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name=uth/&gt; Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U into &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of [[calcium carbonate]] materials such as [[speleothem]] or [[coral]], because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor [[sediment]]s, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref name=uth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys178/pdf/chap3_6.pdf |title=3–6: Uranium Thorium Dating |publisher=Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics, [[University of Notre Dame]] |accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=O.|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Antevs/ecol438/uthdating.html |title=Uranium-Thorium Dating |publisher=Department of Geosciences, [[University of Arizona]] |archivedate=28 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328095352/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Antevs/ecol438/uthdating.html |accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th to &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th.&lt;ref name="rafferty2010"&gt;{{citation|title=Geochronology, Dating, and Precambrian Time: The Beginning of the World As We Know It|date=2010|last1=Rafferty|first1=J.

==Chemistry==
{{Main|Compounds of thorium}}
A thorium atom has 90 electrons, of which four are [[valence electron]]s. Three [[atomic orbital]]s are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=59–60}} Despite thorium's position in the [[f-block]] of the periodic table, it has an anomalous [Rn]6d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. This is due to [[relativistic effects]], which become stronger near the bottom of the periodic table, specifically the relativistic [[spin–orbit interaction]]. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium results in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, in which +4 is also the highest possible state, but +3 plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the [[transition metal]]s zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.&lt;ref name=CottonSA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite journal |first1=W.

Despite the anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the [Rn]6d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration with the 5f orbitals above the [[Fermi level]] should be [[hexagonal close packed]] like the [[group 4 element]]s titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically.&lt;ref name=Johansson/&gt; The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=S. |year=2006 |title=Lanthanide and Actinide Chemistry|page=150|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow, like those of [[silver]] or lead, as the Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has no 5f or 6d electrons.&lt;ref name="Yu. D.

The only other commonly-encountered actinide, uranium, retains some echoes of main-group behaviour. The chemistry of uranium is more complicated than that of thorium, but the two most common oxidation states of uranium are uranium(VI) and uranium(IV); these are two oxidation units apart, with the higher oxidation state corresponding to formal loss of all valence electrons, which is similar to the behaviour of the heavy main-group elements in the [[p-block]].&lt;ref name=King/&gt;}} Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|p=1262}}

===Reactivity===
Thorium is a highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] and electropositive metal. With a [[standard reduction potential]] of −1.90&amp;nbsp;V for the Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=6}} Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit [[pyrophoricity]], spontaneously igniting in air.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} When heated in air, thorium [[swarf|turnings]] ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} Such samples slowly tarnish, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}}

At [[standard temperature and pressure]], thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, with the exception of [[hydrochloric acid]], where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}}&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| last= Hammond |first= C.

High coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size. Thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the [[Manhattan Project]]) has coordination number 14.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=1275–1277}} These thorium salts are known for their high solubility in water and polar organic solvents.&lt;ref name="Yu.

Many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, such as the [[perchlorate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, [[sulfite]]s, nitrates, carbonates, [[phosphate]]s, [[vanadate]]s, [[molybdate]]s, and [[chromate]]s, and their hydrated forms.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=101–115}} They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most of them have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=101–115}} For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=101–115}} Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as [[oxalate]], [[citrate]], and [[EDTA]], are much more stable. In natural thorium-containing waters, organic thorium complexes usually occur in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes, even when the concentrations of inorganic ligands are much greater than those of organic ligands.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=117–134}}

===Organothorium compounds===
Most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the [[cyclopentadienyl complex]]es and [[cyclooctatetraenide anion|cyclooctatetraenyls]]. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to [[americium]], and also expected for [[curium]]), thorium forms a cyclooctatetraenide complex: the yellow Th(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[thorocene]]. It is [[isotypic]] with the better-known analogous uranium compound [[uranocene]].{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=116–117}} It can be prepared by reacting [[potassium cyclooctatetraenide|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] with thorium tetrachloride in [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) at the temperature of [[dry ice]], or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=116–117}} It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=116–117}} [[Half sandwich compound]]s are also known, such as (''η''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)ThCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.&lt;ref name=CottonSA2006/&gt;

Other organothorium compounds are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are known, but their structures have not been determined. They decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion [Th(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt [Li(tmeda)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[ThMe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] (tmeda= Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1&amp;nbsp;pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5&amp;nbsp;pm), they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is not known, but its [[adduct]]s are stabilised by [[phosphine]] ligands.&lt;ref name=CottonSA2006/&gt;

In the universe, thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements, because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process (the other being uranium), and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are [[thulium]], [[lutetium]], tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals, as well as uranium.&lt;ref name=Cameron/&gt;&lt;ref name=nucleosynthesis/&gt;{{efn|[[Even and odd atomic nuclei|An even number of either protons or neutrons]] generally increases nuclear stability of isotopes, compared to isotopes with odd numbers.

In the Earth's crust, thorium is much more abundant: with an abundance of 8.1&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm), it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13&amp;nbsp;ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm).{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|p=1294}} This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophile]].

[[Monazite]] (chiefly phosphates of various rare-earth elements) is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide, principally in India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and [[Malaysia]].

He was a Norwegian [[priest]] and amateur [[mineralogist]] who studied the minerals in Telemark, where he served as [[vicar]].

Berzelius made some initial characterisations of the new metal and its chemical compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 [[atomic mass unit|amu]]); it is actually 15 times as large.{{efn|At the time, the [[rare-earth element]]s, among which thorium was found and with which it is closely associated in nature, were thought to be divalent; the rare earths were given [[atomic weight]] values two-thirds of their actual ones, and thorium and uranium are given values half of the actual ones.}} He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity.&lt;ref name=leach2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=453 |title=The Internet Database of Periodic Tables: Berzelius' Electronegativity Table |last=Leach |first=M.

===Initial chemical classification===
In the periodic table published by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table, at the end of each vertical period after the [[alkaline earth metal]]s. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which also contained the modern [[carbon group]] (group 14) and titanium group (group 4), because their maximum oxidation state was +4.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook//35_pt/pt_database.php |title=The INTERNET Database of Periodic Tables |last=Leach |first=M.

It also appears as the heaviest element in the 1864 table by British chemist [[William Odling]] under titanium, zirconium, and [[tantalum]]. It does not appear in the periodic systems published by French geologist [[Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois]] in 1862, German-American musician [[Gustav Hinrichs]] in 1867, or German chemist [[Julius Lothar Meyer]] in 1870, all of which exclude the rare earths and thorium.&lt;ref name=leach/&gt;}}

===First uses===
While thorium was discovered in 1828 its first application dates only from 1885, when Austrian chemist [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] invented the [[gas mantle]], a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}} Many applications were subsequently found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.

===Radioactivity===

Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist [[Marie Curie]].

It was determined that these variations came from a short-lived gaseous daughter of thorium, which they found to be a new element. This element is now named [[radon]], the only one of the rare radioelements to be discovered in nature as a daughter of thorium rather than uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rutherford, E.|author-link=Ernest Rutherford|author2=Owens, R.

After accounting for the contribution of radon, Rutherford, now working with the British physicist [[Frederick Soddy]], showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements in work dating from 1900 to 1903. This observation led to the identification of the [[half-life]] as one of the outcomes of the [[alpha particle]] experiments that led to the disintegration theory of [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=J.

In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for [[rheumatism]], [[diabetes]], and [[sexual impotence]].

===Further classification===
Up to the late 19th century, chemists unanimously agreed that thorium and uranium were analogous to hafnium and tungsten; the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1913, Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] published a [[Bohr model|theoretical model]] of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals.&lt;ref name=leach/&gt; The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Spronsen |first=J.

The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of production of other minerals.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=7}} The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/thorium/mcs-2012-thori.pdf |title=Thorium |author=United States Geological Survey |date=2012 |access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/fnss/fulltext/0412_1.pdf |title=An Overview of World Thorium Resources, Incentives for Further Exploration and Forecast for Thorium Requirements in the Near Future |last=Jayaram |first=K.

The common production route of thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals; extraction of thorium from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as thorium dioxide.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

===Concentration===
There are two categories of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=6}} Initial concentration varies with the type of deposit.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

For the primary deposits, the source pegmatites, which are usually obtained by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo [[froth flotation|flotation]]. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with [[hydrogen chloride]]; then follow [[thickening]], filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}} Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, with a series of magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

Industrial production in the 20th century relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

====Acid digestion====
Acid digestion is a two-stage process, involving the use of up to 93% [[sulfuric acid]] at 210–230&amp;nbsp;°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300&amp;nbsp;°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot be added to the acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200&amp;nbsp;°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70&amp;nbsp;°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

====Alkaline digestion====
Alkaline digestion is carried out in 30–45% [[sodium hydroxide]] solution at about 140&amp;nbsp;°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads to the formation of poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45&amp;nbsp;μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as [[sodium diuranate]], and phosphate as [[trisodium phosphate]]. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60&amp;nbsp;°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of [[silicon dioxide]] in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are dissolved at 80&amp;nbsp;°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can liberate free [[chlorine]] from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. [[Solvent extraction]] may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of [[titanium hydroxide]] is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

===Purification===
High thorium concentrations are needed in nuclear applications. In particular, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture [[cross-section (physics)|cross-sections]] must be very low (for example, [[gadolinium]] concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective [[complexation]] of Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; are used. For example, following alkaline digestion and the removal of phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with [[tributyl phosphate]] in [[kerosene]].{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=8}}

==Modern applications==
Non-radioactivity-related uses have been in decline since the 1950s{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=32}} due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}}&lt;ref name=Furuta/&gt;

Most thorium applications use its dioxide (sometimes called "thoria" in the industry), rather than the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300&amp;nbsp;°C (6000&amp;nbsp;°F), the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points.&lt;ref name="Emsley2011"/&gt; This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases the brightness of the flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas mantles.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=31}} All substances emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the [[visible spectrum]], hence the brightness of thorium mantles.&lt;ref name="Ivey"&gt;{{ cite journal |first= H.

During the production of [[incandescent]] filaments, [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallisation]] of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten [[sintering]] powder before drawing the filaments.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=32}} A small addition of thorium to tungsten [[hot cathode|thermocathodes]] considerably reduces the [[work function]] of electrons; as a result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}} Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer on the surface of thorium.

Its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=196|title=Optical thin films: user handbook|last=Rancourt |first=J.

==Potential use for nuclear energy==

&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel in the same way as &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U or [[plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]. When &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons emitted can strike further &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th nuclei, continuing the cycle.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}} This parallels the uranium fuel cycle in [[fast breeder reactor]]s where &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U undergoes neutron capture to become &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U, beta decaying to first &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np and then fissile &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/plutonium.aspx|title=Plutonium|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can satisfy world energy demands for longer.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|p=1259}}

&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th absorbs neutrons more readily than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (85.5%) or &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (73.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reColor.jsp?newColor=sigf |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides |publisher= [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|p=1259}} A single neutron capture by &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, but &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98–99% of the &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th nuclei because the intermediate products &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U or &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in [[MOX fuel|mixed oxide fuels]] to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.&lt;ref name="wnn-20130621"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF_Thorium_test_begins_2106131.html |title=Thorium test begins |publisher=World Nuclear News |year=2013 |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing [[reactor core]]{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}} because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher [[thermal conductivity]], and a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to [[triuranium octoxide]] (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle – Potential Benefits and Challenges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|title=IAEA-TECDOC-1450 Thorium Fuel Cycle-Potential Benefits and Challenges|date=2005|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The used fuel is difficult and dangerous to reprocess because many of the daughters of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U are strong gamma emitters.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|p=1259}} All &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U production methods result in impurities of [[uranium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U]], either from parasitic knock-out (n,2n) reactions on &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, or &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U that result in the loss of a neutron, or from double neutron capture of &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th, an impurity in natural &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th:&lt;ref name="Intro2WMD"/&gt;
:{{nuclide|thorium|230}} + n → {{nuclide|thorium|231}} + {{math|γ}} {{overunderset|→|''β''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|25.5 h}} {{nuclide|protactinium|231}} {{overunderset|→|''α''|3.28 × 10{{su|p=4}} y}} {{shy}} {{nuclide|protactinium|231}} + n → {{nuclide|protactinium|232}} + {{math|γ}} {{overunderset|→|''β''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|1.3 d}} {{nuclide|uranium|232}}

&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U by itself is not particularly harmful, but quickly decays to produce the strong gamma emitter &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl. (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th follows the same decay chain, but its much longer half-life means that the quantities of &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl produced are negligible.){{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=30}} These impurities of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U make &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of [[nuclear proliferation]] using &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U as the fissile material.&lt;ref name="Intro2WMD"&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to Weapons of Mass Destruction: Radiological, Chemical, and Biological |last= Langford |first= R.

Thus it is a [[neutron poison]]: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U, a significant amount of &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa converts to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U and consumes neutrons, degrading [[neutron economy|the reactor efficiency]]. To avoid this, &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium [[molten salt reactor]]s during their operation, so that it only decays to &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name="NakajimaGroult2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nakajima|first1=Ts.|last2=Groult|first2=H.|title=Fluorinated Materials for Energy Conversion|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044472-7|pages=562–565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th with neutrons, followed by its processing, need to be mastered before these advantages can be realised, and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and plutonium fuel cycle;{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=52–53}} research continues in this area.

===Radiological===

Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the emitted [[alpha radiation]] cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, such as those in gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thorium: Radiation Protection|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/thorium.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001225000/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/thorium.htm|deadurl=yes|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 February 2016|archivedate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of [[cancer]]s of the [[lung]], [[pancreas]], and [[blood]], as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt; Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of [[liver]] diseases.&lt;ref name="arpansa"/&gt;

The decay products of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products are created as the result of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous [[gamma radiation|gamma]] emitters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonuke.org/ComprehensiveTeachingToolkits/Radiation%20Protection/ChSCC_RP/Columbia%20Basin%20RPT-111/Supplementary%20materials/natural-decay-series.pdf |title=Natural Decay Series: Uranium, Radium, and Thorium |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |year=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817010031/http://gonuke.org/ComprehensiveTeachingToolkits/Radiation%20Protection/ChSCC_RP/Columbia%20Basin%20RPT-111/Supplementary%20materials/natural-decay-series.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=35}} As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use.

Tests on the thorium uptake of workers involved in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no adverse effects on health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the [[tracheobronchial tract]] and the lungs from exposure to thorium.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=34}} People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of [[dermatitis]]. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.&lt;ref name="Emsley2011"/&gt; Thorium has no known biological role.&lt;ref name="Emsley2011"/&gt;

===Chemical===
Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric: it ignites spontaneously in air.{{sfn|Wickleder|Fourest|Dorhout|2006|pp=61–63}} In 1964, the [[United States Department of the Interior]] listed thorium as "severe" on a table entitled "Ignition and explosibility of metal powders". Its ignition temperature was given as 270&amp;nbsp;°C (520&amp;nbsp;°F) for dust clouds and 280&amp;nbsp;°C (535&amp;nbsp;°F) for layers. Its minimum explosive concentration was listed as 0.075&amp;nbsp;oz/cu ft (0.075&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); the minimum igniting energy for (non-submicron) dust was listed as 5&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|mJ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b270510.pdf|title=Explosibility of metal powders|first1=M. |last1=Jacobson |first2=A.

===Exposure routes===
Thorium exists in very small quantities everywhere on Earth although larger amounts exist in certain parts: the average human contains about 40&amp;nbsp;[[microgram]]s of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day.&lt;ref name=Emsley2011/&gt; Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes with food and water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.{{sfn|Stoll|2005|p=35}}

Exposure is raised for people who live near thorium deposits or radioactive waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, and for those who work in gas mantle production.&lt;ref name="ATSDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts147.pdf |title=Thorium ToxFAQs |publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorium is especially common in the [[Tamil Nadu]] coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dae.gov.in/iandm/minesback.htm |title=Compendium Of Policy And Statutory Provisions Relating To Exploitation Of Beach Sand Minerals |publisher=Department of Atomic Energy |accessdate=19 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114125/http://www.dae.gov.in/iandm/minesback.htm |archivedate=4 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common in northern Brazilian coastal areas, from south Bahia to [[Guarapari]], a city with highly radioactive monazite sand beaches, with radiation levels up to 50 times higher than world average background radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=An Acad Bras Cienc|year=1981|volume=53|issue=4|pages=683–691|pmid=7345962 |title=Measurements of environmental radiation exposure dose rates at selected sites in Brazil |authors=Pfeiffer, W.

[[File:Undark (Radium Girls) advertisement, 1921, retouched.png|right|thumb|250px|1921 advertisement for Undark]]
'''Undark''' was a trade name for [[luminous paint]] made with a mixture of [[radioactive]] [[radium]] and [[zinc sulfide]], as produced by the [[United States Radium Corporation|U.S. Radium Corporation]] between 1917 and 1938.  It was used primarily in watch and clock dials. The people working in the industry who applied the radioactive paint became known as the [[Radium Girls]], because many of them became ill and some died from exposure to the radiation emitted by the radium contained within the product. The product was the direct cause of [[radium jaw]] in the dial painters.  Undark was also available as a kit for general consumer use and marketed as glow-in-the-dark paint.

==Similar products==
Mixtures similar to Undark, consisting of radium and zinc sulphide were used by other companies. Trade names include:
* ''Luna'' used by the [[Radium Dial Company]], a division of Standard Chemical Company
and
* ''Marvelite'' used by Cold Light Manufacturing Company (a subsidiary of the Radium Company of Colorado)

'''Vanadium carbide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula [[Vanadium|V]][[Carbide|C]].  It is an extremely [[hardness|hard]] [[refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] [[ceramic]] material.  With a hardness of 9-9.5 Mohs, it is possibly the hardest metal-[[carbide]] known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppm.bc.ca/Cermet_Carbide_Nitride_Powder_Products.html|title=Ceramic and Cermet Composite Powders - PPM Ltd.|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911133534/http://www.ppm.bc.ca/Cermet_Carbide_Nitride_Powder_Products.html|archive-date=11 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of interest because it is prevalent in vanadium metal and alloys.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Günter Bauer, Volker Güther, Hans Hess, Andreas Otto, Oskar Roidl, Heinz Roller, Siegfried Sattelberger "Vanadium and Vanadium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a27_367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and preparation==
Being isomorphous with vanadium monoxide, it crystallizes in the rock salt structure.  Because VC and VO are [[miscible]], samples of VC typically contain an impurity of the oxide.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  It is produced by heating vanadium oxides with carbon at around 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.  Vanadium carbide can be formed in the (111) orientation, when formed by radio frequency magnetron sputtering.  Although VC is thermodynamically stable, it converts to V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C at higher temperatures.

Vanadium carbide is used as an additive to [[tungsten carbide]] to refine the carbide crystals to improve the property of the [[cermet]].

==Physical properties==
Vanadium Carbide has an elastic modulus of approximately 380 GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hannink |first=R. |last2=Murry |first2=M. |title=Elastic moduli measurements of some cubic transition metal carbides and alloyed carbides |date=1974 |journal=Material Science |volume=9 |pages=223-228.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen dioxide gas.jpg|thumb|right|An ampule of [[nitrogen oxide]] vapor: brown [[nitrogen dioxide]] and colorless [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], in [[Nitrogen dioxide#Basic thermal properties|equilibrium]]]]
In physics a '''vapor''' (American) or '''vapour''' (British and Canadian) is a substance in the [[gas]] phase at a [[temperature]] lower than its [[critical temperature]],&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;R. H. Petrucci, W. S. Harwood, and F. G. Herring, ''General Chemistry'', Prentice-Hall, 8th ed. 2002, p. 483–86.&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the vapor can be [[condensation|condensed]] to a [[liquid]] by increasing the [[pressure]] on it without reducing the temperature. A vapor is different from an [[aerosol]].&lt;ref name=Cheng2014/&gt; An aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid, or both within a gas.&lt;ref name=Cheng2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=T.|title=Chemical evaluation of electronic cigarettes|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=23|issue=Supplement 2|year=2014|pages=ii11–ii17|issn=0964-4563|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051482|pmc=3995255|pmid=24732157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, water has a critical temperature of {{convert| 647|K|C F}}, which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist. In the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] at ordinary temperatures, therefore, gaseous water (known as [[water vapor]]) will condense into a liquid if its [[partial pressure]] is increased sufficiently.

A vapor may co-exist with a liquid (or a solid). When this is true, the two phases will be in equilibrium, and the gas-partial pressure will be equal to the equilibrium [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;

== Properties ==
[[Image:phase-diag2.svg|thumb|300px|right|In a typical-phase diagram, the boundary between gas and the critical point.|The vapor-liquid critical point in a pressure-temperature [[phase diagram]] is at the high-temperature extreme of the liquid–gas phase boundary. (The dotted green line gives the anomalous behaviour of water.)]]
''Vapor'' refers to a gas phase at a temperature where the same substance can also exist in the [[liquid]] or [[solid]] state, below the [[critical temperature]] of the substance. (For example, water has a critical temperature of 374&amp;nbsp;°C (647 K), which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist.) If the vapor is in contact with a liquid or solid phase, the two phases will be in a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The term ''gas'' refers to a compressible fluid phase. Fixed gases are gases for which no liquid or solid can form at the temperature of the gas, such as air at typical ambient temperatures. A liquid or solid does not have to boil to release a vapor.

Vapor is responsible for the familiar processes of [[cloud]] formation and [[condensation]]. It is commonly employed to carry out the physical processes of [[distillation]] and [[headspace technology|headspace extraction]] from a liquid sample prior to [[gas chromatography]].

The constituent [[molecule]]s of a vapor possess vibrational, rotational, and translational motion. These motions are considered in the [[kinetic theory of gases]].

[[File:Vapor being used in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|If the [[vapor pressure]] exceeds the [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] value, it becomes [[supersaturated]] and [[condenses]] on any available [[nucleation]] sites e. g. [[particles]] of dust. This principle is used in [[cloud chamber]]s, where particles of [[radiation]] are visualized because they [[nucleate]] formation of water droplets.]]
The [[vapor pressure]] is the equilibrium pressure from a liquid or a solid at a specific temperature.  The equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid or solid is not affected by the amount of contact with the liquid or solid interface.

The [[normal boiling point]] of a liquid is the [[temperature]] at which the vapor pressure is equal to [[atmosphere (unit)|normal atmospheric pressure]].&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;

For two-phase systems (e.g., two liquid phases), the vapor pressure of the individual phases are equal.  In the absence of stronger inter-species attractions between like-like or like-unlike molecules, the vapor pressure follows [[Raoult's law]], which states that the [[partial pressure]] of each component is the product of the vapor pressure of the pure component and its mole fraction in the mixture. The total vapor pressure is the sum of the component partial pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Engel and Philip Reid, ''Physical Chemistry,'' Pearson Benjamin-Cummings, 2006, p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring vapor==
Since it is in the gas phase, the amount of vapor present is quantified by the [[partial pressure]] of the gas. Also, vapors obey the [[barometric formula]] in a gravitational field, just as conventional atmospheric gases do.

{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}

'''Whinstone''' is a term used in the [[quarry]]ing industry to describe any hard dark-coloured [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Examples include the [[igneous rock]]s, [[basalt]] and [[dolerite]], as well as the [[sedimentary rock]], [[chert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=129&amp;term_no=98293 English Heritage Online Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/whinstone ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th edition (2000), Houghton Mifflin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Massive outcrops of whinstone occur include the [[Pentland Hills]], Scotland and the [[Whin Sill]]s, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=129&amp;term_no=98293 English Heritage Online Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name 'whin' derives from the sound it makes when struck with a hammer&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=129&amp;term_no=98293 English Heritage Online Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is used for road chippings and [[dry stone wall]]s, but its natural angular shapes do not fit together well and are not easy to build with, and its hardness makes it a difficult material to work&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=129&amp;term_no=98293 English Heritage Online Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;. A common use is in the laying of patios and driveways in its ground/by product state called [[Whindust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=129&amp;term_no=98293 English Heritage Online Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yttrium aluminium garnet''' ('''YAG''', [[Yttrium|Y]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[Aluminium|Al]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) is a synthetic [[crystal]]line material of the [[garnet]] group. It is also one of three phases of the yttrium-aluminium composite, the other two being yttrium aluminium monoclinic (YAM, Y&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[yttrium aluminium perovskite]] (YAP, YAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Sim&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sim | first1=S.M. | last2=Keller | first2=K.A. | last3=Mah | first3=T.I. |year=2000 | title=Phas formation in yttrium aluminum garnet powders synthesized by chemical methods. | journal=Journal of Materials Science | volume=35 | pages=713–717 |bibcode = 2000JMatS..35..713S |doi = 10.1023/A:1004709401795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

YAG, like garnet and [[sapphire]], has no uses as a laser medium when pure. However, after being doped with an appropriate ion, YAG is commonly used as a host material in various [[solid-state laser]]s. Rare earth elements such as [[neodymium]] and [[erbium]] can be [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] into YAG as active laser ions, yielding [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] and [[Er:YAG laser|Er:YAG]] lasers, respectively. [[Cerium]]-doped YAG (Ce:YAG) is used as a [[phosphor]] in [[cathode ray tube]]s and white [[light-emitting diode]]s, and as a [[scintillator]].

==Gemstone YAG==
YAG for a period was used in [[jewelry]] as a [[diamond simulant|diamond]] and other [[gemstone]] simulant. Colored variants and their doping elements include:&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; green ([[chromium]]), blue ([[cobalt]]), red ([[manganese]]), yellow ([[titanium]]), purple ([[neodymium]]), pink, and orange. As faceted gems they are valued (as synthetics) for their clarity, durability, high [[refractive index]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]. The [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] of YAG is 33 degrees. YAG cuts like natural [[garnet]], with polishing being performed with [[alumina]] or [[diamond]] (50,000 or 100,000 grit) on common polishing laps. YAG has low heat sensitivity.

As a synthetic gemstone YAG has numerous varietal and trade names, as well as a number of misnomers. Synonymous names include: ''alexite'', ''amamite'', ''circolite'', ''dia-bud'', ''diamite'', ''diamogem'', ''diamonair'', ''diamone'', ''diamonique'', ''diamonite'', ''diamonte'', ''di'yag'', ''geminair'', ''gemonair'', ''kimberly'', ''Linde simulated diamond'', ''nier-gem'', ''regalair'', ''replique'', ''somerset'', ''triamond'', ''YAIG'', and ''yttrium garnet''. Production for the gem trade decreased after the introduction of synthetic [[cubic zirconia]]; {{as of|1995|lc=yes}} there was little production.&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; Some demand exists as synthetic garnet, and for designs where the very high refractive index of cubic zirconia is not desirable.

===Nd:YAG===
{{Main article|Nd:YAG laser}}
[[File:Yag-rod.jpg|thumb|Nd:YAG laser rod 0.5 cm in diameter.]]
[[Neodymium]]-[[dopant|doped]] YAG ('''Nd:YAG''') was developed in the early 1960s, and the first working Nd:YAG laser was invented in 1964. Neodymium-YAG is the most widely used [[active laser medium]] in [[solid-state laser]]s, being used for everything from low-power continuous-wave lasers to high-power [[Q-switching|Q-switched]] (pulsed) lasers with power levels measured in the kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;V. Lupei, , A. Lupei "Nd:YAG at its 50th anniversary: Still to learn" Journal of Luminescence 2015, {{doi|10.1016/j.jlumin.2015.04.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal conductivity of Nd:YAG is higher and its [[fluorescence]] lifetime is about twice as long as that of [[neodymium doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] crystals, however it is not as efficient and is less stable, requiring more precisely controlled temperatures.  The best absorption band of Nd:YAG for [[laser pumping|pumping the laser]] is centered at 807.5&amp;nbsp;nm, and is 1&amp;nbsp;nm wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redoptronics.com/Nd-YAG-crystal.html |title=ND:YAG crystal (neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet) |work=Red Optronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Nd:YAG lasers produce infrared light at a wavelength of 1064&amp;nbsp;nm. Light at this wavelength is rather dangerous to vision, since it can be focused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] onto the [[retina]], but the light is invisible and does not trigger the [[blink reflex]]. Nd:YAG lasers can also be used with [[frequency doubling]] or frequency tripling [[crystal]]s, to produce green light with a wavelength of 532&amp;nbsp;nm or ultraviolet light at 355&amp;nbsp;nm, respectively.

The [[dopant]] concentration in commonly used Nd:YAG crystals usually varies between 0.5 and 1.4 molar percent. Higher dopant concentration is used for pulsed lasers; lower concentration is suitable for continuous-wave lasers. Nd:YAG is pinkish-purple, with lighter-doped rods being less intensely colored than heavier-doped ones. Since its absorption spectrum is narrow, the hue depends on the light under which it is observed.

===Nd:Cr:YAG===
YAG doped with [[neodymium]] and [[chromium]] ('''Nd:Cr:YAG''' or '''Nd/Cr:YAG''') has absorption characteristics which are superior to Nd:YAG.  This is because energy is absorbed by the broad absorption bands of the Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; dopant and then transferred to Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; by dipole-dipole interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/PROC.1966.5112 | title = Crystalline solid lasers| author = Z. J. Kiss and R. J. Pressley| journal =Proceedings of the IEEE| volume =54 | issue =10 | year =1996| page =1236 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1447042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This material has been suggested for use in [[solar-pumped laser]]s, which could form part of a [[solar power satellite]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1016/j.optcom.2006.07.002| title =Disk-type Nd/Cr:YAG ceramic lasers pumped by arc-metal-halide-lamp| year =2006| author =Saiki, T| journal =Optics Communications| volume =268| issue =1| page =155| last2 =Imasaki| first2 =K| last3 =Motokoshi| first3 =S| last4 =Yamanaka| first4 =C| last5 =Fujita| first5 =H| last6 =Nakatsuka| first6 =M| last7 =Izawa| first7 =Y|bibcode = 2006OptCo.268..155S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Er:YAG===
{{Main article|Er:YAG laser}}
[[Erbium]]-doped YAG ('''Er:YAG''') is an active laser medium lasing at 2940&amp;nbsp;nm. Its absorption bands suitable for pumping are wide and located between 600 and 800&amp;nbsp;nm, allowing for efficient flashlamp pumping. The dopant concentration used is high: about 50% of the yttrium atoms are replaced. The Er:YAG laser wavelength couples well into water and body fluids, making this laser especially useful for medicine and dentistry uses; it is used for treatment of [[tooth enamel]] and in cosmetic surgery. Er:YAG is used for noninvasive monitoring of [[blood sugar]]. The mechanical properties of Er:YAG are essentially the same as Nd:YAG. Er:YAG operates at wavelengths where the threshold for eye damage is relatively high (since the light is absorbed before striking the [[retina]]), works well at room temperature, and has high [[slope efficiency]]. Er:YAG is pale green.

===Yb:YAG===
[[Ytterbium]]-doped YAG ('''Yb:YAG''') is an active laser medium lasing at 1030&amp;nbsp;nm, with a broad, 18&amp;nbsp;nm wide absorption band at 940&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant-Jacob|first=James A.|last2=Beecher|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Parsonage|first3=Tina L.|last4=Hua|first4=Ping|last5=Mackenzie|first5=Jacob I.|last6=Shepherd|first6=David P.|last7=Eason|first7=Robert W.|date=2016-01-01|title=An 115 W Yb:YAG planar waveguide laser fabricated via pulsed laser deposition|url=https://doi.org/10.1364/OME.6.000091|journal=Optical Materials Express|language=EN|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1364/ome.6.000091|issn=2159-3930|bibcode=2016OMExp...6...91G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most useful media for high-power [[DPSS laser|diode-pumped solid state lasers]]. The dopant levels used range between 0.2% and 30% of replaced yttrium atoms. Yb:YAG has very low fractional heating, very high [[slope efficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beecher|first=Stephen J.|last2=Grant-Jacob|first2=James A.|last3=Hua|first3=Ping|last4=Shepherd|first4=David|last5=Eason|first5=Robert W.|last6=Mackenzie|first6=Jacob I.|date=2016-10-30|title=Laser Performance of Yb-doped-Garnet Thin Films Grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ASSL-2016-AM3A.3|journal=Lasers Congress 2016 (ASSL, LSC, LAC)|language=EN|publisher=Optical Society of America|doi=10.1364/assl.2016.am3a.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no excited-state absorption or up-conversion, high mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity. Yb:YAG can be pumped by reliable [[InGaAs]] [[laser diode]]s at 940 or 970&amp;nbsp;nm.

Yb:YAG is a good substitute for 1064&amp;nbsp;nm Nd:YAG in high-power applications, and its frequency-doubled 515&amp;nbsp;nm version can replace the 514&amp;nbsp;nm [[argon laser]]s.

===Nd:Ce:YAG===
[[Neodymium]]-[[cerium]] double-doped YAG ('''Nd:Ce:YAG''', or '''Nd,Ce:YAG''') is an active laser medium material very similar to Nd:YAG. The added cerium atoms strongly absorb in the [[ultraviolet]] region and transfer their energy to the neodymium atoms, increasing the pumping efficiency; the result is lower thermal distortion and higher power output than Nd:YAG at the same pumping level. The lasing wavelength, 1064&amp;nbsp;nm, is the same as for Nd:YAG. The material has a good resistance to damage caused by UV from the pump source, and low [[lasing threshold]]. Usually 1.1–1.4% of Y atoms are replaced with Nd, and 0.05–0.1% with Ce.

===Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG===
[[Holmium]]-[[chromium]]-[[thulium]] triple-doped YAG ('''Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG''', or '''Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG''') is an active laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2080&amp;nbsp;nm and can be pumped by a flashlamp or a laser diode.&lt;ref name="Koechner"&gt;{{cite book| page=49|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8yM4yF_B72QC&amp;pg=PA49| title =Solid-state laser engineering| author =Koechner, Walter | publisher= Springer| date = 2006| isbn = 0-387-29094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in military, medicine, and meteorology. It works well at room temperature, has high [[slope efficiency]], and operates at a wavelength where the threshold for eye damage is relatively high. When pumped by a diode, the 785&amp;nbsp;nm band for Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion can be used.&lt;ref name="Koechner"/&gt; Other major pump bands are located between 400 and 800&amp;nbsp;nm. The dopant levels used are 0.35 atom.% Ho, 5.8 atom.% Tm, and 1.5 at.% Cr. The rods have green color, imparted by chromium(III).

===Tm:YAG===
[[Thulium]]-doped YAG ('''Tm:YAG''') is an active laser medium that operates between 1930 and 2040&amp;nbsp;nm. It is suitable for diode pumping. A dual-mode Tm:YAG laser emits two frequencies separated by 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

===Cr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;:YAG===
[[Chromium]] (IV)-doped YAG ('''Cr:YAG''') provides a large absorption cross section in the 0.9-1.2 micrometer spectral region, which makes it an attractive choice as a passive [[Q-switch]] for Nd-doped lasers. The resulting devices are solid-state, compact and low-cost. Cr:YAG has high damage threshold, good thermal conductivity, good chemical stability, resists [[ultraviolet]] radiation, and is easily machinable. It is replacing more traditional Q-switching materials like [[lithium fluoride]] and organic [[dye]]s. The dopant levels used range between 0.5 and 3 percent (molar). Cr:YAG can be used for passive Q-switching of lasers that operate at wavelengths between 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;nm, such as those based on Nd:YAG, [[Neodymium doped yttrium lithium fluoride|Nd:YLF]], [[Neodymium doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and Yb:YAG.

Cr:YAG can be also used as a laser gain medium itself, producing [[tunable laser]]s with outputs adjustable between 1350 and 1550&amp;nbsp;nm. The Cr:YAG laser can generate [[ultrashort pulse]]s (in the femtoseconds range) when it is pumped at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm by a Nd:YAG laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Chromium-doped gain media |url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/chromium_doped_gain_media.html |work=Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology |publisher=RP Photonics |first=Rüdiger |last=Paschotta |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cr:YAG has been demonstrated in an application of [[non-linear optics]] as a self-pumped [[phase-conjugate mirror]] in a Nd:YAG "loop resonator".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Such a mirror provides compensation of both phase and polarization aberrations induced into the loop resonator.

===Dy:YAG===
[[Dysprosium]]-doped YAG ('''Dy:YAG''') is a temperature-sensitive [[phosphor]] used in temperature measurements. The phosphor is excited by a laser pulse and its temperature-dependent fluorescence is observed. Dy:YAG is sensitive in ranges of 300-1700 [[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Surface thermometry by laser-induced fluorescence| last=Goss| first=L.P.|author2=Smith, A.A. |author3=Post, M.E. | journal=Review of Scientific Instruments| volume=60| issue=12| pages=3702–3706| year=1989| doi=10.1063/1.1140478|bibcode = 1989RScI...60.3702G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phosphor can be applied directly to the measured surface, or to an end of an [[optical fiber]]. Furthermore, it has also been study as single-phase white emitting phosphor in phosphor-converted white light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carreira|first1=J. F. C.|title=YAG:Dy – Based single white light emitting phosphor produced by solution combustion synthesis|journal=Journal of Luminescence|date=2017|volume=183|pages=251–258|doi=10.1016/j.jlumin.2016.11.017|bibcode=2017JLum..183..251C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sm:YAG===
[[Samarium]]-doped YAG ('''Sm:YAG''') is a temperature-sensitive phosphor similar to Dy:YAG.

===Tb:YAG===
[[Terbium]]-doped YAG ('''Tb:YAG''') is a phosphor used in cathode ray tubes. It emits at yellow-green color, at 544&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Ce:YAG===
[[Cerium]](III)-doped YAG ('''Ce:YAG''' or '''YAG:Ce''') is a phosphor, or a [[scintillator]] when in pure [[single-crystal]] form, with wide range of uses. It emits yellow light when subjected to blue or ultraviolet light, or to x-ray light.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Blasse|G. Blasse]] and A. Bril, "A new phosphor for lying-spot cathod-ray tubes for color televisions", Appl. Phys. Lett., 11, 1967, 53-54 {{doi|10.1063/1.1755025}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in white [[light-emitting diode]]s, as a coating on a high-brightness blue InGaN diode, converting part of the blue light into yellow, which then appears as white. Such an arrangement gives less than ideal [[color rendering]]. The output brightness decreases with increasing temperature, further altering device color output.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Ce:YAG is also used in some [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s as one of the phosphors, often together with Eu:Y(P,V)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (yttrium phosphate-vanadate). It is also used as a phosphor in [[cathode ray tube]]s, where it emits green (530&amp;nbsp;nm) to yellow-green (550&amp;nbsp;nm) light. When excited by electrons, it has virtually no afterglow (70 ns decay time). It is suitable for use in [[photomultiplier]]s.

Ce:YAG is used in [[Positron emission tomography|PET scanner]]s, high-energy [[gamma radiation]] and [[charged particle]] detectors, and high-resolution imaging screens for gamma, [[x-ray]]s, [[beta radiation]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]].

Ce:YAG can be further doped with [[gadolinium]].

The '''Çetintepe Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the [[Ortasu River]] (a tributary of the [[Hezil River]]) in [[Uludere]] district of [[Şırnak Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], Ozerka Insatt began construction on the dam in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a 2 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Diyarbakir|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi10/sirnak.htm|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in Şırnak Province and four in [[Hakkâri Province]] were implemented for this purpose. In Şırnak they are the [[Silopi Dam|Silopi]], [[Şırnak Dam|Şırnak]], [[Uludere Dam|Uludere]], [[Balli Dam|Balli]], [[Kavşaktepe Dam|Kavşaktepe]] and [[Musatepe Dam]]s downstream of the Çetintepe Dam. In Hakkari are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and [[Çocuktepe Dam]]s on the Güzeldere River and the [[Aslandağ Dam|Aslandağ]] and [[Beyyurdu Dam]]s on the Bembo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terror Down|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|publisher=Posta|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned to be completed in the second dam on the border against the PKK|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19088520.asp|publisher=Hurriyet|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dams Prevent Smuggling at the Border|url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|publisher=Aktif Haber|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention dams began operation against PKK|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/turkiye/08/23/pkkya.karsi.yapilan.barajlarda.su.tutma.islemi.basladi/674002.0/index.html|publisher=CNNTurk|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ébéniste''''' ({{IPA-fr|ebenist|pron}}) is the French word for a [[Cabinetry|cabinet-maker]].

==Etymology and ambiguities==
As opposed to ''ébéniste'', "''menuisier''" denotes a woodcarver or chairmaker in French. The English equivalent for ''ébéniste'', "ebonist", is not commonly used. Originally, an ''ébéniste'' was one who worked with [[ebony]], a favoured luxury wood for mid-seventeenth century Parisian cabinets, originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in [[Antwerp]]. The word is 17th century in origin.  Early Parisian ébénistes often came from the [[Low Countries]] themselves: an outstanding example is [[Pierre Golle]], who worked at the ''[[Gobelins manufactory]]'' making cabinets and table tops veneered with [[marquetry]], the traditional enrichment of ''ébénisterie'', or "cabinet-work".

==History==
Ébénistes make case furniture, which may be [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ed or painted. Under Parisian guild regulations, the application of painted varnishes, generically called ''[[vernis Martin]]'', was carried out in separate workshops, sawdust being an enemy to freshly varnished surfaces. At the outset of the [[French Revolution]] the guilds in Paris and elsewhere were abolished, and with them went all their regulations. One result of this is that Paris chairmakers were now able to produce [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ed chairs, as London furniture-makers, less stringently ruled, had been able to make since the first chairs with [[splat (furniture)|splat]]s had been produced shortly before 1720, in imitation of [[Chinese chair]]s.

Because of this amalgamation, chairs and other seat furniture began to use veneering techniques which were formerly the guarded privilege of ébénistes.  This privilege became less distinct after the relaxation of guild rules of the [[Ancien Régime]], and after the [[French Revolution]]'s abolition of guilds in 1791. Seat furniture in the [[Empire style]] was often veneered with [[mahogany]], and later in pale woods also.

From the mid-nineteenth century onward, the two French trades, "ébéniste" and "menuisier," were often assembled under the single roof of a "furnisher", and the craft began to make way for the industry. 

From the mid-17th century through the 18th, a notable number of ébénistes of German and Low Countries extraction were pre-eminent among Parisian furniture-makers, as the abbreviated list below suggests.
