'''Aloysius Lilius''' (c. 1510 &amp;ndash; 1576), also variously referred to as '''Luigi Lilio''', '''Luigi Giglio''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Physician|doctor]], [[astronomer]], [[philosopher]] and [[chronology|chronologist]], and also the "primary author" who provided the proposal that (after modifications) became the basis of the [[Gregorian Calendar]] reform of 1582.&lt;ref name=zigg&gt;For name-variants and a few biographical details (including citation to a biography published in 1963) see page 206 in: A Ziggelaar (1983), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The papal bull of 1582 promulgating a reform of the calendar"], pages 201-239 in G.V. Coyne (ed.), ''The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican conference to commemorate its 400th anniversary'' (Vatican City: Specola Vaticana), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Friday the 13th and the Mathematics of the Gregorian Calendar," Richard W. Beveridge, [[University of Maine]], webpage: [http://www.aug.edu/dvskel/Beveridge2003.htm Bev-2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519160256/http://www.aug.edu/dvskel/Beveridge2003.htm |date=2007-05-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Lilius (crater)|Lilius]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him, as is the [[asteroid]] [[2346 Lilio]]. In computer science, the [[Lilian date]] is the number of days since the [[adoption of the Gregorian calendar]] on 15 October 1582.

==Life and work==
Not much is known about the early life of Lilius/Lilio/Giglio. It is known that he came from [[Calabria]], [[Italy]], from [[Ciro, Calabria|Ciro]]. He studied medicine and astronomy in [[Naples]], after which he served Earl [[House of Carafa|Carafa]].&lt;ref&gt;Lilio was said to have lectured in medicine at the [[University of Perugia]] from 1552, but the source for that was recently checked by A Ziggelaar, who could not find verification: A Ziggelaar (1983), article cited above, at page 233, footnote 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Verona]] and died in 1576. Although he was still alive at the time when his proposal was presented at Rome, it does not seem that he made the presentation; it was handled by his brother Antonio, also a physician and astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;A biography (in Italian) by Giulio Aromolo (Napoli, 1963, Istituto della stampa, 109pp), "Papi astronomi e patte : Luigi Giglio astronomo 'primus auctor' della riforma gregoriana del calendario", is referenced by A Ziggelaar (1983) in the article cited above, at page 223, footnote 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is primarily known as the "first author" of the [[Gregorian Calendar]]: he wrote the proposal on which (after modifications) the calendar reform was based. Lilio's brother Antonio presented the manuscript to [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; it was passed to the calendar reform commission in 1575.&lt;ref&gt;According to A Ziggelaar (1983), article cited above, see page 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission issued a printed summary entitled ''Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium'' (Compendium of a New Plan for the Restitution of the Calendar), printed in 1577 and circulated within the Roman Catholic world in early 1578 as a consultation document. Lilio's manuscript itself is not known to have survived; the printed 'Compendium' is the nearest known source for the details it contained.&lt;ref&gt;G Moyer (1983), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=181 "Aloisius Lilius and the 'Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium'"], pages 171-188 in G.V. Coyne (ed.), ''The Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican conference to commemorate its 400th anniversary'' (Vatican City: Specola Vaticana), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 'Compendium' text can be found (in Latin) as part of [[Christopher Clavius]]' complete explanation of the Gregorian calendar, in Volume 5 of Clavius' complete mathematical works, [http://mathematics.library.nd.edu/clavius/cgi-bin/page_turner.cgi?output_main=1&amp;lh_id=13340&amp;rh_id=12825 online from Mathematics Library, University of Notre Dame], from [http://mathematics.library.nd.edu/clavius/images/large/5_1_e_3_0016_large.jpg page 3] to [http://mathematics.library.nd.edu/clavius/images/large/5_1_e_12_0025_large.jpg page 12]. An html version (in Latin with a French translation) is also [http://henk-reints.nl/cal/audette/compend.html available here].&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of consultation and deliberation meant that the [[Calendar reform|reform to the calendar]] did not occur until 1582, six years after the death of Luigi Lilio in 1576. The reform had by then received some modifications in points of detail by the reform commission, in which one of the leading members was [[Christopher Clavius]], who afterwards wrote defences and an explanation of the reformed calendar, including an emphatic acknowledgement of Lilio's work, especially for his provision of a useful reform for the lunar cycle: "We owe much gratitude and praise to Luigi Giglio who contrived such an ingenious Cycle of [[Epact]]s which, inserted in the calendar, always shows the [[new moon]] and so can be easily adapted to any length of the year, if only at the right moments the due adjustment is applied."&lt;ref&gt;A Ziggelaar (1983), article cited above, see page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[papal bull]] (''[[Inter gravissimas]]'') was issued on 24 February 1582 (year 1581 of the old [[Julian calendar]]), ordering Catholic clergy to adopt the new calendar, and exhorting all Catholic sovereigns to do the same.&lt;ref name=zigg /&gt;

The year 2010 was the 500th year since the Lilius' birth; several activities were organized by Italian astronomers in order to recognize the great work performed by him. In particular, in Torretta di Crucoli ([[Crotone]], Italy), a new astronomical group was created and dedicated to Luigi Lilio: [http://www.astrofili-torretta.com Circolo Astrofili Luigi Lilio Torretta (C.A.L.L.T.)].

'''[[Bernard Cornwell]]''''s career started in 1981 with ''[[Sharpe's Eagle]]''. He has been a prolific historical novelist since then having published more than 50 novels.

==Novel series==

===The Sharpe stories===
{{main|Richard Sharpe (fictional character)}}
Cornwell's best known books feature the adventures of Richard Sharpe, a British soldier during the Napoleonic Wars.

The first 11 books of the Sharpe series (beginning in chronological order with ''Sharpe's Rifles'' and ending with ''Sharpe's Waterloo'', published in the US as ''[[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]'') detail Sharpe's adventures in various [[Peninsular War]] campaigns over the course of 6–7 years. Subsequently, Cornwell wrote a prequel quintet – ''Sharpe's Tiger'', ''Sharpe's Triumph'', ''Sharpe's Fortress'', ''Sharpe's Trafalgar'' and ''Sharpe's Prey'' – depicting Sharpe's adventures under Wellington's command in [[India]], including his hard-won promotion to the officer corps, his return to Britain and his arrival in the 95th Rifles, and a sequel, ''Sharpe's Devil'', set six years after the end of the wars.

He also wrote ''[[Sharpe's Battle]]'', a novel "inserted" into his previous continuity, taking place during the [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro|Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro]]. It has been asserted [unattributed] that Cornwell was initially dubious about the casting of Sean Bean for the television adaptations. However, Cornwell effectively scotches this assertion in an interview with the "CompleatSeanBean" website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compleatseanbean.com/cornwell.html|title=Bernard Cornwell Q&amp;A|website=www.compleatseanbean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Cornwell states in the same interview that "..I was utterly delighted that it was to be Sean Bean.." Cornwell also dedicated ''Sharpe's Battle'' to Sean Bean, and has admitted that he subtly changed the writing of the character to align with Bean's portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Richard Sharpe bio| last=| first=| work=The South Essex| url=http://www.southessex.co.uk/bios/richardsharpe.htm| date=| accessdate=22 February 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916042225/http://www.southessex.co.uk/bios/richardsharpe.htm| archivedate=16 September 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, he has written further "missing adventures" set during the "classic" Peninsular War era.

Which doesn't mean I won't pick the idea up again sometime in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Cornwell's comment on Heretic| last=Cornwell| first=Bernard| work=Author's Official site| url=http://bernardcornwell.net/index.cfm?page=11| date=| accessdate=2 October 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185824/http://bernardcornwell.net/index.cfm?page=11| archivedate=27 September 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thrillers===
Cornwell's thrillers are modern mysteries, all with sailing themes. He is a traditional sailor and enjoys sailing his Cornish Crabber by the name of ''Royalist''. His thorough knowledge of sailing and popular skills with writing combine in great novels for the nautically obsessed. According to Cornwell's website, there may be no additions to the series: "I enjoyed writing the thrillers, but suspect I am happier writing historical novels. I'm always delighted when people want more of the sailing books, but I'm not planning on writing any more, at least not now – but who knows? perhaps when I retire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&amp;seriesid=3 |title=The Author's Official site – Sharpe Books dot com |publisher=Bernard Cornwell |date= |accessdate=12 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902023157/http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=1&amp;seriesid=3 |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Circassians''' ({{lang-ru|Черкесы}} ''Čerkesy''), also known by their [[endonym]] '''Adyghe''' ([[Circassian language|Circassian]]: Адыгэхэр ''Adygekher'', {{lang-ru|Ады́ги}} ''Adýgi''), are a [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian nation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |publisher=Questia Online Library |date=25 August 2010 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; native to [[Circassia]], many of whom were [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|displaced]] in the course of the [[Caucasian War|Russian conquest of the Caucasus]] in the 19th century, especially after the [[Russo-Circassian War]] in 1864. In its narrowest sense, the term "Circassian" includes the twelve [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] ([[Circassian language|Circassian]]: Адыгэ, ''Adyge'') princedoms (three democratic and nine aristocratic); [[Abdzakh]], [[Besleney]], [[Bzhedug]], [[Hatuqwai]], [[Kabardians|Kabardian]], [[Mamkhegh]], [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], [[Temirgoy]], [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]], [[Yegeruqwai]] and [[Zhaney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gammer |first=Mos%u030Ce |title=The Caspian Region: a Re-emerging Region |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; each star on the [[Flag of Adygea|Circassian flag]] representing each princedom. However, due to Soviet administrative divisions, Circassians were also designated as the following: ''Adygeans'' (Adyghe in [[Adygea]]), ''Cherkessians'' (Adyghe in [[Karachay-Cherkessia]]), ''Kabardians'' (Adyghe in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]]) and ''Shapsugians'' (Adyghe in [[Krasnodar Krai]]), although all the four are essentially the same people residing in different political units.

Most Circassians are [[Sunni Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sreda.org/arena |title=Главная страница проекта 'Арена' : Некоммерческая Исследовательская Служба СРЕДА |publisher=Sreda.org |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Circassians mainly speak the [[Circassian languages]], a [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] [[dialect continuum]] with three main dialects and numerous sub-dialects. Many Circassians also speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], having been [[exile]]d by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where the majority of them today live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html|title=International Circassian Association|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2017|reason=this is likely not accurate, many Circassian languages are dying out, and many Circassians don't speak any Circassian language}} About 800,000 Circassians remain in historical Circassia (the modern-day titular Circassian republics of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia as well as Krasnodar Krai and the southwestern parts of [[Stavropol Krai]] and [[Rostov Oblast]]), and others live in the Russian Federation outside these [[Republics of Russia|republics]] and [[Krais of Russia|krais]]. The 2010 [[Demographics of Russia|Russian Census]] recorded 718,727 Circassians, of whom 516,826 are Kabardian, 124,835 are other Adyghe in Adygea, 73,184 are [[Cherkess]] and 3,882 Shapsug.&lt;ref name="RussiaCensus"&gt;{{cite web|format=XLS|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/tab5.xls|script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2010: Национальньый состав населения Российской Федерации: Численность лиц, указавших соответствующую национальную принадлежность|trans-title=All-Russian Population Census 2010: National composition of the population of the Russian Federation: Number of persons who indicated their ethnicity|language=ru|publisher=[[Russian Federal State Statistics Service]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424000000/http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/tab5.xls|archivedate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] estimated in the early 1990s that there are as many as 3.7 million "ethnic Circassian" [[diaspora]] (in over 50 countries)&lt;ref name="UNPO Yearbook 1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] |editor1-last=Mullen |editor1-first=Christopher A. |editor1-link= |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first= J.

==Ethnonyms==
[[File:Parsons. Circassian Warrior. 1862.jpg|thumb|upright|Circassian warrior]]
The Circassians [[endonym|refer to themselves]] as ''Adyghe'' (also transliterated as ''Adyga'', ''Adyge'', ''Adygei'', ''Adyghe'', ''Attéghéi''). The name is believed to derive from ''atté'' "height" to signify a mountaineer or a highlander, and ''ghéi'' "sea", signifying "a people dwelling and inhabiting a mountainous country near the sea coast", or "between two seas".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Edmund, ''Travels in the Western Caucasus, including a Tour through Imeritia, Mingrelia, Turkey, Moldavia, Galicia, Silesia, and Moravia in 1836''. London, H. Colburn, 1838. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;[[Louis Loewe|Loewe, Louis]]. ''A Dictionary of the Circassian Language: in Two Parts: English-Circassian-Turkish, and Circassian-English-Turkish''. London, Bell, 1854. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exonym]] "Circassians" ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|k|æ|s|i|ə|n|z}} {{respell|sər|KASS|ee-ənz}}) is occasionally applied to Adyghe and [[Abazin|Abaza]] from the [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;Latham, R. G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aygTAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Latham%20Elements%20of%20Comparative%20Philology&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Elements of Comparative Philology.] London, Walton and Maberly, 1862. p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Circassian'' represents a [[Latinisation of names|Latinisation]] of ''Siraces'', the Greek name for the region, called ''Shirkess'' by Khazars and later ''Cherkess'', the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] name for the Adyghe, and originated in the 15th century with medieval [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchants and travellers to [[Circassia]].&lt;ref name="Ref_e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Latham, R. G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dbs0AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Latham%20Descriptive%20Ethnology&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Descriptive Ethnology.] London, J. Van Voorst, 1859. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkic peoples]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[[William Guthrie (historian)|Guthrie, William]], James Ferguson, and John Knox. ''A New Geographical, Historical and Commercial Grammar and Present State of the Several Kingdoms of the World''...&amp;nbsp;Philadelphia, Johnson &amp; Warner, 1815. p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russians]] call the Adyghe ''Cherkess''.&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;Taitbout, De Marigny. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9kMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Taitbout%2C%20De%20Marigny.%20Three%20Voyages%20in%20the%20Black%20Sea%20to%20the%20Coast%20of%20Circassia&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Three Voyages in the Black Sea to the Coast of Circassia.] London, 1837. pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folk etymology]] usually explains the name ''Cherkess'' as "warrior cutter" or "soldier cutter", from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words ''[[wikt: çeri|çeri]]'' (soldier) and ''[[wikt:kesmek|kesmek]]'' (to cut).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

As a result of [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Byzantine]] influence, [[Christianity]] spread throughout the Caucasus between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;''The Penny Magazine''.

From around 400 AD wave after wave of invaders began to invade the lands of the [[Adyghe people]], who were also known as the ''Kasogi'' (or Kassogs) at the time. They were conquered first by the [[Bulgars]] (who originated on the Central Asian steppes). Outsiders sometimes confused the Adyghe people with the similarly-named [[Utigurs]] (a branch of the Bulgars), and both peoples were sometimes conflated under misnomers such as "''Utige''". Following the dissolution of the Khazar state, the Adyghe people were integrated around the end of the 1st millennium AD into the [[Kingdom of Alania]].

Between the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, the Adyghe people lost their independence as the [[Russian Empire]] gradually carried out a series of wars and campaigns. During this period, the Adyghe plight achieved a certain celebrity status in the West; but pledges of assistance were never fulfilled. After the [[Crimean War]] of 1853 to 1856, Russia turned its attention to the Caucasus in earnest. Following major territorial losses for [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] in the [[Caucasus]] in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)]], forcing Persia to cede what comprises now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] to Imperial Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C.

In 1859 the Russians finished defeating [[Imam Shamil]] in the eastern Caucasus, and turned their attention westward. Eventually, the long-lasting [[Russian–Circassian War]], which had begun in 1763, ended with the defeat of the Adyghe forces. Some Adyghe leaders signed loyalty oaths on 2 June 1864 (21 May, [[Old Style|O.S.]]).

The conquest of the Caucasus by the Russian Empire in the 19th century during the Russian-Circassian War led to the destruction and killing of many Adyghe—towards the end of the conflict, the Russian General {{ill|Nikolai Yevdokimov|ru|Евдокимов, Николай Иванович}} had the task of driving the remaining Circassian inhabitants out of the region, primarily into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Mobile columns of Russian riflemen and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] cavalry carried out the task.&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;Levene 2005:297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_o"&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Chapter 4|last= Richmond|first= Walter |title= The Circassian Genocide|year= 2013|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-6069-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHlwZwpA70cC}} {{clarify|date= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King 2008: 94–96"&gt;King 2008: 94–6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"In a series of sweeping military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864... the northwest Caucasus and the Black Sea coast were virtually emptied of Muslim villagers.

Like other ethnic minorities under Russian rule, the Adyghe who remained in the Russian Empire borders were subjected to policies of mass resettlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Ottoman Empire, which ruled large parts of the area south of Russia, regarded the Adyghe warriors as courageous and well-experienced. It encouraged them to settle in various near-border settlements of the Ottoman Empire in order to strengthen the empire's borders.

According to [[Walter Richmond]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Circassia was a small independent nation on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. For no reason other than ethnic hatred, over the course of hundreds of raids the Russians drove the Circassians from their homeland and deported them to the Ottoman Empire. At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history".&lt;ref&gt;

===Post-exile period===
It has been estimated that the [[Ottoman Empire]] imported some 200,000 [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]]—mainly Circassians—between 1800 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Clarence-Smith (2006).

Oxford University Press. pp. 13–16. {{ISBN|0-19-522151-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adyghes who were settled by the Ottomans in various near-border settlements across the empire, ended up living across many territories in the Middle East. At the time these belonged to the Ottoman Empire and are now located in the following countries:

*[[Circassians in Turkey|Turkey]], which has the largest Adyghe population in the world. The Adyghe settled in three main regions in Turkey: [[Samsun]], along the shores of the [[Black Sea]]; the region near the city of [[Ankara]], the region near the city of [[Kayseri]], and in the western part of the country near the region of [[Istanbul]]. This latter region experienced a [[1999 İzmit earthquake|severe earthquake in 1999]]. Many Adyghe played key roles in the Ottoman army and also participated in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].
*[[Circassians in Syria|Syria]]. Most of the Adyghe who immigrated to Syria settled in the [[Golan Heights]]. Prior to the [[Six-Day War]], the Adyghe people were the majority group in the Golan Heights region—their number at that time is estimated at 30,000. The most prominent settlement in the Golan was the town of [[Quneitra]]. The total number of Circassians in Syria is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peleschuk|first=Dan|url=http://russiaprofile.org/international/56577.html|title=Long Lost Brethren|publisher=Russiaprofile.org|date=27 March 2012|accessdate=20 August 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327211025/http://russiaprofile.org/international/56577.html|archivedate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Syrian Circassians said they were exploring returning to Circassia, as tensions between the [[Ba'athism|Baath government]] and the opposition forces escalated. Circassians from different parts of Syria, such as [[Damascus]], have moved back to the Golan Heights, believed to be safer. Some refugees have been reportedly killed by shelling. Circassians have been lobbying the Russian and Israeli governments to help evacuate refugees from Syria. Some visas were issued by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nca/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=40093&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=24&amp;cHash=c5547130a104af82d1179fea3bc7fafc |title=single |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Circassians in Israel|Israel and Palestine]]. The Adyghe initially settled in three places—in [[Kfar Kama]], [[Rehaniya]], and in the region of [[Hadera]]. Due to a [[malaria]] epidemic, the Adyghe settlement near Hadera was eventually abandoned.

*[[Circassians in Iraq|Iraq]]. The Adyghe came to [[Iraq]] directly from [[Circassia]].They settled in all parts of Iraq—from north to south—but most of all in Iraq's capital [[Baghdad]]. Many Adyghe also settled in [[Kirkuk|Kerkuk]], [[Diyala Province|Diyala]], [[Fallujah]], and other places. Circassians played a major role in different periods throughout Iraq's history, and made great contributions to political and military institutions in the country, to the [[Iraqi Army]] in particular. Several Iraqi prime ministers have been of Circassian descent.

==Culture==
{{see also|Circassian music|Circassian folklore}}
Adyghe society prior to the Russian invasion was highly stratified. While a few princedoms in the mountainous regions of Adygeya were fairly egalitarian, most were broken into strict [[caste]]s. The highest was the caste of the "princes", followed by a caste of lesser nobility, and then commoners, serfs, and slaves. In the decades before Russian rule, two princedoms overthrew their traditional rulers and set up democratic processes, but this social experiment was cut short by the end of Adyghe independence.

Circassians also speak [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in large numbers, having been [[exile]]d by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where the majority of them live today, and some to neighboring [[Persia]], to which they came primarily through mass deportations by the [[Safavids]] and [[Qajars]] or, to a lesser extent, as [[muhacir|muhajirs]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |title=ČARKAS |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYOXY2Np?url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberling, Pierre, ''Georgians and Circassians in Iran'', The Hague, 1963; pp. 127–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engelbert Kaempfer (p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanbaghi, Aptin, ''The Fire, the Star and the Cross: Minority Religions in Medieval and Early Modern Iran'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Richmond writes that the Circassian language in Russia is "gravely threatened." He argues that Russian policy of surrounding small Circassian communities with Slavic populations has created conditions where Circassian language and nationality will disappear. By the 1990s, Russian had become the standard language for business in the [[Republic of Adygea]], even within communities with Circassian majority populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-6069-4 |last=Richmond |first=Walter |title=The Circassian Genocide |date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{see also|Adyghe Habze}}

[[File:Abu Darweesh Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|The [[mosque]] of Abu Darwish (Adyghe descendant), one of the oldest mosques in [[Amman]] and considered as a major [[landmark]].]]
Ancestors of modern Adyghe people gradually went through following various religions: [[Monotheism]] with its [[Christianity]], and then Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Чамокова|first=Сусанна Туркубиевна|date=2015|title=ТРАНСФОРМАЦИЯ РЕЛИГИОЗНЫХ ВЗГЛЯДОВ АДЫГОВ НА ПРИМЕРЕ ОСНОВНЫХ АДЫГСКИХ КОСМОГОНИЧЕСКИХ БОЖЕСТВ|url=|journal=Вестник Майкопского государственного технологического университета|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the tradition of the early church that Christianity made its first appearance in Circassia in the first century AD via the travels and preaching of the [[Andrew the Apostle|Apostle Andrew]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated95"&gt;''Antiquitates christianæ, or, The history of the life and death of the holy Jesus as also the lives acts and martyrdoms of his Apostles: in two parts'', by Taylor, Jeremy, 1613–1667. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Christianity]] spread throughout the Caucasus between the 4th century&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; and the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Ref_ab" /&gt;

A small Muslim presence in Circassia has existed since the Middle Ages, but widespread Islamization occurred after 1717, when Sultan Murad IV ordered the Crimean Khans to spread Islam among the Circassians, with the Ottomans and Crimeans seeing some success in converting members of the aristocracy who would then ultimately spread the religion to their dependents.&lt;ref name="NathoIslamization"&gt;Natho, Kadir I. ''Circassian History''. Pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the efforts of the Ottomans and their Crimean and Circassian clients, the masses of the Circassian people remained Christian and pagan, until the threat of Russian conquest impelled the majority of them to convert in order to cement defensive alliances with the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate to protect their independence;&lt;ref name="NathoIslamization" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shenfield, Stephen D. "The Circassians : A forgotten genocide". In Levene and Roberts, ''The Massacre in History''.

===Traditional social system===
[[File:USSHER(1865) p183 CIRCASSIAN DANCE.jpg|thumb|250px|Circassian dance]]
Society was organized by ''Adyghe khabze'', or Circassian custom.&lt;ref&gt;This section summarizes Walter Richmond, Northwest Caucasus, 2008, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these customs had equivalents throughout the mountains. It should be noted that the seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of [[Imam Shamil]]. The aristocracy was called ''warq''. Some aristocratic families held the rank of ''Pshi'' or prince and the eldest member of this family was the ''Pshi-tkhamade'' who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to ''tfokotl'', roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the warq. They were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called ''Khase'' or larger ones called ''Zafes''. Decisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the ''Pshi-tkhamade'', although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.

In addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek [[xenia (Greek)|xenia]]. Many houses would have a ''kunakskaya'' or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to ''abreks'' or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or ''kunaks''. There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called ''tleuzh'' who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an ''atalyk'' or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. Adyghe khabze is sometimes called [[adat]] when it is contrasted to the kind of [[Islamic law]] advocated by people like [[Imam Shamil]].

===Traditional clothing===
[[File:Traditional clothing, Circassian Heritage Center.JPG|thumb|300px|Traditional Circassian clothing]]

The traditional female clothing ({{lang-ady |Бзылъфыгъэ Шъуашэр, Bzıłfıǵe Ȿuaşer}} {{IPA-ady|bzəɬfəʁa ʂʷaːʃar|}}) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ({{lang-ady |Джанэр, Janer}} {{IPA-ady|d͡ʒaːnar|}}), coat ({{lang-ady |Сае, Saye}} {{IPA-ady|saːja|}}), shirt, pant ({{lang-ady |ДжэнэкӀакор, Jeneç'akuer}} {{IPA-ady|d͡ʒanat͡ʃʼaːkʷar|}}), vest ({{lang-ady |КӀэкӀ, Ç'eç'}} {{IPA-ady|t͡ʃʼat͡ʃʼ|}}), lamb leather bra ({{lang-ady |Шъохътан, Ȿuex́tan}} {{IPA-ady|ʂʷaχtaːn|}}), a variety of hats ({{lang-ady |ПэӀохэр}, Peꜧuexer} {{IPA-ady|paʔʷaxar|}}), shoes, and belts ({{lang-ady |Бгырыпхыхэр, Bğırıpxıxer}} {{IPA-ady|bɣərəpxəxar|}}). Holiday dresses are made of expensive fabrics such as [[silk]] and [[velvet]]. The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn. The Circassian dresses were embroidered with gold and silver threads. These embroideries were handmade and took time to complete as they were very intricate.

The traditional male costume ({{lang-ady |Адыгэ хъулъфыгъэ шъуашэр, Adığe X́uıłfıǵe Ȿuaşer}} {{IPA-ady|aːdəɣa χʷəɬfəʁa ʂʷaːʃar|}}) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors times wore coat with short sleeves—in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn). A compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called [[Shashka]]. It is a special kind of [[sabre]]; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] [[sword]]. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word "Sashkhwa" ({{lang-ady |Сашьхъуэ, Sas̨x́ue}}) which means "long knife". On the breast of the costume are long ornamental tubes or sticks, once filled with a single charge of gunpowder (called gaziri cartridges) and used to reload muskets.

===Traditional cuisine===
[[File:Old Circassian traditional house.jpg|thumb|An old country house and traditional cuisine with [[Haliva]] (Хьэлжъо, Helɀwa) and [[Mataz]] (Мэтазэ, Metaze), two of the prominent traditional Adyghe snacks.]]

In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly [[flour]] and [[meat]] dishes. An example of the latter is known as [[ficcin]].

[[Circassian cheese]] is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the [[North Caucasus]].

A popular traditional dish is [[chicken (food)|chicken]] or [[turkey meat|turkey]] with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. [[Mutton]] and [[beef]] are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour [[milk]] with crushed garlic and salt.

Variants of pasta are found. A type of [[ravioli]] may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.

On holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make [[Haliva]] ({{lang-ady|хьэлжъо, Helɀua}}) (fried triangular pastries with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies. In the Levant there is a famous Circassian dish which is called Tajen Alsharkaseiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju90EXQUKY0 |title=تركى شركسية تقديم الشيف الشربينى |publisher=YouTube |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional crafts===
The Adyghes have been famous for making [[carpets]] ({{lang-ady| пӏуаблэхэр, P'uablexer}} {{IPA-ady|pʷʼaːblaxar|}}) or mats worldwide for thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Making carpets was very hard work in which collecting raw materials is restricted to a specific period within the year. The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its{{clarify|date=September 2014}} colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by [[Populus|poplar]] leaves ({{lang-ady| екӏэпцӏэ, Yeç'epc'e}} {{IPA-ady|jat͡ʃʼapt͡sʼa|}}).

The carpets were adorned with images of [[bird]]s, beloved [[animal]]s ([[horse]]s), and plants, and the image of the [[Sun]] was widely used.

The carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to [[humidity]] and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over [[rifles]] ({{lang-ady| шхончымрэ, Şxuençımre}} {{IPA-ady|ʃxʷant͡ʃəmra|}}) and pistols ({{lang-ady| къэлаеымрэ, Qelayeımre}}), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.

The carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before [[marriage]]; a big carpet, a small carpet, and the last for praying as a [[prayer rug]]. These carpets would give the grooms an impression as to the success of their brides in their homes after marriage.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"&gt;"Адыгэ 1оры1уатэм ухэзгъэгъозэн тхылъ", Ехъул1э Ат1ыф, Нахэхэр (129–132), гощын (1), Адыгэ ш1уш1э Хасэ, Йордания, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribes==
From the [[late Middle Ages]], a number of territorial- and political-based Circassian tribes or ethnic entities began to take shape. They had slightly different dialects.

Dialects came to exist after Circassia was divided into princedoms (tribes) after the death of King Yinal of Circassia, who united Circassia for the last time before its short renuion during the Russo-Caucasian War. As the logistics between the princedoms became harder, each princedom became slightly isolated from one another, thus the people living under the banner of each princedom developed their own dialects. In time, the dialects they speak were named after their princedoms. After a longer while, the people began being called after the princedom which they live under the banner of. Therefore, there is a widespread misconception of these princedoms actually being tribes. Opposed to that, the notion "tribe" is non-existent in the Circassian culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

At the end of the [[Caucasian War]] most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, and many of the princedoms were destroyed and the people evicted from their historical homeland in 1864.

The main groups within the Circassian people are the [[Adygeans]], [[Abkhazians]], [[Abazins]], [[Kabardians]], and [[Cherkess]]. This does not include tribal subgroups.

Most Adyghe living in [[Circassia]] are Bzhedug, Kabardian, and Temirgoy, while the majority in [[Circassian diaspora|diaspora]] are Kabardian, Abdzakh, and Shapsug. West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect.

The twelve stars on the Circassian flag symbolize the individual tribes of the Circassians; the nine stars within the arc symbolize the nine aristocratic tribes of Adygea, and the three horizontal stars symbolize the three democratic tribes. The twelve tribes are the Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai, and Zhaney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|title=Circassians|publisher=adiga-home.net|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820015838/https://www.adiga-home.net/Circassians.htm|archivedate=20 August 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circassian tribes can be grouped and compared in various ways. Linguists divide the [[Northwest Caucasian]] languages into Circassian (including Kabardian), Ubykh (originally an Circassian dialect, theorised to be the original form of Circassian language), and Abazgi (Abkhaz-Abaza). While Abazgi and Circassian are mutually unintelligible, Ubykh and Circassian are practically the same language. The Ubykhs lived on the Black Sea coast, around the city of Sochi, the capital of Circassia, north of Abkhazia. The Abkhazians lived on the coast between the Circassians and the Georgians, were organized as the [[Principality of Abkhazia]] and were involved with the Georgians to some degree. The Abaza, their relatives, lived north of the mountains and were involved with Circassia proper. They extended from the mountain crest northeast onto the steppe and partially separated the Kabardians from the rest. [[Sadz]] were either northern Abkhazian or eastern Abaza, depending on the source. The Kabarda occupied about a third of the north Caucasus piedmont from east of Circassia proper eastward to the Chechen country. To their north were the Nogai nomads and to the south, deeper in the mountains, were from west to east, the Karachays, Balkars, Ossetes, Ingushes, and Chechens. The Kabardians were fairly advanced, interacted with the Russians from the sixteenth century and were much reduced by plague in the early nineteenth century.

As for the Circassians proper, apparently called Kiakhs, some writers speak of twelve princedoms and some do not.
*The narrow '''Black Sea coast''' was occupied, from north to south by the [[Natukhai]], [[Shapsug]], Ubykh, and the Abkhaz ([[Sadz]] sub-branch). The main part of the Natukhai and Shapsug princedoms located in north of the mountains. The Natukhai were enriched by trade since their coast was not backed by high mountains and opened onto the steppe.
* The '''north slope''' was inhabited, from north to south, by the Natukhai, Shapsug, Abdzakh, and Abaza. They seem to have been the most populous princedoms after the Kabarda and its inland location gave then some protection from Nogai and Cossack raiding.
* In the '''far west''' were three small princedoms that were absorbed into the Natukhai and disappeared. These were the Adele [[:ru:Адале]] on the Taman peninsula and the Shegak and Chebsin ([[:ru:Хегайки]] and [[:ru:Чебсин]]) near Anapa.
* Along the '''Kuban''' were the Natukhai, Zhaney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, and Temirgoy.
* On the '''east''', between the Laba and Belaya, from north to south, were the Temirgoy, Yegeruqwai ([[:ru:Егерукаевцы]]), Makhosh ([[:ru:Махошевцы]]), [[Besleney]] and Abaza. The Besleney were a branch of the Kabardians. The Tapanta ([[:ru:Тапанта]]), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. Along the Belaya River were the Temirgoy, the ill-documented Ademey ([[:ru:Адамийцы]]) and then the [[Mamkhegh]] near the modern [[Maykop]].
*The Guaye ([[:ru:Гуайе]]) are poorly documented. The Tchelugay lived west of the Makhosh. The Hakuch lived on the coast south of the Natukhai. Other groups are mentioned without much documentation. There are reports of princedoms migrating from one place to another, again without much documentation. Some sketch maps show a group of [[Karachays]] on the upper Laba without any explanation.

The princedoms along the Kuban and Laba rivers were exposed to Nogai and Cossack raiding while those in the interior had some protection. The three "democratic" princedoms were the Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh. They managed their affairs by assemblies while the other princedoms were controlled by "princes" or ''Pshi''. Princedoms with remnants in the Caucasus are: Kabarda (the largest), the Temirgoy and Bzhedug in Adygea, and the Shapsug near Tuapse and to the north of Tuapsiysiy Rayon of Krasnodarskiy Kray. There are also a few Besleney and Natukhai villages, and an Abdzakh village.

==Circassian diaspora==
{{Main|Circassian diaspora}}
[[File:Circassian horsemanship during Sir Herbert Samuel's second visit to Transjordan.jpg|thumb|Adyghe [[horsemanship]] in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], April 1921]]
[[File:Çerkez sürgününün anılması 1.jpg|thumb|Circassians commemorate the banishment of the Circassians from Russia in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]], [[İstanbul]]]]

Adyghe have lived outside the Caucasus region since the [[Middle Ages]]. They were particularly well represented in [[Turkey]] and [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]].

During the 13th century the Mamluks seized power in [[Cairo]]. Some 15th-century Circassian converts to Islam became [[Mamluk]]s and rose through the ranks of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]] to high positions, some becoming sultans in Egypt such as [[Qaitbay]], Mamluk Sultan of Egypt (1468–1496). The majority of the leaders of the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluk dynasty]] in Egypt (1382–1517) had Circassian origins,&lt;ref name="GPG"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War|last=McGregor|first=Andrew James|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-275-98601-8|page=15|quote=By the late fourteenth century Circassians from the north Caucasus region had become the majority in the Mamluk ranks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also including Abkhaz, Abaza, and Georgian peoples whom the Arab sultans had recruited to serve their kingdoms as a military force. With the rise of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (who ruled Egypt from 1805 to 1848), most senior Mamluks were killed by him in order to secure his rule and the remaining Mamluks fled to [[Sudan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[Safavid]] (1501–1736) and [[Qajar]] (1789–1925) dynasties saw the importing and deporting of large numbers of Circassians to [[Persia]], where many enjoyed prestige in the [[harems]] and in the élite armies (the so-called ''ghulams''), while many others settled and deployed as craftsmen, labourers, farmers and regular soldiers. Many members of the Safavid nobility and élite had Circassian ancestry and Circassian dignitaries, such as the kings [[Abbas II of Persia]] (reigned 1642–1666) and [[Suleiman I of Persia]] (reigned 1666–1694). While traces of Circassian settlements in Iran have lasted into the 20th century, many of the once large Circassian minority became assimilated into the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems|title=ČARKAS|publisher=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SYOXY2Np?url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems|archivedate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, significant communities of Circassians continue to live in particular cities in Iran,&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=number+of+circassians+in+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_SmExfuC8&amp;sig=2lK8k9IsUQZyjCtdKqIAIr6Rc5M&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwins7Whz4vGAhVRCNsKHb9pAME#v=onepage&amp;q=number%20of%20circassians%20in%20iran&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|978-1438126760}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; like Tabriz and Tehran, and in the northern provinces of [[Gilan]] and [[Mazandaran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118238/Circassian|title=Circassian|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaldmanMason2006"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&amp;pg=PA176|title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples|last1=Waldman|first1=Carl|last2=Mason|first2=Catherine|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4381-2918-1|volume=2|pages=175–176|chapter=Circassians|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of [[Circassia|their homeland]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|ethnic cleansing]] and [[Exile|mass exile]] mainly to the [[Ottoman Empire]], and to a lesser extent [[Qajar Iran]] and the Balkans. This increased the number of Circassians in the region and even created several entirely new Circassian communities in the states that got created after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

The total number of Circassians worldwide is estimated at 8 million.

===Western Asia===
Around half of all Circassians live in [[Turkey]], mainly in the provinces of [[Samsun Province|Samsun]] and [[Ordu Province|Ordu]] (in Northern Turkey), [[Kahramanmaraş Province|Kahramanmaraş]] (in Southern Turkey), [[Kayseri Province|Kayseri]] (in Central Turkey), [[Bandırma]], and [[Düzce Province|Düzce]] (in Northwest Turkey).

Significant communities live in [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name='LLOW'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/lang?id=3044 |title=Significant numbers of Adyghe speakers reside in Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Israel |publisher=Languageserver.uni-graz.at |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]] (see [[Circassians in Syria]]),&lt;ref name='LLOW'/&gt; and smaller communities live in [[Israel]] (in the villages of [[Kfar Kama]] and [[Rehaniya]]—see [[Circassians in Israel]]).&lt;ref name='LLOW'/&gt;

[[Circassians in Iran]] are the nation's second largest Caucasus-derived nation after the [[Iranian Georgians|Georgians]].&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt;

Circassians are also present [[Circassians in Iraq|in Iraq]]. [[Baghdad]], [[Sulaymaniyah]], and [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] comprise the country's main cities with Circassians,&lt;ref name=ORSAM&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|first1=Ahmet Hüseyin Ali İsmail|last1=Katav|first2=Bilgay|last2=Duman|title=Iraqi Circassians (Chechens, Dagestanis, Adyghes)|journal=ORSAM Reports|publisher=[[Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies]]|date=November 2012|issue=134|url=http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/20121116_134ingtum.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403142200/http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/20121116_134ingtum.pdf|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; though lesser numbers are spread in other regions and cities as well.

===Egypt===
Most Circassian communities in [[Egypt]] were assimilated into the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDd80jyLptI |title=Al-Gaddafi speech about the Circassians|publisher=Youtube.com |date=30 July 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example is Egypt's [[Abaza family]], a large [[Abazins|Abazin]] clan. Until the rise of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Egypt in the 1950s, the Adyghe formed an élite group in the country. Besides the Adyghe, the Abaza family still holds to this day an élite place in Egyptian society, and constitutes Egypt's largest family, with well over 15,000 members active in all aspects of society. {{As of|2016}} several thousand Adyghe reside in Egypt; in addition to the descendants of Burji Mamluks of Adyghe origin, there are many who descend from royal Circassian consorts or Ottoman pashas of Circassian origin as well as Circassian [[muhajirun|muhajirs]] of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The major Adyghe community in [[Ukraine]] is in [[Odessa]].

There is a small community of Circassians in [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. A number of Adyghe also settled in [[Bulgaria]] in 1864–1865 but most fled after it became separate from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. The small community that settled in [[Kosovo]] (the [[Kosovo Adyghes]]) repatriated to the [[Republic of Adygea]] in 1998.

===North America===
Numerous Circassians have also immigrated to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Upstate New York]], [[California]], and [[New Jersey]]. There is also a small Circassian community in [[Canada]].

==Sochi Olympics controversy==
{{Main|Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics}}

Adyghe organizations in [[Russia]] and the Adyghe diaspora around the world requested that construction at the site stop and that the [[Olympic Games]] not be held at the site of the [[Circassian Genocide|Adyghe genocide]], to prevent desecration of Adyghe graves. According to Iyad Youghar, who headed the lobby group [[International Circassian Council]]: "We want the athletes to know that if they compete here they will be skiing on the bones of our relatives."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The year 2014 also marked the 150th anniversary of the Circassian Genocide which angered the Circassians around the world. Many protests were held all over the world to stop the Sochi Olympics, but were not successful.

This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.

Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked,&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For religion, behaviors often take the form of [[ritual]]s and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs.

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-56025-9|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know? Supernatural Agents' Access to Socially Strategic and Non-Strategic Information|journal=Cognitive Science|date=July 2012|volume=36|issue=5|pages=846–869|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01242.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D. W.|title=Niche construction and Dreaming logic: aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=23 October 2013|volume=280|issue=1772|pages=20132297–20132297|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2297|pmc=3813344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

'''Covasna's inclined plane''' (also called '''Șiclău''') is a unique [[standard gauge]] railway system used to carry logs by using [[gravity]], without any other source of [[energy]].

==History==

'''[[Covasna County|Covasna's]] inclined plane'''''' ''''''(''''''Șiclăul''', as it is known locally), was designed by [[engineer]] Emil Lux in 1886, at the initiative of [[lumber mill]] owner David Horn  near the border between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Romania]]. The railway's main purpose was to increase wood supply and timber transportation. A narrow gauge railway (760&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Comandău]] -  Covasna was therefore built between 1889 and 1891.

After two years Horn transferred the concession to  forestry company Ardeleana, formerly Erdelyi Erdoipar RT. Ardeleana was founded in 1890 and was owned by Groedel brothers. This company built nine [[Railroad|railway systems]] covering a total of 118.3&amp;nbsp;km. To enable the connection between Valea Zânelor (Fairy's Valley) and Șiclău, the Inclined Plane was inaugurated in 1890. The components were manufactured by [[Vietnam|Viennese]] firm Obach. The Inclined Plane was used every day for over a century (1892-1995). It transported daily around 30 cars, each having the capacity of 10m³ of wood.

In 1995, only a few years after celebrating its centenary, the  Inclined Plane underwent a series of unfortunate events when a powerful storm toppled almost all the nearby trees. In addition, in 1997 the top control station was destroyed by fire. A drastic reduction in wood volumes ended the Inclined Plane on 1 October 1999 (along with 32&amp;nbsp;km of railway that formed the last remains of the forestry railways system from [[Comandău]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/un-unicat-tehnic-distrus-nepasare-planul-inclinat-comandau |title=Un unicat tehnic distrus de nepăsare - Planul Înclinat de la Comandău }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The train operated by allowing the weight of a loaded train to pull a lighter, empty train up the slope. A metal cable connected the two trains. Operation was controlled from the control room located in the top station. Trains ran on a normal [[track gauge]] (1435&amp;nbsp;mm). In the middle of the route a branch allowed the simultaneous passage of the wagons.

'''''Crime Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated panels of typography with panels of illustrations. Thus, it was arranged in tiers like a comic book but eliminated hand-lettering, balloons and panel borders.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955. ''Crime Illustrated'' ran for a total of two issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, they had no choice but to cancel them.

==Writers==
The editor of ''Crime Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of this title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote using the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and Alfred E. Neuman. In a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]], Feldstein included retellings of previous stories: the first issue's "Fall Guy for Murder" and "Mother's Day", and the second issue's "Screenplay for Murder" and "Pieces of Hate". Writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had contributed to EC's earlier publications), Richard Smith and John Larner.

==Artists==
Artists featured in ''Crime Illustrated'' include [[Joe Orlando]], [[Bernard Krigstein]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Johnny Craig]].

==Reprints==
''Crime Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in 2006 as part of his ''Complete EC Library''. These reprints also included the first-time publication of the third issue (assembled in 1956 but never published by EC).

'''M. David Knowles''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] [[Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]]}} (born '''Michael Clive Knowles''', 29 September 1896 – 21 November 1974) was an [[English people|English]] [[Benedictine]] [[monk]], [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], and [[historian]], who became [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1954 to 1963. His works on [[monasticism]] in England from the times of [[Dunstan]] (909–988) to the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] are considered authoritative.

==Biography==
Born Michael Clive Knowles on 29 September 1896 in [[Studley, Warwickshire]], England,{{sfn|Brooke|1991|p=2}} Knowles was educated at [[Downside School]], operated by the monks of [[Downside Abbey]], and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he took a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first]] in both philosophy and classics.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Monk===
In 1923 Knowles became a member of the monastic community at Downside, being given the religious name of '''David''', by which he was always known thereafter. After completing the [[novitiate]] he was sent by the [[abbot]] to the  [[Sant'Anselmo all'Aventino|Pontifical Athenaeum of St. Anselm]] in Rome for his theological studies. Returning to Downside, he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest. His research into the early monastic history of England was assisted by the library built up at Downside by Dom Raymund Webster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Martin |date=24 January 2007 |title=Obituary of Dom Daniel Rees |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2180749.ece |work=The Independent |location=London |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211607/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2180749.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007 |access-date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowles became the leader of a faction of the younger monks of the abbey who  wanted to resist the growing demands of the school on the pattern of monastic life at the abbey. They advocated a more [[contemplation|contemplative]] life as the goal of their lives as monks. This effort led to a period of major conflict within the community and he was transferred to [[Ealing Abbey]], another teaching establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obituary of Dom Aelred Watkin, M.A., O.S.B. |url=http://www.sal.org.uk/obituaries/Obituary%20archive/dom-watkin |publisher=Society of Antiquaries of London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613113205/http://www.sal.org.uk/obituaries/Obituary%20archive/dom-watkin |archive-date=13 June 2011 |access-date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic at Cambridge===
In 1944 Knowles was elected into a [[research fellow]]ship in Medieval Studies at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse in the University of Cambridge]], where he would remain for the duration of his academic career.{{sfn|Lovatt|1991}}

In 1947 he was appointed as [[Professor of Medieval History (Cambridge)|Professor of Medieval History]] and then, in 1954, he became the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]], a post he held until his retirement in 1963.

He served as president of the [[Royal Historical Society]] from 1957 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/rhspresidents.doc |title=Presidents of the Royal Historical Society |publisher=Royal Historical Society |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111002/http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/rhspresidents.doc |archivedate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While pursuing his academic life at Cambridge, Knowles was eventually, at the instigation of Abbot [[Christopher Butler]], [[Enclosed religious orders|exclaustrated]] from Downside Abbey and finally released from his vows. Before his death on 21 November 1974 from a heart attack,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in ''The Times'', 26 November 1974&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brooke|1991|p=24}} however, he was readmitted to the order.{{sfn|Ellis|1983|p=88}}

Knowles is best known for his history of early English monasticism, ''The Monastic Order in England: A History of Its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940–1216'' (1940). His three-volume work, ''The Religious Orders in England'' (1948–1959), is also highly regarded by scholars in English medieval ecclesiastical history.&lt;ref&gt;Review by V.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">A '''deficiency judgment''' is an unsecured money judgment against a [[borrower]] whose [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] [[foreclosure]] sale did not produce sufficient funds to pay the underlying [[promissory note]], or loan, in full. &lt;ref&gt;See also Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a [[Recourse loan|recourse]] or [[nonrecourse loan]], which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are recourse loans.

In short, many jurisdictions hold that the loans obtained at the acquisition of a property ("purchase-money") are non-recourse, and most, if not all, subsequent loans are recourse.

States that follow the title (trust-deed) theory of mortgages typically allow non-judicial foreclosure procedures, which are fast, but do not allow deficiency judgments. States that follow the lien theory of mortgages require judiciary foreclosure procedures, but allow deficiency judgments against the debtor, although some states have narrowed the time periods to seek a deficiency judgment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tampaflforeclosure.com/foreclosure-defense/motion-for-deficiency-representation|title = Post Judgment Deficiency Motions in Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A "deficiency" is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the amount owed and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Supreme Court of Missouri Upholds Lenders' Rights to Obtain Full Deficiency Judgment  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-missouri-upholds-lenders-rights-to-obtain-full-deficiency-judgment |publisher= Armstrong Teasdale
|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-04-23|accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geoff Walsh, a staff attorney with the U.S. [[National Consumer Law Center]], said on [[National Public Radio|NPR]] that the United States is "seeing an uptick" in the pursuit of deficiency claims, because technological developments have enabled large debt-buying institutions and mortgage insurers to more easily pursue former borrowers, who often don't know their legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/406253|title = Bound by Debt: The Relentless Grip of the Foreclosure Crisis Continues|last = |first = |date = 15 October 2014|work = The Takeaway, NPR|accessdate = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11639">'''Discourse Grammar''' (DG) is a [[grammatical framework]] that grew out of the analysis of spoken and written linguistic discourse on the one hand, and of work on [[Parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthetical expressions]], including [[Simon C. Dik]]'s study of extra-clausal [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]], on the other. Initiated by Gunther Kaltenböck, [[Bernd Heine]] and Tania Kuteva, the framework is based on the distinction between two organizing principles of grammar where one concerns the structure of sentences and the other the linguistic organization beyond the sentence.

In accordance with the perspective adopted in this framework, linguistic units such as formulae of social exchange, interjections, discourse markers and other prefabricated expressions, which tend to be assigned a more marginal status in many models of mainstream linguistics, are interpreted as playing an important role in structuring linguistic discourse.

==Influences==
Work on Discourse Grammar (DG) has been inspired by a number of different works, in particular by Simon C. Dik's theory of [[Functional discourse grammar|Functional Grammar]] according to which linguistic discourse is composed of two different kinds of linguistic material, referred to, respectively, as clausal and extra-clausal constituents.&lt;ref name=Dik1997 /&gt; On the other hand, it has benefitted greatly from research on the nature of parenthetical categories&lt;ref name=DK2007 /&gt; and the concept of supplements.&lt;ref name=HP2002 /&gt;

==Principles and concepts==
DG is composed of all the linguistic resources that are available for designing texts, irrespective of whether these are spoken or written (or signed) texts. It is viewed both as an activity, a real-time interactional tool, and a knowledge store consisting of a set of conventional linguistic units plus their combinatorial potential. An elementary distinction between two main domains of speech processing is made, referred to as ''Sentence Grammar'' and ''[[Thetical Grammar]]''.&lt;ref name=KHK2011 /&gt;

Sentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination. It has been the only, or the main subject of mainstream theories of linguistics. The concern of Thetical Grammar is with theticals, that is, with linguistic discourse units beyond the sentence, being syntactically, semantically, and typically also prosodically detached from expressions of Sentence Grammar. These units include what is traditionally referred to as parenthetical constructions but are not restricted to them. The main categories of Thetical Grammar are conceptual theticals (including comment clauses, discourse markers, etc.)&lt;ref name=KHK2015 /&gt; as well as various other extra-clausal categories such as vocatives, formulae of social exchange, and interjections.&lt;ref name=HKKL2013 /&gt; While being separate in principle, the two domains interact in multiple ways in shaping linguistic discourse.&lt;ref name=KH2014 /&gt; The main way of interaction is via [[Cooptation (grammar)|cooptation]], an operation whereby chunks of Sentence Grammar such as clauses, phrases, words, or any other units are deployed for use in Thetical Grammar.&lt;ref name=KHK2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKK201F /&gt;

==Application and further work==
Being a relatively young framework, DG has so far found only limited applications. Work has focused mainly on comment clauses, discourse markers,&lt;ref name=Heine2013 /&gt; final particles,&lt;ref name=HKK2012 /&gt; and insubordination.&lt;ref name=HKK201F /&gt; Furthermore, DG as a descriptive tool has for the most part been restricted to the study of English. Analysis within this framework is now being extended to non-European languages. More detailed research has been carried out already on Akie, a traditional hunter-gatherer language of the Nilotic family spoken in north-central Tanzania. A grammar of this language based on DG has been published,&lt;ref name=KHL2015a /&gt; the use of theticals in the organization of texts has been studied,&lt;ref name=KHL2015b /&gt; and institutional frames surfacing from the analysis of Akie texts have been identified using Thetical Grammar as a basis.&lt;ref name=HKL2015c /&gt;

In another line of research, DG has been extended to the study of language contact. As the work on the discourse in bilingual situations has shown, theticals play an important role both in code-switching and borrowing.&lt;ref name=Heine201F /&gt; Furthermore, there is reason to assume that the distinction between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar may shed new light on the question of how human language or languages evolved.&lt;ref name=Heine201F-14 /&gt;

Finally, a considerable part of the research is devoted to the question of whether the distinction between the two domains is reflected in neural activity. As this research suggests, there appears to be a corresponding distinction in brain lateralization, in that Sentence Grammar correlates primarily with left-hemisphere activity whereas Thetical grammar appears to be more strongly associated with right-hemisphere activation.&lt;ref name=HKK2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKKL2015 /&gt;

==Related work==
That discourse organization operates simultaneously in two different dimensions has also been pointed out in a number of other research traditions. Thus, a distinction akin to that between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar is also made in some psycholinguistic studies on comprehension where a contrast between propositional representation and discourse model is made,&lt;ref name=Gernsbacher1990 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PLB2007 /&gt; and in neurolinguistic discourse analysis there is a related distinction between referential and modalizing speech.&lt;ref name=Nespoulous1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NCVL1998 /&gt; In other frameworks, specific manifestations of the distinction are highlighted, such as that between microgrammar and macrogrammar,&lt;ref name=Haselow2013 /&gt; or between an analytic and a holistic mode of processing,&lt;ref name=Pawley2009 /&gt; or between conceptual and procedural meaning in the theory of Relevance Grammar.&lt;ref name=Pawley2009-22 /&gt;

==Career==
Charlesworth was [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] research fellow at the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref name='GlassBio' /&gt;

Her expertise in ancient glass led to her appointment by the British Committee on Ancient Glass to undertake the British census of ancient glass, which was completed in 1955 although its publication was prevented by the committee's lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient glass|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/c7874ef2-cb01-4784-82f9-5008777eb23c|website=The National Archives|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Factory service manuals''' (FSM) are the manuals provided by manufacturers which cover the servicing, maintenance and repair of their products.  They were not originally offered to the public as they were developed for the dealerships so that their mechanics were able to fix their own products.

Many after-market manuals are available, with most of them referencing the FSM for topics such as torque specifications, dimensions and part numbers.

For vehicles, the following content are usually covered:
body, frame &amp; mounting, engine, suspension, [[Powertrain|driveline]], brake systems, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]/transaxle, clutch, chains, exhaust, fuel, steering, [[shock absorber|shocks]], climate control, instrumentation &amp; Warnings Systems, battery &amp; charging systems, audio, lighting, electrical distribution, and wiring.

The city was also known as ''Ferentinum'', ''Ferentum''  or ''Ferentia'', and should not be confused with ancient ''Ferentinum'' (now [[Ferentino]]), which is in southern Lazio.&lt;ref&gt;On the various places with this or similar names, see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/Places/Europe/Italy/Ferentinum_etc/home.html Bill Thayer: ''Ferentum and Ferentinum''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ferentium had an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] predecessor at modern [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]], as shown by the presence of a [[necropolis]]. In the Roman period, the city was a [[municipium]] of the Stellatina [[Roman tribe|tribe]] and part of the seventh [[Roman Italy#Augustan organization|regio of the province of Italia]]. Several famous families came from the city, including that of the Roman emperor [[Otho]]&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Otho*.html ''Otho'' 1].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#3 ''Divus Vespasianus'' 3].&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of the emperor [[Vespasian]]. Either she or [[Domitilla the Younger|her identically named daughter]] were worshipped as ''diva Domitilla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1962|272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1172 Ferentium was conquered by and incorporated into neighboring [[Viterbo]].

==Remains==
Extensive remains of the ancient city are still extant, including a [[Theater (building)#Ancient Rome|theater]] and several domestic and municipal buildings.

== Archaeological Investigations ==
Much of the early work at the site is due to the "archaeologist king" [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]]. The most recent excavations took place between 1994 and 2009 under the supervision of [[Tuscia University]] in Viterbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferento ricerche archeologiche|url=http://scaviferento.unitus.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=77&amp;lang=en|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the most important remains may be found in the National Archaeological Museum of Viterbo at [[Rocca Albornoz]], including some reconstructed building remains and some marble statues depicting characters from classical [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] which presumably came from the area of the theater. A small wooden model of the theater is also present.

Nearby sites include "[[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]]" which was itself excavated in the years between 1956 and 1978 by the [[Swedish Institute in Rome]].

== Literature ==
The site appears in the famous ''The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria'' by George Dennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denis|first1=George|title=The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria|date=1907|location=London; New York|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cities-and-cemeteries-of-etruria/oclc/1905413}} ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/_Periods/Roman/Archaic/Etruscan/_Texts/DENETR*/13.html#ref10 online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recruited to perform in [[Vienna]] for the court of Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles the VI]]. Fluent in many languages, he invented the spirited and comic character of the ''Italianized Frenchman''. In 1740, while in [[Venice]], he published a comedy titled ''l' Adulatore'' (The Adulater).

'''Heroes World Distribution Co.''', originally named '''Superhero Enterprises''', was an [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] [[distributor]] founded by Ivan Snyder, active from 1975 to 1997, during the growth and consolidation of the [[direct market]]. Heroes World was acquired by [[Marvel Comics]] in late [[1994 in comics|1994]] to act as the publisher's sole distributor. This ill-fated move, combined with other marketplace factors of the time, resulted in the financial failure of many other comics distributors and retailers — and the near collapse of the entire North American comic book market.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In the early 1970s, Ivan Snyder was head of licensing in [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel Comics Group]]'s merchandising department, in charge of selling various Marvel licensed products via mail order. After a change in management in the mid-1970s, Marvel discontinued the mail order service, and  Snyder purchased the business in 1975, renaming it '''Superhero Enterprises'''. Initially running the business out his basement, Snyder shortly thereafter moved into a storefront in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], with a catalog showroom store format.  A second store was opened in a [[Livingston, New Jersey|Livingston]] shopping mall, with [[DC Comics]] products added to their product mix.&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;

When the former [[Mego Corporation]] trademark "Superhero" was purchased by Marvel and DC, Superheroes Enterprise was forced to change its name to '''Heroes World'''. By 1982, Heroes World's retail chain had expanded to 12 locations,&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{cite web|last=Heiler|first=Brian|title=Visit Heroes World|url=http://www.megomuseum.com/megolibrary/articles/heroesworld.html|work=MegoLibrary|publisher=Mego Museum.com|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it continued its mail order distribution business. (The Heroes World catalog was produced in conjunction with the [[Dover, New Jersey]]-based [[Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art]].)&lt;ref name=mm /&gt;

=== Acquisition by Marvel ===
By late 1994, Heroes World was North America's third largest comics distributor&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, Bob. "Newswatch: Marvel Buys 3rd Largest Distributor: Heroes World Purchase Signals Fundamental Changes in the Direct Market," ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (Feb. 1995): pp. 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt; (behind [[Diamond Comics Distributors]] and [[Capital City Distribution]]). On December 28, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.comichron.com/comicstimeline/marveltimeline.html "Marvel Comics Timeline: Significant moments in the publishing history of Marvel Comics,"] The Comics Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt; Heroes World was bought by Marvel Comics&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;Bryant, Adam. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/business/pow-the-punches-that-left-marvel-reeling.html?_r=0 "BUSINESS DAY: Pow! The Punches That Left Marvel Reeling,"] ''New York Times'' (MAY 24, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; to act as the company's exclusive distributor,&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; thus reducing other distributors' market share by more than a third.&lt;ref name="cbg129"&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg129.html "Marvel Comics to Self-Distribute  Heroes World,"] Tales From the Database, Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The change took effect with books shipped July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson (with additional reporting by T.M. Haley). [http://www.newsarama.com/comics/may-2010-comichron-report-100830.html "JULY '10 COMICHRON Report: 15 Years After HEROES WORLD,"] Newsarama (August 30, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As industry veteran [[Chuck Rozanski]] notes:

{{quote|Without Marvel comics to distribute, all of the surviving direct market comics distributors suddenly found their overall sales volume reduced by 35%-40% ... while their operating costs remained constant. In a business where even a single point of discount or volume could translate into huge differences in earnings, these massive losses in sales volume were simply not sustainable. [[Steve Geppi]], owner of Diamond Comic Distributors, responded to this threat to the survival of his business by entering into negotiations to become the exclusive distributor for all the other comics publishers. ... While Steve was begging all the comics publishers to switch all of their distribution business exclusively over to his company, John Davis and [[Milton Griepp]] of Capital City were making the same pleas on the part of their organization.&lt;ref name="cbg129" /&gt;}}

The ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major North American distributor, Diamond.&lt;ref name="DuinCC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 "Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase," bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes World's new role as Marvel's exclusive distributor was a failure from the beginning. Lacking the infrastructure to handle Marvel's huge weekly orders resulted in extensive shipment and billing mistakes, errors which caused great consternation among the thousands of comics specialty shops affected.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Howard. "Blood &amp; Thunder: We Told You There's Be Days Like This," ''The Comics Journal'' #186 (Apr. 1996), pp 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Rozanski:

{{quote|... the Heroes World management team failed miserably in the PR war to win the hearts and minds of comics retailers. In fact, rather than win over any converts to Marvel, the hassle of having to place two new comics orders each month (sometimes at a lower overall discount), plus paying freight costs on Heroes World shipments, pushed many comics retailers to the brink of closing their stores.&lt;ref name="cbg129" /&gt;}}

These factors, combined with the collapse of the comics speculation market, did indeed result in many comics stores closing their doors for good.

Throughout 1995 and 1996, Heroes World continued to flounder, facing lost business&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Wizards Cut Off Heroes World," ''The Comics Journal'' #179 (Aug. 1995), p. 25. (''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' cards no longer available through Heroes World.)&lt;/ref&gt; and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Jordan. "Son of Heroes World President Receives Fine, Probation for Tax Fraud," ''The Comics Journal'' #187 (May 1996), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"News Watch: Rojek's Suit Against Marvel Dismissed," ''The Comics Journal'' #189 (Aug. 1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1997 the company went out of business,&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; and Marvel returned to Diamond Distributors,&lt;ref&gt;"Hello Again: Marvel Goes with Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #193 (February 1997), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; which by that point was the only major distributor left standing.

'''''In the Red''''' is the first in a sequence of four [[black comedy]]-[[crime drama]] series created for [[BBC Radio 4]] by [[Mark Tavener]] featuring [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as BBC Reporter George Cragge and [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] as [[Superintendent (police)|Police Superintendent]] Frank Jefferson.

The first seven-part series (BBC Radio 4, 1995), was adapted by Tavener and comedy-writer [[Peter Baynham]] from Tavener's [[In the Red (novel)|novel of the same name]] ([[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]], 1989), which had been inspired by the writer's early experiences working for the [[BBC]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="RHH01"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=In the Red |publisher=''radiohaha'' |date=|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pq/radiohaha/INTHERED.html |accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent series, ''[[#In the Balance|In the Balance]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1997), ''[[#In the Chair|In the Chair]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1998), and ''[[#In the End|In the End]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1999), were all six-parts each and followed the same format, with the two lead characters investigating a series of murders often linked to British politics and media. There was also a three-part [[In the Red (TV series)|television series based on the original novel]] ([[BBC Two]], 1998), adapted by [[Malcolm Bradbury]], featuring [[Warren Clarke]] as Cragge and [[Alun Armstrong]] as Jefferson.

Following the conclusion of the final series, the characters of Charles Prentis, played by [[Stephen Fry]], and Martin McCabe, played by [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], who appeared in ''[[#In the Red|In the Red]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1995), ''[[#In the Chair|In the Chair]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1998), and ''[[#In the End|In the End]]'' (BBC Radio 4, 1999), as well as the TV production of [[In the Red (TV series)|In the Red]] (BBC Two, 1998), were featured in their own spin-off series ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]'' ([[BBC Radio 4]], 2000-2006/[[BBC Two]], 2003-2005), which was also created and written by Tavener.

'''Industrial design''' is a process of [[design]] applied to [[Product (business)|products]] that are to be manufactured through techniques of [[mass production]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Noblet|1993|pp=21-22}} This distinguishes industrial design from [[craft]]-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can take many forms: it can be conducted by an individual or a large team; it can emphasize intuitive [[creativity]] or calculated [[Evidence-based design|scientific decision-making]], and often emphasizes both at the same time; and it can be influenced by factors as varied as [[Raw material|material]]s, [[Manufacturing process management|production processes]], [[business strategy]] and prevailing social, commercial or aesthetic attitudes.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}} The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, function, usability, [[physical ergonomics]], marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.&lt;ref&gt;de Noblet, J., ''Industrial Design'', Paris: A.F.A.A. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
For several millennia before the onset of [[industrialisation]], design, technical expertise, and manufacturing were often done by individuals [[Craft production|craftsmen]], who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or [[apprenticeship]].{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

The [[division of labour]] that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}} The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Bruges]], where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] of [[pattern books]]: collections of [[engravings]] illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} The use of [[Technical drawing|drawing]] to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by [[architects]] and [[shipwrights]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].{{sfn|Baynes|1991|p=108}}

In the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as [[France]] led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomised by the [[Gobelins Manufactory]], opened in [[Paris]] in 1667 by [[Louis XIV]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from [[tapestries]] and [[furniture]] to [[metalwork]] and [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]], all under the creative supervision of the King's leading artist [[Charles Le Brun]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=11-12}} This pattern of  large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the [[Meissen porcelain]] workshops established in 1709 by the [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxony]], where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=12}} As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=12-13}}

===Birth of industrial design===
The emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the [[industrial revolution]] in [[Great Britain]] in the mid 18th century.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, [[urbanisation]] changed patterns of [[consumerism|consumption]], the [[imperialism|growth of empires]] broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider [[middle class]] created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population.{{sfn|Benton|2000|p=380}}

The first use of the term "industrial design" is often attributed to the industrial designer [[Joseph Claude Sinel]] in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade.  [[Christopher Dresser]] is considered among the first independent industrial designers.&lt;ref name=dresser&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Dresser|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=Design Museum|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial design's origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance the [[Deutscher Werkbund]], founded in 1907 and a precursor to the [[Bauhaus]], was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put [[Germany]] on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the [[United States]].

The earliest use of the term may have been in [[The Art Journal|''The Art Union'', A monthly Journal of the Fine Arts]], 1839.

{{Quotation|Dyce's report to the Board of Trade on foreign schools of Design for Manufactures. Mr Dyces official visit to France, Prussia and Bavaria for the purpose of examining the state of schools of design in those countries will be fresh in the recollection of our readers. His report on this subject was ordered to be printed some few months since, on the motion of Mr Hume.

The school of St Peter, at Lyons was founded about 1750 for the instruction of draftsmen employed in preparing patterns for the silk manufacture. It has been much more successful than the Paris school and having been disorganized by the revolution, was restored by Napoleon and differently constituted, being then erected into an Academy of Fine Art: to which the study of design for silk manufacture was merely attached as a subordinate branch. It appears that all the students who entered the school commence as if they were intended for artists in the higher sense of the word and are not expected to decide as to whether they will devote themselves to the Fine Arts or to Industrial Design, until they have completed their exercises in drawing and painting of the figure from the antique and from the living model. It is for this reason, and from the fact that artists for industrial purposes are both well paid and highly considered (as being well instructed men) that so many individuals in France engage themselves in ''both'' pursuits.}}

''The Practical Draughtsman's Book of Industrial Design'' by [[Jacques-Eugène Armengaud]] was printed in 1853.&lt;ref name=practical&gt;{{cite web|title=The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design : forming a complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing by Armengaud, aîné (Jacques-Eugène), 1810-1891|url=https://archive.org/details/practicaldraught00arme|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a "complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing." The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design.  This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

[[Robert Lepper]] helped to establish one of the country's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon magazine - Winter 2002"&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/magazine/02winter/newsbriefs.html "Newsbriefs: Lepper show runs at Warhol."] Carnegie Mellon Magazine. Winter 2002. Retrieved January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Product design]] and industrial design overlap in the fields of [[user interface design]], [[information design]], and [[interaction design]]. Various [[schools]] of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called ''functionalist'' school.&lt;ref&gt;Pulos, Arthur J., ''The American Design Adventure 1940-1975'', Cambridge, Mass:MIT Press (1988), p. 249 ({{ISBN|9780262161060}})&lt;/ref&gt; Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, educational programs in the U.S. for engineering design require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/accreditation/ Abet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD Nasad.arts-accredit.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812143443/http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD |date=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
Most industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting  Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two  to four years of study. The study results in a [[Bachelor of Industrial Design]] (B.I.D.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc) or [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as [[Master of Design]], [[Master of Fine Arts]] and others to a [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]].

==Definition==

Industrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who design the mechanical aspects of the product assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations.

{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Industrial design (ID) is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.|source=[[Industrial Designers Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124105248/http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89 |archivedate=January 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers and engineers, because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Design|Carnegie Mellon's School of Design]], "Design is the process of taking something from its existing state and moving it to a preferred state" (Simon, Herbert A. "The sciences of the artiﬁcial." Cambridge, MA (1969, 1981, 1996)).

Industrial design can overlap significantly with [[engineering design]], and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general [[engineering]] focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on ''aesthetic and user-interface'' aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|credentials and/or licensure]] required to engage in the practice of engineering.&lt;ref name=mcadc&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between Industrial Design And Design Engineering|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=MCADC Cafe|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Industrial design" as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]], except for the latter's sub-specialty of [[ergonomics]].

At the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences."
An extended version of this definition is as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what’s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.
Industrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. "&lt;ref name="ICSID 2015 in Gwangju"&gt;[http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm ICSID web：DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317224506/http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process==

[[Image:VW 1300 side.jpg|thumb|Model 1300 Volkswagen Beetle]]

Although the process of design may be considered 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, [[computer-aided industrial design]] and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use [[industrial CT scanning]] to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product.

Product characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, [[colors]], texture, form, and aspects concerning the [[Ergonomic|use of the product]]. Additionally they may specify aspects concerning the production process, [[material selection|choice of materials]] and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the [[point of sale]]. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving [[usability]], lowering production costs and developing more appealing products.

Industrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to [[aesthetics]], usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns—such as psychology, desire, and the emotional attachment of the user. These [[Architectural design values|values]] and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary—between different schools of thought, and among practicing designers.

==Industrial design rights==
{{Main article|Industrial design rights}}

Industrial design rights are [[intellectual property]] rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian.  A design patent would also be considered under this category.  An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs]], a [[WIPO]]-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.

A number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. [[Alvar Aalto]], renowned as an [[architect]], also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. [[Raymond Loewy]] was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] corporate logo, the original [[BP]] logo (in use until 2000), the [[PRR S1]] steam locomotive, the [[Studebaker Starlight]] (including the later iconic bulletnose), as well as [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric razors, [[Electrolux]] refrigerators, short-wave radios, [[Le Creuset]] French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items.

[[Richard A. Teague]], who spent most of his career with the [[American Motor Company]], originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]], [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]], [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], and the complete interior of the [[Eagle Premier]].

Milwaukee's [[Brooks Stevens]] was best known for his [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Skytop Lounge]] car  and [[Oscar Mayer]] [[Wienermobile]] designs, among others.

[[Viktor Schreckengost]] designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art's school of industrial design.

[[Oskar Barnack]] was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the [[Leica Camera|Leica]], which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design.

[[Charles and Ray Eames]] were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the [[Eames Lounge Chair Wood]] and [[Eames Lounge Chair]]. Other influential designers included [[Henry Dreyfuss]], [[Eliot Noyes]], [[John Vassos]], and [[Russel Wright]].

[[Dieter Rams]] is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company [[Braun (company)|Braun]] and the [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] school of industrial design.

Many of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s recent iconic products were designed by Sir [[Jonathan Ive]].

The '''jackalope''' is a [[mythical animal]] of North American folklore (a [[fearsome critter]]) described as a [[Hare|jackrabbit]] with [[pronghorn|antelope]] horns. The word "jackalope" is a [[portmanteau]] of "jackrabbit" and "antelope." Many jackalope [[taxidermy]] mounts, including the original, are made with deer [[antler]]s.

In the 1930s, Douglas Herrick and his brother, hunters with taxidermy skills, popularized the American jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass and selling the combination to a local hotel in [[Douglas, Wyoming]]. Thereafter, they made and sold many similar jackalopes to a retail outlet in [[South Dakota]], and another taxidermist continues to manufacture the horned rabbits in the 21st century. Stuffed and mounted, jackalopes are found in many bars and other places in the United States; stores catering to tourists sell jackalope postcards and other paraphernalia, and commercial entities in America and elsewhere have used the word "jackalope" or a jackalope logo as part of their marketing strategies. The jackalope has appeared in published stories, poems, television shows, video games, and a low-budget [[mockumentary]] film. The [[Wyoming Legislature]] has considered bills to make the jackalope the state's official mythological creature.

The underlying legend of the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, may be related to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that at least some of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the ''[[Shope papilloma virus]]''. It causes horn- and antler-like [[tumor]]s to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.

Folklorists see the jackalope as one of a group of fabled creatures common to American culture since [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] days. These appear in [[tall tale]]s about [[hodag]]s, giant turtles, [[Bigfoot]], and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. The tales lend themselves to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.

==Name==
''Jackalope'' is a [[portmanteau]] word that combines two words, ''jackrabbit'' and ''antelope''.

[[hare|Jackrabbits]] are actually hares rather than rabbits though both are [[mammal]]s in the order ''[[Lagomorpha]]''. Wyoming is home to three species of hares, all in the genus ''Lepus''. These are the [[black-tailed jackrabbit]], the [[white-tailed jackrabbit]], and the [[snowshoe hare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lewis, Dan|title=Wyoming Wildlife – The Hares, Rabbits &amp; Pikas!|url=http://wyomingnaturalist.com/mammals_lagomorphs.html|year=2014|accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antelope is actually a [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'') rather than an antelope, although one of its colloquial names in North America is "antelope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caton, J. D. |year=1876|title=The American Antelope, or Prong Buck|journal=The American Naturalist|volume= 10 |issue=4|pages=193–205|jstor=2448724|doi=10.1086/271628}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the largest herds of wild pronghorns, which are found only in western North America, are in Wyoming. The adults grow to about {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} tall, weigh up to {{convert|150|lb|kg}}, and can run at sustained speeds approaching {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronghorn|publisher=National Wildlife Federation|url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/pronghorn.aspx|year=2015|accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories or descriptions of animal hybrids have appeared in many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century [[Iran|Persian]] work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a [[unicorn]].&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simon, Matt|title=Fantastically Wrong: The Disturbing Reality That Spawned the Mythical Jackalope|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/fantastically-wrong-jackalope/|journal=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|date=2014-05-14|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] folklore in [[Bavaria]] (the [[wolpertinger]]) and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Scariest Rabbit"/&gt; Natural history texts such as ''Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri'' (''The History Book of Natural Quadrangles'') by [[John Jonston|Joannes Jonstonus]] (John Jonston) in the 17th century&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; and illustrations such as ''Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII'' by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hoefnagel, Joris|title=Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.69793.html|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2014|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they were real creatures, but by the end of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.&lt;ref name="Scariest Rabbit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jemison, Michaela|title=The World's Scariest Rabbit Lurks Within the Smithsonian's Collection|url=http://smithsonianscience.org/2014/10/worlds-scariest-rabbit-lurks-within-smithsonians-collection/|work=Smithsonian Science|date=2014-10-31|accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rabbit shopes papilloma virus 3.jpg|thumb|Rabbit with [[Shope papilloma virus]] infection]]
References to horned rabbits may originate in sightings of rabbits affected by the [[Shope papilloma virus]], named for Richard E. Shope, M.D., who described it in a scientific journal in 1933.&lt;ref name="Shope paper"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shope, Richard E.  |author2=Hurst, E.

They had "numerous horn-like protuberances on the skin over various parts of their bodies. The animals were referred to popularly as 'horned' or 'warty' rabbits."&lt;ref name="Shope paper"/&gt; Legends about horned rabbits also occur in Asia and Africa as well as Europe, and researchers suspect the changes induced by the virus might underlie at least some of those tales.&lt;ref name=" Wichita exhibit"&gt;{{cite news| author=Rife, Susan L.|title= The Evolution of the Jackalope Exhibit Explores Facts Behind Hoax| newspaper=The Wichita Eagle|location=Wichita, Kansas|edition=City|page=1C|date=1990-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Douglas variant===
''[[The New York Times]]'' attributes the American jackalope's origin to a 1932 hunting outing involving Douglas Herrick (1920–2003) of [[Douglas, Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin, Douglas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/us/douglas-herrick-82-dies-father-of-west-s-jackalope.html |title=Douglas Herrick, 82, Dies|page=23|newspaper=The New York Times |date=2003-01-19 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herrick and his brother had studied [[taxidermy]] by mail order as teenagers, and when the brothers returned from a hunting trip for jackrabbits, Herrick tossed a carcass into the taxidermy store, where it came to rest beside a pair of deer antlers. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Herrick's idea for a jackalope.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web| title= The Origin of the Jackalope| url=http://www.jackalope.org/Douglas/DouglasJackalope.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513034111/http://www.jackalope.org/Douglas/DouglasJackalope.html| date= 2008| work= Douglas [Wyoming] Chamber of Commerce| archivedate=2008-05-13| accessdate= 2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first jackalope the brothers put together was sold for $10 to Roy Ball, who displayed it in Douglas' La Bonte Hotel. The mounted head was stolen in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver, Myrna|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/23/local/me-herrick23 |title=Douglas Herrick, 82; on a Whim He Created 'Jackalope'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jackalope became a popular local attraction in Douglas, where the Chamber of Commerce issues Jackalope Hunting Licenses to tourists. The tags are good for hunting during official jackalope season, which occurs for only one day: June 31 (a nonexistent date as June has 30 days), from midnight to 2 a.m. The hunter must have an IQ greater than 50 but not over 72. Thousands of "licenses" have been issued.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; In Herrick's home town of Douglas, there is an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} statue of a jackalope,&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; and the town hosts an annual Jackalope Days Celebration in early June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackalope Days|url=http://www.cityofdouglas.org/index.aspx?NID=156|publisher=City of Douglas|accessdate=2015-01-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204092201/http://www.cityofdouglas.org/index.aspx?NID=156|archivedate=2015-02-04|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the Herrick's success, Frank English of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] has made and sold many thousands of jackalopes since retiring from the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1981. He is the only supplier of the altered animal heads to [[Cabela's]], a major outdoor-theme retail company. His standard jackalopes and "world-record" jackalopes sell for about $150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tupper, Seth|title=Jackalope Sightings Abound in Rapid Valley|newspaper=Rapid City Journal|date=2015-01-19|location=Rapid City, South Dakota|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/jackalope-sightings-abound-in-rapid-valley/article_f21cf53d-4ef3-51ee-8a4b-88ed3036904f.html|accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Man and Beast in American Comic Legend'', folklorist [[Richard Dorson]] recounts the Douglas variant but also an alternative that will "surely infuriate the residents of Douglas...". According to Dorson, in ''Mythical Creatures of the North Country'' (1969), historian Walker D. Wyman acknowledged the existence of what he called the Alkali Area Jackalope of the western United States. However, he expressed doubt that it predated the Jack-pine Jackalope of [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]], "a mythological throwback that defies even the most competent biologists of the region." Wyman claimed there were three known specimens of this primary jackalope—in [[Augusta, Wisconsin|Augusta]] in west-central Wisconsin; [[Cornucopia, Wisconsin|Cornucopia]], along the south shore of [[Lake Superior]]; and in a north shore museum and lumber camp—all "presumably shot by careless hunters during the deer season."&lt;ref name="Man and Beast"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorson, Richard M.|title=Man and Beast in American Comic Legend|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|date=1982|pages=50–54|isbn=0-253-33665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 revision and expansion of his book, which includes material on the rubberado porcupine, the [[Snallygaster|snoligoster]], the three-tailed bavalorus, the [[squonk]], and many other creatures, Wyman devotes four pages to the jackalope. In a turnabout from his earlier claims of a North Country origin for the antlered hare, he says, "The center of its vast range seems to be Wyoming." Evidence of wide dispersal of ''Lepus antilocapra wyomingensis'' from its original range, he claims, are labels such as "Tioga, Pennsylvania," and "Hongkong" stamped on mounted jackalope heads in barrooms across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wyman, Walker D.; Wyman, Helen B.

==Tall tales==
The jackalope is subject to many outlandish and largely [[tongue-in-cheek]] claims embedded in [[tall tales]] about its habits. Jackalopes are said to be so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored.&lt;ref name="jackalope movie"/&gt; Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but ''The New York Times'' questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Coats, Karen|title=Ghost Knight|journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|publisher=University of Illinois |volume=65|issue=10|date=June 2012|pages=509–10|doi=10.1353/bcc.2012.0489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jackalope can imitate the human voice, according to legend. During the days of the [[Old West]], when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; or singing along, usually as a [[tenor]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; It is said that jackalopes, the rare ''Lepus antilocapra'', only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Noel, Tom|title=Jackalope Legend Still Traps Interest|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=2003-02-08|location=Denver, Colorado|page=9D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official recognition==
In 2005, the legislature of Wyoming considered a bill to make the jackalope the state's official mythological creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2005/digest/hb0004.htm |title=H.B.

In 2013, following the death of the bill's sponsor, [[Dave Edwards (Wyoming politician)|Dave Edwards]], the state legislature reintroduced the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hancock, Laura|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-lawmakers-consider-declaring-jackalope-state-s-official-mythical-creature/article_3c49017f-1bfd-5c07-a9cd-c7fb707b210e.html |title=Wyoming Lawmakers Consider Declaring Jackalope State's Official Mythical Creature |newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune|location=Casper, Wyoming|date=2013-01-12 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It again passed the House but died in the rules committee of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/house-bill/article_69ae9623-d1a1-5a7a-9b2f-c5fa9b6bde17.html |title=House Bill 149 |newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune|date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, three state representatives put forth the jackalope proposal again, this time as House Bill 66,&lt;ref name=Hancock&gt;{{cite news|author=Hancock, Laura|title=Legislator Brings Back Jackalope Bill for Wyoming Mythical Creature|newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/legislator-brings-back-jackalope-bill-for-wyoming-mythical-creature/article_f7344984-2012-587d-bb3b-590dda5e9e01.html|date=2015-01-09|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again it passed the House but died in a Senate committee.&lt;ref name=2015Leg&gt;{{cite web|title=Digest – H.B.

Musicians have used the jackalope in various ways. [[R. Carlos Nakai]], a Native American [[flute]] player, formerly belonged to a group called Jackalope.

Jackalopes have appeared in movies and on television. A jackalope named "Jack Ching Bada Bing" was a recurring character in a series of sketches on the television show ''[[America's Funniest People]]''. The show's host, [[Dave Coulier]], voiced the rascally hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ryan, Mike|title=Hollywood Hybrids: The Best Chimeras on the Big (and Small) Screen|journal=Popular Mechanics|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/visual-effects/hollywoods-best-and-worst-chimeras|publisher=Hearst Communication|date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundin'|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395479/|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pixar]] featured a jackalope in the short animation ''[[Boundin']]''.

==Scholarly interpretations==
Folklorist John A. Gutowski sees in the Douglas jackalope an example of an American tall tale publicized by a local community that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons. A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town's association with the local legend.&lt;ref name="Gutowski"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gutowski, John A.|title=The Protofestival: Local Guide to American Folk Behavior|journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=15|number=2 (May/August 1978|pages=113–32|jstor=3814089|subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutowski finds evidence of what he calls the "protofestival" pattern throughout the United States. In addition to the jackalope, his examples include the [[sea serpent]] of [[Nantucket]], which in 1937 led to "stories of armadas hunting the monster, and footprint discoveries by local businessmen", accompanied by wide publicity. In similar fashion, [[Newport, Arkansas]], publicized its [[White River Monster]], and [[Algiers, Louisiana]], claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. [[Ware, Massachusetts]], drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. [[Perry, New York]], held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax. The [[Hodag]] Festival in [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]], celebrates "discovery" of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit. [[Willow Creek, California]], hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival. Since 1950, [[Churubusco, Indiana]], has celebrated Turtle Days, based on a story, part real and part invented, about the hunt for the [[Beast of Busco]], a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[snapping turtle]] said to be living in a nearby lake.&lt;ref name="Gutowski"/&gt;

Common to these tales, Gutowski says, is the recurring [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of the quest for the mythical animal, often a monster. The same motif, he notes, appears in American novels such as ''[[Moby Dick]]'' and ''[[Old Man and the Sea]]'' and in monster movies such as ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and  ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and in world literature such as ''[[Beowulf]]''. The monster motif also appears in tales of contemporary places outside the United States, such as Scotland, with its [[Loch Ness Monster]]. What is not global, Gutowski says, is the embrace of local monster tales by American communities that put them to use through "public relations hoaxes, boisterous boosterism, and [a] carnival atmosphere... ".&lt;ref name="Gutowski"/&gt;

Folklorist [[Richard Dorson|Richard M. Dorson]] also cites the "booster impulse, mingled with entrepreneurial hoaxing" as the way that Douglas with its jackalope, Churubusco with its giant turtle, and other towns with their own local legends rise above anonymity. He traces the impulse and the methods to the promotional literature of colonial times that depicted North America as an earthly paradise. Much later, in the 19th century, settlers transferred that optimistic vision to the [[Western United States|American West]], where it culminated in "boosterism". Although other capitalist countries advertise their products, Dorson says, "...the intensity of the American ethos in advertising, huckstering, attention-getting, media-manipulating to sell a product, a personality, a town is beyond compare."&lt;ref name="Dorson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dorson, Richard M.|title=Editor's Comment: Rejoinder to 'American Folklore vs. Folklore in America: A Fixed Fight?'|journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=17|number=1 (January/April 1980|pages=85–89|jstor=3814224|subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Cotton Dana''' (born August 19, 1856 in [[Woodstock, Vermont]] – d. July 21, 1929 in [[Newark, New Jersey]]) was an American [[library]] and [[museum]] director who sought to make these [[Cultural property|cultural institutions]] relevant to the daily lives of citizens.  As a [[public library|public librarian]] for forty years Dana promoted the benefits of reading, pioneered direct access to shelved materials, and innovated specialized library services of all types.

==Biography==

Dana studied [[law]] at [[Dartmouth College]], where he graduated in 1878.  Moving to [[Denver]] in 1880, Dana passed the Colorado [[Bar association|bar]] and began to practice.  Dana moved to New York and was admitted to the bar in 1883.   Taking a position as the editor of the ''[[Ashby Avalanche]]'' in 1885, Dana moved to Minnesota but resettled in Colorado after a short time.  Dana married in 1888 to Adine Rowena Wagener. They had no children.

Because of the reputation he cultivated as a learned man and his connections in the [[Denver Public Schools]], the superintendent Aaron Gove nominated Dana as the City's first librarian.  Dana directed the [[Denver Public Library]] from 1889 to 1898, pioneering the patron's right to open [[library stacks|stacks]], allowing them to browse for themselves instead of having library staff intervening for every request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=C. A.|date=1994|title=Access and utility: John Cotton Dana and the antecedents of information science, 1889-1929|url=|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=186–204|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dana wanted to update libraries and envisioned them as vibrant community centers rather than collections of relics that appealed to only a small segment of people.  Under Dana's leadership the Denver Public Library also pioneered the first-ever collection devoted to [[children's literature]].  He was personally opposed to the concept of storytime, preferring for his children's library to focus on the continuing education of school teachers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Dana served as [[List of presidents of the American Library Association|president]] of the [[American Library Association]] in 1895/96.

The city began discussing lowering Dana's salary over mounting public controversy concerning a city tax levied for the school district and, by extension, the library.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Dana also drew criticism for circulating "gold bug" literature at the library; Colorado was economically dependent on [[Silver mining in Colorado|mining silver]] and the [[gold standard]] was a political issue.  Dana felt that library patrons should have information on both sides of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=K.|date=2000|title=The librarian as secular minister to democracy: The life and ideas of John Cotton Dana|url=|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=514–534|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back east again, he served as a librarian at the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] public library from 1898 to 1902 and continued many of his Denver policies there. One of the changes Dana implemented at the Springfield library was to the physical building itself.  He had workers tear down many of the railings and generally open the floor plan. Dana was adamant that patron be permitted to browse the stacks: "Let the shelves be open, and the public admitted to them, and let the open shelves strike the keynote of the whole administration. The whole library should be permeated with a cheerful and accommodating atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these terms were not invented until nearly a century later, Dana concerned himself heavily with the [[ergonomics]] and [[usability]] of the library collections and facilities.  He left Springfield after refusing to become involved in a power struggle with the library's patrons.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Dana provided leadership at the [[Newark Public Library]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], from 1902 until his death in 1929.  He established foreign language collections for [[immigrants]] and also developed a special collection for the business community. This "Business Branch" was the first of its kind in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newark.rutgers.edu/about-us/have-you-met-rutgers-newark/john-cotton-dana-library John Cotton Dana Library was erected in 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dana founded the [[Special Libraries Association]], serving as its first president from 1909 to 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sla.org/about-sla/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana founded the [[Newark Museum]] in 1909, directing it until his death. The Museum was exceptional because it included contemporary American commercial products as folk art as well as factory-made products. John C. Dana personally believed that purchasing European oil painting was a waste of money and thus supported American art movements.  He did not like modern art, but he believed in the principle of a universal museum and thus ordered purchases of art associated with the [[Ashcan School]]. In 1915, he curated the exhibition "Clay Products of New Jersey" where he displayed two porcelain toilets from [[Trenton Potteries]], part of his work toward including industrial arts in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton also began the Newark Museum's notable Tibetan collection.

Dana was quoted as saying, “A great department store, easily reached, open at all hours, is more like a good museum of art than any of the museums we have yet established”.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  A biographer said of Dana, “He would have found a library school curriculum intolerable, and doubtless a library school would have found him intolerable”.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Dana's death, his successor at the Newark Public Library referred to him as “The First Citizen of Newark”.  The pre-legal department of [[New Jersey Law School]], transitioning from a two-year to a four-year curriculum in 1930, renamed the school ''Dana College'' (Watkins 2006, 2).  Six years after his death, the city of Newark appointed October 6, 1935 as ''John Cotton Dana Day''.  Rutgers-Newark's [[John Cotton Dana Library|main library]], opened in 1967, is named after Dana.

The [[American Library Association]] offers the ''John Cotton Dana Public Relations Award'' to libraries with exceptional [[public relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/llama/awards/johncottondana John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NJ Associations of Museums has an annual award in his name, presented to an individual "for outstanding contributions to the New Jersey museum profession."

The highest honor of the [[Special Libraries Association]]  is the ''[[John Cotton Dana Award]]'', recognizing an information professional for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org/get-involved/awards/awards-descriptions/ SLA Awards Descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana is recognized in the [[Library Hall of Fame]].

This is a '''list of medieval bestiaries'''. The [[bestiary]] form is commonly divided into "families," as proposed in 1928 by [[M. R. James]] and revised by Florence McCulloch in 1959-1962.

A '''looseleaf service''' is a type of publication used in [[legal research]] which brings together both [[Primary authority|primary]] and [[Secondary authority|secondary]] source materials on a specific field or topic in [[law]].  For this reason they are sometimes called "subject-matter services".

Looseleaf services are most commonly used for research in areas of law which change rapidly due to [[Regulation|regulatory]] and [[Administrative law|administrative]] developments (such as [[tax law]], [[environmental law]], [[financial regulation]], and [[labor law]]).  Looseleaf services are typically contained in [[ring binder]]s to keep them updated, because they are published fairly frequently (at minimum monthly, sometimes weekly or bi-weekly) in order to keep the information therein current.  Most [[Law library|law libraries]] have a subscription to several of these services, and many of the more popular services are available electronically as well.

==Types==
===Interfiled===
In an interfiled looseleaf service, individual pages can be removed and replaced with more recent printings, eliminating the need for pocket parts or similar supplements.  Most of the looseleaf services offered by [[Commerce Clearing House]] are of the interfiled type.

===Newsletter-style===
Newsletter-type looseleaf services are published as topical [[newsletter]]s, which are then filed by law librarians under the appropriate topic headings for future reference.

One of the best-known looseleaf services, ''[[United States Law Week]]'', is of this type.  Most of the looseleaf services published by [[Bureau of National Affairs]] are newsletter-style.

==History==

Looseleaf service was invented by Richard Prentice Ettinger in 1914, founder of Prentice Hall. As a 19-year-old assistant to his [[Princeton University]] tax professor, he published the professor's book at his own risk. The first print run sold well and he ordered a second print run from an outside printing company. On the day that this second print run arrived, the [[United States Congress]] changed the tax law enough that the book was outdated. Faced with this challenge, Ettinger came up with the idea of cutting the pages (leaves) loose, replacing the few pages where changes in the tax code had occurred, drilling holes through the pages and putting them into a ring-binder. Even though it was more costly, it did have the benefit that future changes could easily be accommodated by simply exchanging a single leaf or group of pages.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

'''Marcus Junkelmann''' (* 2 October 1949 in [[Munich]]) is a German historian and experimental archeologist.

==Life and work==
Junkelmann started to study history at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1971 and in 1979 he received a PhD for a thesis on the military achievements of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian II]] (1662–1726) (original title: '' Kurfürst Max Emanuel von Bayern als Feldherr''). After that he worked as an associate member of staff at the university and for a military museum in [[Ingolstadt]].

In the 1980s Junkelmann became well known in Germany for his work in [[experimental archeology]]. He reconstructed and tested Roman weapons and army gear. In 1985 in connection with the 2000 year celebration of the city of [[Augsburg]] he organized a large [[Historical reenactment|experimental reenactment]] of the life and work conditions of [[Legionary|Roman legionaries]]. The experiment consisted of a month-long march from [[Verona]] to [[Augsburg]] including the crossing of the [[Alps]]. For the complete trip the original Roman army gear and equipment was used and the typical legionary tasks were performed. Later Junkelmann went on to perform a similar experiments for the Roman cavalry. He authored several books and documentaries on his archeological experiments. In 1997 he was awarded the [[Ceram Prize]] for his book on the nutrition of Roman soldiers (original title: ''Panis militaris: Die Ernährung des römischen Soldaten oder der Grundstoff der Macht'').

The '''mile''' is an [[English units of measurement|English unit]] of [[units of length|length]] of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s by [[international yard and pound|international agreement]] in 1959.

With [[qualifier]]s, "mile" is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the [[#Roman mile|Roman&amp;nbsp;mile]], such as the [[#Nautical mile|nautical&amp;nbsp;mile]] (now 1.852&amp;nbsp;km exactly), the [[#Italian mile|Italian&amp;nbsp;mile]] (roughly 1.852&amp;nbsp;km), and the [[li (unit)|Chinese&amp;nbsp;mile]] (now 500&amp;nbsp;m exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 [[roman feet]] but the greater importance of [[furlong]]s in [[Elizabethan era|pre-modern]] [[Kingdom of England|England]] meant that the [[#Statute mile|statute&amp;nbsp;mile]] was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit)|feet]] in 1593. This form of the mile then spread to the [[British Empire|British-colonized nations]] some of which continue to employ the mile. The [[United States Geological Survey|US Geological Survey]] now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its [[North American Datum|1927 geodetic datum]] has meant that a separate [[#U.S. survey mile|US&amp;nbsp;survey&amp;nbsp;mile]] ({{sfrac|6336|3937}}&amp;nbsp;km) continues to see some use. While most countries replaced the mile with the [[kilometre]] when switching to the [[International System of Units]], the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.

The mile was usually [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''m.''' in the past but is now sometimes written as '''mi''' to avoid confusion with the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[metre]]. However, derived units, such as [[miles per hour]] or [[miles per gallon]], continue to be universally abbreviated as '''mph''' and '''mpg''', respectively.

==Name {{anchor|Etymology}}==
The [[modern English]] word ''mile'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|myl}}'' and [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|mīl}}'', which was [[cognate]] with all other [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] terms for "miles". These derived from [[apocope|apocopated]] forms of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mīlia}}'' or ''{{lang|la|mīllia}}'', the plural of ''{{lang|la|mīle}}'' or ''{{lang|la|mīlle}}'',{{refn|group=n|[[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] miles probably derived from [[Middle Low German]], while the terms in [[Romance language]]s developed variously from the singular and plural Latin forms.{{sfnp|OED|2002|loc="mile, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''"}}}} literally "thousand" but used as a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipped]] form of ''{{lang|la|mīlle passus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|passuum}}'', the [[#Roman mile|Roman mile]] of one thousand [[pace (unit)|pace]]s.{{sfnp|OED|2002|loc="mile, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''"}}

The present [[#International mile|international mile]] is usually what is understood by the unqualified term "mile". When this distance needs to be distinguished from the [[#Nautical mile|nautical mile]], the international mile may also be described as a "land mile" or "statute mile".{{sfnp|AHD|2006|loc="mile, 1"}} In [[British English]], the "[[#Statute mile|statute mile]]" may refer to the present international miles or to any other form of [[#English mile|English mile]] since the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#16th century|1593 Act of Parliament]], which set it as a distance of 1,760&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s. Under [[American law]], however, the "statute mile" refers to the [[#U.S. survey mile|US survey mile]].{{sfnp|Thompson|2008|loc=B.6.}} Foreign and historical units translated into English as miles usually employ a [[qualifier]] to describe the kind of mile being used but this may be omitted if it is obvious from the context, such as a discussion of the 2nd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]] describing its distances in terms of "miles" rather than "Roman miles".

The mile has been variously abbreviated—with and without a trailing period—as '''m''', '''M''', '''ml''', and '''mi'''.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] now uses and recommends mi in order to avoid confusion with the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[metre]] (m) and [[millilitre]] (ml).{{sfnp|Butcher|2014|p=C-16}} However, derived units such as [[miles per hour]] or [[miles per gallon]] continue to be abbreviated as mph and mpg rather than mi/h and mi/gal. In the United Kingdom [[Road signs in the United Kingdom|road signs]] use '''m''' as the abbreviation for mile though height and width restrictions also use '''m''' as the abbreviation for the metre, which may be displayed alongside feet and inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/307152/draft-tsrgd-schedules.pdf| title=Road traffic: The traffic signs regulations and general directions 2015 | publisher= [[gov.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] style holds that "There is no acceptable abbreviation for 'miles'" and so it should be spelt out when used in describing areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130702112133541 "Numbers"] bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman mile===
The '''[[Roman units|Roman]] mile''' (''{{lang|la|{{linktext|mille passus}}}}'',&lt;!--see talk page--&gt; &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"thousand paces"; &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|abbr.|abbreviated}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''m.p.'''; also ''{{lang|la|milia passuum}}''{{refn|group=n|A [[partitive genitive]] construction literally meaning "one thousand of paces".{{sfnp|Lease|1905|p=211}} }} and ''{{lang|la|mille}}'') consisted of a thousand [[pace (unit)|pace]]s as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times. The [[ancient Roman]]s, marching [[Roman army|their armies]] through uncharted territory, would often push a carved stick in the ground after each 1,000 paces. Well-fed and harshly driven [[Roman legion]]aries in good weather thus created longer miles. The distance was indirectly standardised by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]'s establishment of a standard [[Roman foot]] (Agrippa's own) in 29 BC,{{sfnp|Soren|1999|p=184}} and the definition of a pace as 5&amp;nbsp;feet. An Imperial Roman mile thus denoted 5,000&amp;nbsp;[[Roman feet]]. [[Agrimensor|Surveyors]] and specialized equipment such as the [[decempeda]] and [[dioptra]] then spread its use.{{sfn|Shuttleworth}} In modern times, Agrippa's Imperial Roman mile was empirically estimated to have been about {{convert|1,617|yard|m}} in length.{{sfnp|Smith|1875|p=171}} In [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic areas]] of the Empire, the Roman mile ({{lang-grc-gre|μίλιον}}, ''mílion'') was used beside the native [[Greek units]] as equivalent to 8 [[stadia (unit)|stadia]] of 600 [[Greek feet]]. The ''mílion'' continued to be used as a [[Byzantine units|Byzantine unit]] and was also used as the name of the [[zero mile marker]] for the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Milion]], located at the head of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] near [[Hagia Sophia]].

The Roman mile also spread throughout Europe, with its local variations giving rise to the different units below.

Also arising from the Roman mile is the "milestone". All roads radiated out from the [[Roman Forum]] throughout the Empire – 50,000 miles of stone-paved roads. At every mile was placed a shaped stone, on which was carved a [[Roman numeral]], indicating the number of miles from the center of Rome – the Forum. Hence, one always knew how far one was from Rome.&lt;ref name="AdkinsAdkins2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lesley Adkins|author2=Roy A.

===Italian mile===
The '''[[Italian units|Italian]] mile''' (''{{lang|it|miglio}}'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|pl.|plural}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|it|miglia}}'') was traditionally considered a direct continuation of the Roman mile, equal to 1000 paces,&lt;ref name=demorgan/&gt; although [[Italian units of measurement#Length|its actual value over time or between regions]] could vary greatly.{{sfnp|Zupko|1981|loc="Miglio"}} It was often used in international contexts from the Middle Ages into the 17th century&lt;ref name=demorgan&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TFAwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA231 1].&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus also known as the "geographical mile",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SGwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 2].&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[geographical mile]] is now a separate standard unit.

The '''[[Arabic mile]]'''&lt;!-- See talk page. --&gt; ({{lang|ar|الميل}}, ''al-mīl'') was not the common [[Arabic unit]] of [[units of length|length]]; instead, [[Arabs]] and [[Persian people|Persians]] traditionally used the longer [[parasang]] or "Arabic [[league (unit)|league]]". The Arabic mile was, however, used by [[medieval Arab geographers|medieval geographers]] and scientists and constituted a kind of precursor to the [[#Nautical mile|nautical]] or [[geographical mile]]. It extended the Roman mile to fit an [[Arabian astronomy|astronomical]] approximation of 1 [[arcminute]] of [[latitude]] measured directly north-and-south along a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. Although the precise value of the approximation remains disputed, it was somewhere between 1.8 and 2.0&amp;nbsp;km.

====English mile====
{{see also|yard}}

The "'''old [[English units|English]] mile'''" of the [[medieval England|medieval]] and [[Early Modern England|early modern period]]s varied but seems to have measured about 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[#International mile|international&amp;nbsp;miles]] (1.9&amp;nbsp;km).{{sfnp|Andrews|2003|p=70}} The English long continued the Roman computations of the mile as 5000 [[foot (unit)|feet]], 1000 [[pace (unit)|paces]], or 8 longer divisions, which they equated with their "[[furrow]]'s length" or [[furlong]].{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}}

The origins of English units are "extremely vague and uncertain",{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} but seem to have been a combination of the [[Roman units|Roman system]] with native [[Welsh units|British]] and Germanic systems both derived from multiples of the [[barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]].{{refn|group=n|The {{c.|lk=no|1300}} [[Composition of Yards and Perches]], a [[statutes of uncertain date|statute of uncertain date]] usually reckoned as an enactment of [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]{{sfn|NPL}} or [[Edward II of England|II]],{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} notionally continued to derive English units from three barleycorns "dry and round" to the [[inch]]{{sfn|NPL}} and this statute remained in force until the 1824 [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] establishing the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]]. In practice, official measures were verified using the standards at the Exchequer or simply ignored.{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=37}}}} Probably by the reign of [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] in the 10th century, the nominal [[prototype]] [[standard (metrology)|physical standard]] of English length was an [[arm]]-length [[iron]] bar (a [[yard]]stick) held by the [[kings of England|king]] at [[Winchester]];{{sfn|NPL}}{{sfnp|Chisolm|1864|p=8}} the foot was then one-third of its length. [[Henry I of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;I]] was said to have made a new standard in 1101 based on his own arm.&lt;!--Sic. No nose involved.--&gt;{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} Following the issuance of [[Magna Carta]], the [[baron (UK)|baron]]s of [[English Parliament|Parliament]] directed [[John Lackland|John]] and his son to keep the [[list of English kings|king]]'s standard measure (''{{lang|la|Mensura Domini Regis}}'') and [[Troy pound|weight]] at the [[Exchequer]],{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=8}} which thereafter verified local standards until its abolition in the 19th century. New [[brass]] standards are known to have been constructed under [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]].{{sfnp|Chisholm|1864|p=4}}

Arnold's {{c.|lk=no|1500}} ''Customs of London'' recorded a mile shorter than previous ones, coming to 0.947&amp;nbsp;international&amp;nbsp;miles or 1.524&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}}

{{anchor|Statute mile}} &lt;!--linked from statute mile, land miles, etc. so kindly maintain anchor link.--&gt;
The English '''statute mile''' was established by a [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures]] [[Act of Parliament]] in 1593 during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]]. The act on the [[Composition of Yards and Perches]] had shortened the length of the foot and its associated measures, causing the two methods of determining the mile to diverge.{{sfnp|Zupko|1977|pp=10–11, 20–21}} Owing to the importance of the surveyor's [[rod (unit)|rod]] in deeds and [[surveying]] undertaken under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]],{{sfnp|Burke|1978|loc=Ch.&amp;nbsp;9}} decreasing the length of the rod by {{frac|1|11}} would have amounted to a significant [[land tax|tax]] increase. Parliament instead opted to maintain the mile of 8 [[furlongs]] (which were derived from the rod) and to increase the number of feet per mile from the old Roman value.{{sfnp|Adams|1990}} The applicable passage of the statute reads: "A Mile shall contain eight Furlongs, every Furlong forty Poles,{{refn|group=n|"Pole" being another name for the [[rod (unit)|rod]].}} and every Pole shall contain sixteen Foot and {{not a typo|an}} half."{{refn|Act 35 {{abbr|Eliz.&amp;nbsp;I|Elizabeth I}} {{abbr|cap.|Chapter}} 6, {{abbr|s.|section}} 8.&lt;ref name="statutes at large"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes at large from the first year of King Edward the fourth to the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=29 November 2011|volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;II |year=1763|page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The statute mile therefore contained 5,280&amp;nbsp;feet or 1,760&amp;nbsp;yards.{{sfnp|Klein|1988|p=69}} The distance was not uniformly adopted. [[Robert Morden]] had multiple scales on his 17th-century maps which included continuing local values: his map of [[Hampshire]], for example, bore two different "miles" with a ratio of {{nowrap|1&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.23}}{{sfnp|Norgate|1998}} and his map of [[Dorset]] had three scales with a ratio of {{nowrap|1&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.23&amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp;1.41}}.{{sfnp|Morden|1695}} In both cases, the traditional local units remained longer than the statute mile.

====Welsh mile====
The '''[[Welsh units|Welsh]]&amp;nbsp;mile''' (''{{lang|cy|milltir}}'' or ''{{lang|cy|milldir}}'') was 3&amp;nbsp;[[#International mile|mile]]s and 1470&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s long (6.17&amp;nbsp;km). It comprised 9000&amp;nbsp;[[pace (unit)|pace]]s (''{{lang|cy|cam}}''), each of 3&amp;nbsp;[[Welsh feet]] (''{{lang|cy|troedfedd}}'') of 9&amp;nbsp;inches,{{sfnp|Owen|1841|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zYZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90 Book&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;XVII, §5]}} usually reckoned as equivalent to the English inch. Along with other [[Welsh units]], it was said to have been [[Molmutine Laws|codified]] under [[Dyfnwal Moelmud|Dyfnwal the Bald and Silent]] and [[Laws of Hywel Dda|retained unchanged]] by [[Hywel Dda|Hywel the Good]].{{sfnp|Owen|1841|loc=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zYZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 Book&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;XVII, §2]}} Along with other Welsh units, it was discontinued following the [[Edwardian Conquest of Wales|conquest]] of [[Principality of Wales|Wales]] by the English under [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]] in the 13th century.

====Scots mile====
[[File:Edinburgh High Street.JPG|thumb|[[Edinburgh]]'s "[[Royal Mile]]"—running from [[Edinburgh Castle|the castle]] to [[Holyrood Abbey]]—is roughly a Scots mile&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Edinburgh 2000 visitors' guide|publisher=Collins|year=1999|page=31|isbn=978-0-004-49017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''[[Scots units|Scots]] mile''' was longer than the English mile,&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=mile |title= [[Dictionary of the Scottish Language]] – [[Scottish National Dictionary]] |chapterurl=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=1982&amp;startset=25361793&amp;query=MILE&amp;fhit=mile&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd#fhit }}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned by [[Robert Burns]] in the first verse of his poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]". It comprised 8&amp;nbsp;(Scots)&amp;nbsp;furlongs divided into 320&amp;nbsp;[[fall (Scots)|fall]]s or faws (Scots [[rod (unit)|rod]]s).&lt;ref name="DOST"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=fall, faw |title=Dictionary of the Scottish Language – [[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]] |chapterurl=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=fall&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It varied from place to place but the most accepted equivalencies are 1,976&amp;nbsp;[[Imperial system|Imperial]]&amp;nbsp;[[yard]]s (1.123 [[statute mile]]s or 1.81&amp;nbsp;km).

It was legally abolished three times: first by a 1685 act of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]],&lt;ref name="1685-4-83"&gt;"[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/83 Act for a standard of miles]" (June 16, 1685). ''APS'' '''viii''': 494, c.59. ''[[Records of the Parliaments of Scotland|RPS]]'' 1685/4/83.&lt;/ref&gt; again by the 1707 [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1706/10/257 Union with England Act 1707 (c.&amp;nbsp;7)], art.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]].&lt;ref name="SNL" /&gt; It had continued in use as a customary unit through the 18th century but had become obsolete by its final abolition.

====Irish mile====
{{Main|Irish mile}}

The '''Irish mile''' (''{{lang|ga|míle}}'' or ''{{lang|ga|míle Gaelach}}'') measured 2240 yards: approximately 1.27 statute miles or 2.048 kilometres.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc=[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictI.html "Irish mile"]}}&lt;ref name=OSIfaq&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx#faq7 |accessdate=February 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228155031/http://www.osi.ie/en/faq/faq3.aspx |archivedate=February 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in Ireland from the [[Plantations of Ireland|16th century plantations]] until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on "[[Imperial measure|English measure]]" but used a [[linear perch]] measuring {{convert|7|yard|metre}} as opposed to the English [[Rod (unit)|rod]] of {{convert|5.5|yard|metre}}.&lt;ref name=OSIfaq /&gt;

* The '''Dutch mile''' (''{{lang|nl|Mijl}}'') has had different definitions throughout history. One of the older definitions was 5600 [[ell]]s. But the length of an ell was not standardised, so that the length of a mile could range between 3280&amp;nbsp;m and 4280&amp;nbsp;m. The Dutch mile also has had historical definitions of one hour's walking (''{{lang|nl|Uur gaans}}''), which meant around 5&amp;nbsp;km, or 20,000 Amsterdam or Rhineland feet (respectively 5660&amp;nbsp;m or 6280&amp;nbsp;m). Besides the common Dutch mile, there is also the geographical mile. 15 geographical Dutch miles equal one degree of [[longitude]] on the [[equator]]. Its value changed as the circumference of the earth was estimated to a better precision. But at the time of usage, it was around 7157&amp;nbsp;m. The metric system was introduced in the Netherlands in 1816, and the metric mile became a synonym for the kilometer, being exactly 1000&amp;nbsp;m. Since 1870, the term "mile" was replaced by the equivalent "kilometer". Today, the word "mile" is no longer used, apart from some old proverbs.
{{anchor|German mile|Austrian mile|Danish mile}}
* The '''German mile''' (''{{lang|de|Meile}}'') was 24,000 German feet. The standardised '''Austrian mile''' used in southern Germany and the [[Austrian Empire]] was 7.586&amp;nbsp;km; the '''Prussian mile''' used in northern Germany was 7.5325&amp;nbsp;km. Following its standardisation by [[Ole Rømer]] in the late 17th century, the '''Danish mile''' (''{{lang|da|mil}}'') was precisely equal to the Prussian mile and likewise divided into 24,000 feet.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}} These were sometimes treated as equivalent to 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. Earlier values had varied: the ''Sjællandske miil'', for instance, had been 11.13&amp;nbsp;km. The Germans also used a longer version of the [[#Geographical mile|geographical mile]].
* The '''Saxon Post mile''' (''{{lang|de|kursächsische Postmeile}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Polizeimeile}}'', introduced on occasion of a survey of the Saxon roads in the 1700s, corresponded to 2000 Dresden [[rod (unit)|rods]], equivalent to 9.062 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.poststrassen-erleben.de/geschichten/historie-der-postsaeulen.html | title = Historie der Postsäulen | publisher = Forschungsgruppe Kursächsische Postmeilensäulen e.V. und 1.

* The '''[[Croatian mile]]''' (''{{lang|hr|hrvatska milja}}''), first devised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Stjepan Glavač]] on a 1673 map, is the length of an arc of the equator subtended by {{sfrac|10}}° or 11.13&amp;nbsp;km exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://public.carnet.hr/zuh/do1874/nv17/nv17_11.htm "Centuries of Natural Science in Croatia : Theory and Application"].

* The '''[[Ottoman units of measurement|Ottoman mile]]''' was 1,894.35 m (1.17709&amp;nbsp;mi), which was equal to 5,000 Ottoman foot. After 1933, the Ottoman mile was replaced with the modern Turkish mile (1,853.181&amp;nbsp;m).

==International mile==
The '''international mile''' is precisely equal to '''{{val|1.609344|u=km}}''' (or {{sfrac|25146|15625}}&amp;nbsp;km as a fraction).{{refn|1,760&amp;nbsp;yards&amp;nbsp;× 0.9144 m/yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72/schedules |title=Weights &amp; Measures Act of 1985 |contribution=Schedule&amp;nbsp;I, Part&amp;nbsp;VI }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was established as part of the 1959 [[international yard and pound]] agreement reached by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and [[South Africa]],{{sfnp|Barbrow|1976|pp=16–17, 20}} which resolved small but measurable differences that had arisen from separate physical standards each country had maintained for the yard.{{sfnp|Bigg|1964}} As with the earlier [[#Statute mile|statute mile]], it continues to comprise 1,760 yards or 5,280 feet.

The old Imperial value of the yard was used in converting measurements to metric values in India in a 1976 Act of the Indian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091112174359/http://202.54.104.236/intranet/eip/legislation/uploads/THE%20STANDARDS%20OF%20WEIGHTS%20AND%20MEASURES%20ACT%201976.pdf Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current National Topographic Database of the [[Survey of India]] is based on the metric [[WGS-84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Survey of India]], "[http://www.surveyofindia.gov.in/tenders/nationalmappolicy/nationalmappolicy.pdf National Map Policy&amp;nbsp;– 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331035549/http://www.surveyofindia.gov.in/tenders/nationalmappolicy/nationalmappolicy.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used by the [[Global Positioning System]].

The difference from the previous standards was 2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]], or about 3.2&amp;nbsp;millimeters ({{frac|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch) per mile. The U.S. standard was slightly longer and the old Imperial standards had been slightly shorter than the international mile. When the international mile was introduced in English-speaking countries, the basic [[geodetic datum]] in America was the [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD27). This had been constructed by [[triangulation]] based on the definition of the foot in the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, with 1&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1200|3937}}&amp;nbsp;metres and the definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the ''U.S. survey foot'' to distinguish it from the international foot.{{sfnp|Astin|1959}}&lt;ref group="n"&gt;When reading the document it helps to bear in mind that 999,998 = 3,937 × 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking countries until the [[international yard and pound]] agreement in 1959 established the yard as exactly 0.9144&amp;nbsp;metres, giving a mile exactly 1,609.344&amp;nbsp;metres. The U.S. adopted this international mile for most purposes, but retained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the ''U. S. survey mile''. In the United States, ''statute mile'' normally refers to the survey mile,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convertunits.com/from/mile+%5Bstatute%5D/to/mile+%5Bstatute,+US%5D Convert mile &amp;#91;statute&amp;#93; to mile &amp;#91;statute, US&amp;#93;] "1 metre is equal to {{val|0.000621371192237}} mile [statute], or {{val|0.000621369949495}} mile [statute, US]. ... The U.S. statute mile (or survey mile) is defined by the survey foot. This is different from the international statute mile, which is defined as exactly 1609.344 meters. The U.S. statute mile is defined as 5,280 U.S. survey feet, which is around {{val|1609.347219}} meters."&lt;/ref&gt; about 3.219&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch) longer than the international mile (the international mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the U.S. survey mile).

Canadian railways have not been metricated and therefore continue to measure trackage in miles and speed in miles per hour.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hastingspark.com/racing/factbook.aspx Hastings Racecourse Fact Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172501/http://www.hastingspark.com/racing/factbook.aspx |date=2012-04-18 }} Like Canadian railways, Canadian race tracks etc, have not been metricated and continue to measure distance in miles, furlongs, and yards (see page 18 of the fact book).&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. survey mile==
The ''U.S. survey mile'' is 5,280 survey feet, or about 1,609.347&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/document-2382].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ''statute mile'' formally refers to the survey mile,{{sfnp|Thompson|2008|loc=B.6.}} but for most purposes, the difference between the survey mile and the international mile is insignificant—one international mile is {{val|0.999998}} U.S. survey miles—so ''statute mile'' can be used for either. But in some cases, such as in the U.S. [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles,&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title = What are the 'official' conversions that are used by NGS to convert 1) metres to inches, and 2) metres to feet? | url = http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#Feet | id = Frequently Asked Questions about the National Geodetic Survey | author =U.S. National Geodetic Survey| accessdate = May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accumulated difference ''can be'' significant, so it is important to note that the reference is to the U.S. survey mile.

The United States redefined its yard in 1893, but this resulted in U.S. and Imperial measures of distance having very slightly different lengths.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which replaced the NAD27, is defined in meters. State Plane Coordinate Systems were then updated, but the [[National Geodetic Survey]] left individual states to decide which (if any) definition of the foot they would use. All State Plane Coordinate Systems are defined in meters, and 42 of the 50 states only use the metre-based State Plane Coordinate Systems. However, eight states also have State Plane Coordinate Systems defined in feet, seven of them in U.S. Survey feet and one in international feet.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

State legislation in the U.S. is important for determining which conversion factor from the metric datum is to be used for land surveying and real estate transactions, even though the difference (2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) is hardly significant, given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures be based on the U.S. survey foot, eight have legislated that they be based on the international foot, and eighteen have not specified which conversion factor to use.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

==Nautical mile==
[[File:RechtwKugeldreieck.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|'''On the utility of the nautical mile.'''&lt;br&gt;Each circle shown is a [[great circle]]—the analog of a line in spherical trigonometry—and hence the shortest path connecting two points on the globular surface. [[Meridian (geography)|Meridians]] are great circles that pass through the poles.]]
{{Main|Nautical mile}}

The ''nautical mile'' was originally defined as one [[minute of arc]] along a [[Meridian arc|meridian]] of the Earth.{{sfnp|Maloney|1978|p=34}} Navigators use dividers to step off the distance between two points on the navigational chart, then place the open dividers against the minutes-of-latitude scale at the edge of the chart, and read off the distance in nautical miles.{{sfnp|Maloney|1978|pp=34–35}} The Earth is not perfectly spherical but an [[oblate spheroid]], so the length of a minute of latitude increases by 1% from the equator to the poles. Using the [[World Geodetic System|WGS84 ellipsoid]], the commonly accepted Earth model for many purposes today, one minute of latitude at the WGS84 equator is 6,046 feet and at the poles is 6,107.5 feet. The average is about 6,076 feet (about 1,852 metres or 1.15 statute miles).

In the United States, the nautical mile was defined in the 19th century as 6,080.2&amp;nbsp;feet (1,853.249&amp;nbsp;m), whereas in the United Kingdom, the ''Admiralty nautical mile'' was defined as 6,080&amp;nbsp;feet (1,853.184&amp;nbsp;m) and was about one minute of latitude in the latitudes of the south of the UK. Other nations had different definitions of the nautical mile, but it is now internationally defined to be exactly {{convert|1,852|m|ft|8|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related nautical units===
The nautical mile per hour is known as the [[Knot (unit)|knot]]. Nautical miles and knots are almost universally used for aeronautical and maritime navigation, because of their relationship with degrees and minutes of latitude and the convenience of using the latitude scale on a map for distance measuring.

The [[data mile]] is used in [[radar]]-related subjects and is equal to 6,000 feet (1.8288 kilometres).{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="data mile"}} The [[radar mile]] is a unit of time (in the same way that the [[light year]] is a unit of distance), equal to the time required for a radar pulse to travel a distance of two miles (one mile each way). Thus, the radar statute mile is 10.8&amp;nbsp;μs and the radar nautical mile is 12.4&amp;nbsp;μs.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="radar mile"}}

==Geographical mile==
{{Main|Geographical mile}}

The [[geographical mile]] is based upon the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[latitude]]. The German geographical mile ({{lang|de|geographische Meile}}) was previously {{frac|15}}° of latitude (7.4127&amp;nbsp;km).{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="meile"}}

==Grid system==
[[Cities]] in the continental United States often have [[street]]s laid out by miles. [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Chicago]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Miami]], are several examples. Typically the largest streets are about a mile apart, with others at smaller intervals. In the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City "streets" are close to 20 per mile, while the major numbered "avenues" are about six per mile. (Centerline to centerline, 42nd Street to 22nd Street is supposed to be 5250 feet while 42nd Street to 62nd Street is supposed to be {{clarify|date=May 2014}} 5276&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in.){{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Metric mile==
{{Main|Metric mile}}

The informal term "[[metric mile]]" is used in sports such as [[track and field athletics]] and [[speed skating]] to denote a distance of {{convert|1500|metres|feet|0}}. In United States high-school competition, the term is sometimes used for a race of {{convert|1600|metres|feet|0}}.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mile"}}

==Scandinavian mile==
{{Main|Scandinavian mile}}

The '''[[Scandinavian mile]]''' (''{{lang|no|mil}}'') remains in common use in Norway and Sweden, where it has meant precisely 10&amp;nbsp;km since metrication occurred in 1889.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}} It is used in informal situations and in measurements of fuel consumption, which are often given as litres per ''{{lang|no|mil}}''. In formal situations (such as official road signs) and where confusion may occur with [[#International mile|international mile]]s, it is avoided in favour of kilometres.

The '''Swedish&amp;nbsp;mile''' was standardised as 36,000 Swedish feet or 10.687&amp;nbsp;km in 1649; before that it varied by [[provinces of Sweden|province]] from about 6 to 14.485&amp;nbsp;km.{{sfnp|Rowlett|2005|loc="mil 4"}}

Before metrication, the '''Norwegian&amp;nbsp;mile''' was 11.298&amp;nbsp;km.

The traditional Finnish ''{{lang|fi|peninkulma}}'' was translated as ''{{lang|sv|mil}}'' in Swedish and also set equal to 10&amp;nbsp;km during metrication in 1887, but is much less commonly used.

==Comparison table==
A comparison of the different lengths for a "mile", in different countries and at different times in history, is given in the table below. [[League (unit)|League]]s are also included in this list because, in terms of length, they fall in between the short West European miles and the long North, Central and Eastern European miles.

==Idioms==
Even in English-speaking countries that have moved from the Imperial to the metric system (for example, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand), the mile is still used in a variety of [[idioms]]. These include:
* A ''[[wikt:country mile|country mile]]'' is used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] to denote a very long distance.
* ''"A miss is as good as a mile"'' (failure by a narrow margin is no better than any other failure)
* ''"Give him an inch and he'll take a mile"''&amp;nbsp;– a corruption of ''"Give him an inch and he'll take an [[ell]]"''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (5th edition; 1964).

* ''"Missed by a mile"'' (missed by a wide margin)
* ''"Go a mile a minute"'' (move very quickly)
* ''"Talk a mile a minute"'' (speak at a rapid rate)
* ''"To go the extra mile"'' (to put in extra effort)
* ''"Miles away"'' (lost in thought, or daydreaming)
* ''"[[Milestone]]"'' (an event indicating significant progress)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical references in Europe]]
In the [[British Isles]], an '''ordnance datum''' or '''OD''' is a [[Geodetic_system#Vertical_data|vertical datum]] used by an ordnance survey as the basis for deriving altitudes on [[map]]s.  A [[spot height]] may be expressed as '''AOD''' for "above ordnance datum".  Usually mean sea level (MSL) is used for the datum.  In particular:

* In Great Britain, OD for the [[Ordnance Survey]] is '''ODN''' ('''Ordnance Datum Newlyn'''), defined as the MSL at [[Newlyn]] in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921. Prior to 1921, OD was taken from the level of the [[Victoria Dock (Liverpool)|Victoria Dock, Liverpool]] ('''ODL'''). The difference between the different data varies across the country; full details are available from the Ordnance Survey website (below).
* In [[Northern Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] is '''Belfast Ordnance Datum''', the MSL at Clarendon Dock, [[Belfast]] between 1951 and 1956.
* In the [[Republic of Ireland]], OD for the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] is '''Malin Ordnance Datum''': the MSL at Portmoor Pier, [[Malin Head]], [[County Donegal]], between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref name="osi"&gt;[http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp Irish Grid Reference System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614230048/http://www.osi.ie/gps/overview/irishgrid.asp |date=2008-06-14 }} from OSI website&lt;/ref&gt;
** Prior to 1970, '''Poolbeg Ordnance Datum''' was used: the low water of [[spring tide]] at [[Poolbeg Lighthouse]], Dublin, on 8 April 1837.  Poolbeg OD was about 2.7 metres (9 feet) lower than Malin OD.&lt;ref name="osi"/&gt;

==Tunnel datum==
'''Tunnel datum''' is a datum based on an ordnance datum and used in designing tunnels which pass below sea level.
* for the [[London Underground]], a tunnel datum of ODN -100 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/victoria-Environmental-Statement-Main-Report.pdf|title=Victoria Station Upgrade Environmental Statement: Main Report |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |pages=2–6; §2.5.4, fn 2 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60m AOD is 40m ATD (above tunnel datum)
* for the [[Channel Tunnel]], a tunnel datum of ODN &amp;minus;200 m is used;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Radcliffe |first=Eric |title=Engineering the Channel Tunnel |editor=Colin J Kirkland |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |chapter=Control and Construction Surveys |isbn=0-419-17920-8 |page=53 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; thus a depth of &amp;minus;60 m is 140 m ATD

Scutari was born in the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbereshe]] [[San Costantino Albanese]] in the [[Province of Potenza]], southern [[Italy]] in 1952. He graduated from the "Istituto Magistrale di Lagonegro" and later he enrolled in the Faculty of Philology of the [[University of Bari]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="UC"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As a very fond of [[Arbereshe language]] person, he has participated in many convents and seminars, between others "La diversità linguistica, patrimonio culturale della Basilicata" (The linguistic diversity, cultural patrimony of Basilicata), held in San Costantino Albanese in 2004. 
&lt;br&gt;He received a docent title from the [[University of Basilicata]] in 2003 with the title "Operatore linguistico e culturale di area arbëreshe" (Linguistic and cultural operator in the Arbereshe area). Scutari is a collaborator of the [[periodical]] ''Bashkia'' (The municipality), cultural section, issued by the Municipality of S.Constantino Albanese.
&lt;br&gt;Scutari is the author of many studies and [[monograph]]s on the [[Albanian dialects]] of Italy.&lt;ref name="UC"&gt;{{citation| language=Italian| url=http://www.albanologia.unical.it/BibliotecaSKO/PasqualeScutari.html| publisher=University of Calabria| title=AUTORI E STUDIOSI LOCALI |trans-title=Local authors and researchers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Phonological awareness involves the detection and manipulation of sounds at three levels of sound structure: (1) [[syllables]], (2) [[Syllable onset|onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s, and (3) [[phoneme]]s. Awareness of these sounds is demonstrated through a variety of tasks (see below). Available published tests of phonological awareness (for example PhAB2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbs|first1=Simon|last2=Bodman|first2=Sue|title=PhAB2|date=2014|publisher=GL Assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are often used by teachers, psychologists and speech therapists to help understand difficulties in this aspect of language and literacy. Although the tasks vary, they share the basic requirement that some operation (e.g., identifying, comparing, separating, combining, generating) be performed on the sounds. It is assumed that the individual performing these tasks must have awareness of the units of sound in order to perform the operation.

Phonological awareness is one component of a larger phonological processing system used for speaking and listening.&lt;ref name="Catts &amp; Kamhi (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner &amp; Torgesen (1987)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993)" /&gt; Phonological awareness is different from other phonological abilities in that it is a [[metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] skill, requiring conscious awareness and reflection on the structure of language.&lt;ref name="Gillon (2004)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mattingly (1972)" /&gt; Other phonological abilities: such as attending to speech, discriminating between sounds, holding sounds in memory: can be performed without conscious reflection. However, these other phonological abilities are prerequisite to the development of phonological awareness. Therefore, general listening skills are often among those included in phonological awareness instruction.

The terms ''[[phonemic awareness]]'' and ''[[phonics]]'' are often used interchangeably with phonological awareness. However, these terms have different meanings. Phonemic awareness is a subset of phonological awareness that focuses specifically on recognizing and manipulating phonemes, the smallest units of sound. Phonics requires students to know and match letters or letter patterns with sounds, learn the rules of spelling, and use this information to decode (read) and encode (write) words. Phonemic awareness relates only to speech sounds, not to alphabet letters or sound-spellings, so it is not necessary for students to have alphabet knowledge in order to develop a basic phonemic awareness of language.

Phonological awareness tasks (adapted from Virginia Department of Education (1998):&lt;ref name="Virginia Department of Education (1998)" /&gt; and Gillon (2004)&lt;ref name="Gillon (2004)" /&gt;

; Listening skills:
The ability to attend to and distinguish environmental and speech sounds from one another&lt;ref name="Virginia Department of Education (1998)" /&gt;
* Alertness: Awareness and localization of sounds
* Discrimination: Recognize same/different sounds
* Memory: Recollection of sounds and sound patterns
* Sequencing: Identify order of what was heard
* Figure-ground: Isolate one sound from background of other sounds
* Perception: Comprehension of sounds heard

; Syllable-structure awareness tasks:
* Syllable segmentation: e.g., "How many syllables (or parts) are in the word ''coffee''?"&lt;ref name="(Dodd, Holm, Oerlemans, &amp; McCormick (1996)" /&gt;
* Syllable completion: e.g., "Here is a picture of a rabbit. I'll say the first part of the word. Can you finish the word ''ra_____''?"&lt;ref name="(Muter, Hulme, &amp; Snowling (1997)" /&gt;
* Syllable identity: e.g., "Which part of ''complete'' and ''compare'' sound the same?"&lt;ref name="(Dodd, Holm, Oerlemans, &amp; McCormick (1996)" /&gt;
* Syllable deletion: e.g., "Say ''finish''. Now say it again without the ''fin''"&lt;ref name="Rosner (1999)" /&gt;

; Onset-rime awareness tasks:
* Spoken word recognition: e.g., "Do these words rhyme: ''shell bell''?"&lt;ref name="(Dodd, Holm, Oerlemans, &amp; McCormick (1996)" /&gt;
* Spoken rhyme detection or rhyme oddity task: e.g., "Which word does not rhyme: ''fish, dish, hook''?" &lt;ref name="Bradley &amp; Bryant (1983)" /&gt;
* Spoken rhyme generation: e.g., "Tell me words that rhyme with ''bell''?"&lt;ref name="(Muter, Hulme, &amp; Snowling (1997)" /&gt;
* Onset-rime blending &lt;ref name="Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993)" /&gt;

; Phonemic awareness tasks:
* Alliteration awareness (aka phoneme detection and sound or phoneme categorization): e.g., "Which word has a different first sound: ''bed, bus, chair, ball''?"&lt;ref name="Torgesen &amp; Bryant (1994)" /&gt;
* Phoneme matching: e.g., "Which word begins with the same sound as ''bat'': ''horn, bed, cup''?" &lt;ref name="Torgesen &amp; Bryant (1994)" /&gt;
* Phoneme isolation: e.g., "Tell me the sound you hear at the beginning of the word ''food''" &lt;ref name="Stahl &amp; Murray (1994)" /&gt;
* Phoneme completion: e.g., "Here is a picture of a watch. Finish the word for me: ''wa''_____ "&lt;ref name="(Muter, Hulme, &amp; Snowling (1997)" /&gt;
* Phoneme blending with words or non-words: e.g., "What word do these sounds make: ''m...oo...n''?" &lt;ref name="Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993)" /&gt;
* Phoneme deletion, also referred to as phoneme elision: e.g., "Say ''coat''. Now say it again but don't say /k/"&lt;ref name="Rosner (1999)" /&gt;
* Phoneme segmentation with words or non-words: e.g., "How many sounds can you hear in the word ''it''?&lt;ref name="(Dodd, Holm, Oerlemans, &amp; McCormick (1996)" /&gt;
* Phoneme reversal: e.g., "Say ''na'' (as in ''nap''). Now say na backwards"&lt;ref name="Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, &amp; Rashotte, 1993)" /&gt;
* Phoneme manipulation: e.g., "Say ''dash''. Now say it again, but instead of /æ/ say /I/"&lt;ref name="Rosner (1999)" /&gt;
* Spoonerism: e.g., ''felt made'' becomes ''melt fade''&lt;ref name="(Dodd, Holm, Oerlemans, &amp; McCormick (1996)" /&gt;

== Development ==

Although some two-year-old children demonstrate phonological awareness, for most children, phonological awareness appears in the third year, with accelerating growth through the fourth and fifth years.&lt;ref name="Dodd &amp; Gillon (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillon &amp; Schwarz (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maclean, Bryant, &amp; Bradley (1987)" /&gt; Phonological awareness skills develop in a predictable pattern similar across languages progressing from larger to smaller units of sound (that is, from words to syllables to onsets and syllable rimes to phonemes).&lt;ref name="Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cisero &amp; Royer, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caravolas &amp; Bruck (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaney (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox &amp; Routh (1975)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson, Anderson, &amp; Hololigan (1996)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanovich, Cunningham, &amp; Cramer (1984)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Treiman &amp; Zukowsky (1991)" /&gt; Tasks used to demonstrate awareness of these sounds have their own developmental sequence. For example, tasks involving the detection of similar or dissimilar sounds (e.g., oddity tasks) are mastered before tasks requiring the manipulation of sounds (e.g., deletion tasks), and blending tasks are mastered before segmenting tasks.&lt;ref name="Anthony, Lonigan, Driscoll, Phillips &amp; Burgess (2003)" /&gt; It should be noted that the acquisition of phonological awareness skills does not progress in a linear sequence; rather, children continue to refine skills they have acquired while they learn new skills.&lt;ref name="Anthony, Lonigan, Driscoll, Phillips &amp; Burgess (2003)" /&gt;

The development of phonological awareness is closely tied to overall language and speech development. Vocabulary size, as well as other measures of receptive and expressive semantics, syntax, and morphology, are consistent concurrent and longitudinal predictors of phonological awareness.&lt;ref name="Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaney (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper, Roth, Speece, &amp; Schatschneider (2002)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickinson, McCabe, Anastasopoulos, Peisner-Feinberg, &amp; Poe (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rvachew (2006)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rvachew &amp; Grawburg (2006)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Tager-Flusberg (1982)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walley, Metsala, &amp; Garlock (2003)" /&gt; Consistent with this finding, children with communication disorders often have poor phonological awareness.&lt;ref name="Boudreau &amp; Hedberg (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamhi &amp; Koenig (1985)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamhi, Lee, &amp; Nelson (1985)" /&gt;

[[Phonological development]] and articulatory accuracy is often correlated to phonological awareness skills, both for children with typical speech&lt;ref name="Carroll, Snowling, Hulme, &amp; Stevenson (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foy &amp; Mann (2001)" /&gt; and those with disordered speech.&lt;ref name="Rvachew, Ohberg, Grawberg, &amp; Heyding, (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrivee &amp; Catts (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster &amp; Plante (1992)" /&gt; In addition to milestones of speech and language development, speech and language processing abilities are also related to phonological awareness: both speech perception&lt;ref name="Rvachew (2006)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McBride-Chang (1995)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nittrouer (1996)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nittrouer &amp; Burton (2005)" /&gt; and verbal short-term memory&lt;ref name="McBride-Chang (1995)" /&gt; have been concurrently and predicatively correlated with phonological awareness abilities.

== Phonological awareness and reading ==

Phonological awareness is an important determiner of success in learning to read and spell. For most children, strong readers have strong phonological awareness, and poor readers have poor phonological awareness skills.&lt;ref name="Ehri et al. (2001)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (2000a)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (2000b)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Torgesen, Wagner, and Rashotte (1994)" /&gt; Phonological awareness skills in the preschool and kindergarten years also strongly predict how well a child will read in the school years.&lt;ref name="Bradley &amp; Bryant (1983)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lundberg, Olofsson, &amp; Wall (1980)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberman, Shankweiler, &amp; Liberman (1989)" /&gt; In addition, interventions to improve phonological awareness abilities lead to significantly improved reading abilities.&lt;ref name="Bradley &amp; Bryant (1983)" /&gt; Phonological awareness instruction improves reading and spelling skills, but the reverse is also true: literacy instruction improves phonological awareness skills.&lt;ref name="Burgess &amp; Lonigan (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perfetti, Beck, Bell, &amp; Hughes (1987)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bus &amp; Van IJzendoorn (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Troia, (1999)" /&gt; The relationship between phonological awareness and reading abilities changes over time.&lt;ref name="Development of Phonemes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazan|first=Valerie|author2=Barrett|title=The Development of Phonemic Categorization in Children aged 6-12|journal=Journal of Phonetics|year=2000|volume=28|pages=377–396|doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0121|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/val/jphon%20hazan%20and%20barrett.pdf|accessdate=29 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905172519/http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/val/jphon%20hazan%20and%20barrett.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of phonological awareness ability (syllable, onset-rhyme, and phoneme) contribute to reading abilities in the Kindergarten through second grade.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Bradley, Maclean &amp; Crossland (1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Engen &amp; Hoien (2002)" /&gt; However, beyond the second grade, phoneme-level abilities play a stronger role.&lt;ref name="Muter, Hulme, Snowling, &amp; Taylor (1997)" /&gt;

Phonological awareness and literacy is often explained by decoding and encoding.&lt;ref name="Gillon (2004)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harm &amp; Seidenberg (1999)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, Haller (1993)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehri (1992)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenberg &amp; McClelland (1989)" /&gt; In reading, decoding refers to the process of relating a word's written representation to its verbal representation. Especially in the early stages of reading, decoding involves mapping letters in the word to their corresponding sounds, and then combining those sounds to form a verbal word. Encoding: a process used in spelling: is similar, although the process goes in the opposite direction, with the word's verbal representation is encoded in a written form. Again, especially in the early stages of reading, encoding involves determining the sounds in a verbal word, and then mapping those sounds onto a letter sequence in order to spell out the written word. In both encoding and decoding, phonological awareness is needed because the child must know the sounds in the words in order to relate them to the letter sounds.

== Intervention ==

Phonological awareness is an auditory skill that is developed through a variety of activities that expose students to the sound structure of the language and teach them to recognize, identify and manipulate it. Listening skills are an important foundation for the development of phonological awareness and they generally develop first.&lt;ref name="Virginia Department of Education (1998)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurtz (2010)" /&gt; Therefore, the scope and sequence of instruction in early childhood literacy curriculum typically begins with a focus on listening, as teachers instruct children to attend to and distinguish sounds, including environmental sounds and the sounds of speech. Early phonological awareness instruction also involves the use of songs, nursery rhymes and games to help students to become alert to speech sounds and rhythms, rather than meanings, including [[rhyme]], [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. While exposure to different sound patterns in songs and rhymes is a start towards developing phonological awareness, exposure in itself is not enough, because the traditional actions that go along with songs and nursery rhymes typically focus on helping students to understand the meanings of words, not attend to the sounds. Therefore, different strategies must be implemented to aid students in becoming alert to sounds instead. Specific activities that involve students in attending to and demonstrating recognition of the sounds of language include waving hands when rhymes are heard, stomping feet along with alliterations, clapping the syllables in names, and slowly stretching out arms when segmenting words. Phonological awareness is technically only about sounds and students do not need to know the letters of the alphabet to be able to develop phonological awareness.

Students in [[primary education]] sometimes learn phonological awareness in the context of literacy activities, particularly phonemic awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42692283|title=Road to the code : a phonological awareness program for young children|last=Blachman|first=Benita|date=|publisher=Paul H.

'''Religious texts''' (also known as scripture, or scriptures, from the [[Latin]] ''scriptura'', meaning "writing") are texts which religious traditions consider to be central to their practice or beliefs. Religious texts may be used to provide meaning and purpose, evoke a deeper connection with the [[divine]], convey religious truths, promote [[religious experience]], foster communal identity, and guide individual and communal religious practice. Religious texts often communicate the practices or values of a religious traditions and can be looked to as a set of guiding principles which dictate physical, mental, spiritual, or historical elements considered important to a specific religion. The terms 'sacred' text and 'religious' text are not necessarily interchangeable in that some religious texts are believed to be [[sacred]] because of their nature as [[Divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[Revelation|revealed]] or [[Divine Revelation|inspired]], whereas some religious texts are simply narratives pertaining to the general themes, practices, or important figures of the specific religion, and not necessarily considered sacred by itself. A core function of a religious text making it sacred is its ceremonial and liturgical role, particularly in relation to sacred time, the [[liturgical year]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, the [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine efficacy]] and subsequent holy service; in a more general sense, its performance.

It is not possible to create an exhaustive list of religious texts, because there is no single definition of which texts are recognized as religious.

== History of religious texts ==
{{See also|History of religions|Timeline of religion|History of writing}}
One of the oldest known religious texts is the [[Kesh Temple Hymn]] of Ancient [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Samuel|year=1942|title=The Oldest Literary Catalogue: A Sumerian List of Literary Compositions Compiled about 2000 B.C.|url=|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=88|pages=10–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Seth|year=2002|title=Old Light on Moses' Shining Face|url=|journal=Vetus Testamentum|volume=52|pages=400–406|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of inscribed clay tablets which scholars typically date around 2600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Princess_priestess_poet.html?id=X3ALAQAAMAAJ|title=Princess, priestess, poet: the Sumerian temple hymns of Enheduanna|last=Enheduanna|last2=Meador|first2=Betty De Shong|date=2009-08-01|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292719323|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] from [[Sumer]], although only considered by some scholars as a religious text, has origins as early as 2150-2000 BCE, and stands as one of the earliest literary works that includes various [[mythological]] figures and themes of interaction with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eCZRK_61adMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=religion+in+the+epic+of+gilgamesh&amp;ots=30kD2623sQ&amp;sig=9EjuqoN4QViNQQtmposUYgEjVgg#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh: The Babylonian Epic Poem and Other Texts in Akkadian and Sumerian|last=George|first=Andrew|date=2002-12-31|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140449198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] of ancient [[Hinduism]] is estimated to have been composed between 1700–1100 BCE, which not only denotes it as one of the oldest known religious texts, but also one of the oldest written religious text which is still actively used in religious practice to this day, though no actual evidence of this text exists prior to the 13th century AD.

There are many possible dates given to the first writings which can be connected to Talmudic and Biblical traditions, the earliest of which is found in scribal documentation of the 8th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contradictionsinthebible.com/the-yahwist-2/|title=The Yahwist|date=2012-12-23|newspaper=Contradictions in the Bible|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by administrative documentation from temples of the 5th and 6th centuries BCE,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=F7USWMRAwGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=first+writing+of+torah&amp;ots=iaIwVQlUOw&amp;sig=Tmec5mzl647UARFgSvmb57Et6-E#v=onepage&amp;q=BCE&amp;f=false|title=Torah in the Mouth: Writing and Oral Tradition in Palestinian Judaism 200 BCE-400 CE|last=Jaffee|first=Martin S.|date=2001-04-19|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198032236|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another common date being the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although a significant text in the history of religious text because of its widespread use among religious denominations and its continued use throughout history, the texts of the Abrahamic traditions are a good example of the lack of certainty surrounding dates and definitions of religious texts.

High rates of mass production and distribution of religious texts did not begin until the invention of the printing press in 1440,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html|title=The History Guide|website=www.historyguide.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; before which all religious texts were hand written copies, of which there were relatively limited quantities in circulation.

== Associated terminology ==
A religious canon refers to the generally accepted, uniform, and often unchanging collection of texts which a religious denomination considers comprehensive in terms of their specific application of texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, the content of a [[Protestant Bible]] may differ from the content of a [[Catholic Bible]] - insofar as the Protestant Old Testament does not include the [[Deuterocanonical books]] while the Roman Catholic canon does.  Protestants and Catholics use the same 27 book NT canon, as well as the same 39 book OT protocanon, also shared by Jews.

The word "canon" comes from the Sumerian word meaning "standard".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Canon Debate|last= Ulrich|first= Eugene|publisher= |year= 2002|isbn= |location= |pages= 21–35|chapter= The Notion and Definition of Canon|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "scripture" and variations such as "Holy Writ", "Holy Scripture" or "Sacred Scripture" are defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as terms which specifically apply to Biblical text and the [[Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scripture|title= scripture - definition of scripture in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website= Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date= 2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

Hierographology ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἱερός, ''hieros'', "sacred" or "holy"; γραφή, ''graphe'', "writing"; λόγος, ''logos'', "word" or "reason") ([[archaism|archaically]] also '[[hierology (textual criticism)|hierology]]') is the study of sacred texts.

* The [[Bible]] (the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]). The Apostolic churches (Catholicism and Orthodoxy) also include the [[Biblical apocrypha|Deuterocanonicals]].
** For '''[[Protestantism]]''', this is the 66-book canon - the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] of 24 books divided differently (into 39 books) and the universal 27-book [[New Testament]]. Some denominations also include the 15 books of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] between the Old Testament and the New Testament, for a total of 81 books.
** For '''[[Catholicism]]''', this includes seven [[deuterocanonical books]] in the Old Testament for a total of 73 books, called the [[Canon of Trent]] (in versions of the Latin Vulgate, [[3 Esdras]], [[4 Esdras]], and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]] are included in an appendix, but considered non-canonical).
** For the '''[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]''', this includes the ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', which consist of the Catholic deuterocanon, plus [[3 Maccabees]], [[Psalm 151]], the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], and [[3 Esdras]]. [[4 Maccabees]] is considered to be canonical by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Orthodox also generally divide Baruch and Letter of Jeremiah into two books instead of one. The enumeration of the Books of Ezra is different in many Orthodox Bibles, as it is in all others: see Wikipedia's article on [[Esdras|the naming conventions of the Books of Esdras]].&lt;/ref&gt;
** The '''[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]''' (and its offspring, the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]]) adds various additional books depending on the specific enumeration of the canon (see [[Ethiopian Biblical canon]]), but always includes 4 Esdras, the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[1 Enoch]], [[4 Baruch]], and [[Meqabyan|1, 2, and 3 Meqabyan]] (no relation to the Books of Maccabees).
** Some '''[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac churches]]''' accept the [[Letter of Baruch]] as scripture.

She attempted another campaign for public office in 1997, this time as a Democrat, and was arrested that same year.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Career==
Ruthann Greenzweig was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. After graduating from Cornell University, she moved to Maryland with her husband and two young children, acquired a law degree at Catholic University and became a real estate developer.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt; She completed several big deals and became a member of the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], Maryland, Planning Board. In 1994, she lost the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Maryland to former Tennessee Senator [[Bill Brock]], who was in turn defeated by incumbent [[Paul Sarbanes]]. After Brock lost to Sarbanes, Aron sued Brock for [[slander]] based on comments he made about her during the primary campaign. Brock had said, at a September 1994 press conference:{{Reduced pull quote|1=center|width=50%|2=''She has been convicted by jury of fraud, more than once.''|3=[[Bill Brock]]|4=campaign comment against Ruthann Aron.}}

In reality, juries had ruled against Aron in two civil lawsuits in which former business partners accused her of fraud or other offenses. A federal judge overturned one of the verdicts, and Aron settled both suits out of court after agreeing to pay about $175,000 in each case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/stories/debate.htm|author=Charles Babington|title=GOP Senate Foes Trade Shots|date=September 8, 1994|agency=''The Washington Post''|page=D06|accessdate=April 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423054625/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/stories/debate.htm|archive-date=April 23, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the slander trial, Aron cited Brock's use of the term "convicted" for verdicts that had come in civil court. Lawyer Arthur G. Kahn, who had prosecuted one of the fraud cases, testified against Aron at the February 1996 trial, which Aron lost. Nonetheless, it was the first time that a losing federal candidate was able to get the winner into court over words spoken in a campaign.&lt;ref name="Mystery"/&gt;

==Contract killings==
Aron was arrested in June 1997 for trying to [[Contract killing|hire]] a [[hitman]]; she approached William "Billy" Mossberg, a local landfill owner, who immediately went to the police. The police asked Mossberg to work with them and he then agreed with Aron to [[murder]] her husband and Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Katherine Shaver |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/aron.htm |title=Aron Gets Three Years in Murder Plot |work=The Washington Post |date=November 24, 1998 |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925031654/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/aron.htm |archive-date=September 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was ousted from the Planning Board in August 1997. At the time of her arrest, she was planning to run, as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], for an at-large seat on the Montgomery County Council. In her first trial, she used nine psychiatrists/psychologists to argue that a [[traumatic brain injury|brain injury]] and her [[child abuse|childhood abuse]] had rendered her incapable of realizing that what she was doing was illegal. Aron was diagnosed as having [[borderline personality disorder]] by multiple psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Mystery"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/magazine/mystery021598.htm | author=Karl Vick | page=M20 | work=The Washington Post | title=The Mystery of Ruthann Aron | date=February 26, 1998 | access-date=December 13, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214041129/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/magazine/mystery021598.htm | archive-date=December 14, 2017 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/home.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Aron Released From Mental Hospital | date=February 15, 1998 | author=Karl Vick | page=B01 | access-date=December 13, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223046/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/home.htm | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One juror held out on her behalf, and a mistrial was declared.&lt;ref name="Lone"&gt;{{cite news | url=//https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/trial0402.htm?tid=a_inl | author=Katherine Shaver | page=A1 | work=The Washington Post | title=Holdout Juror Says Aron Needs Help | date=April 2, 1998 | access-date=January 19, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141428/http://https/ | archive-date=August 19, 2013 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1998, Aron pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]], and in November 1998 she was sentenced to two consecutive 18-month prison sentences.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}

==Aftermath==

'''Sarcasm''' is "a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression or remark; a bitter gibe or [[taunt]]".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Boxer, D. | quote = Only ''people'' can be sarcastic, whereas ''situations'' are ironic. | year = 2002 | title = Applying Sociolinguistics: Domains and Face-to-Face Interaction | chapter = 4 - 'Yeah right:' sociolinguistic functions of sarcasm in classroom discourse | page = 100 | publisher = John Benjamins Publications | isbn = 978-90-272-1850-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarcasm may employ [[ambivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Rockwell, P.

Both are instruments of satire and vituperation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most noticeable in spoken word, sarcasm is mainly distinguished by the inflection with which it is spoken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony?s=t | title=Irony | publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]|quote=The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal inflection, whereas satire and irony arising originally as literary and rhetorical forms, are exhibited in the organization or structuring of either language or literary material.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is largely context-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Campbell, JD. | title = Investigating Components of Sarcastic Context | year = 2012 | quote = The findings ... show that the target sentences, when presented in isolation, were not seen as being conventionally sarcastic in nature. These same target sentences, however, when surrounded by contextual information provided by the participants asked to create a sarcastic context, were later coded as being sarcastic by a naïve rater. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1545&amp;context=etd]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==

The word comes from the Greek σαρκασμός (''sarkasmós'') which is taken from σαρκάζειν (''sarkázein'') meaning "to tear flesh, bite the lip in rage, sneer".&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

It is first recorded in English in 1579, in an annotation to ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]]:
{{quote|Tom piper, an ironicall Sarcasmus, spoken in derision of these rude wits, whych ...&lt;ref name="OED-quote"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.oed.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2008|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}; ([http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/october.html#Tom%20Piper Spenser, Edmund, ''Shepheardes Calendar'': on-line text of the passage])&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, the word ''sarcastic'', meaning "Characterized by or involving sarcasm; given to the use of sarcasm; bitterly cutting or caustic", doesn't appear until 1695.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

== Usage ==

In its entry on [[irony]], [[Dictionary.com]] describes sarcasm thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In sarcasm, ridicule or mockery is used harshly, often crudely and contemptuously, for destructive purposes. It may be used in an indirect manner, and have the form of irony, as in "What a fine musician you turned out to be!," "It's like you're a whole different person now...," and "Oh... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years!" or it may be used in the form of a direct statement, "You couldn't play one piece correctly if you had two assistants." The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal inflection ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony | title = Irony | work = Dictionary | publisher = Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Distinguishing sarcasm from [[banter]], and referring to the use of irony in sarcasm, Derek Bousfield writes &lt;ref&gt;Bousfield, D., "'Never a truer word said in jest': A Pragmastylistic Analysis of Impoliteness as Banter in Henry IV, Part I" in Marina Lambrou and Peter Stockwell, ''Contemporary Stylistics'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; that sarcasm is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The use of strategies which, ''on the surface'' appear to be appropriate to the situation, but are meant to be taken as meaning the opposite in terms of ''face management''. That is, the utterance which appears, on the surface, to maintain or enhance the face of the recipient actually attacks and damages the face of the recipient. ... ''sarcasm'' is an insincere form of politeness which is used to offend one's interlocutor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

17.'Never a truer word said in jest': A Pragmastylistic Analysis of Impoliteness as Banter in Henry IV, Part I, Derek Bousfield (University of Huddersfield, UK)

John Haiman writes: "There is an extremely close connection between sarcasm and irony, and literary theorists in particular often treat sarcasm as simply the crudest and least interesting form of irony." Also, he adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, situations may be ironic, but only people can be sarcastic. Second, people may be unintentionally ironic, but sarcasm requires intention. What is essential to sarcasm is that it is overt irony intentionally used by the speaker as a form of verbal aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-511524-6| last = Haiman| first = John| title = Talk is cheap : sarcasm, alienation, and the evolution of language| location = Oxford| date = 1998| page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While [[Henry Watson Fowler]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony. But irony, or the use of expressions conveying different things according as they are interpreted, is so often made the vehicle of sarcasm ... The essence of sarcasm is the intention of giving pain by (ironical or other) bitter words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fowler, Henry Watson |authorlink= Henry Watson Fowler | title = [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In psychology==
Professionals in psychology and related fields have long looked upon sarcasm negatively,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Thomas H. (1928) "Sarcasm". The School Review Vol. 36, No. 9 (Nov., 1928), pp. 685-695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cason, H. (1930) Methods of preventing and eliminating annoyances. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 25(1), Apr 1930, 40-48.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly noting that sarcasm tends to be a maladaptive [[coping mechanism]] for those with unresolved anger or frustrations. Psychologist Clifford N. Lazarus describes sarcasm as "[[hostility]] disguised as humor". While an occasional sarcastic comment may enliven a conversation, Lazarus suggests that too frequent use of sarcasm tends to "overwhelm the emotional flavor of any conversation".&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Clifford N. "Think Sarcasm is Funny? Think Again: Sarcasm is really just hostility disguised as humor" Psychology Today, Jun 26, 2012; accessed 15 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding ==
Understanding the subtlety of this usage requires second-order interpretation of the speaker's or writer's intentions; different parts of the brain must work together to understand sarcasm. This sophisticated understanding can be lacking in some people with certain forms of brain damage, dementia and autism (although not always),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | title = The Neuroanatomical Basis of Understanding Sarcasm and Its Relationship to Social Cognition | author = Shamay-Tsoory, Simone G.; Tomer, R.; Aharon-Peretz, J. | journal = Neuropsychology | year = 2005 | volume = 19 | number = 3 | pages = 288–300 | doi = 10.1037/0894-4105.19.3.288| pmid = 15910115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this perception has been located by [[MRI]] in the right [[parahippocampal gyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/health/research/03sarc.html?em&amp;ex=1213848000&amp;en=79518c9f61e51946&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=The Science of Sarcasm (Not That You Care)|publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' |author= Hurley, Dan |date=June 3, 2008|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.035.0098a | author = Slap, J. W. | year = 1966 | title = On Sarcasm | journal = [[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]] | volume = 35 | pages = 98–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that people with damage in the [[prefrontal cortex]] have difficulty understanding non-verbal aspects of language like tone, Richard Delmonico, a [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]] at the [[University of California, Davis]], told an interviewer.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7411 |author= Singer, Emily |date= 23 May 2005 |title= Understanding Sarcasm is a Complex Business |publisher= ''[[New Scientist]]'' |accessdate= October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research could help doctors distinguish between different types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia and [[Alzheimer's disease]], according to David Salmon, a neuroscientist at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Singer" /&gt;

In William Brant's ''Critique of Sarcastic Reason'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Südwestdeutscher Verlag für Hochschulschriften| isbn = 978-3-8381-3457-4| last = Brant| first = William| title = Critique of sarcastic reason: the epistemology of the cognitive neurological ability called "theory-of-mind" and deceptive reasoning| location = Saarbrücken, [Germany]| date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sarcasm is hypothesized to develop as a cognitive and emotional tool that adolescents use in order to test the borders of politeness and truth in conversation. Sarcasm recognition and expression both require the development of understanding forms of language, especially if sarcasm occurs without a cue or signal (e.g., a sarcastic tone or rolling the eyes). Sarcasm is argued to be more sophisticated than lying because lying is expressed as early as the age of three, but sarcastic expressions take place much later during development (Brant, 2012). According to Brant (2012, 145-6), sarcasm is

{{quote|(a) form of expression of language often including the assertion of a statement that is disbelieved by the expresser (e.g., where the sentential meaning is disbelieved by the expresser), although the intended meaning is different from the sentence meaning. The recognition of sarcasm without the accompaniment of a cue develops around the beginning of adolescence or later.  Sarcasm involves the expression of an insulting remark that requires the interpreter to understand the negative emotional connotation of the expresser within the context of the situation at hand. Irony, contrarily, does not include derision, unless it is sarcastic irony.  The problems with these definitions and the reason why this dissertation does not thoroughly investigate the distinction between irony and sarcasm involves the ideas that: (1) people can pretend to be insulted when they are not or pretend not to be insulted when they are seriously offended; (2) an individual may feel ridiculed directly after the comment and then find it humorous or neutral thereafter; and (3) the individual may not feel insulted until years after the comment was expressed and considered.}}

Cultural perspectives on sarcasm vary widely with more than a few cultures and linguistic groups finding it offensive to varying degrees. [[Thomas Carlyle]] despised it: "Sarcasm I now see to be, in general, the language of the devil; for which reason I have long since as good as renounced it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carlyle |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Carlyle |title= Originally published in 1833-34 in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], on the other hand, recognized in it a cry of pain: Sarcasm, he said, was "usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dostoyevsky |first= R |title= [[Notes from Underground]] |date=1864 |chapter=Part 2 section VI|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/600/600-h/600-h.htm#chap0206}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 1855, a collection of [[Etiquette (technology)|guidelines for Internet communications]], includes a warning to be especially careful with it as it "may not travel well." A professional translator has advised that international business executives "should generally avoid sarcasm in intercultural business conversations and written communications" because of the difficulties in translating sarcasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wooten|first=Adam|title=International Business: Sarcasm is never lost in translation: yeah, right!|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705390563/Sarcasm-is-never-lost-in-translation-yeah-right.html?pg=all|accessdate=10 November 2012|newspaper=Deseret News|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study by L. Huang, F. Gino and A.D. Galinsky of the Harvard Business School "tests a novel theoretical model in which both the construction and interpretation of sarcasm lead to greater creativity because they activate abstract thinking." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | title = The Highest Form of Intelligence: Sarcasm Increases Creativity Through Abstract Thinking for Both Expressers and Recipients | author = Huang, L.; Gino, F.; Galinsky, A.D. | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | year = 2015| issn=0749-5978 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocal indication ==

In English, sarcasm is often telegraphed with [[kinesics|kinesic]]/[[prosodic]] cues&lt;ref&gt;Kinesic/prosodic cues are among five cues to sarcasm's presence noted by Diana Boxer, 2002:100; the other cues are counter-factual statements, extreme exaggeration, tag questions, and direct cues.&lt;/ref&gt; by speaking more slowly and with a lower pitch. Similarly, Dutch uses a lowered pitch; sometimes to such an extent that the expression is reduced to a mere mumble. But other research shows that there are many ways that real speakers signal sarcastic intentions. One study found that in [[Cantonese]], sarcasm is indicated by raising the fundamental frequency of one's voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheang, H. S.; Pell, M. D.  | year = 2009 | title = Acoustic markers of sarcasm in Cantonese and English | journal = [[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 1394–1405 | pmid = 19739753 | doi = 10.1121/1.3177275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Amharic]], rising intonation is used to show sarcasm.&lt;ref name="Leslau"&gt;Leslau, Wolf. Reference Grammar of Amharic. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1995. 45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punctuation ==

{{main|Irony punctuation}}

Though in the English language there is no standard accepted method to denote irony or sarcasm in written conversation, several forms of punctuation have been proposed. Among the oldest and frequently attested are the [[percontation point]]—furthered by [[Henry Denham]] in the 1580s—and the [[irony mark]]—furthered by [[Alcanter de Brahm]] in the 19th century. Both of these marks were represented visually by a ⸮ backwards question mark (unicode U+2E2E). Each of these punctuation marks are primarily used to indicate that a sentence should be understood as ironic, but not necessarily designate sarcasm that is not ironic. By contrast, more recent proposals, such as the [[snark mark]], or the use of a following [[tilde]] are specifically intended to denote sarcasm rather than irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=Keith|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols &amp; Other Typographical Marks|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=978-0-393-06442-1|pages=36–37,217–219,221,232–233,239–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bracketed exclamation point or question mark as well as [[scare quotes]] are also sometimes used to express irony or ironic sarcasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance on Standards for Subtitling|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/standards_for_subtitling/subtitling_2.asp.html#2_1|work=ITC Guidance on Public Consultation: Codes &amp; Guidance Notes|publisher=ITC|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain Ethiopic languages, sarcasm and unreal phrases are indicated at the end of a sentence with a sarcasm mark called [[temherte slaq]], a character that looks like an inverted exclamation point ¡.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yacob.org/papers/DanielYacob-IUC15.pdf | format = pdf | title = A Roadmap to the Extension of the Ethiopic Writing System Standard Under Unicode and ISO-10646 | publisher = 15th International Unicode Conference | page = 6 | accessdate = 22 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage directly parallels [[John Wilkins]]' 1668 proposal to use the inverted [[exclamation point]] as an irony mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=Keith|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols &amp; Other Typographical Marks|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=978-0-393-06442-1|pages=212–215, 231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal by Asteraye Tsigie and Daniel Yacob in 1999 to include the ''temherte slaq'' in unicode was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=Keith|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols &amp; Other Typographical Marks|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=978-0-393-06442-1|pages=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying ==
A French company has developed an analytics tool that claims to have up to 80% accuracy in identifying sarcastic comments posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23160583|title=Authorities 'use analytics tool that recognises sarcasm'|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[United States Secret Service]] requested bids for software that would identify sarcasm in [[tweet (Twitter)|tweet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/04/secret_service_wants_twitter_sarcasm_radar|title=Oh, wow.

== Legality ==
In late August 2016, [[North Korea]] banned sarcasm against the government. It was reported that the government gave the warnings in mass meetings across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korean Citizens Warned Against 'Hostile' Speech|authors=Sunghui Moon, Jackie Yoo, Richard Finney|date=2016-09-02|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/warned-09022016160227.html|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent media reports suggest that North Korea banned sarcasm altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Jong-un bans sarcasm in North Korea fearing people will only agree with him 'ironically'|author=Barney Henderson|date=2016-09-08|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/08/kim-jong-un-bans-sarcasm-in-north-korea-fearing-people-will-only/|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un bans sarcasm|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2016-09-08|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/08/north-korean-dictator-kim-jong-un-bans-sarcasm.html|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea bans sarcasm because Kim Jong-un fears people only agree with him ‘ironically’|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Harriet Agerholm|date=2016-09-08|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-bans-sarcasm-kim-jong-un-freedom-speech-a7231461.html|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''soap opera''' is an ongoing drama [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]] on [[television]] or [[radio]], featuring the lives of many characters and their emotional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=soap opera | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/soap+opera?s=t | encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary—Complete &amp; Unabridged | edition=10th | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''soap opera'' originated from radio dramas being sponsored by [[soap]] manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Bowles-118/&gt;

[[BBC Radio]]'s ''[[The Archers]]'', first broadcast in 1950, is the world’s longest-running radio soap opera;&lt;ref name="Archers"&gt;{{cite news|title=May 1950 - The Archers - the world’s longest running soap opera|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0168wd7|agency=BBC|date=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world's longest-running television soap opera is ''[[Coronation Street]]'', first broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Corrie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coronation Street recognised as longest running soap|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-11410873/coronation-street-recognised-as-longest-running-soap|agency=BBC|date=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the genre==
The first serial considered to be a "soap opera" was ''[[Painted Dreams]]'', which debuted on October 20, 1930 on [[Chicago]] radio station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]].&lt;ref name=hummert&gt;{{cite book|title= Frank and Anne Hummert's radio factory: the programs and personalities of broadcasting's most prolific producers|first= Jim |last= Cox|publisher= McFarland |year= 2003|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early radio series such as ''Painted Dreams'' were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week. Most of the listeners would be housewives.Thus, the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience.&lt;ref name=Bowles-118&gt;Bowles, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The first nationally broadcast radio soap opera was ''[[Clara, Lu, and Em]]'', which aired on the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on January 27, 1931.

==Story and episode structure==
One of the defining features that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative.  While Spanish language [[telenovelas]] are sometimes called "soap operas," telenovelas have conflicts that get resolved and a definite ending after (more or less) a year of daily weekday airing.  But with soap operas each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode".&lt;ref name=Bowles-121&gt;Bowles, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas, "Although melodramatically eventful, soap operas such as this also have a luxury of space that makes them seem more naturalistic; indeed, the economics of the form demand long scenes, and conversations that a 22-episodes-per-season weekly series might dispense with in half a dozen lines of dialogue may be drawn out, as here, for pages. You spend more time even with the minor characters; the apparent villains grow less apparently villainous."&lt;ref name="LA Times 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/18/entertainment/la-et-hollywood-heights-20120618 |title=Television review: Stars in their eyes in ''Hollywood Heights'' |first=Robert |last=Lloyd |website=|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent [[narrative thread]]s that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of [[cliffhanger]], and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.

Evening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.

In 1976, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described [[daytime television in the United States|American daytime television]] as "TV's richest market," noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximize ad revenues.&lt;ref name="Time 1976"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850,00.html|title=Sex and Suffering in the Afternoon|date=January 12, 1976|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article explained that at that time, many [[prime time]] series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs.&lt;ref name="Time 1976"/&gt; The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, [[Bill Hayes (actor)|Bill Hayes]] and [[Susan Seaforth Hayes]] of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'',&lt;ref name="SOD stats Seaforth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/susanseaforthhayesbio/ |title=Soap star stats: Susan Seaforth Hayes (Julie, ''DAYS'') |publisher=SoapOperaDigest.com |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123212146/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/susanseaforthhayesbio/ |archivedate=January 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1985 Encyc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schemering |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Schemering |title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] |date=September 1985 |pages=66–73 |isbn=0-345-32459-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.&lt;ref name="1997 Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waggett|first=Gerard J.|title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Waggett book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]]|date=November 1997|page=91|chapter=''One Life to Live''|isbn=0-06-101157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plots and storylines==
The main characteristics that define soap operas are "an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations".&lt;ref name=Bowles-119&gt;Bowles, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. "Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, [[deus ex machina]] endings.'" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from ''[[EastEnders]]'' to ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.&lt;ref name=Geraghty-30&gt;Geraghty, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the prominence of English-language television, most soap-operas are completely English (or in the case of a foreign soap opera, dubbed into English). However, several South African soap operas started incorporating a multi-language format, the most prominent being [[7de Laan]], which incorporates [[Afrikaans]], English, [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and several other [[Bantu languages]] which make up the [[Languages of South Africa|11 Official Languages of South Africa]] (the subtitles are always in English).

In many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the US, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, pp. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore [[social realism|social realist]] storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare.&lt;ref name=Bowles-121/&gt; UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting "reality" or purport to have a "realistic" style.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, ''EastEnders'' focuses on the tough and grim life in the east end of London; ''Coronation Street'' and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of "northern straight talking".&lt;ref name=Geraghty-35&gt;Geraghty, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romantic love|Romance]], secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In US daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback [[romance novel]]s. Soap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.

Australian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the "romantic quality" of criminal and/or [[business oligarch|oligarch]] life.

In soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and [[twin]]s (including the [[evil twin|evil variety]]) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.

As in [[comic books]] – another popular form of linear [[storytelling]] pioneered in the US during the 20th century – a character's death is [[comic book death|not guaranteed to be permanent]].&lt;ref name=Returns&gt;{{cite news|last=Richmond|first=Ray|title=Soaps and fans suspend disbelief so their favorite stars can return|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sTEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=884EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bill%20eckert%20general%20hospital&amp;pg=4915%2C1899422|accessdate=December 19, 2012|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=February 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', [[Taylor Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) was shown to [[flatline]] and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a [[retcon]] explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.

Stunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.

===Daytime serials on television===

The first [[daytime television in the United States|daytime TV]] soap opera in the United States was ''[[These Are My Children]]'' in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by [[game show]]s, [[situation comedies|sitcom]] [[rerun]]s and talk shows.

In 1988, [[H. Wesley Kenney]], who at the time served as the [[executive producer]] of ''[[General Hospital]]'', said to ''[[The New York Times]]'':&lt;ref name="NYT 25"&gt;{{cite news|title=At a Ripe 25, 'Hospital' Is Healthy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/02/arts/at-a-ripe-25-hospital-is-healthy.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 2, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I think people like stories that continue so they can relate to these people. They become like a family, and the viewer becomes emotionally involved. There seem to be two attitudes by viewers. One, that the stories are similar to what happened to them in real life, or two, thank goodness that isn't me. | H. Wesley Kenney}}

Many long-running US soap operas established particular environments for their stories. ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'' and ''General Hospital'', in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. ''[[As the World Turns]]'' dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife [[Nancy Hughes|Nancy]] who, tired of being "the loyal housewife" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. ''[[Guiding Light]]'' dealt with Bert Bauer ([[Charita Bauer]]) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' mostly told its story through the eyes of [[Joanne Gardner]] ([[Mary Stuart (actress)|Mary Stuart]]). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.

In contrast, ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' (1966–1971) and ''[[Port Charles]]'' (1997–2003) featured supernatural characters and dealt with [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.

The American soap opera ''Guiding Light'' (originally titled ''&lt;u&gt;The&lt;/u&gt; Guiding Light'' until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator [[Irna Phillips]] was involved in a dispute with [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], ''Guiding Light'' was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 until 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.

Originally serials were broadcast as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, ''As the World Turns'' and ''The Edge of Night'', both produced by [[Procter &amp; Gamble Productions]], debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four US serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' airs 30-minute episodes.

Soap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in [[New York City]], a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as ''General Hospital'', ''Days of our Lives'' and ''The Young and the Restless'' were produced in [[Los Angeles]]. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. ''As the World Turns'' and ''The Edge of Night'' were the last to make the switch, in 1975.

''Port Charles'' used the practice of running 13-week "[[story arc]]s," in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do [[telenovela]] arcs, but this was rejected.

Though U.S. daytime soap operas are not generally [[rerun]] by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled. Early episodes of ''Dark Shadows'' were rerun on [[PBS]] member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the 1990s. After ''The Edge of Night''{{'}}s 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on [[USA Network]] from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] network dedicated to the genre, [[SOAPnet]], began re-airing soaps that originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] and [[CBS]].

Newer broadcast networks since the late 1980s, such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[cable television]] networks, have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules, instead running [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although [[DirecTV]]'s [[Audience Network|The 101 Network]] took over existing serial ''[[Passions]]'', continuing production for one season; while [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] and [[ABC Family|CBN Cable Network]] respectively aired their own soap operas, ''[[The Catlins (TV series)|The Catlins]]'' (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and ''[[Another Life (1981 TV series)|Another Life]]'' (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the [[fourth television network|fourth "major network,"]] carried a short lived daytime soap ''[[Tribes (TV series)|Tribes]]'' in 1990. Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their [[U.S. television network affiliate switches of 1994|ascension to major-network status in 1994]] (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps, which aired on newly created sister network [[MyNetworkTV]], but the experiment was largely a failure).

Due to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, ''Dark Shadows'', which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).

====Performers====
:''See [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors]]''
Due to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of [[Mike Karr]] on ''The Edge of Night'' was played by three different actors.

Conversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. [[Helen Wagner]] played Hughes family matriarch [[Nancy Hughes]] on American soap ''As the World Turns'' from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060330/us_nm/leisure_world_dc |website=News.Yahoo.com (Internet Archive) |archivedate=April 28, 2006 |title=Actress shares 50th year with ''As the World Turns'' |first=Steve |last=Gorman |year=2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428045747/https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060330/us_nm/leisure_world_dc }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. [[Rachel Ames]] played [[Audrey Hardy]] on both ''General Hospital'' and ''Port Charles'' from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. [[Susan Lucci]] played [[Erica Kane]] in ''[[All My Children]]'' from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. [[Erika Slezak]] played [[Victoria Lord]] #3 on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-jeanne-cooper-dies-dead-young-restless-corbin-bernsen-20130508,0,4586061.story |title=Jeanne Cooper of ''Young and the Restless'' dies at 84 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Christie | last=Dzurilla | date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other actors have played several characters on different shows.  [[Millette Alexander]], [[Bernard Barrow]], [[Doris Belack]], [[David Canary]], [[Judith Chapman]], [[Jordan Charney]], [[Joan Copeland]], [[Nicolas Coster]], [[Jacqueline Courtney]], [[Louis Edmonds]], [[Dan Hamilton]], [[Don Hastings]], [[Vincent Irizarry]], [[Lenore Kasdorf]], [[Teri Keane]], [[Lois Kibbee]], [[John Loprieno]], [[Maeve McGuire]], [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]], [[Christopher Pennock]], [[Gary Pillar]], [[Antony Ponzini]], [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Louise Shaffer]], and [[Diana van der Vlis]], among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.

====Evolution of the daytime serial====
For several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] towns.

Exterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series ''The Edge of Night'' and ''Dark Shadows''. Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, ''[[The Best of Everything (TV series)|The Best of Everything]]'' and ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' were set in a real-world location, New York City.

The first exotic location shoot was made by ''All My Children'', to [[St. Croix]] in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the ''All My Children'' shoot. Soap operas ''Another World'' and ''Guiding Light'' both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for [[Alan Spaulding]] and [[Rita Stapleton|Rita Bauer]]'s torrid affair. ''Search for Tomorrow'' taped for two weeks in [[Hong Kong]] in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to [[Jamaica]] to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.

During the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.

One of the first and most popular couples was [[Luke Spencer and Laura Webber]] on ''[[General Hospital]]''. Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.

With increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left-Handed Boy Statue, and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in [[Mexico]]. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.

During the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and [[social issues]], such as [[Erica Kane]]'s drug addiction on ''All My Children'', the re-emergence of [[Viki Lord]]'s [[multiple personality disorder]] on ''One Life to Live'', and [[Stuart Chandler]] dealing with his wife Cindy dying of [[AIDS]] on ''All My Children''. Other social issues included [[cancer]], [[rape]], [[abortion]], [[homophobia]], and [[racism]].

Some shows during the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera ''Dark Shadows'' was [[Barnabas Collins]], a vampire, and ''One Life to Live'' featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past.

====Traditional grammar of daytime serials====
Modern U.S. daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.

American daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:
* A construct unique to U.S. daytime serials is the format where the action will cut between various conversations, returning to each at the precise moment it was left. This is the most significant distinction between U.S. daytime soap operas and other forms of U.S. television drama, which generally allow for narrative time to pass, off-screen, between the scenes depicted.&lt;ref name=Bowles-121/&gt; On occasion, a character or characters involved a conversation earlier in that act may appear in a different setting later in the same act.
* In U.S. daytime soap operas, scenes often end with a [[pregnant pause]] and a close-up on the character. There will be no dialogue for several seconds, while the music builds before cutting to a commercial or a new scene. This kind of segue is referred to in the industry as a "tag."
* The traditional [[three-point lighting]] set-up routinely used in [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] is also used on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated [[back lighting]] to lift actors out of the background. This is useful in programs like soap operas, which are shot on videotape in small interior sets. The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets.
* Domestic interiors are often furnished with stained wood wall panels and furniture, and items of brown leather furniture. This is to give a sumptuous and luxurious look suggesting the wealth of the characters. Daytime serials often foreground other sumptuous elements of set decoration; presenting a "mid-shot of characters viewed through a frame of lavish floral displays, glittering crystal decanters or gleaming antique furniture".&lt;ref name=Bowles-119/&gt;
* Few U.S. daytime soap operas routinely feature location or exterior-shot footage (''Guiding Light'' began shooting many of its scenes outdoors in its final two seasons). Often an outdoor locale is recreated in the studio. Australian and UK daily soap operas invariably feature a certain amount of exterior shot footage in every episode. This is usually shot in the same location and often on a purpose-built set, with new exterior locations for particular events.
* The visual quality of a soap opera is usually lower than prime time U.S. television drama series due to the lower budgets and quicker production times. This is also because soap operas are recorded on videotape using a [[multi-camera setup]], unlike primetime productions that are usually shot on film and frequently use the [[Single-camera setup|single camera]] shooting style. Because of the lower resolution of video images, and also because of the emotional situations portrayed in soap operas, daytime serials make heavy use of [[close-up]] shots. Programs in the United States did not make the full conversion to [[high-definition television|high definition broadcasting]] until September 2011, when ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' became the last soap to convert to the format; ''One Life to Live'' was an exception to this, as it continued to be produced and broadcast in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] – albeit in the [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] – until the end of its run on ABC in January 2012.
* Soap operas have idiosyncratic [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] techniques. In one common situation, a romantically involved couple starts a conversation face-to-face, then one character will turn 180° and face away from the other character while the conversation continues. This allows both characters to appear together in a single shot, and both facing the audience. This is unrealistic in real life and is not frequently seen in film or on television outside U.S. daytime serials, but it is an accepted soap opera convention, sometimes referred to as a "Two Shot West."&lt;ref name=mittell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mittell|first=Jason|title=Television and American Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because of the "escapist" tone of the genre and due to the large number of cast members employed by each program (usually totaling around 30 to 35 actors for hour-long soaps, and 15 to 25 for those lasting a half-hour), daytime soap operas have traditionally listed all contract cast members (as well as recurring and guest actors) during the [[closing credits]], instead of the [[opening credits|opening title sequence]]. Until the 1990s, these series listed only a few of the principal actors at the end of the episode in certain episodes airing on Monday through Thursdays. Because of the aforementioned reasons, an extended credit sequence featuring a complete list of the show's cast members – listed alongside the characters they portray – typically airs at least once per week (usually on the Friday show; although since the 2000s, most soap operas – with ''General Hospital'' as one of the few exceptions – have randomized the day the cast list is shown). ''The Young and the Restless'' became the first American daytime soap to include the names of its contract actors in the opening credits in 1999 (although due to the large number of actors on contract with the show at one time, it utilizes different versions of the title sequence with a randomized list of about six actors); ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' began listing its entire main cast (as well as some actors appearing on a recurring basis) from 2005 to 2017, with ''General Hospital'' following suit from 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='General Hospital' Gets New Credits: A Look at 'GH's' Opening Over the Years|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/02/25/general-hospital-gets-new-credits-a-look-at-ghs-opening-ov/|author=Michael Maloney|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline====

=====Statistics and trends=====
[[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|Soap opera ratings]] have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera has been created since ''[[Passions]]'' in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – ''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' – continue to air on the [[Big three television networks|three major networks]], down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This marks the first time since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]].&lt;ref name="1950s Nielsen"&gt;Waggett (1997). "Soap Opera Nielsen Ratings". ''Soap Opera Encyclopedia'', pp. 626-628.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Young and the Restless'', the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as ''[[Judge Judy]]''.&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R rating"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/arts/television/after-some-soaps-cancellations-others-adjust.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Taffy | last=Brodesser-Akner | title=After Some Soaps' Cancellations, Others Adjust | date=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulations of soap opera [[magazine]]s have decreased and some have even ceased publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/soap-opera-declines-cause-fallout-magazines-139510|title=Soap Opera Declines Cause Fallout for Magazines|work=AdWeek|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year.&lt;ref name=latimesblog&gt;Villarreal, Yvonne.

Several of the U.S.’s most established soaps ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, ''[[Guiding Light]]'', barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run.&lt;ref name="Guiding Light ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.soapoperanetwork.com/topic/32193-september-14-18-2009/ |title=September 14-18, 2009 - SON Community |publisher=Boards.soapoperanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[As the World Turns]]'' aired its final episode on September 17, 2010 after a 54-year run.

''All My Children'', another New York-based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and ''One Life to Live'', each with a four-decade-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. ''[[All My Children]]'' aired its network finale in September 2011 with ''One Life to Live'' following suit in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/15/business/la-fi-ct-soaps-20110415|title=Soap operas: ABC ending soaps "All My Children" and "One Life to Live."|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''All My Children'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]'' were briefly revived online in 2013, before being canceled again that same year.&lt;ref name=enstars&gt;{{cite web|last=DuBois|first=Lauren|title='All My Children' and 'One Life To Live' Officially Cancelled For Second Time|url=http://www.enstarz.com/articles/28792/20131111/all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-officially-cancelled-for-second-time-shows-bid-farewell-for-good-video.htm|work=EnStars|accessdate=12 November 2013|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Causes=====
As women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304186404576389693935512286#articleTabs%3Darticle | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sam | last=Schechner | title=As Venerable Soap Operas Die Off, Fans Fight for One More Life to Live | date=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the [[internet]] has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to [[reality television]] displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/arts/television/06kant.html |title=After 72 Years, Springfield Gets a Stop Sign |publisher=''The New York Times'' | first=Barbara | last=Kantrowitz | date=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early term for the reality TV genre was ''docu-soap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=docu-soap|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/docusoap|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 [[O. J. Simpson murder case]], both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anolik|first1=Lili|title=It All Began with O. J.|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/oj-simpson-trial-reality-tv-pop-culture|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Passalacqua|first1=Connie|title=Post-Trial, Is There Life for the Soaps?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-15/entertainment/ca-35367_1_soap-opera|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=15 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daytime programming alternatives such as [[talk show]]s, [[game show]]s, and [[court show]]s cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/arts/television/09soap.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Bill | last1=Carter | first2=Brian | last2=Stelter | title=CBS Cancels ‘As the World Turns,' Procter &amp; Gamble's Last Soap Opera | date=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' and ''Port Charles''. Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the [[Great Recession]], which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/as-the-big-3s-world-turns/|title=As the Big 3's World Turns|publisher=''New York Times'' | first=Jerry | last=Garrett | date=December 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulcahy Jr.|first1=Kevin|title=25 Biggest Blunders In Daytime Soap Opera History|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2011/09/25blunders.html|website=[[We Love Soaps]]|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The primetime serial===
Serials produced for primetime slots have also found success. The first primetime soap opera was ''[[Faraway Hill]]'' (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dumontnetwork.com/a1.html|title=DuMont Television Network - Historical Web Site|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Faraway Hill'' ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.

The first long-running prime time soap opera was ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the [[Peyton Place (film)|eponymous 1957 film]] (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 [[Peyton Place (novel)|novel]]).

The popularity of ''Peyton Place'' prompted the CBS network to spin-off popular ''As the World Turns'' character [[Lisa Miller Grimaldi|Lisa Miller]] into her own evening soap opera, ''[[Our Private World]]'' (originally titled "The Woman Lisa" in its planning stages). ''Our Private World'' was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer [[Eileen Fulton]]) returned to ''As The World Turns'' after the series ended.

The structure of ''Peyton Place'', with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the primetime serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.

The successful primetime serials of the 1980s included ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, [[promiscuous]], and passionate [[antagonist]] as a key character in the storyline – respectively, [[J. R. Ewing]], [[Alexis Colby]], [[Abby Cunningham]] and Angela Channing. These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences "loved to hate".

Unlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a [[single camera setup]], and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. ''Dallas'', its spin-off ''Knots Landing'', and ''Falcon Crest'' all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. ''Dynasty'' featured this format throughout its run.

The soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American primetime television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. This series, produced by [[Steven Bochco]], featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an [[ensemble cast]], multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'' overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.

The primetime soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Party of Five]]'', ''[[The OC]]'', and ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'', ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'', and more recently ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'', ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', ''[[Mistresses (U.S. TV series)|Mistresses]]'', and formerly ''[[Ringer (TV series)|Ringer]]'', which its sister production company [[ABC Studios]] co-produced with [[CBS Television Studios]] for [[The CW]]. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

On June 13, 2012, ''[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]]'', a continuation of the [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|1978 original series]] premiered on the cable network, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show's most established star, [[Larry Hagman]], died midway through the series. In 2012, [[Nick at Nite]] debuted a primetime soap opera, ''[[Hollywood Heights (TV series)|Hollywood Heights]]'', which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela ''[[Alcanzar una estrella]]'', suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel [[TeenNick]] halfway through its run to [[burning off|burn off]] the remaining episodes.

In 2015, Fox debuted ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'', a primetime musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by [[Lee Daniels]] and [[Danny Strong]] and led by [[Academy Award]] nominees [[Terrence Howard]] and [[Taraji P. Henson]], the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', [[James Goldman]]'s ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'' and the 1980s soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Also in 2015, [[E!]] introduced ''[[The Royals (TV series)|The Royals]]'', a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by ''Dynasty'' (even featuring [[Joan Collins]] as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a primetime soap opera ''[[Blood &amp; Oil]]'', following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day [[Williston, North Dakota|Williston]] oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015 during the 2015-16 TV season.

===Telenovelas===
The [[telenovela]], a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism ''Spanish soap opera'' has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central [[story arc]] with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.

Spanish-language networks, chiefly [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]], have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Marisa|title=How the Telenovela Is Beating the Networks|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-telenovela-is-beating-networks-173938|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online serials===
Some [[web series]] are soap operas, such as ''[[Degrassi: In Session]]'' or ''[[Venice: The Series]]''. In 2013, production company [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] revived ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'' for the web, retaining original creator [[Agnes Nixon]] as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kimberly|title='All My Children,' 'One Life to Live' Return as Online Soaps: Six Things You Need to Know|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/-all-my-children----one-life-to-live--return-as-online-soaps--six-things-you-need-to-know-214221733.html|work=Yahoo!

==United Kingdom==
:''See [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors]]''
Soap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting ''[[Front Line Family]]'' in April 1941 on its [[BBC World Service|North American shortwave service]] to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign against American "Neutrality" in World War II | author=Cull, Nicholas John | year=1995 | pages=135–136 | isbn=0-19-508566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, ''[[The Archers]]'', which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951.&lt;ref name="Archers"/&gt; It is currently broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.

In the UK, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the [[kitchen sink drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When kitchen-sink drama revolutionised British cinema|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/classic-british/kitchen-sink-drama-revolution/|agency=The Telegraph|date=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular British television programmes are ''[[EastEnders]]'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'', ''[[Emmerdale]]'', ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', and the Australian produced ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]''. The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television.&lt;ref name="BARB"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16671101 "Tracking 30 years of TV's most watched programmes"]. BBC. Retrieved 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the [[British Royal Family]], including [[Elizabeth II]] herself. Major events in [[British culture]] are often mentioned in the storyline, such as England’s participation at the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the death of [[Princess Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup fever hits Walford|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5076722.stm|agency=BBC|date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Den Ange Divorce.jpg|thumb|A scene from ''[[EastEnders]]'' on Christmas Day 1986, watched by 30.15 million viewers. The story, in which [[Den Watts]] served his wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] with [[divorce papers]], was the highest-rated soap episode in British history, and the highest-rated program in the UK during the 1980s. Only the 1966 World Cup Final and the funeral of Princess Diana rank higher in the all time ratings.&lt;ref name="BARB"/&gt;]]
The 1986 [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] episode of ''EastEnders'' is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (more than half the population at the time).&lt;ref name="BARB"/&gt; The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of ''EastEnders'' the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] (32.3 million viewers) and [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana's funeral]] in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) which were transmitted on both [[BBC One]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].&lt;ref name="BARB"/&gt;

===Television===
An early television serial was ''[[The Grove Family]]'' on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'', running from 1957 until 1967.

In the 1960s ''[[Coronation Street]]'' revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.&lt;ref name="Corrie"/&gt; The BBC also produced several serials: ''[[Compact (soap opera)|Compact]]'' was about the staff of a women's magazine; ''[[The Newcomers (TV series)|The Newcomers]]'' was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; ''[[United!]]'' contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; ''[[199 Park Lane]]'' (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as ''Coronation Street''. Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely [[wiped]].

During the 1960s, ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s main rival was ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'', a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. ''Crossroads'' was set in a [[Birmingham]] motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. ''Crossroads'' was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of ''Crossroads'' was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).

A later rival to ''Coronation Street'' was ITV's ''[[Emmerdale Farm]]'' (later renamed ''Emmerdale''), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural [[Yorkshire]]. Increased viewership resulted in ''Emmerdale'' being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.

''[[Pobol y Cwm]]'' (''People of the Valley'') is a [[Welsh language]] serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. ''Pobol y Cwm'' was originally broadcast on [[BBC Wales]] television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station [[S4C]] when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on [[BBC One|BBC1]] in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. ''Pobol y Cwm'' was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], with English [[subtitling|subtitles]]; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/viewing/e_index.shtml |title=s4c.co.uk |publisher=s4c.co.uk |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1980s===

Daytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced ''[[General Hospital (UK TV series)|General Hospital]]'', which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980,  [[Scottish Television]] debuted ''[[Take the High Road]]'', which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as ''[[The Sullivans]]'' (aired on ITV from 1977), ''[[The Young Doctors]]'' (from 1982), ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' (from 1983), ''[[A Country Practice]]'' (from 1982), ''[[Richmond Hill (TV series)|Richmond Hill]]'' (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, ''Neighbours'' was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and ''Home and Away'' aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.

The day [[Channel 4]] began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the [[Liverpool]]-based ''[[Brookside]]'', which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of ''Brookside'' was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike ''Coronation Street'' and ''Emmerdale Farm'', which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in ''Brookside'' were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city [[council estates]], or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though ''Brookside'' was still broadcast in a pre-[[watershed (television)|watershed]] slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. [[Bobby Grant (Brookside)|Bobby Grant]] ([[Ricky Tomlinson]]), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, [[rape]]) often being featured.

In 1985, the BBC's ''EastEnders'' debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which [[divorce papers]] were served to [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) by her husband, [[The Queen Victoria|Queen Vic]] landlord [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]).

A notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, [[Yorkshire Television]] began airing the cult Australian soap opera ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title ''Prisoner: Cell Block H''. It was probably most popular in the Midlands where [[ITV Central|Central Television]] consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.

===The 1990s===

In 1992, the BBC made ''[[Eldorado (soap opera)|Eldorado]]'' to daily alternate with ''EastEnders''. The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', a soap with a youth focus. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera ''[[Family Affairs]]'', which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.

''Brookside''{{'}}s premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, [[incest|sibling incest]], religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.

''Coronation Street'' and ''Brookside'' began releasing straight-to-video features. The ''Coronation Street'' releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The ''Brookside'' releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.

''Emmerdale Farm'' was renamed ''Emmerdale'' in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the [[Lockerbie bombing]]. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and ''Emmerdale'' grew in popularity.

Throughout the 1990s, ''Brookside'', ''Coronation Street'', ''EastEnders'' and ''Emmerdale'' continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.

===The 2000s===

Since 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime drama ''Doctors'' began in March 2000, preceding ''Neighbours'' on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial ''High Road'' (formerly ''Take The High Road'') continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched ''[[River City]]'', which proved popular and effectively replaced ''High Road'' when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial ''Brookside'' ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving ''Hollyoaks'' as Channel 4's flagship serial.

A new version of ''Crossroads'' featuring a mostly new cast was produced by [[Carlton Television]] for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled ''[[Night and Day (TV series)|Night and Day]]''. This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003. ''Family Affairs'', which was broadcast opposite the racier ''Hollyoaks'', never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, ''Family Affairs'' had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005.

In 2008, ITV premiered ''[[The Royal Today]]'', a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama ''[[The Royal]]'', which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002. Just days later, soap opera [[parody]] programs ''[[Echo Beach (soap)|Echo Beach]]'' premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy ''[[Moving Wallpaper]]''. Both ''Echo Beach'' and ''The Royal Today'' ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera ''[[Silver Street]]'' debuted on the [[BBC Asian Network]] in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/11_november/16/asian.shtml|title=BBC Press Release|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Format===

UK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original ''Crossroads'', which began as a weekdaily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced. Things started to change in 1989 when ''Coronation Street'' began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded again, to air four episodes a week. ''Brookside'' premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990, it expanded to three episodes a week; the trend was followed by ''EastEnders'' in 1994 and ''Emmerdale'' in 1997, In 2000, the soap went five episodes a week. ''Family Affairs'' debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week throughout its entire run. The imported ''Neighbours'' screens as five new episodes a week, which are shown once at 1:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. and repeated at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Channel 5 each weekday.

Currently, ''Coronation Street'' (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) and ''Hollyoaks'' both produce five episodes a week, while ''EastEnders'' produces four each week. In 2002, ''Brookside'' expanded from three half-hour episodes on different weeknights to airing one 90-minute episode each week. In 2004, ''Emmerdale'' began airing six episodes a week. ''Doctors'' airs five episodes a week, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. It was announced in June 2016 that starting late 2017, Coronation Street would air six episodes a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/feature/a799753/coronation-streets-six-episode-week-a-treat-or-a-terrible-idea/|title=Corrie's 6 episodes: A treat or a terrible idea?|date=1 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of ''Coronation Street'' and ''Emmerdale'' were moved out of their slots. ''Coronation Street'' added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ''Emmerdale''{{'}}s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with rival ''EastEnders''.

In July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, ''Coronation Street'' moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. ''Emmerdale'' reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2524536/Coronation-Streets-Wed-shows-scrapped.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Jen | last=Blackburn | title=Corries Wed shows scrapped | date=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coronation Street has since returned to a Wednesday slot. It now airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. Emmerdale airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.

UK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. Since the 1980s, these programs routinely feature scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on. During their early years, ''Coronation Street'' and ''Emmerdale'' used [[16 mm film]] while scenes were shot on location. Later soap operas such as ''Hollyoaks'' and ''Family Affairs'' started filming on [[high-definition video]], a more modern filming process, as opposed to standard videotape, which features better quality and appears to look more like [[filmizing|film]] than videotape.

UK soap operas do not incorporate [[recap sequence]]s at the beginning of each episode, which would be appropriate for the fact that when an episode ends, it picks up the story during the following episode. However, in 2012, ''Hollyoaks'' began airing a recap sequence at the beginning of each episode. With the exception of ''Hollyoaks'', soap operas in the UK also lack [[incidental music]], although ''EastEnders'' would sometimes feature music that plays over an ending scene if it was dramatic, with an alternative ''EastEnders'' theme known as "[[Julia's theme]]".

==Australia==
:''See [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors]]''
Australia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the UK, [[New Zealand]] and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes. Stylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences.&lt;ref name=Bowles-120&gt;Bowles, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.&lt;ref name=Bowles-120/&gt;

===Early serials===
The genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, ''Big Sister'', featured actress [[Thelma Scott]] in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera ''[[Blue Hills (radio serial)|Blue Hills]]'', which was created by [[Gwen Meredith]] and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was ''[[Autumn Affair]]'' (1958) featuring radio personality and ''Blue Hills'' star [[Queenie Ashton]] making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the [[Seven Network]]. ''Autumn Affair'' failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by ''[[The Story of Peter Grey]]'' (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. ''The Story of Peter Grey'' ran for 164 episodes.

The first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with ''[[Bellbird (soap opera)|Bellbird]]'', produced by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. ''Bellbird'' was a moderate success but built-up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. ''[[Motel (TV series)|Motel]]'' (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.

===The 1970s===
The first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', a nighttime series produced by [[Cash Harmon Television]] for [[Network Ten]], which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as [[homosexuality]], [[adultery]], drug use, rape-within-marriage and [[racism]], which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, ''Number 96'' had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of ''Number 96'' prompted the creation of ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'', which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by [[Crawford Productions]], many critics considered ''The Box'' to be a more slickly produced and better written show than ''Number 96''. ''The Box'' also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after ''Number 96''. For 1974 ''Number 96'' was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year ''The Box'' occupied the number two spot.

Also in 1974, the [[Reg Grundy Organisation]] created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first ''teen'' soap opera, ''[[Class of '74]]''. With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'', its high school setting and early evening timeslot, ''Class of '74'' came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.

By 1975, both ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'', perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. ''Class of '74'' was renamed ''Class of '75'' and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap ''[[The Unisexers]]'' failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap ''[[Until Tomorrow]]'' ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.

A feature film version of ''Bellbird'' entitled ''Country Town'' was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'' also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'' also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.

In November 1976 ''[[The Young Doctors]]'' debuted on the [[Nine Network]]. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'', focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later ''[[The Sullivans]]'', a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a [[Melbourne]] family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, ''The Sullivans'' became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period ''Number 96'' re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. ''Bellbird'' experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.
 
''Bellbird'', ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'', which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. ''The Young Doctors'' and ''The Sullivans'' continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/[[police procedural]] series ''[[Cop Shop]]'' (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]]. In early December 1977 [[Network Ten|Channel Ten]] debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced ''[[The Restless Years]]'' (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.

The Seven Network, achieving success with ''Cop Shop'' produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce ''[[Skyways (TV series)|Skyways]]'', a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show ''[[The Don Lane Show]]''. ''Skyways'', which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, [[prostitution]], drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and [[murder]], and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.

===The 1980s===

The Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic [[family saga]] ''Sons and Daughters'' (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.

Grundy soap ''The Young Doctors'' and Crawford Productions' ''The Sullivans'' continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: ''[[Taurus Rising]]'' (1982), ''[[Waterloo Station (TV series)|Waterloo Station]]'' (1983), ''[[Starting Out]]'' (1983) and ''[[Possession (TV series)|Possession]]'' (1985), along with ''[[Prime Time (Australian TV series)|Prime Time]]''  (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created ''[[Neighbours]]'', a suburban-based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.

Produced in Melbourne at the studios of [[HSV-7]], ''Neighbours'' achieved high ratings in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]] and [[Adelaide]], but not in [[Sydney]], where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show ''[[Perfect Match (Australian game show)|Perfect Match]]'' on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station [[ATN-7]] quickly lost interest in ''Neighbours'' as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep ''Neighbours'' on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas ''A Country Practice'' and ''Sons and Daughters''.

After the network cancelled ''Neighbours'', it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. As of 2015 the series airs on [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.

The success of ''Neighbours'' in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as ''[[Home and Away]]'' (1988–present) on Channel Seven and ''Richmond Hill'' (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however ''Richmond Hill'' emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by ''[[E Street]]'' (1989–1993).

Nine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama ''[[Family and Friends]]'' in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme ''[[Chances (TV series)|Chances]]'' in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of ''Number 96'' and ''The Box'' in an attempt to attract attention. ''Chances'' achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.

===Australian soaps internationally===
Several Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of ''The Young Doctors'', ''The Sullivans'', ''Sons and Daughters'' and ''Neighbours'' (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's ''Prisoner'' began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. ''Prisoner'' also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated ''Prisoner'' in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of ''Sons and Daughters''. During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty'' had resulted in the debuts of ''Taurus Rising'' and ''[[Return to Eden]]'', two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.

Other shows to achieve varying levels of international success include ''Richmond Hill'', ''E Street'', ''[[Paradise Beach]]'' (1993–1994), and ''[[Pacific Drive]]'' (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's ''[[Home and Away]]'', a teen soap developed as a rival to ''[[Neighbours]]'', has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.

===The 1990s and beyond===
''[[Something in the Air (TV series)|Something in the Air]]'', a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.

Attempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' saw the creation of ''[[Echo Point (TV series)|Echo Point]]'' (1995) and ''[[Breakers (TV series)|Breakers]]'' (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, ''Neighbours'' was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode&lt;ref&gt;Mercado, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for ''Neighbours'' had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for.&lt;ref&gt;Kilkelly, Daniel. [http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a44065/neighbours-ratings-a-cause-for-concern.html 'Neighbours' ratings a cause for concern"] ''Digital Spy.'' March 18, 2007. Accessed 2007-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.

It has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes&lt;ref name=Bowles-119/&gt; and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters.&lt;ref name=Bowles-120/&gt; The casts of ''Neighbours'' and ''Home and Away'' are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial,&lt;ref name=Bowles-119/&gt; a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.

''Neighbours'' was carried in the United States on the [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] [[cable channel]] in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as ''All My Children'' and ''The Young and the Restless'', and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.

''[[headLand]]'' made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of ''Home and Away'' that was to have been produced in conjunction with ''Home and Away''{{'}}s UK broadcaster, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]]. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon's ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'' appeared on July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the [[Steven Universe]] episode "Love Letters".

After losing the UK television rights to ''Neighbours'' to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial ''[[Out of the Blue (2008 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'', which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/outoftheblue |title=BBC – Out of the Blue – Homepage |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but low ratings prompted its move to [[BBC Two]] on 19 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/not-out-of-the-blue/2008/05/12/1210444287750.html|title=Out of the Blue fails to impress UK viewers|publisher=AAP|accessdate=2008-05-17 | location=Melbourne | date=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3265 |title=What's on TV – Top TV listings guide, plus soaps, news, prizes and previews |publisher=Whatsontv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707002638/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3265 |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was cancelled after its first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7483890.stm|title=BBC scrap Out of the Blue soap|publisher=''BBC News''|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Neighbours]]''' continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] on January 11, 2011.&lt;ref name="EleventhHeaven"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/eleventh-heaven-as-ten-network-hails-debut/story-e6frg8zx-1225986587144|title=Eleventh heaven as Ten Network hails debut|last=Chessell|first=James|date=13 January 2011|work=The Australian |publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a464336/neighbours-producer-insists-soap-will-reach-30th-anniversary.html |author=Sophie Dainty |title='Neighbours' producer insists soap will reach 30th anniversary |publisher=[[digitalspy.co.uk]] |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==

===Television===

Pioneering series ''[[Pukemanu]]''&lt;ref&gt;NZ On Screen - [http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/pukemanu/series Pukemanu]&lt;/ref&gt; aired over two years (1971–72) and was the [[NZBC]]'s first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/pukemanu/series|title=NZ On Screen|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Close to Home (1975 TV series)|Close to Home]]'' is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on Television One (Formally NZBC, later becoming Television New Zealand) from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make ''[[The Governor (TV series)|The Governor]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/close-to-home-1975/series|title=NZ On Screen|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gloss (TV series)|Gloss]]'' is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap ''Dynasty'', with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in ''[[Shortland Street]]'', which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on [[TV 2 (New Zealand)|TVNZ 2]].

===Radio===
[[Radio New Zealand]] began airing its first radio soap ''[[You Me Now]]'' in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.

==Canada==
Relatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included ''[[Family Passions]]'', ''[[Scarlett Hill]]'', ''[[Strange Paradise]]'', ''[[Metropia (TV series)|Metropia]]'', ''[[Train 48]]'' and the international co-production ''Foreign Affairs''. ''Family Passions'' was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including ''[[49th &amp; Main]]'' and ''[[North/South]]'', have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with [[Canadian content]] regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.

Notable prime time soap operas in Canada have included ''[[Riverdale (1997 TV series)|Riverdale]]'', ''[[House of Pride]]'', ''[[Paradise Falls]]'', ''[[Lance et Compte]]'' ("He Shoots, He Scores"), ''[[Loving Friends and Perfect Couples]]'' and ''[[The City (1999 TV series)|The City]]''. The [[Degrassi (franchise)|''Degrassi'' franchise]] of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.

On French-language television in [[Quebec]], the ''[[téléroman]]'' has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included ''[[Rue des Pignons]]'', ''[[Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut]]'', ''[[Diva (Canadian TV series)|Diva]]'', ''[[La famille Plouffe]]'', and the soap opera parody ''[[Le Cœur a ses raisons]]''.

==India==
{{main|Indian soap opera}}
{{main|Tamil television soap opera}}

Unlike the season based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the late 1990s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.

Many soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like [[Balaji Telefilms]] running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.

==Europe==

===Remakes of Australian serials===
The Australian serial ''The Restless Years'' was remade in the [[Netherlands]] as ''[[Goede tijden, slechte tijden]]'' (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as ''[[Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten]]'' (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to "good times, bad times". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]]. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.

A later Australian serial, ''Sons and Daughters'', has inspired five [[remake]]s produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are ''[[Verbotene Liebe]]'' (Germany, 1995–2015); ''[[Skilda världar]]'' ([[Sweden]], 1996–2002); ''Apagorevmeni agapi'' ([[Greece]], 1998); ''Cuori Rubati'' ([[Italy]], 2002–2003) and ''[[Zabranjena ljubav]]'' ([[Croatia]], 2004–2008). Both ''The Restless Years'' and ''Sons and Daughters'' were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.

===Norway===
The [[Norway|Norwegian]] soap opera ''[[Hotel Cæsar]]'' aired on [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in [[Scandinavia]]. Popular foreign soaps in the country include ''Days of Our Lives'' (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' (TNT (Norway) and ''Home and Away'' ([[TV 2 Norway|TV 2]]), all of which are subtitled.

===Netherlands===
Serials have included ''[[Goede tijden, slechte tijden]]'' (1990–present), ''Onderweg naar Morgen'' (1994–2010) and ''Goudkust'' (1996–2001). In 2016 ''Goede tijden, slechte tijden'' spin-off ''Nieuwe Tijden'' started airing. U.S. daytime serials ''As The World Turns'' and ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' have aired in the Netherlands; ''As the World Turns'' began airing in the country in 1990, with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] subtitles.

===Germany===
In the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before [[Das Erste]] introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with ''[[Lindenstraße]]'', which was seen as a German counterpart to ''Coronation Street''. Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before ''[[Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten]]'' became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the [[RTL Television|RTL]] network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after ''Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten'', Das Erste introduced ''[[Marienhof (TV series)|Marienhof]]'', which aired twice a week.

After successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like ''GZSZ'', the format was based on an Australian soap opera from [[Reg Watson]]. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled ''[[Verbotene Liebe]]'', which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of ''Verbotene Liebe'', the network turned ''Marienhof'' into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced ''[[Unter uns]]'' in late 1994.

[[ZDF]] started a business venture with [[Canada]] and co-produced the short-lived series ''Family Passions'', starring actors such as [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]], [[Roscoe Born]], [[Dietmar Schönherr]] and a young [[Hayden Christensen]]. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted ''Jede Menge Leben''. Even after a crossover with three soaps, ''[[Freunde fürs Leben]]'', ''[[Forsthaus Falkenau]]'' and ''[[Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht]]'', the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. [[Sat.1]] tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera ''Neighbours'', which was dropped in 1995 due to the [[talk show]] phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with ''So ist das Leben – die Wagenfelds'', before failing with ''Geliebte Schwestern''. [[RTL II]] made its own short-lived attempt with ''Alle zusammen - jeder für sich''.

The teen soap opera ''[[Schloss Einstein]]'' debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near [[Berlin]]. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.

In 1999, after the lasting success of ''Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten'', ''Marienhof'', ''Unter uns'' and ''Verbotene Liebe'', [[ProSieben]] aired ''[[Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies]]'', set on [[Mallorca|the Spanish island with the same name]]. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on [[free-to-air]] and [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television]].

In 2006, ''[[Alles was zählt]]'' became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to ''Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten'' and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own [[telenovela]]s, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. ''Unter uns'' was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After ''Unter uns'' was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. ''Marienhof'' had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however ''Marienhof'' was canceled in June 2011. ''Verbotene Liebe'' was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after ''Marienhof'' was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.

While ''Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten'', ''Unter uns'' and ''Alles was zählt'' are currently the only daily soaps on the air after ''Verbotene Liebe'' has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas ''[[Sturm der Liebe]]'' and ''[[Rote Rosen (TV series)|Rote Rosen]]'' are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.

===Belgium===
[[File:Leah Thys thuisdag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leah Thys, actress in the Belgian soap ''[[Thuis]]''. At the back Peter Rouffaer is visible.]]
In [[Belgium]], the two major soap operas are ''[[Thuis]]'' ("Home") and ''[[Familie]]'' ("Family"). Soap operas have been very popular in [[Flanders]], the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. ''Familie'' debuted in late 1991, and with nearly 6,000 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is ''Thuis'', which has aired on "[[één]]" since late 1995. ''Thuis'' is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.3 million Flemmings in total).

During the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as ''Neighbours'' and ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as ''Days of Our Lives'', Australia's ''Home and Away'' and Germany's "Sturm der Liebe". [[Vitaya]] unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera "[[Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden]]" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include ''The Young and the Restless'', ''EastEnders'' (both on VTM), "Port Charles" (at één, then known as TV1) and "Coronation Street" (on Vitaya). "[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.

The only teen soap opera on Belgian television was ''[[Spring (television soap)|Spring]]'' ("Jump" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented [[Ketnet]] and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.

===Italy===
The most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series ''Un posto al sole'' ("A Place Under the Sun"), which had aired on [[Rai 3]] since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]''). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as ''Ricominciare'' ("Starting Over"), ''Cuori rubati'' ("Stolen Hearts"), ''Vivere'' ("Living"), ''Sottocasa'' ("Downstairs"), ''Agrodolce'' ("Bittersweet") and ''Centovetrine'' ("Hundred Shop Windows").

The most popular Italian prime-time drama series, ''Incantesimo'' ("Enchantment"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on [[Rai 1]].

===Ireland===

====Television====
In the early years of [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ's first television soap was ''Tolka Row'', which was set in urban [[Dublin]]. For several years, both ''Tolka Row'' and ''[[The Riordans]]'' were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera ''[[The Riordans]]'', which premiered in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1960s.html |title=rte.ie |publisher=rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for ''The Riordans'' in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted ''Emmerdale Farm'' (now ''Emmerdale''), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, ''The Riordans'' was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his "Agri-soap" [[trilogy]] ''[[Bracken (TV series)|Bracken]]'', starring [[Gabriel Byrne]], whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of ''The Riordans''. [[Bracken (TV series)|Bracken]] was soon replaced by the third "Agri-soap" ''[[Glenroe]]'', which ran until 2001. As RTÉ wanted a drama series for its Sunday night lineup rather than a soap opera, ''On Home Ground'' (2001–2002), ''[[The Clinic (TV series)|The Clinic]]'' (2002–2009) and ''[[Raw (TV series)|RAW]]'' (2010–2013) replaced the agri-soaps of the previous decades.

In 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. ''[[Fair City]]'', which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded ''Fair City'' to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. ''Fair City'' airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on [[RTÉ One]]; however, after rival network TV3 moved ''Coronation Street'' to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of ''Fair City'' began airing at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. each week.

[[TG4]] produce the Irish language soap ''[[Ros na Rún]]'' ("Headland of the Secrets" or "Headland of the Sweethearts"); set in the fictional village of ''Ros Na Rún'', located outside [[Galway]] and near [[Spiddal]], it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of ''Ros Na Rún'' has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including [[domestic violence]], [[infidelity]], [[theft]], [[arson]], [[abortion]], homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, [[teen pregnancy]] and [[paedophilia]]. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. ''Ros na Rún'' is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.

Although Ireland has access to international soaps (such as ''Coronation Street'', ''Emmerdale'', ''EastEnders'', ''Home and Away'', ''Hollyoaks'' and ''[[Neighbours]]''), ''Fair City'' continues to outperform them all, and is Ireland's most popular soap opera, with the show peaking at over 700,000 viewers.

January 2015 ''[[Red Rock (TV series)|Red Rock]]'' has broadcast on TV3. Red Rock airs twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series is base in a fishing village in Dublin. The soaps centres around the local Garda station but also includes stories from the village.

====Radio====
[[RTÉ Radio]] produced its first radio soap, ''Kennedys of Castleross'', which ran from April 13, 1955 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1950s.html |title=rte.ie |publisher=rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1980s.html |title=rte.ie |publisher=rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, ''Harbour Hotel'', which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, ''Konvenience Korner'' and ''Riverrun'', which were followed in 2004 by ''Driftwood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/driftwood/1016346.html |title=rte.ie |publisher=rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921201707/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/driftwood/1016346.html |archivedate=September 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however [[RTÉ Radio 1]] continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/drama/ |title=rte.ie |publisher=rte.ie |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In [[Greece]], there have been several soap operas.

====ANT1====
An early serial was ''Sti skia tou hrimatos'' ("Money Shadows"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of ''Lampsi'' ("the Shining"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of ''Lampsi'' came the short lived ''To galazio diamandi'' ("Blue Diamond") and ''Simphonia siopis'' ("Omertà"). ''Lampsi'' was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by ''Erotas'' ("Love"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.

Greece's second longest-running soap is ''Kalimera Zoi'' ("Goodmorning Life"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.

====MEGA====
Mega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial ''I Dipsa'' ("The Thirst"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included ''Paralliloi dromoi'' (1992–1994) and its successor ''Haravgi'' ("Daylight", 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials ''Apagorevmeni Agapi'' ("Forbidden Love"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; ''Gia mia thesi ston Ilio'' ("A Spot Under the Sun"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; ''Filodoxies'' ("Expectations"), which ran  from 2002 to 2006; and ''Vera Sto Deksi'' ("Ring on the Right Hand"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to ''Lampsi'', causing that show's ratings to decline.

''Ta Mistika Tis Edem'' ("Edem Secrets"), which was created by the producers of ''Vera Sto Deksi'', debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.

====ERT====
IENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas ''I Kravgi Ton Likon'' and ''Megistanes''. ERT also produced the long-running soap ''O Simvoleografos''. Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas, which included ''Pathos'' ("Passion"), ''Erotika tis Edem'' ("Loving in Eden") and ''Ta ftera tou erota'' ("The Wings of Love"). These failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.

====ALPHA====
Alpha produced ''Kato apo tin Acropoli'' ("Under the Acropolis"), which ran for 2½ years.

===Cyprus===

====Weekday shows====
The first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV's ''Odos Den Ksehno'' ("'Don't Forget' Street"), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by ''To Serial'', which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998. [[CyBC]] created the third weekdaily soap, ''Anemi Tou Pathous'' ("Passion Winds"), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by ''I Platia'' ("The Square") from September 2004 to July 2006. ''Epikindini Zoni'' ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. ''Vimata Stin Ammo'' made its debut in September 2010.

[[Sigma TV]] first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap ''Sto Para Pente'', which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and first held the distinction of being the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by ''Se Fonto Kokkino'', which ran from September 2008 to July 2012. Other Sigma TV weekday shows include ''Akti Oniron'' (which ran from 1999 to 2001), ''Vourate Geitonoi'' (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekdaily series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), ''Oi Takkoi'' (which ran from 2002 to 2005), ''S' Agapo'' (which ran from 2001 to 2002), ''Vasiliki'' (which ran from 2005 to 2006), ''Vendetta'' (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), ''30 kai Kati'' (which ran from 2006 to 2007) and ''Mila Mou'' (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009).

[[ANT1 Cyprus]] aired the soap ''I Goitia Tis Amartias'' in 2002, which was soon canceled. ''Dikse Mou To Filo Sou'' followed from 2006 to 2009, along with ''Gia Tin Agapi Sou'', which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by ''Panselinos'', which has aired since 2009.

====Weekly shows====
The longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is ''Istories Tou Horkou'' ("Villages Stories", which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by ''Manolis Ke Katina'' ("Manolis and Katina", which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was ''To Kafenio'' ("The Coffee Shop"), which premiered on CyBC on 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekdaily show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus on 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1's ''Eleni I Porni'' ("Eleni, The Whore"), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC's ''Stin Akri Tu Paradisou'' ("At The Heaven's Edge"), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was ''Aigia Fuxia'', which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.

===Finland===
The only daily Finnish soap opera so far is ''[[Salatut elämät]]'' (''Secret Lives''), which has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on [[MTV3]]. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in [[Helsinki]]. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012.

Other soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows ''Uusi päivä'' (which has aired since 2009) and ''Kotikatu'' (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs do not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.

==Internet and mobile soap opera==
{{main|Mobile soap opera}}
With the advent of [[internet television]] and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'', a spin-off of the established ''EastEnders''. For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.

On September 13, 2011, [[TG4]] launched a new 10-part online series titled, ''[[Ros na Rún|Na Rúin]]'' (an Internet spin-off of ''[[Ros na Rún]]''). The miniseries took on the theme of a [[Mystery film|mystery]]; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.

==Parodies==
In motion pictures, the 1982 comedy ''[[Tootsie]]'' has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.

The 1991 comedy ''[[Soapdish]]'' stars [[Sally Field]] as an aging soap opera actress on fictional series ''The Sun Also Sets'' who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes such as her live-in [[boyfriend]] who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the program.

Another 1991 comedy, [[Delirious (1991 film)|Delirious]], stars [[John Candy]] as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.

On television, several soap opera [[Parody|parodies]] have been produced:
*''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967–78) featured a recurring skit, "[[As the Stomach Turns]]", that spoofed the American soap opera ''As the World Turns''.
* Two of the most famous U.S. parodies were the series ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' (1976–77) and ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' (1977–81), the latter of which was a weekly sitcom/soap opera parody.
* ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'' was a 1986 American [[miniseries]] spoof of the primetime serials of the period.
* The recurring "[[Acorn Antiques]]" skit on the UK's ''[[Victoria Wood As Seen On TV]]'' (1985–87) was modeled on ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' and other British soap operas of the 1970s.
* ''[[Let The Blood Run Free]]'' (1990–94) was an Australian parody of medical drama series.
* The 1990–91 ABC drama ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' was a primetime series that poked fun at the genre. Episodes during the series' first season also included a fictional soap within the stories, titled ''Invitation to Love''.
* ''Shark Bay'' (1996) was an Australian parody of glamorous beachside soap operas. It featured many actors who had appeared in Australian soap operas ''Sons and Daughters'', ''Prisoner'', ''Home and Away'' and ''Neighbours''.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* The 2000–2001 [[The WB|WB]] sitcom ''[[Grosse Pointe (TV series)|Grosse Pointe]]'' was a self-parody of creator [[Darren Star]]'s behind-the-scenes experiences producing nighttime soaps, in particular ''Beverly Hills, 90210''.
* South African comedian [[Casper de Vries]] produced the soap opera parody ''[[Casper de Vries#Television|Haak en Steek]]'' (which ran from 2003 to 2004), based on South African soaps like ''[[Egoli: Place of Gold]]''.
* The ABC dramedy ''[[Dirty Sexy Money]]'' (which ran from 2007 to 2009) was in a way a soap opera parody but, in actuality, was styled as more of a [[satire]] that operated in a humorous way similar to a parody. The series was critically acclaimed,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} but only lasted for two seasons.
* The now-cancelled ABC soap opera ''One Life to Live'' would often poke fun at the genre as well, even featuring a soap within the soap called ''Fraternity Row'', which many of ''One Life to Live''{{'}}s characters had either worked on or watched. Months after ABC announced in April 2011 that it would cancel ''One Life to Live'', the series featured a storyline in which ''Fraternity Row'' itself was cancelled, leading the character of [[Roxy Balsom]] ([[Ilene Kristen]]) to desperately try and save the series, to no avail. A special episode that aired on December 19, 2011 featured the cast of ''One Life to Live'' acting out an episode of ''Fraternity Row'' in a dream of Roxy's; the episode poked fun at both  ''One Life to Live'' and the entire genre itself, featuring many soap opera stereotypes such as over-acting, outrageous story lines, bad casting and incestuous relationships; it also parodied some storylines featured on the real-world soap. The second-to-last episode of ''One Life to Live'' showed characters watching the final episode of ''Fraternity Row'' and exposing the show's last big secret: the series' main heroine and protagonist, Lorraine King Vonvaldenburg Baxter Beumont, was really a man.
* ''[[Second City TV]]'' featured ''The Days of the Week'': "Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. These are...The Days of the Week."
* The ABC comedy-drama ''Desperate Housewives'' (which ran from 2004 to 2012) was a semi-satirical nighttime series that took many elements from the genre.
* The [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[Tender Touches]]'' which premiered in 2017 is a parody of soap operas.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwarz|first=John|title=Adult Swim To Premiere Five Nights Of &amp;#8220;Tender Touches&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Bubbleblabber|url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/adult-swim-to-premiere-five-nights-of-tender-touches/|work=Bubbleblabber|publisher=bubbleblabber.com|date=17 December 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stroke order''' refers to the order in which the [[Stroke (Chinese character)|strokes]] of a [[Chinese character]] (or [[Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages|Chinese derivative character]]) are written. A stroke is a movement of a writing instrument on a writing surface. Chinese characters are used in various forms in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]]. They are known as ''[[Hanzi]]'' in ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]), ''[[kanji]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and ''[[Hanja]]'' in Korean. Stroke order is also attested in other [[logogram | logographic scripts]], e.g. [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bramanti|first1=Armando|title=Rethinking the Writing Space: Anatomy of Some Early Dynastic Signs|journal=Current Research in Cuneiform Palaeography. Proceedings of the Workshop organised at the 60ᵗʰ Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Warsaw 2014, pp. 31-47|date=2015|url=https://www.academia.edu/21411909/2015._Rethinking_the_Writing_Space_Anatomy_of_Some_Early_Dynastic_Signs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
[[Chinese character]]s are basically [[logogram]]s constructed with strokes. Over the millennia a set of generally agreed rules have been developed by custom. Minor variations exist between countries, but the basic principles remain the same, namely that writing characters should be economical, with the fewest hand movements to write the most strokes possible. This promotes writing speed, accuracy, and readability. This idea is particularly important since as learners progress, characters often get more complex. Since stroke order also aids learning and memorization, students are often taught about it from a very early age in schools and encouraged to follow them. 

The [[Eight Principles of Yong]] (永字八法 [[Pinyin]]: ''yǒngzì bā fǎ''; Japanese: ''eiji happō''; Korean: 영자팔법, ''yeongjapalbeop'', ''yŏngjap'albŏp'') uses the single character {{wiktmul|永}}, meaning "eternity", to teach eight of the most basic strokes in [[Regular Script]].

===Ancient China===
In [[ancient China]], the [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén characters]] carved on [[ox]] [[scapula]] and [[tortoise]] [[plastrons]] showed no indication of stroke order. The characters show huge variations from piece to piece, sometimes even within one piece. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone (to be carved in a workshop later). Although the brush-written stroke order is not discernible after carving, there exists some evidence that it was not entirely idiosyncratic: a few of the characters, often marginal administrative notations recording the provenance of the shells or bones, were not later recarved, and the stroke order of these characters tends to resemble traditional and modern stroke order.&lt;ref name="Keightley 1978"&gt;{{harvnb|Keightley|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those characters (the vast majority) which were later engraved into the hard surface using a knife, perhaps by a separate individual, there is evidence (from incompletely engraved pieces) that in at least some cases all the strokes running one way were carved, then the piece was turned, and strokes running another way were then carved.&lt;ref name="Keightley 1978" /&gt;

===Imperial China===
In early [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]], the common script was the [[Xiaozhuan|Xiaozhuan style]]. About 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first to conquer all of China, imposed [[Li Si]]'s character uniformisation, a set of 3300 standardized ''Xiǎozhuàn'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fazzioli|1987|p=13|quote="And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''S&amp;#x101;n Ch&amp;#x101;ng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its graphs on old steles — some dating from 200 BC — reveal indications of the stroke order of the time. However, stroke order could still not yet be ascertained from the steles, and no paper from that time is extant.

The true starting point of stroke order is the [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text. In theory, by looking at the Lìshū style steles' graphs and the placement of each stroke, one can see hierarchical priority between the strokes, which indicates the stroke order used by the calligrapher or stele sculptors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (regular script) — still in use today —  is more regularized, allowing one to more easily guess the stroke order used to write on the steles. The stroke order 1000 years ago was similar to that toward the end of Imperial China.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} For example, the stroke order of &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt; is clear in the [[Kangxi dictionary]] of 1716; but in a modern book, the official stroke order (the same) will not appear clearly. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while current stroke order is still the same, according to the old style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangxi|1716|p=41}} See by example the radicals &lt;big&gt;卩&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;厂&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt;. The 2007 common shape for those characters don't allow clearly to "guess" the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow us to guess the stroke order.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stroke orders implied by the Kangxi dictionary are not necessarily similar to nowadays' norm.

===Cursive styles and hand-written styles===
Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|Xíngshū]]'' (semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Grass script|Cǎoshū]]'' (cursive or grass script) show stroke order more clearly than Regular Script, as each move made by the writing tool is visible.

The modern governments of mainland China, Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edbchinese.hk/lexlist_ch/|title=香港小學學習字詞表|author=|date=|website=www.edbchinese.hk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stroke-order.learningweb.moe.edu.tw/character.do|title=常用國字標準字體筆順學習網|author=|date=|website=stroke-order.learningweb.moe.edu.tw|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kakijun.jp/|title=漢字の正しい書き順(筆順)|first=|last=kakijun|date=|website=漢字の正しい書き順(筆順)|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have [[standardization|standardized]] official stroke orders to be taught in schools. These stroke order standards are prescribed in conjunction to each government's standard character sets. The various official stroke orders agree on the vast majority of characters, but each have their differences. No governmental standard matches traditional stroke orders completely. The differences between the governmental standards and traditional stroke orders arise from accommodation for schoolchildren who may be overwhelmed if the rules about stroke orders are too detailed, or if there are too many exceptions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The differences listed below are not exhaustive.
* '''Traditional stroke order''': Widely used in [[Imperial China]], currently used in the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] secondary to each region's governmental standards. Practiced mainly by informed scholars of calligraphy. Also called "calligraphic" stroke order. These stroke orders are established by study of handwritten documents from pre-Republic China, especially those of notable calligraphers. These stroke orders are most conservative regarding etymology, character construction, character evolution, and tradition. Many characters have more than one stroke correct [[Variant Chinese character|form]]. Stroke orders may vary depending on the [[Chinese script styles|script style]]. Unlike the other standards, this is not a governmental standard.
* '''Japanese stroke order''': Prescribed mostly in modern [[Japan]]. The standard character set of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] is the [[Jōyō kanji]], which contains many characters [[shinjitai|reformed]] in 1946. The MEXT lets editors freely prescribe a character's stroke order, which all should "follow commonsensical orders which are widely accepted in the society"{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. This standard diverges from the traditional stroke order in that the two sides of the grass radical ([[wikt:艹|艹]]) are joined, and written with three strokes. Also, this standard is influenced by [[semi-cursive script]], leading to some vertical strokes to precede intersecting horizontal strokes if the vertical stroke does not pass through the lowest horizontal stroke, as in 隹 and 生. 必 is written with the top dot first, while the traditional stroke order writes the 丿 first.
* '''Taiwan stroke order''' ({{harvnb|Li|al.|1995}}): Prescribed mostly in modern [[Taiwan]]. The standard character set of the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|ROC Ministry of Education]] is the [[Standard Form of National Characters]]. This standard diverges from the traditional stroke order in that the upper-right dot of the 戈 component is written second to last. The vertical stroke in [[wikt:忄|忄]] is written second. 成 starts with the horizontal. Also, the [[wikt:𠂇|𠂇]] component, as seen in 左 and 右, is written with the horizontal stroke first in all instances, while the traditional stroke order differentiates the stroke order of [[wikt:𠂇|𠂇]] according to etymology and character structure.
* '''Mainland China stroke order''': Prescribed mostly in modern [[Mainland China]]. In 1956, the government of the PRC introduced many newly created characters and substitutions, called [[Simplified Chinese character]]s, which form part of the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|PRC Ministry of Education]]'s standard character set, the [[Xiàndài Hànyǔ Chángyòng Zìbiǎo]]. This in turn reformed the stroke order of many characters. Besides these characters, this standard diverges from the traditional stroke order in characters with the [[wikt:艹|艹]] radical, merging both sides like the Japanese standard. Also, the horizontal stroke of the [[wikt:𠂇|𠂇]] component is written first in all instances. 乃 ends with 丿. 成 starts with the horizontal. In 1997, the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|PRC Ministry of Education]] published the official stroke order standard for commonly used characters.
* '''Hong Kong stroke order''': Prescribed mostly in modern [[Hong Kong]]. The standard character set of the Hong Kong [[Education Bureau]] is the [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters]]. In this standard, [[wikt:艹|艹]] is written vertical-horizontal-vertical-horizontal, instead of the traditional vertical-horizontal-horizontal-vertical. 成 starts with the horizontal.

== Alternative stroke orders ==
Besides general errors and regional differences in stroke order, it is common in the PRC to apply alternative stroke orders which resemble PRC stroke orders to Traditional Chinese characters, although the PRC generally uses Simplified characters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the below example, the traditional character 問 (simplified: 问) is shown with both the traditional stroke order (left, starting with the left vertical stroke), as in imperial China, Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, and with the Simplified stroke order (right, with the left vertical stroke fourth).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== General guidelines ==
'''''Note:''' There are exceptions within and among different standards. The following are only guidelines.''

'''1. Write from top to bottom, and left to right.''' [[File:三-order.gif|40px]]

As a general rule, strokes are written from top to bottom and left to right. For example, among the first characters usually learned is the number one, which is written with a single horizontal line: 一. This character has one stroke which is written from left to right.

The character for "two" has two strokes: 二. In this case, both are written from left to right, but the top stroke is written first. The character for "three" has three strokes: 三. Each stroke is written from left to right, starting with the uppermost stroke.
[[File:人-red.png|thumb|200px|right|The Chinese character meaning "person" ([[File:人-order.gif|20px|人 animation]], [[Mandarin Chinese]]: ''rén'', [[Cantonese|Cantonese Chinese]]: ''yàhn'', [[Korean language|Korean]]: ''in'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''hito'', ''nin; jin'').  The character has two strokes, the first shown here in dark, and the second in red.  The black area represents the starting position of the writing instrument.]]
This rule also applies to the order of components. For example, 校 can be divided into two. The entire left side (木) is written before the right side (交). There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly occurring when the right side of a character has a lower enclosure (see below).

When there are upper and lower components, the upper components are written first, then the lower components, as in 品 and 星.

'''2. Horizontal before vertical''' [[File:十-order.gif|40px]]

When horizontal and vertical strokes cross, horizontal strokes are usually written before vertical strokes: the character for "ten," 十, has two strokes. The horizontal stroke 一 is written first, followed by the vertical stroke &lt;span style="color:red; font-size:100%;"&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; 十.

In the Japanese standard, a vertical stroke may precede many intersecting horizontal strokes if the vertical stroke does not pass through the lowest horizontal stroke.

'''3. Character-spanning strokes last''' [[File:聿-order.gif|40px]]

Vertical strokes that pass through many other strokes are written after the strokes through which they pass, as in 聿 and 弗.

Horizontal strokes that pass through many other strokes are written last, as in 毋 and 舟.

'''4. Diagonals right-to-left before diagonals left-to-right''' [[File:文-order.gif|40px]]

Right-to-left diagonals (丿) are written before left-to-right diagonals (乀): 文.

Note that this is for symmetric diagonals; for asymmetric diagonals, as in 戈, the left-to-right may precede the right-to-left, based on other rules.

'''5. Center before outside in vertically symmetrical characters''' [[File:水-order.gif|40px]]

In vertically symmetrical characters, the center components are written before components on the left or right. Components on the left are written before components on the right, as in 兜 and 承.

'''6. Enclosures before contents''' [[File:回-order.gif|40px]] [[File:国-order.gif|40px]]

Outside enclosing components are written before inside components; bottom strokes in the enclosure are written last if present, as in 日 and 口. (A common mnemonic is "Put people inside first, then close the door.") Enclosures may also have no bottom stroke, as in 同 and 月.

'''7. Left vertical before enclosing''' [[File:口-order.gif|40px]]

Left vertical strokes are written before enclosing strokes. In the following two examples, the leftmost vertical stroke (|) is written first, followed by the uppermost and rightmost lines (┐) (which are written as one stroke): 日 and 口.

'''8. Bottom enclosures last''' [[File:道-order.gif|40px]]

Bottom enclosing components are usually written last: 道, 建, 凶.

'''9. Dots and minor strokes last''' [[File:玉-order.gif|40px]]

Minor strokes are usually written last, as the small "dot" in the following: 玉, 求, 朮.

== Representations ==
There are various ways to describe the stroke order of a character. Children learn the stroke order in courses, as part of writing learning. Various graphical representations are possible, most notably successive images of the character with one more stroke added (or changing color) each time, numbering strokes, color-coding, fanning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lri.fr/~dragice/strokefanning/ |title=Stroke Fanning |website=Lri.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently animations. Stroke order is often described in person by writing characters on paper or in the air.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5154">'''''Strong female character''''' is a term for a class of [[stock character]]. It is the opposite of the [[damsel in distress]] stock character. In the first half of the 20th century, the rise of mainstream [[feminism]] and the increased use of the concept in the later 20th century have reduced the concept to a standard item of [[popular culture|pop culture]] fiction.

Whether female characters are strong enough is often used as a gauge of story quality by critics, in a similar manner to whether the story passes the [[Bechdel test]]. However, some have criticized this metric for causing authors to avoid creating female characters with realistic weaknesses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952390126|title=Marvel's Black Widow from Spy to Superhero: Essays on an Avenger with a Very Specific Skill Set|last=Ginn|first=Sherry|publisher=McFarland|others=|year=2017|isbn=9780786498192|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=24-25|oclc=952390126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traits ==
According to Carina Chocano, the strong female character has become a "cinematic [[cliché]]", resulting in character archetypes like the "alpha professional" whose laser-like focus on career advancement has caused her to become a "grim, celibate automaton", and the "gloomy ninja with commitment issues". By this metric, the strong female character is a woman with the gendered behavior taken out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is no clear consensus on the definition of "strong female character". Some believe it describes characters with powerful physical abilities, such as those of [[Buffy Summers]] or [[Katniss Everdeen]]. Others believe it to represent the quality of a character's "inner life" and their relative importance in the story.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Despite the archetype arising largely through feminism, it has not been universally well received by those supportive of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/11/katniss-everdeen_n_5481087.html|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=June 21, 2014|title=Is Katniss Everdeen Actually A Strong Female Character?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophia McDougall]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' has criticized the high prevalence of strong female characters for creating a [[cliché]] that represents women as unrealistically strong; she argues that the simplicity of this archetype does little to present women in media in a realistic, complex way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/i-hate-strong-female-characters|publisher=''[[New Statesman]]''|title=I hate Strong Female Characters: Sherlock Holmes gets to be brilliant, solitary, abrasive, Bohemian, whimsical, brave, sad, manipulative, neurotic, vain, untidy, fastidious, artistic, courteous, rude, a polymath genius. Female characters get to be Strong.|date=August 15, 2013|last=McDougall|first=Sophia|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carina Chocano from ''[[The New York Times]]'' has offered similar criticism for the "shorthand meme" of strong female characters; while she sees them as a "gateway drug" to realistic representation, she takes offense at the implication that female characters are "not interesting or worth identifying with" if they are not cold, flawless, and masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/a-plague-of-strong-female-characters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=‘Tough, Cold, Terse, Taciturn and Prone to Not Saying Goodbye When They Hang Up the Phone’|date=July 1, 2011|last=Chocano|first=Carina|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Alison Willmore of [[BuzzFeed]] takes issue with popular interpretation of the word "strong" rather than with the archetype itself; she prefers strong female characters in the sense of well-developed ones given a legitimate point of view over "badass" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonwillmore/roman-polanskis-new-movie-explores-the-real-meaning-of-stron|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|title=Roman Polanski’s New Movie Explores The Real Meaning Of "Strong Female Character"|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Faircloth of the feminist blog [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] believes that strong female characters are not enough or required, but that women must have integral roles in the plot apart from helping men realize theirs (rather than, "seamlessly replace[able] with a floor lamp").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553|publisher=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=June 17, 2014|last=Faircloth|first=Kelly|accessdate=June 21, 2014|title='Strong Female Characters' Aren't Enough, Goddammit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">The '''iron mines of Tele-Nugar''' are located approximately 155&amp;nbsp;km south of the regional center of [[Melfi, Chad|Melfi]], in [[Barh Signaka| Barhr Signaka Department]], [[Guera Region]], [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2054/ Les curieuses mines de fer de Télé-Nugar - UNESCO World Heritage Centre] Retrieved 2009-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site description ==
Discovered in 1911, the iron mines comprise an area roughly 1000 m in diameter.  The [[Fanian]] people who utilized the site extracted iron and reduced it into a final product.  Several holes can be found dispersed throughout the site, allowing sufficient ventilation and illumination for the miners working below.  Pillars help support a main arch in the mine, which were sculpted directly into the walls.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Archaeological specimens found at the site include stove walls used for iron reduction, blast pipe fragments, pottery shards, and slag heaps.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

== Other site uses ==
In addition to being used as a source of iron and processing location, the mine was also used as defensive shelter for the Fanians during raids from the [[Ouaddai Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

== World Heritage status ==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on July 21, 2005 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

'''''The Circuit Rider''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Alexander Phimister Proctor]], located in Capitol Park, east of the [[Oregon State Capitol]] in [[Salem, Oregon]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.springfieldmuseum.com/robert-asbury-booth.html|title=City History by People: Robert Asbury Booth|publisher=The Springfield Museum|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/explore/exhibits/capitol.aspx|title=Capitol Tour Web Exhibit|accessdate=March 17, 2014|publisher=[[Oregon Blue Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
According to the Springfield Museum, ''The Circuit Rider'' depicts "one of Oregon's pioneer [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit-riding]] Methodist ministers" and commemorates "the labors and achievements of the ministers of the Gospel, who as circuit riders became the friends, counselors and evengels to the pioneers on every American frontier."&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; The ''[[Oregon Blue Book]]'' says the [[equestrian statue]] is "symbolic of the many missionaries who came to Oregon".&lt;ref name=OBB/&gt;

The 3.5-ton statue was cast by [[Roman Bronze Works]] in New York and was gifted to the State of Oregon in 1924. It was presented "in reverent and grateful remembrance of Robert Booth, pioneer minister of the Oregon Country" by his son, Robert Asbury Booth, who was a prominent [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] businessman and Oregon State Highway Commissioner.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!310872~!0#focus|title=The Circuit Rider, (sculpture).|accessdate=March 17, 2014|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was originally sited at the west front of the old Capitol building and was relocated during construction of the new Capitol building (c. 1936–1937).&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; It fell off its pedestal during the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]] due to high winds.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; In 1993, the statue was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program, which concluded that "treatment [was] needed".&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

'''The Netherlands Institute for the Near East''' (Dutch: ''Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten''; colloquially known by its abbreviation: '''NINO''') is an institution for the advancement of the study of the [[Ancient Near East]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. It is an independent foundation with close ties to [[Leiden University]], housed at the Faculty of Humanities. The institute was founded in 1939.
In 2017 the board of NINO decided to integrate the library into Leiden university and to transform the institute to a pure "research school" &lt;ref&gt;petition at ipetitions.com, June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Library ==
The NINO library holds ca. 50.000 titles (scientific books and journals) in the fields of [[Assyriology]], [[Egyptology]], [[Near Eastern Archaeology]] and related fields. On 1 January 2018 the NINO library became part of [[Leiden University Library|Leiden University Libraries]].

== Publications and research ==
NINO publishes the journal ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'' and the annuary ''Anatolica''. Its current monograph series are ''PIHANS'', ''Egyptological Publications'' and ''Achaemenid History''. Fieldwork projects were and are carried out in Turkey, Syria and Iraq (survey and excavation in the [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Rania Plain]], notably at [[Tell Shemshara]]).

== Collections ==
The institute holds several collections, the best known of which is the De Liagre Böhl Collection, which incorporates the largest collection of [[cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] in the Netherlands. Some highlights from the Böhl Collection are on display at the nearby [[National Museum of Antiquities (Netherlands)|National Museum of Antiquities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">A '''therapeutic privilege''' (or ''therapeutic exception'') refers to an uncommon situation whereby a [[physician]] may be excused from revealing information to a patient when disclosing it would pose a serious [[psychological]] threat, so serious a threat as to be medically [[contraindication|contraindicated]].&lt;ref name="virtualmentor.ama-assn.org"&gt;http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2004/02/msoc1-0402.html&lt;/ref&gt; The therapeutic privilege is an exception to the general rule of [[informed consent]], and only applies when disclosure of the information itself could pose serious and immediate harm to the patient, such as prompting [[suicidal behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van den Heever P |title=Pleading the defence of therapeutic privilege |journal=S Afr Med J |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=420–1 |year=2005 |pmid=16100889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception of therapeutic privilege does not apply when disclosure will merely lead to refusal of care that the physician thinks beneficial.&lt;ref name="virtualmentor.ama-assn.org"/&gt;

'''Thomas Jevon''' (1652–1688) was an English playwright, and one of the first English [[Harlequin]]s. He began his career as a dancing master, but worked his way onto the stage, and played leading low-comedy parts in London between 1673 and 1688. His brother-in-law was the English playwright and poet laureate [[Thomas Shadwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Jevon, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jevon's only published play, the farce ''The Devil of a Wife, or, a Comical Transformation'' (with a plot borrowed from a [[Philip Sidney]] story, and possibly some assistance from Shadwell), was performed in 1686 at Dorset Garden, where Jevon usually acted. Jevon and [[George Powell (playwright)|George Powell]] played the two leading roles, and the piece achieved great success. Various versions with added music appeared later, and [[Charles Coffey]] used it as the basis of his opera ''The Devil to Pay'' in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Timothy Daniel Sullivan''' (July 23, 1862 – August 31, 1913) was a New York politician who controlled [[Manhattan]]'s [[Bowery, Manhattan|Bowery]] and [[Lower East Side]] districts as a prominent leader within [[Tammany Hall]]. He was euphemistically known as "Dry Dollar", as the "Big Feller", and, later, as "Big Tim" (because of his physical stature). He amassed a large fortune as a businessman running vaudeville and legitimate theaters, as well as nickelodeons, race tracks and athletic clubs. Sullivan in 1911 pushed through the legislature the [[Sullivan Act]], an early [[gun control]] measure. He was a strong supporter of [[organized labor]] and [[women's suffrage]].  The newspapers depicted Big Tim as the spider in the center of the web, overstating his criminal activities and his control over gambling in the city.  Welch says that, "assigning the role of vice lord to Sullivan gave Tammany's enemies a weapon to be wielded in every municipal election between 1886 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F, Welch,  ''King of the Bowery '' p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Larry Mulligan and Timothy Sullivan.jpg|left|thumb|Larry Mulligan and Tim Sullivan (right)]] 
He was born in the slum of [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] to Daniel O. Sullivan and his wife Catherine Connelly (or Conley), immigrants from [[Kenmare]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland. His father, a Union veteran of the [[American Civil War]], died of Typhus in October 1867 at age thirty-six, leaving his wife to care for their four children. Three years later, Catherine Sullivan married again  to an alcoholic laborer of Irish descent named Lawrence Mulligan, having six children by him.&lt;ref&gt;Records, Mulligan, Lawrence &amp; Catherine, Transfiguration Church, 29 Mott Street, New York City, May 1869. See also:  Schedule 1, "Inhabitants in the 6th District, 6th Ward in the County of New York," p. 11. Census, New York City 1870, 6th Ward.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age eight, Tim Sullivan began shining shoes and selling newspapers on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]] in lower [[Manhattan]]. By his mid-twenties, he was the part or full owner of six saloons, which was the career of choice for aspiring politicians. Sullivan attracted the attention of local politicians, notably [[Thomas "Fatty" Walsh]], a prominent [[Tammany Hall]] ward leader and father of stage actress [[Blanche Walsh]].

In 1886, Sullivan married Helen Fitzgerald. He gradually began building one of the most powerful [[political machine]]s, which would control virtually all jobs and vice below 14th Street in Manhattan. His base was his headquarters at 207 Bowery. By 1892, Tammany Hall leader [[Richard Croker]] appointed Sullivan leader of his assembly district of the [[Lower East Side]].

==Political career==
Sullivan was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co., 2nd D.) in [[110th New York State Legislature|1887]], [[111th New York State Legislature|1888]], [[112th New York State Legislature|1889]], [[113th New York State Legislature|1890]], [[114th New York State Legislature|1891]], [[115th New York State Legislature|1892]] and [[116th New York State Legislature|1893]].

He was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1894 to 1902, sitting in the [[117th New York State Legislature|117th]], [[118th New York State Legislature|118th]] (both 9th D.), [[119th New York State Legislature|119th]], [[120th New York State Legislature|120th]], [[121st New York State Legislature|121st]], [[122nd New York State Legislature|122nd]], [[123rd New York State Legislature|123rd]], [[124th New York State Legislature|124th]] and [[125th New York State Legislature]]s (all seven 11th D.).

He was elected as a Democrat to the [[58th United States Congress|58th]] and [[59th United States Congress]]es, holding office from March 4, 1903, until his resignation on July 27, 1906. According to some accounts, Sullivan was dissatisfied with the graft and anonymity of Washington political life, prompting his resignation. he was quoted as saying, "There's nothing in this Congressman business.  They know 'em in Washington.  The people down there use 'em as hitchin'-posts.  Every time they see a Congressman on the streets they tie their horses to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacNeil |first=Neil|date=1963 |title= Forge of Democracy: The House of Representatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AmJAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22every+time+they+see+a+congressman%22&amp;dq=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22every+time+they+see+a+congressman%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIxomRh56TxwIVCz8-Ch1sGw6v |location=New York, NY |publisher=David McKay Company |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was again a member of the State Senate (12th D.) from 1909 to 1912, sitting in the [[132nd New York State Legislature|132nd]], [[133rd New York State Legislature|133rd]], [[134th New York State Legislature|134th]] and [[135th New York State Legislature]]s. In November 1912, he was elected to the [[63rd United States Congress]] but, due to ill health, did not take his seat, and died a few months into his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carlebach |first=Michael |date=2011 |title=Bain's New York: The City in News Pictures 1900-1925 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Rr2lvoFsAQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22congress%22+%221912%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIo9rXkp-TxwIVxRw-Ch39-wC2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22timothy%22%20%22sullivan%22%20%22congress%22%20%221912%22&amp;f=false |location=Mineola, NY |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |page=179 |isbn=978-0-4864-7858-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It could be said that Sullivan was one of the earliest political reformers, since he was aligned with women's rights activist [[Frances Perkins]] and sponsored legislation limiting the maximum number of hours women were forced to work, improving the conditions of stable and delivery horses and the [[Sullivan Law]], city [[gun control]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;3Chapter 195, "An Act to Amend the [New York State] Penal Law in Relation to the Sale and Carrying of Dangerous Weapons." May 1911. See also: "Suffragists Cheer Big Tim Sullivan..." New York Times, March 31, 1912. C6. For a listing of Sullivan's legislative activity, see: New York Legislative Index, 1909-1912.

==Rise to power in Tammany Hall==

(Westport, CT. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with various other Sullivans, Big Tim also branched out into popular amusement venues such as [[Dreamland (amusement park)|Dreamland]] in Coney Island, where he installed a distant relative, Dennis, as the political leader.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, ("Flatnose Denny) was a brother of U.S. Rep. Christopher D. Sullivan. The former, a one-time police detective, was murdered on the Coney Island boardwalk in June 1922, see "Dinnie" Sullivan Slain by Blackjack, New York Times, 21 June 1922, 1. For additional information on the Sullivan clan, see: "Little Tim Dead at Forty." New York Times, December 23, 1909. 1. See also: "Sullivan is Last of a Famous Line, New York Times, August 3, 1937; "Sullivans and Tammany." New York Times, August 6, 1942. Editorial&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan, whose control extended to illegal [[boxing|prizefights]] through the [[National Athletic Club]], influenced the [[New York State Legislature]] to legalize boxing in 1896 before ring deaths and other scandals caused the law's repeal four years later.

Among other laws he helped pass was the [[Sullivan Act]], a state law that required a permit to carry or own a concealed weapon, which eventually became law on May 29, 1911.  Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, and carrying them was a felony. However, with many residents unable to afford the $3 registration fee issued by the corrupt New York Police Department, his bodyguards could be legally armed while using the law against their political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Czitrom, Dan. Underworld and Underdogs: Big Tim Sullivan and Metropolitan Politics in New York, 1889-1913. Journal of American History. 78.2. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was extremely popular among his constituents.  In the hot summer months, [[tenement]] dwellers would be feted to steamboat excursions and picnics to College Point in Queens or New Jersey. In the winter months, the Sullivan machine doled out food, coal and clothing to his constituents. On the anniversary of his mother's birthday, February 6, Sullivan dispensed shoes to needy tenement dwellers. The annual Christmas Dinners were a particularly notable event covered in all of the city papers.&lt;ref&gt;"Fed by Senator Sullivan: Three Thousand Bowery Lodging House Men his Guests." New York Times, December 26, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had a loyal following, his involvement in organized crime and political protection of street gangs and vice districts would remain a source of controversy throughout his career.

==Electoral fraud==
Sullivan was an expert in using electoral fraud to retain his power. In a quid pro quo arrangement, constituents voted the way that they were instructed. In return, they were the recipients of Tammany largesse which included coal in the winter, clambakes and outings in the summer, jobs on the city payroll and all-around assistance. In 1892 when his pct went 395 to 4 for [[Grover Cleveland]] over [[Benjamin Harrison]] in the presidential election he said, "Harrison got one...more vote than I expected, but I'll find that feller!" His most common tactic, with no voter ID, was to use "repeaters." Here's how he described it, "When you've voted'em with their whiskers on you take'em to a barber and scrap off the chin-fringe. Then you vote'em again with side lilacs and a mustache. Then to a barber again, off comes the sides and you vote'em a third time with the mustache. If that ain't enough, and the box can stand a few more ballots, clean off the mustache and vote'em plain face. That makes every one of 'em good for four votes." (Rothstein by David Pietrusza. Pgs 53-55.)

==Involvement in criminal activity==
During the turn of the century, he would develop contacts with many influential figures including [[Monk Eastman]], [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], [[Arnold Rothstein]] and disgraced NYPD Lieutenant [[Charles Becker]], who was able to attain the latter a high-ranking position on the New York police force in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Andy. Against the Evidence: The Becker-Rosenthal Affair. London: Weidenfeld, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

A close associate of [[Charles Francis Murphy]], who succeeded the exiled [[Richard Croker]] as head of Tammany Hall in May 1902, the two forced corrupt police chief [[William Stephen Devery]] out of Tammany's Executive Committee as part of Murphy's campaign to eliminate any direct links between vice districts and Tammany Hall.

However, Sullivan was allowed to keep his [[kickbacks]] from the Lower East Side and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] as a means of keeping him from becoming Murphy's political rival (he had used his considerable political influence from keeping Croker's reform group, the ''Committee of Five'', out of the Bowery only two years before). In exchange, Sullivan would have to furnish gang leaders [[Monk Eastman]] and [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], amongst others, to commit [[election fraud]] on behalf of Tammany Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', September 17, 1903, p. 8; ''New York Times'', September 20, 1903, 1. See also: Humbert s. Nelli. The Business of Crime: Italian and Syndicate Crime in the United States. New York, 1976. 101-140&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was widely known that Sullivan and his subordinates were active in a number of illegal activities including prostitution, gambling and extortion. A number of these revelations came to light in the New York State [[Lexow Committee]] hearings as well as through the investigations of the Rev. [[Charles Henry Parkhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Lexow, Report and Proceedings of the Senate Committee Appointed to Investigate the Police Department of the City of New York, 5 vols. Albany, 1895. See also, Parkhurst, Charles Henry. My Forty Years in New York. New York: MacMillan, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Suffering from [[tertiary syphilis]] during his later years, his health continued to deteriorate until he was judged mentally incompetent and finally committed to a sanitarium in 1912. According to the Incompetency hearings, Sullivan elicited paranoid [[delusions]], believed he was being spied upon and his food was being poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;New York State Supreme Court, "In the Matter of the Application for the Appointment of a Committee of the Person and Property of Timothy D. Sullivan." January 24, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 12, 1913, the New York Sun reported in a prominent page two article that he was mourned after being committed, "beyond cure" (without naming illness), suffering from "religious mania".

After nearly a year, he managed to escape from his brother's house after eluding nurses on the early morning of August 31 (although other accounts claim he had escaped from orderlies after an all-night card game). Within a few hours, his body was found on the tracks in the Eastchester area of the Bronx, New York.

Sullivan's family did not report him missing for more than ten days, and his body was brought, and held, at the local Fordham morgue. Finally, after a fortnight, Sullivan was classified as a vagrant and scheduled for burial in [[Potter's field|Potter's Field]] despite his tailored clothing and "TDS" diamond monogrammed cufflinks.

Just before removal, his body was finally recognized by Police Officer Peter Purfield, who was assigned to the morgue detail. ([[The New York Times]] later speculated that Sullivan might have been killed and placed on the tracks. In fact, the engineer of the train that struck Sullivan stated that he thought the body was already deceased. And, adding to the speculation of foul play, Thomas Reigelmann, the [[Bronx]] coroner and Tammany political appointee who signed the death certificate, failed to recognize the body of his longtime friend despite the lack of trauma to the decedent's face.)&lt;ref&gt;''New York World'', "Says Blackjack May have Killed Big Tim Sullivan," November 18, 1914, 1; ''New York Times'', September 10, 1913, 1; ''New York Times'', September 11, 1913, 4; ''New York Times'', September 14, 1913, 1; ''New York World'', September 10, 1913, 3. "Bureau to Identify Bodies Will be Established as a Result of Sullivan Case." ''New York Times''. September 27, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan's wake was held at his clubhouse, located at 207 [[Bowery]] and over 25,000&amp;nbsp;people turned out for his funeral at [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York]] on Mott Street.  He was interred in [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Records of Calvary and Allied Cemeteries, Woodside, NY. Section 9, Plot 197, Graves 1-9.  See also: [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/sullivan8.html#R9M0JEFW0] and [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12804274], keyword: Sullivan, Timothy D.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next seven or eight years, there was a protracted battle over Sullivan's estate, which, by some estimates, ranged as high as $2.5&amp;nbsp;million.  After creditors were satisfied, the bulk of the assets went to Sullivan's full siblings, Patrick H., Mary Anne, and half-brother, Lawrence Mulligan.  (For several years after Big Tim's death, Patrick H. Sullivan attempted to maintain his late brother's political and criminal clout. However, he proved to be an ineffectual leader and requitted himself from politics to pursue real estate ventures).&lt;ref&gt;"Depose (P.H.) Sullivan as Bowery Leader."  ''New York Times'', February 16, 1916. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan had one child with his wife Helen, a daughter who died in infancy.
He did, however, father at least six illegitimate children, many with actresses affiliated with his theatrical ventures, two of whom were [[Christie MacDonald]] and [[Elsie Janis]].&lt;ref&gt;Aida Sullivan, rumored to be Big Tim's natural daughter, was formally adopted by the Sullivans from the New York Foundling Hospital in 1894. She ultimately received a $50,000 life insurance policy from the Sullivan estate. See: "Says She Will Sue: Miss Sullivan Asserts Big Tim Made a Will Providing for Her."  ''New York Times'', September 18, 1913, 2.  Sullivan's had another daughter, Margaret Catherine, born to Margaret A. Holland, who received a $50,000 life insurance policy from his estate. See, New York World, December 10, 1913, 1; New York Tribune, December 10, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
He was portrayed by [[Joseph Sullivan (actor)|Joseph Sullivan]] in the 1914 [[silent film]] ''The Life of Big Tim Sullivan; Or, From Newsboy to Senator'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0004222/ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;  one of the earliest people to be the subject of a [[biographical film]]. He was also a main character in Kevin Baker's novel ''[[Dreamland (Kevin Baker)|Dreamland]]'', about life in turn-of-the-century New York, set in part in the [[Coney Island]] amusement park of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Big Tim Sullivan; Or, From Newsboy to Senator''. Gotham Film Co., 1914. Sullivan left no diaries and very few private letters. Autobiographical materials comes largely through his own statements in the press of his era.&lt;/ref&gt;

On film himself, Sullivan appeared in a silent short ''Actors' Fund Field Day'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239211/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ''Actors' Fund Field Day''; IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1910 short film denoting  an actors' fundraising. Sullivan more than likely knew many of the persons in the film.

'''White Latin Americans''', or '''European Latin Americans''', are [[Latin Americans]] who are considered [[White people|white]], typically due to [[European diaspora|European]], or in some cases [[Levant]]ine, descent. Latin American countries have often encouraged [[miscegenation]], and even a small amount of European ancestry could entail significant upwards [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T.

The Indians that had lost their connections with their communities and had adopted different cultural elements could "pass" and be considered mestizos. The same applied to blacks and castas. Rather, the factor that distinguished the various social groups was their ''calidad'' ("quality"); this concept was related to an idea of blood as conferring status, but there were also other elements, such as occupation and marriage, that could have the effect of blanqueamiento (whitening) on people and influence their upward social mobility.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chambers, Sarah C.|year=2003|chapter=Little Middle Ground The Instability of a Mestizo Identity in the Andes, 18th and 19th centuries|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin American|editor=Nancy P.

First, divergent patterns of colonization may account for differences in the construction of racial groupings, as evidenced in Latin America, which was colonized primarily by the Spanish.

People descended from European settlers who arrived in [[Americas|the Americas]] during the colonial and post-independence periods can be found throughout Latin America.

==Being white==
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Latin America}}
''Being white'' is a term that emerged from a tradition of [[Race (classification of humans)|racial classification]] that developed as Europeans colonized large parts of the world and employed classificatory systems to distinguish themselves from the local inhabitants. However, while most present-day racial classifications include a concept of being white that is ideologically connected to European heritage and specific phenotypic and biological features associated with European heritage, there are differences in how people are classified. These differences arise from the various historical processes and social contexts in which a given racial classification is used. As Latin America is characterized by differing histories and social contexts, there is also variance in the perception of whiteness throughout Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chambers, Sarah C.|year=2003|chapter=Little Middle Ground The Instability of a Mestizo Identity in the Andes, 18th and 19th centuries|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin American|editor=Nancy P. Appelbaum|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|quote=This blending of culture and genealogy is also reflected in the use of the terms ''Spanish'' and ''white''. For most of the colonial period, Americans of European descent were simply referred to as ''Spaniards''; beginning in the late 18th century, the term ''blanco'' (white) came into increasing but not exclusive use. Even those of presumably mixed ancestry may have felt justified in claiming to be Spanish (and later white) if they participated in the dominant culture by, for example, speaking Spanish and wearing European clothing.(p. 33)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Wade]] specialist in race concepts of Latin America

&lt;blockquote&gt;...racial categories and racial ideologies are not simply those that elaborate social constructions on the basis of phenotypical variation or ideas about innate difference but those that do so using the particular aspects of phenotypical variation that were worked into vital signifiers of difference during European colonial encounters with others.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 1997. Race and Ethnicity in Latin America. Critical Studies On Latin America. Pluto Press p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many parts of Latin America being white is more a matter of socio-economic status than specific phenotypic traits, and it is often said that in Latin America "money whitens"&lt;ref&gt;Levine-Rasky, Cynthia. 2002. "Working through whiteness: international perspectives. SUNY Press (p. 73) " 'Money whitens' If any phrase encapsulates the association of whiteness and the modern in Latin America, this is it. It is a cliché formulated and reformulated throughout the region, a truism dependant upon the social experience that wealth is associated with whiteness, and that in obtaining the former one may become aligned with the latter (and vice versa)."&lt;/ref&gt; Within Latin America there are variations in how racial boundaries have been defined. In Argentina, for example, the notion of mixture has been downplayed. Alternately, in countries like Mexico and Brazil mixture has been emphasized as fundamental for nation-building, resulting in a large group of bi-racial ''mestizos'', in Mexico, or tri-racial ''[[pardo]]s'', in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=2170&amp;id_pagina=1|title=IBGE - sala de imprensa - notícias|author=IBGE|work=ibge.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laboratoriogene"&gt;[http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/geneImprensa/2009/pensamento.pdf Do pensamento racial ao pensamento racional] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522233206/http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/geneImprensa/2009/pensamento.pdf |date=May 22, 2014 }}, [http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br laboratoriogene.com.br].&lt;/ref&gt; who are considered neither fully white nor fully non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade, Peter|chapter=Race in Latin America|editor=Poole, Deborah|year=2008|title=Companion to Latin American Anthropology|publisher=Blackwell publishing|page=182|quote=The nature of Latin American societies as mestizo – with the variations that run from Argentina, where the image of mixture is downplayed in favor of whiteness, to Brazil or Mexico, where mixture is foregrounded in discourse on the nation – has powerfully shaped ideas about race in the region.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in the United States where ancestry may be used exclusively to define race, by the 1970s, Latin American scholars came to agree that race in Latin America could not be understood as the "genetic composition of individuals" but instead must be "based upon a combination of cultural, social, and [[wiktionary:somatic|somatic]] considerations". In Latin America, a person's ancestry may not be decisive in racial classification. For example, full-blooded siblings can often be classified as belonging to different races (Harris 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7846.html|title=Sample Chapter for Telles, E.E.: Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil.|work=princeton.edu|access-date=2011-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125201950/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7846.html|archive-date=2012-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4222t703|title=The Japanese in multiracial Peru, 1899-1942|work=eScholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons the distinction between "white" and "mixed", and between "mixed" and "black" and "indigenous", is largely subjective and situational, meaning that any attempt to classify by discrete racial categories is fraught with problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade, Peter|chapter=Race in Latin America|editor=Poole, Deborah|year=2008|title=Companion to Latin American Anthropology|publisher=Blackwell publishing|page=184|quote=However, "black" and "indigenous" are often vaguely defined and there is an indecisive, subjective distinction between them and "mixed" and between the latter and "white" (hence the problems of enumerating these populations).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Map-Latin America.png|thumb|right|290px|Latin America]]
People of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] origin began to arrive in the Americas in the 15th century since the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. After the Wars of Independence, the elites of most of the countries of the region concluded that their underdevelopment was caused by their populations being mostly [[Amerindian]], [[Mestizo]] or [[Mulatto]];&lt;ref name=euram&gt;{{cite web |title=L'emigració dels europeus cap a Amèrica |trans-title=The Emigration of Europeans to America |url=http://www.edualter.org/material/vld/amlat13.pdf |website=EduAlter.org |language=Catalan |access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a major process of "[[Racial whitening|whitening]]" was required, or at least desirable.&lt;ref name=branqueamento /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mloveman/papers/Loveman%20Whiteness%20in%20Latin%20America.pdf "Whiteness in Latin America: Measurement and Meaning in National Censuses (1850-1950)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927230306/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mloveman/papers/Loveman%20Whiteness%20in%20Latin%20America.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }} by Mara Loveman. ''Journal de la Société des Américanistes''. Vol. 95-2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Latin American countries then implemented [[blanqueamiento]] policies to promote European immigration, and some were quite successful, especially Argentina, [[Uruguay]], and Brazil. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the number of European immigrants who arrived far surpassed the number of original colonists. Between 1821 and 1932, of a total 15 million immigrants who arrived in Latin America,&lt;ref name=britsa&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-41807/South-America South America: Postindependence overseas immigrants].

==Admixture==
[[Image:Casta painting all.jpg|thumb|250px|''Las castas''. 18th century, Museo Nacional del Virreinato, [[Tepotzotlán]], Mexico.]]
Since European [[Colonialism|colonization]], Latin America's population has had a long history of intermixing, so that many Latin Americans who have [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n or, rarely, [[Asian people|East Asian]] ancestry have European ancestry as well. The ''[[casta]]'' system, a primarily race-based classification that was used in colonial Latin America designated people according to its racial background, with the main classifications being ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indio]]'' (used to refer to Native American people), ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' (those of complete European ancestry born in Latin America, or in cases, people who were 7/8 or more European and 1/8 Indigenous or less), ''[[castizo]]'' (3/4 European, 1/4 Indigenous), or ''[[mestizo]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Demographics of Africa|negro]]'' (Sub-Saharan Africans) ''[[mulato]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 African), ''[[zambo]]'' (1/2 African, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Pardo]]'' (persons with European, African and Indigenous ancestry), and ''Peninsulares'' who were Europeans born in Spain or other European countries such as Portugal in the case of Portuguese colonies.

As in Spain, persons of even remote Jewish or Moorish ancestry were not allowed to enroll in the Spanish Army or the Catholic Church in the colonies. Applicants to both institutions, and their spouses, had to obtain a ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' (purity of blood) certificate that proved that they had no Jewish or Moorish ancestors, in the same way as those in the Peninsula did. However, being a medieval concept that targeted exclusively those religious groups, it was never an issue among the native population in the colonies of the Spanish Empire, which by law allowed people from all racial groups to join the army, with being of the Catholic faith the only prerequisite. One notable example was that of [[Francisco Menendez (creole)|Francisco Menendez]], a freed-black military officer of the Spanish Army during the 18th century at the [[Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]] fort in St. Augustine, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black society in Spanish Florida | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Landers, Jane | year=1999 | pages=29 | isbn=0-252-06753-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically both [[Colonial Brazil|Colonial]] and [[Imperial Brazil]] had [[institutionalized discrimination]] against citizens who were deemed people of color, it never had a casta system like that of Hispanic America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} White Brazilians equivalent in status to the Hispanic criollo could have less than 80% European (overwhelmingly Portuguese) ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Having some Amerindian and black African ancestry—which is widespread among white Brazilians, among all social classes in its [[Regions of Brazil|five geographic regions]] since the 16th to 17th centuries—as well as having Moorish, Jewish, Arab, or [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry, affected social status less than in Hispanic America,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} This does not mean that the social status of "fully non-white" people (people of color who are not mulattoes, mestizos, [[zambos]], pardos, etc.—in short, [[Mixed-race Brazilian]]s—even with Caucasian features); "westernized" Brazilians with non-Caucasian phenotypes; or people with known non-European ancestry was equal to that of Brazilian elites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Populations==

In terms of percentage of the total population, [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Costa Rica]] have the highest concentrations of whites, who constitute 80–90% of their total populations. The smallest concentration is in [[Honduras]], with only 1%.

White Mexicans are for the most part descendants of Spanish immigrants who arrived mainly from northern regions of Spain such as [[Cantabria]], [[Navarra]], [[Galicia Spain|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]],&lt;ref name="MinerosYcomerciantes"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A.

In that time, more people from the United States have been added to the population of Mexico than Mexicans to that of the United States, according to government data in both nations.&lt;ref name="For Migrants, New Land of Opportunity Is Mexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/americas/for-migrants-new-land-of-opportunity-is-mexico.html|title=For Migrants, New Land of Opportunity Is Mexico|date=22 September 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of [[Ethnic groups of Europe|European]] population, according to the American historian [[Howard F. Cline]] the majority of Mexicans in these regions have no native admixture and their aspect resemble that of [[Spaniards|northern Spaniards]].&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesandMexico"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howard F.

Because of this, Europeans often were the most numerous ethnic group within colonial cities in northern and western Mexico (albeit this trend is also seen in large central Mexican cities such as Mexico City) and became the regions with the highest proportion of whites during the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish colonial period]].&lt;ref name="EnsayospoblaciónMéxico"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sherburne Friend Cook|author2=Woodrow Borah|title=Ensayos sobre historia de la población.

A 2012 study published by the [[Journal of Human Genetics]] found the ancestry of the Mexican mestizo population to be predominantly European (64.9%), followed by Native American (30.8%) and African (4.2%). Those with European ancestry were most prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%), with Native American ancestry in the center and southeast (37–50%), and with African ancestry being evenly distributed throughout (0–8.8%).&lt;ref name="Admixture" /&gt; The states that participated in this study were Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatan.&lt;ref name="Results of the study per state"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/jhg/journal/v57/n9/images/jhg201267f3.jpg|pmid=22832385 | doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.67 | volume=57|title=Admixture and population structure in Mexican-Mestizos based on paternal lineages|year=2012|journal=J.

Another study, conducted by Mexico's [[Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica|National Institute of Genomic Medicine]] (INMEGEN), reported that mestizo Mexicans were 58.96% European, 35.05% "Asian" (Amerindian mostly), and 5.03% African. Those in Sonora had the highest percentage of European ancestry (70.63%) and in Guerrero the lowest (51.98%), those in Guerrero also having shown the highest Asian percentage (37.17%). The African percentages ranged from 2.8%, in Sonora, to 11.13%, in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as "being racially mixed in some degree"). The study was conducted with volunteers from 6 states ([[Sonora]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Veracruz]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Oaxaca]], and [[Yucatan]]) and an indigenous group known as [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The same study found that the haplogroup of Mexico's population was most similar to that of Europeans, with the percentage of haplotypes shared being 81%, followed by the Asian haplogroup, at 74%, and finally the African haplogroup, at 64%. Investigators noted that the African admixture in general did not come from the African slaves brought by the Europeans, but was already part of the genetic makeup of the colonizers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2009/06/04/genoma-destapa-diferencias-de-mexicanos|title=Genoma destapa diferencias de mexicanos|publisher=CNN Expansión |date=2009-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, of people in Mexico city, found the Mexican mestizo population—where individuals tend to be either predominantly European or Amerindian rather than tending toward an average—to be the one which shows the largest variation out of all the mestizo groups of Latin America. The results of this study are similar to the ones made by INMEGEN, with European admixture averaging 56.8%, followed by Asian (Native American) at 39.8% and African at 3.4%.&lt;ref name="Plos genetics"/&gt; Additional studies suggests a higher European admixture correlates with higher socioeconomic status, and a higher Amerindian ancestry with lower: a study exclusively of low-income Mexicans found the mean admixture to be 59%, 34.8%, and 6.2% for Amerindian, European, and African respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.1310070210/abstract|title=Racial admixture in a Mestizo population from Mexico City |date=2005-05-27 |accessdate=2013-09-09|doi=10.1002/ajhb.1310070210|volume=7|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|pages=213–216 | last1 = Lisker | first1 = Rubén}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a study made on Mexicans whose income was higher than the mean found their European admixture to be 81%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Martinez-Marignac%202007.pdf|title=Admixture in Mexico City: implications for admixture mapping of Type 2 diabetes genetic risk factors|publisher=Utm.utoronto.ca |date=2006-10-02 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides socioeconomic factors, it has been observed that European ancestry varies significativelly depending of the Mexican region that is analyzed, with it being the dominant ancestry in northern and western Mexico.

However, after the mass exodus resulting from the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, the number of white Cubans actually residing in Cuba diminished. Today, the various records that claim to show the percentage of whites in Cuba are conflicting and uncertain; some reports (usually coming from Cuba) still report a similar-to-pre-1959 number of 65%, and others (usually from outside observers) report 40–45%. Despite most white Cubans being of [[Spanish immigration to Cuba|Spanish descent]], many others are of [[French immigration to Cuba|French]], Portuguese, German, [[Italian Cuban|Italian]], or Russian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees |title=Etat des propriétés rurales appartenant à des Français dans l'île de Cuba}} (from [http://www.cubagenweb.org Cuban Genealogy Center])&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], [[Castilian people|Castilians]], and [[Galician people|Galicians]] immigrated to Cuba. Between 1901 and 1958, more than a million Spaniards arrived in Cuba from Spain; many of these and their descendants left after Castro's Communist [[Cuban Revolution|regime took power]]. One further significant ethnic influx was from various Middle Eastern nations.

An early Census on the island was conducted by Governor [[Francisco Manuel de Lando]] in 1530. An exhaustive 1765 census was taken by Lieutenant General [[Alexander O'Reilly]], which, according to some sources, showed 17,572 whites out of a total population of 44,883.&lt;ref name=Haines/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soph.md.rcm.upr.edu/demo/images/VazquezCalzada/Vazques-trabajos/Vazquez-1968-el%20crecimiento%20poblacional.pdf El crecimiento poblacional en Puerto Rico: 1493 al presente] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003174514/http://soph.md.rcm.upr.edu/demo/images/VazquezCalzada/Vazques-trabajos/Vazquez-1968-el%20crecimiento%20poblacional.pdf |date=2015-10-03 }} (Population of Puerto Rico 1493 - present) Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The censuses from 1765 to 1887 were taken by the [[Spanish government]] who conducted them at irregular intervals. The [[1899 Puerto Rico Census|1899 census]] was taken by the United States War Department. Since 1910, Puerto Rico has been included in every decennial census taken by the United States.

White Puerto Ricans of European, mostly Spanish, descent are said to comprise the majority, with 75.8% of the population identifying as white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ 2010.census.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102032304/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ |date=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, one year after the U.S invaded and took control of the island, 61.8% identified as white. In 2000, for the first time in fifty years, the [[2000 United States Census|census]] asked people to define their race and found the percentage of whites had risen to 80.5% (3,064,862); not because there has been an influx of whites to the island (or an exodus of non-White people), but a change of race perceptions, mainly because Puerto Rican elites wished to portray Puerto Rico as the "white island of the Antilles", partly as a response to scientific racism.&lt;ref name=HPRBWHITE&gt;[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/demsem/loveman-muniz.pdf How Puerto Rico Became White—University of Wisconsin-Madison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207224431/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/demsem/loveman-muniz.pdf |date=2012-02-07 }}. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 20th century, American observers remarked on the "surprising preponderance of the white race" on the island. One travel writer called Puerto Rico "the whitest of the Antilles". In a widely distributed piece, a geologist wrote that the island was "notable among the West Indian group for the reason that its preponderant population is of the white race". In a more academic book he reiterated that "Porto Rico, at least, has not become [[Africanization|Africanized]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121212130544/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/liteng/courses/e21h_2007/documents/santiago/Neither%20Black%20nor%20White-The%20Representation%20of%20Puerto%20Rican%20Racial%20Identity.RTF Representation of racial identity among Puerto Ricans and in the U.S. mainland] &lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, hundreds of [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]]n, [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]], Middle Eastern, and Portuguese families, along with large numbers of immigrants from Spain (mainly from [[Catalonia]], [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Andalusia]], and the [[Canary Islands]]) and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America, arrived in Puerto Rico. Other settlers have included [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish]], Scots, [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|Germans]], and Italians. Thousands of immigrants were granted land from Spain during the ''Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815'' ([[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with a certain amount of free land.

According to a [[genetic research]] by the [[University of Brasilia]], Puerto Rican genetic admixture consists in a 60.3% European, 26.4% African, and 13.2% Amerindian ancestry.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

From the late 19th century to when the [[Panama Canal]] opened, European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America to reach the west coast of the United States ([[California]]).

In Costa Rica, estimates of the percentage of white people vary between 77%&lt;ref name="Costa Rica"/&gt; and 82%,&lt;ref name=Lizcano/&gt; or about 3.1–3.5 million people. The white and mestizo populations combined equal 83%, according to the [[CIA World Factbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html#People|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rican European ancestry is mostly Spanish, although a significant number is descended from Italian, Greek, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, Lebanese, or Polish families. Other ethnic groups include Russians, Danes, Belgians, Croats, Hungarians, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrera Balharry|first=Eugenio|title=Los alemanes y el estado cafetalero|location=Costa Rica|isbn=9977-64-405-5|pages=100–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm|title=The Jewish Community in Costa Rica|work=jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Costa-Rica.html|title=Culture of Costa Rica - history, people, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social, marriage|work=everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

A 2010-2012 national study estimated that white Guatemalans are 18.5% of the population (2.7 million),&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt; with the majority descendants of [[Germans]], followed those of [[Spaniards]], [[French people|French]], [[Italians]], [[English people|English]], [[Swedish people|Swedish]], [[Belgian people|Belgian]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Danish people|Danish]], [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. There are also descendants of [[Americans]], [[Canadian]]s, and whites from Latin American nations such as [[Argentina]] and [[Costa Rica]].

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Guatemala had massive immigration from [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]], as well as, to a lesser extent, [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Scandinavian countries]], [[Ireland]], and other European countries. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth, immigration from [[Russia]], [[Poland]], and [[Greece]] was encouraged by grants of land for coffee [[finca]]s and vineyards in the areas of [[Cobán]],  [[Zacapa]], [[Guatemala City]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Chiquimula]], [[El Progreso]], and other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europaenguatemala.blogspot.com/ La cara Europea de Guatemala] Tuesday, March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940, the percentage of Guatemalans of European origin had reached 29%, becoming the majority in the capital and in the east, with significant populations in Verapaces, Quetzaltenango, and several areas in the southwest. But by 1980, with a fall-off of European immigration, and a significant increase in indigenous and mestizo families, that figure had fallen to 13%. Later, after armed conflict that destroyed many non-white families, the percentage had risen, as well as that of castizos (mixture of the mestizo population and European descent) and mestizos with European predominance.&lt;ref name=University&gt;[http://library.stanford.edu/areas/latin-american-iberian-collections Recolection of ethic groups and census of latin americans] Stanford University Library.

According to a 2014 research published in the journal ''Genetics and Molecular Biology'' and to a 2010 research published in the journal "Physical Antropology", European ancestry predominates in 69% of Nicaraguans, followed by African ancestry in 20%, and lastly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry in 11%, making Nicaragua the country with the highest proportion of European ancestry in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francisco Mauro Salzano|author2=Mónica Sans|title=Interethnic admixture and the evolution of Latin American populations|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|date=2014|volume=37|issue=1 (suppl)|pages=151–170|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/gmb/v37n1s1/v37n1s1a03.pdf|publisher=Sociedade Brasileira de Genética|location=Brazil|issn=1415-4757|doi=10.1590/s1415-47572014000200003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carolina Nuñez|author2=Miriam Baeta|title=Reconstructing the population history of Nicaragua by means of mtDNA, Y-chromosome STRs, and autosomal STR markers|journal=Physical Antropology|date=2010|volume=143|issue=4|pages=591–600|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21355/abstract|publisher=American Association of Physical Antropology|location=United States of America|issn=1415-4757|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-genetic data from the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' establish that from Nicaragua's 2016 population of 5,966,798, around 69% are [[mestizo]], 17% [[White Latin American|white]], 5% Native American, and 9% [[Afro-Latin American|black and other races]].&lt;ref name="CIA-Paraguay" /&gt; This fluctuates with changes in migration patterns.

In the 19th century, Nicaragua experienced a wave of immigration, primarily from Europe. In particular, families from Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium moved to Nicaragua to set up businesses with money they brought from Europe. They established many agricultural businesses, such as coffee and sugarcane plantations, as well as newspapers, hotels, and banks.

There is also a small Middle Eastern–Nicaraguan community of Syrian, Armenian, Palestinian, Jewish, and Lebanese people in Nicaragua, with a total population of about 30,000.

Other ancestries includes Dutch, English, French, German, Swiss, Danish, Irish, Greek, Italian, Lebanese, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. There is also a sizable and influential Jewish community.

The ancestry of Argentines is mostly European, with both Native American and African contributions.

Argentina's [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina|National Institute of Statistics and Censuses]] (INDEC) does not conduct ethnic/racial censuses; so, no official data exist on the percentage of white Argentines today. Nevertheless, various sources estimate the white population of European descent to be between 85% and 86.4%.&lt;ref name=Lizcano/&gt;&lt;ref name="egw levinson"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC&amp;pg=PA313 ''Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook''] by David Levinson.

These percentages show an estimated population of 34-36 million white people in Argentina.

White Argentines are dispersed throughout the country, but their greatest concentration is in the east-central region of [[Pampas]], the southern region of [[Patagonia]], and in the west-central region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]]. Their concentration is smaller in the north-eastern region of [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Litoral]], and is much smaller in the north-western provinces of [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]], and [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]], which was the most densely populated region of the country (mainly by [[Amerindian]] and [[Mestizo]] people) before the wave of immigration of 1857-1940 and was the area where European newcomers settled the least.&lt;ref name="white argentina myth"&gt;[http://hahr.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/88/1/71.pdf "Indigenous or Criollo: The Myth of White Argentina in Tucumán's Calchaquí Valley"], escrito por Oscar Chamosa.

The white population residing in Argentina is mostly descended from immigrants who arrived from Europe and the Middle East between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a smaller proportion from Spaniards of the colonial period. From 1506 to 1650—according to M.&amp;nbsp;Möner, Peter Muschamp, and Boyd-Bowman—out of a total of 437,669 Spaniards who settled in the [[Spanish Empire|American Spanish colonies]], between 10,500 and 13,125 ''Peninsulares'' settled in the Río de la Plata region.&lt;ref name= Vita &gt;Luis Vita: ''Introducción a una teoría de la historia para América Latina''. Chapter IV. Editorial Planeta. Buenos Aires, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial censuses conducted after the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] showed that the proportion of Spaniards and [[Criollo people|Criollo]]s was significant in the cities and surrounding countryside, but not so much in the rural areas. The 1778 census of [[Buenos Aires]], ordered by [[Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo|Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz]], revealed that, of a total population of 37,130 inhabitants (in both the city and surrounding countryside), the Spaniards and Criollos numbered 25,451, or 68.55% of the total. Another census, carried out in the Corregimiento de [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1777, showed that the Spaniards and Criollos numbered 4,491 (or 51.24%) out of a population of 8,765 inhabitants. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] (city and countryside) the Spanish/Criollo people comprised a 39.36% (about 14,170) of 36,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name= "colonial census"&gt;Fuente: ''Argentina: de la Conquista a la Independencia.'' por C.

Data provided by Argentina's ''Dirección Nacional de Migraciones'' (National Bureau of Migrations) states that the country received a total 6,611,000 European and Middle Eastern immigrants during the period from 1857 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1990/1/90.01.06.x.html|title=90.01.06: South American Immigration: Argentina|work=yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main immigrant group was 2,970,000 Italians (44.9% of the total), who came initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]], and [[Lombardy]], and later from [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feditalia.org.ar/arg/federaciones/feditalia_org_fed_regionales.html|title=Feditalia - Confederación General de Federaciones Italianas en Argentina|work=feditalia.org.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second group in importance was Spaniards, some 2,080,000 (31.4% of the total), who were mostly [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Basque people|Basques]], but also [[Asturia]]ns, [[Cantabria]]ns, [[Catalonia|Catalans]], and [[Andalucia]]ns. In smaller but significant numbers came Frenchmen from [[Occitania]] (239,000, 3.6% of the total) and Poles (180,000&amp;nbsp;– 2.7%). From the [[Russian Empire]] came some 177,000 people (2.6%), who were not only ethnic Russians, but also [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Volga Germans]], [[Lithuanians]], etc. From the [[Ottoman Empire]] the contribution was mainly [[Armenia]]ns, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], and [[Syria]]ns, some 174,000 in all (2.6%). Then come the immigrants from the [[German Empire]], some 152,000 (2.2%). From the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] came 111,000 people (1.6%), among them Austríans, Hungarians, [[Croatia]]ns, [[Bosnia]]ks, [[Serbia|Serbs]], [[Ruthenia]]ns, and [[Montenegro|Montenegrins]]. 75,000 immigrants came from what was then the UK, of these the majority were Irish who were escaping the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]] or British rule. Other minor groups were the Portuguese (65,000), Slavic peoples from [[Yugoslavia]] (48,000), the Swiss (44,000), Belgians (26,000), Danes (18,000), white Americans (12,000), the Dutch (10,000), and the Swedish (7,000). Even colonists from Australia, and [[Boers]] from South Africa, can be found in the Argentine immigration records.

In the 1910s, when immigration reached its peak, more than 30% of Argentina's population had been born in Europe, and over half of the population of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] had been born abroad. According to the 1914 national census, 80% out of a total population of 7,903,662 were people who were either European, or the children and grandchildren of same. Among the remaining 20% (the descendants of the population previous to the immigratory wave), about one third were white. That makes for 86.6%, or about 6.8 million whites residing in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Argentina'', de Ricardo.Levene. University of North Carolina Press, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; European immigration continued to account for over half the population growth during the 1920s,&lt;ref name=rock&gt;[https://books.google.com/books ''Argentina: 1516-1982 From Spanish Colonisation to the Falklands War''] escrito por David Rock.

According to Argentine records, 392,603 people from the Old World entered the country in the 1940s. In the following decade, the flow diminished because the [[Marshall Plan]] improved Europe's economy, and emigration was not such a necessity; but even then, between 1951 and 1970 another 256,252 Europeans entered Argentina.&lt;ref name="immigration post ww2"&gt;[http://sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/soc237/papers/cookappendixr.pdf Migration and Nationality Patterns in Argentina.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218231130/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/soc237/papers/cookappendixr.pdf |date=2012-02-18 }} Fuente: ''Dirección Nacional de Migraciones, 1976''.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s—when whites were 76.1% of the total—onward, increasing immigration from countries on Argentina's northern border ([[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Paraguay]])&lt;ref&gt;Inmigración, Cambio Demográfico y Desarrollo Industrial en la Argentina.

In 1992, after the fall of the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union and its allies, the governments of Western Europe were worried about a possible mass exodus from Central Europe and Russia. President [[Carlos Menem]] offered to receive part of that emigratory wave in Argentina. On December&amp;nbsp;19, 1994, Resolution 4632/94 was enacted, allowing "special treatment" for applicants who wished to emigrate from the republics of the ex-Soviet Union. From January 1994 until December 2000, a total 9,399 Central and Eastern Europeans traveled and settled in Argentina. Of the total, 6,720 were [[Ukrainians]] (71.5%), 1,598 [[Russians]] (17%), 526 [[Romanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Moldovans]], and [[Poles]], and 555 (5.9%) traveled with a Soviet passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/269/26900104.pdf Recent Migration from Central and Eastern Europe to Argentina, a Special Treatment?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230520/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/269/26900104.pdf |date=July 22, 2011 }} {{es icon}} by María José Marcogliese.

Brazil is one of the few countries in Latin America that includes racial categories in its censuses: ''Branco'' (White), ''Negro'' (Black), ''Pardo'' (Multiracial), ''Amarelo'' (Yellow) and ''Indígena'' (Amerindian), with categorization being by self-identification. Taking into account the data provided by the last National Household Survey, conducted in 2010, Brazil would possess the most numerous white population in Latin America, given that a 47.7%&amp;nbsp;– 91 million people&amp;nbsp;– of Brazilians self-declared as "Brancos".&lt;ref name="Igbe Brasil 2010" /&gt; Comparing this survey with previous censuses, a slow but constant decrease in the percentage of self-identified white Brazilians can be seen: in the 2000 Census it was 53.7%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html#People|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Brazil.html|title=Brazil|work=worldstatesmen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2006 Household Survey it was 49.9%,&lt;ref name= "igbe pnad 2006" /&gt; and in the last, 2008, survey it decreased to the current 48.4%.&lt;ref name="igbe 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614225239/http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-14 |title=Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática - SIDRA |work=ibge.gov.br }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts believe that this decrease is evidence that more Brazilians have come to appreciate their mixed ancestry, re-classifying themselves as "Pardos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duarte|first=Alessandra|title=Censo 2010: população do Brasil deixa de ser predominantemente branca|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/politica/censo-2010-populacao-do-brasil-deixa-de-ser-predominantemente-branca-2789597|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=O Globo|agency=Infoglobo Comunicação e Participações S.A.|date=29 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124143702/http://oglobo.globo.com/politica/censo-2010-populacao-do-brasil-deixa-de-ser-predominantemente-branca-2789597|archivedate=24 January 2014|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=Portuguese|quote=(...)

Historicamente, pretos e pardos eram desvalorizados socialmente, o que fazia com que pretos desejassem ser pardos, e pardos, brancos. Agora, pretos e pardos quiseram se identificar assim.

After independence, Brazil saw several campaigns to attract European immigrants, which were prompted by a policy of ''Branqueamento'' (Whitening).&lt;ref name=branqueamento &gt;[http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/7079.pdf Ideologia do Branqueamento - Racismo á Brasileira?] por Andreas Haufbauer&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the slave labor force was gradually replaced by European immigrants, especially [[Italians]].&lt;ref name="Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rsp/v8s0/03t2.gif|title=Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil|website=Scielo.br|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mostly took place after 1850, as a result of the end of the [[Slavery in Brazil|slave trade]] in the Atlantic Ocean and the growth of coffee plantations in the [[São Paulo]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vestibular.uol.com.br/ultnot/resumos/ult2770u23.jhtm|title=Fim da escravidão gera medidas de apoio à imigração no Brasil - 16/02/2005 - Resumos - História do Brasil|work=uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vestibular.uol.com.br/ultnot/resumos/ult2770u39.jhtm|title=Café atrai imigrante europeu para o Brasil - 22/02/2005 - Resumos - História do Brasil|work=uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; European immigration was at its peak between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries, when nearly five million Europeans immigrated to Brazil, most of them Italians (58.5%), Portuguese (20%), Germans, Spaniards, Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians.

An autosomal study from 2013, of nearly 1,300 samples from all regions of Brazil, found predominantly European ancestry, combined with African and Native American contributions in varying degrees:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0075145&amp;representation=PDF|format=PDF|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels|website=Plosone.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a DNA study from 2010,

&lt;blockquote&gt;a new portrayal of each [[ethnicity]] contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The results, published by the scientific magazine ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'' by a team of the [[Universidade Católica de Brasília|Catholic University of Brasília]], show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin, eye, and hair colour have little to do with the genetic makeup (regardless of census classification) of each person, as has been shown in previous studies.&lt;ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml|title=DNA de brasileiro é 80% europeu, indica estudo|work=uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ancestry informative [[SNP genotyping|SNPs]] can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19639555 | doi=10.1002/ajhb.20976 | volume=22 | title=Genetic composition of Brazilian population samples based on a set of twenty-eight ancestry informative SNPs | year=2010 | journal=Am. J. Hum. Biol. | pages=187–92 |vauthors=Lins TC, Vieira RG, Abreu BS, Grattapaglia D, Pereira RW }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is important to note that "the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers". Thus, as the researchers make explicit, "the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of various socioeconomic strata, although "likely to be leaning slightly towards the ''pardo'' group".&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.20976/pdf|title=Genetic composition of Brazilian population samples based on a set of twenty-eight ancestry informative SNPs| doi=10.1002/ajhb.20976|pages=187–92|pmid=19639555|volume=22|year=2010|vauthors=Lins TC, Vieira RG, Abreu BS, Grattapaglia D, Pereira RW |journal=Am.

According to an autosomal genetic study by the [[University of Brasilia]], in 2008, the composition of Brazil is about 65% European, 25% African, and 9% Native American.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

[[São Paulo state]], the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.20474/abstract|title=Genomic ancestry of a sample population from the state of São Paulo, Brazil | doi=10.1002/ajhb.20474 | volume=18|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|pages=702–705|year=2006 | last1 = Brandão Ferreira | first1 = Luzitano}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study, from 2013, found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0075145#pone-0075145-g004|title= Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145 | volume=8|journal=PLoS ONE|pages=e75145|pmid=24073242|year=2013|pmc=3779230 | last1 = Saloum | first1 =  | last2 = de Neves Manta | first2 = F | last3 = Pereira | first3 = R | last4 = Vianna | first4 = R | last5 = Rodolfo | first5 =  | last6 = de Araújo | first6 = A | last7 = Leite Góes | first7 = Gitaí D | last8 = Aparecida | first8 =  | last9 = da Silva | first9 = D | last10 = de Vargas Wolfgramm | first10 = E | last11 = da Mota Pontes | first11 = I | last12 = Ivan Aguiar | first12 = J | last13 = Ozório Moraes | first13 = M | last14 = Fagundes | first14 =  | last15 = de Carvalho | first15 = E | last16 = Gusmão | first16 = L |display-authors=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic study presented by the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research found that, on average, "white" Brazilians have &gt;70% European genomic ancestry, whereas "black" Brazilians have 37.1% European ancestry. It concluded that "The high ancestral variability observed in whites and blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes. Thus, the only possible basis to deal with genetic variation in Brazilians is not by considering them as members of colour groups, but on a person-by-person basis, as 190 million human beings, with singular genome and life histories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-879X2009005000026&amp;script=sci_arttext#Abstract|title=DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians|work=scielo.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile was usually an unattractive place for migrants, simply because it was far from Europe and relatively difficult to reach. However, during the 18th century an important flux of emigrants from Spain populated Chile.

Within 100 years after the first Spanish settlement, nearly 95 percent of all Native Americans in Colombia had died. The majority of the deaths of Native Americans were the cause of diseases such as measles and smallpox, which were spread by European settlers. Many Native Americans were also killed by armed conflicts with European settlers.

White Colombians are mostly descendants of Spaniards, although Italian, German, Irish, Portuguese, Slavic, and Lebanese Colombians are found in significant numbers. Many Spanish colonists came searching for gold, while other Spaniards established themselves as leaders of social organizations teaching natives the Christian faith and the ways of European civilization. Catholic priests provided education for Native Americans that otherwise was unavailable.

Between 1540 and 1559, 8.9 percent of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] is attributable to the Basque immigration and character traits. Today many Colombians of the Department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] region preserve their Basque ethnic heritage. In Bogota, there is a small district/colonies of Basque families who emigrated as a consequence of Spain's Civil War or because of better opportunities.&lt;ref name="Amerikanuak"&gt;Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World by William A. Douglass, Jon Bilbao, P.167&lt;/ref&gt; Basque priests were the ones that introduced handball into Colombia. Basque immigrants in Colombia were devoted to teaching and public administration. In the first years of the Andean Multinational Company, Basque sailors navigated as captains and pilots on the majority of the ships until the country was able to train its own crews.&lt;ref name=Pastor&gt;Possible paradises: Basque emigration to Latin America by José Manuel Azcona Pastor, P.203&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and largest wave of immigration from the Middle East began around 1880, and continued during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The immigrants were mainly Maronite Christians from Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon) and Palestine, fleeing those then Ottoman territories.&lt;ref name="webislam.com"&gt;[http://www.webislam.com/?idn=4103 {{es icon}} webislam.com: La comunidad musulmana de Maicao (Colombia)] webislam.com&lt;/ref&gt; Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese have continued to settle in Colombia. Due to a lack of information, it is impossible to know the exact number of Lebanese and Syrians that immigrated to Colombia; but for 1880 to 1930, 5,000–10,000 is estimated. Syrians and Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence. Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for different religious, economic, and political reasons. In 1945, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, and Bogota are the cities with the largest numbers of Arabic-speakers in Colombia.&lt;ref name=LABLAA&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol29/tierra3.htm {{es icon}} Luis Angel Arango Library: Los sirio-libaneses en Colombia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025184545/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol29/tierra3.htm |date=2006-10-25 }} lablaa.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs that went to [[Maicao]] were mostly [[Sunni Muslim]], with some [[Druze]] and [[Shiites]], as well as Orthodox and Maronite Christians.

In December 1941 the United States government estimated that there were 4,000 Germans living in Colombia. There were some Nazi agitators in Colombia, such as Barranquilla businessman Emil Prufurt. Colombia invited Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave.&lt;ref name=LB&gt;Latin America during World War II by Thomas M. Leonard, John F.

There are many annual festivals that focus German cuisine, specially pastry arts and beer. Since 2009, there has been a considerable increase in collaborative research through advanced business and educational exchanges, such as those promoted by [[COLCIENCIAS]] and [[AIESEC]].  There are many Colombian-German companies focused on finance, science, education, technology and innovation, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/01-Nodes/Kolumbien_node.html|title=Auswärtiges Amt  -  Colombia|work=Auswärtiges Amt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecuador====
{{Main|Demographics of Ecuador}}
According to the 2010 National Population Census, 6.1% of the population self-identified as [[White people|white]], down from 10.5% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html|title=Población del país es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC|author=EL UNIVERSO|work=El Universo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ecuador, being white is more an indication of social class than of ethnicity. Classifying oneself as white is often done to claim membership to the middle class and to distance oneself from the lower class, which is associated being "Indian". For this reason the status of ''blanco'' is claimed by people who are not primarily of European heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, David. 1998. Ethnic groups worldwide: a ready reference handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 346. "Blanco or White is more a social-class designation than an ethnic one, as identification as a Blanco is based on a combination of white skin color, European features, speaking Spanish, residence in the western part of the nation (especially in a city), and enough wealth or education to be classified as middle or upper class. However, in some rural regions, Mestizos refer to themselves as Blancos, to distinguish themselves from Native Americans and Quechua speakers. Blancos form the ruling elite in Ecuador, and categorization as a Blanco is considered desirable by people of full or partial European descent.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[genetic research]] by the [[University of Brasilia]], Ecuadorian genetic admixture indicates 64.6% Amerindian, 31.0% European, and 4.4% African ancestry.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

White Ecuadorians, mostly ''criollos'', are descendants of Spanish colonists and also Spanish refugees fleeing the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War. Most still hold large amounts of lands, mainly in the northern ''Sierra'', and live in [[Quito]] or [[Guayaquil]]. There is also a large number of white people in [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], a city in the southern [[Andes]] of Ecuador, due to the arrival of Frenchmen in the area, who came to measure the arc of the Earth. Cuenca, [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]], and the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos]] attracted German immigration during the early 20th century. The Galápagos also had a small Norwegian fishing community until they were asked to leave. There are sizable populations of Italian, French, German, Basque, Portuguese, and Greek descent, as well as a small Ecuadorian Jewish population. [[History of the Jews in Ecuador|Ecuador's Jews]] consists of [[Sephardic Jews]] arriving in the South of the country in the 16th and 17th centuries and [[Ashkenazi Jews]] during the 1930s in the main cities of Quito and Cuenca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Ecuador.html |title=Jews in Ecuador |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paraguay====
{{Main|Demographics of Paraguay}}
Ethnically, culturally, and socially, Paraguay has one of the most [[Monoculturalism|homogeneous]] populations in South America. Because of [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]]'s 1814 policy that no white Spaniards and Europeans could intermarry among themselves (they could only marry blacks, [[mulatto]]es, [[mestizo]]s or the native [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]]), a measure taken to avoid a white majority occurring in Paraguay (De Francia believed that all men were equal as well), it was within little more than one generation that most of the population were of mixed racial origin.

The exact percentage of the white Paraguayan population is not known because the Paraguayan census does not include racial or ethnic identification, save for the indigenous population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgeec.gov.py/Censos/Imagenes/Cuestionario%20Censal.pdf?PHPSESSID=296abb7abfa015f8241d208aeaed71f4|title=Paraguayan Census form|website=Dgeec.gov.py|accessdate=8 October 2017}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was 1.7% of the country's total in the 2002 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgeec.gov.py/Publicaciones/Biblioteca/censo_indigena/Capitulo%201.pdf|title=II CENSO NACIONAL INDÍGENA DE POBLACIÓN Y VIVIENDAS 2002. Pueblos Indígenas del Paraguay. Resultados Finales|website=Dgeec.gov.py|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimate the sizes of other groups, the mestizo population being estimated at 95% by the CIA World Factbook, with all other groups totaling 5%.&lt;ref name="PRA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Paraguay: People; Ethnic groups| url =https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pa.html#People | work =CIA World Factbook | accessdate = 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA-Paraguay&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|pa|Paraguay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, whites and the remaining groups (Asians, Afro-Paraguayans, others) make up approximately 3.3% of the total population. According to Lizcano, in 2005 a fifth of population or 20% are white and 75% approximately is mestizo.&lt;ref name=Lizcano/&gt; Such a reading is complicated, because, as elsewhere in Latin America, "white" and "mestizo" are not mutually exclusive (people may identify as both).

Due to the European migration in the 19th and 20th centuries, the majority of whites are of German descent (including Mennonites), with others being of French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese descent.&lt;ref name=EuroParaguay/&gt; Many are southern and southeastern Brazilians (''[[brasiguayos]]''), as well as Argentines and Uruguayans, and their descendants.&lt;ref name=EuroParaguay/&gt; People from such regions are generally descendants of colonial settlers and/or more recent immigrants.&lt;ref name=EuroParaguay&gt;{{cite web|last=Benítez Martínez|first=María Victoria|title=Inmigrantes Europeos en Paraguay 1818 1930|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/53/06/44/PDF/AT9_Benitez.pdf|work=XIV Encuentro de Latinoamericanistas Españoles|publisher=Université de Paris|accessdate=24 January 2014|location=Paris, France|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, 600 families of [[Volga Germans]] who migrated to Germany after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], re-migrated and established a new colony, ''Neufeld'', near [[Yuty]] ([[Caazapá Department]]), in southeastern Paraguay.&lt;ref name=ABCpy&gt;{{cite web|title=Establecerán nueva colonia de alemanes en Paraguay|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/economia/estableceran-nueva-colonia-de-alemanes-en-paraguay-852314.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|website=Abc.com|date=26 August 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Peruvians of European descent|Peruvians|Immigration to Peru}}

According to the [[2017 Peru Census|2017]] census 5.9% or 1.3 million people self-identified as white of the population who were aged 12 and above. This was the first time the census had asked an ancestral identity question. The highest proportion was in the [[La Libertad Region]] with 10% identifying as white.&lt;ref name="census2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Perú: Perfil Sociodemográfico |page = 214 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They are descendants primarily of Spanish colonists, and also of Spanish refugees fleeing the Spanish Civil War. After World War II, many German refugees fled to Peru and settled in large cities, while others descend from Italian, French (mainly [[Basque people|Basques]]), Austrian or German, Portuguese, British, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Jordanian, and Syrian immigrant families. The majority of the whites live in the largest cities, and are concentrated in the northern coastal cities of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], and of course the capital [[Lima]]. [[Cajamarca]] and [[San Martín Region]], and the highlands of northwestern Peru, are also places with strong Spanish, and other European, influence and ethnic presence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} The only southern city with a significant white population is [[Arequipa]].

According to a [[genetic research]] by the [[University of Brasilia]], Peruvian genetic admixture indicates 73.0% Amerindian, 15.1% European, and 11.9% African ancestry.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

====Uruguay====
{{Main|Uruguayan people}}

A 2009 DNA study in the ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'' showed the genetic composition of Uruguay as primarily European, with Native American ancestry ranging from one to 20 percent and sub-Saharan African from seven to 15 percent, depending on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/108068634/abstract/|title=Substantial native American female contribution to the population of Tacuarembó, Uruguay, reveals past episodes of sex-biased gene flow|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20025 | volume=16|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|pages=289–297|year=2004 | last1 = Bonilla | first1 = Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the mid-19th and the early 20th centuries, [[Uruguay]] received part of the same migratory influx as Argentina, although the process started a bit earlier. During 1850-1900, the country welcomed four waves of European immigrants, mainly Spaniards, Italians and Frenchmen. In smaller numbers came British, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Portuguese, Poles, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Dutch, Belgians, Croatians, Lebanese, Armenians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and Irish. The demographic impact of these migratory waves was greater than in Argentina, Uruguay going from having 70,000 inhabitants in 1830, to 450,000 in 1875, and a million inhabitants by 1900, its population thus increasing fourteen-fold in only 70 years. Between 1840 and 1890, 50%–60% of [[Montevideo]]'s population was born abroad, almost all in Europe. The Census conducted in 1860 showed that 35% of the country's population was made up by foreigners, although by the time of the 1908 Census this figure had dropped to 17%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rau.edu.uy/uruguay/historia/Uy.hist3.htm "El Nacimiento del Uruguay Moderno en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1997, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of Uruguay conducted a Continuous Household Survey, of 40,000 homes, that included the topic of race in the country. Its results were based on "the explicit statements of the interviewee about the race they consider they belong themselves". These results were extrapolated, and the INE estimated that out of 2,790,600 inhabitants, some 2,602,200 were white (93.2%), some 164,200 (5.9%) were totally or partially black, some 12,100 were totally or partially Amerindian (0.4%), and the remaining 12,000 considered themselves Yellow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf "Encuesta Contínua de Hogares 1996-1997"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035805/http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf |date=2011-10-19 }}. Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Uruguay {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a new Enhanced National Household Survey touched on the topic again, but this time emphasizing ancestry, not race; the results revealed 5.8% more Uruguayans stated having total or partial black and/or Amerindian ancestry. This reduction in the percentage of self-declared "pure whites" between surveys could be caused by the phenomenon of the interviewee giving new value to their African heritage, similar to what has happened in Brazil in the last three censuses. Anyway, it is worth noting that 2,897,525 interviewées declared having only white ancestry (87.4%), 302,460 declared having total or partial black ancestry (9.1%), 106,368 total or partial Amerindian ancestry (2.9%) and 6,549 total or partial Yellow ancestry (0.2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/Informe%20final%20raza.pdf "Perfil Demográfico y Socioeconómico de la Población Uruguaya según su Ascendencia Racial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601180825/http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/Informe%20final%20raza.pdf |date=2012-06-01 }} por Marisa Bucheli y Wanda Cabela.

Recently many European and American immigrants have entered the country seeking peace and security, or escaping from the pollution and voracious tax systems in their countries of origin. In 1997, the Uruguayan government granted residence rights to only 200 European/American citizens; in 2008 the number of residence rights granted increased to 927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipro.com.uy/foro/index.php?topic=13491.0|title=Login|website=Antipro.com.uy|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official Venezuelan census, although "white" literally involves external issues such as light skin, shape and color of hair and eyes, among others, the term "white" has been used in different ways in different historical periods and places, and so its precise definition is somewhat confusing.&lt;ref name="Census2011"/&gt; For this reason, ''White Venezuelan'' is used to describe the [[Venezuela]]n [[Citizenship|citizen]] of [[European ethnic groups|European]] origin.

According to the 2011 National Population and Housing Census, 43.6% of the population identified themselves as [[white people]].&lt;ref name="Census2011"/&gt; A [[genome|genomic]] study shows that about 60.6% of the Venezuelan [[gene pool]] has European origin. Among the Latin American countries in the study (Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina exhibit the highest European contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godinho|first=Neide Maria de Oliveira|title=O impacto das migrações na constituição genética de populações latino-americanas|url=http://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/5542

The Venezuelan [[gene pool]] indicates a 60.6% European, 23.0% Amerindian, and 16.3% African ancestry.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt; Spaniards were introduced into [[Venezuela]] during the colonial period. Most of them were from [[Andalusia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and from the [[Canary Islands]]. Until the last years of World War II, a large part of European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, and their cultural impact was significant, influencing the development of Castilian in the country, its gastronomy and customs. With the beginning of oil production during the first decades of the 20th century, employees of oil companies from the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands established themselves in Venezuela. Later, in the middle of the century, there was a new wave of immigrants originating from Spain (mainly from Galicia, Andalucia, and Basque country, some being refugees from the [[Spanish Civil War]]), Italy (mainly from southern Italy and the Veneto region), and Portugal (from Madeira), as well as from Germany, France, England, [[Croatia]], the Netherlands, other European countries, and the [[Middle East]] (Lebanon), encouraged by a welcoming immigration policy to a prosperous, rapidly developing country where educated and skilled immigrants were needed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}
