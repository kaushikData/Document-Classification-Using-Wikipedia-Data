'''Maduabuchi "Abuchi" Obinwa''' (born January 15, 1997) is a [[Nigerian Americans|Nigerian-American]] professional [[association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[midfielder]].

==Youth==
Born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Obinwa spent time in his youth with Chicago Magic PSG, an affiliate of French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. While with the team, he was named the 2013 [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]]'s U15/16 Central Conference Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/39/us-soccer-awards-academy-players-and-coaches-of-year|title=U.S. SOCCER AWARDS U-15/16 AND U-17/18 ACADEMY PLAYERS AND COACHES OF YEAR FOR 2012-13 SEASON|website=USSoccer.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played with the PSG academy and spent time with the youth academy of Spanish club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref name=MRI&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/24282432|title=Obinwa refuses to rule out Nigeria despite MRI scan failure|website=BBC.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obinwa signed his first professional contract with German club [[Hannover 96]] on January 29, 2015, six months after he had signed an amateur contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/nigeria/news/150130/Abuchi_Obinwa_signs_for_Hannover_96|title=Abuchi Obinwa signs for Hannover 96|website=SuperSport.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never made a professional appearance, only appearing for the U19 side in the [[Under 19 Bundesliga|Under-19 Bundesliga North/Northeast]]. Obinwa made six appearances over two seasons with the U19s. He also appeared once on the bench for [[Hannover 96 II]] in the [[Regionalliga Nord]]. Obinwa was an unused substitute against [[VfR Neumünster]] on March 29, 2015.&lt;ref name=Soccerway&gt;{{Soccerway|abuchi-obinwa/358163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Columbus Crew SC===
On January 25, 2017 Obinwa signed with his hometown club [[Columbus Crew SC]] of [[Major League Soccer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus Crew SC sign young midfielders Abuchi Obinwa and Cristian Martinez|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/25/columbus-crew-sc-sign-young-midfielders-abuchi-obinwa-and-cristian-martinez|website=MLSSoccer.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for Columbus on July 17 in a [[Exhibition game#Club football|friendly]] against German club [[Eintracht Frankfurt]], replacing [[Mohammed Abu]] in the 67th minute of a 1–0 victory for Crew SC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbuscrewsc.com/post/2017/07/17/recap-crew-sc-measures-friendly-defeats-eintracht-frankfurt|title=RECAP: Crew SC measures up in friendly, defeats Eintracht Frankfurt|website=ColumbusCrewSC.com|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obinwa spent the rest of the season on loan to Pittsburgh, and finished the year without appearing again for Crew SC.

On December 1, 2017, Crew SC declined Obinwa's contract option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbuscrewsc.com/post/2017/12/01/options-exercised-9-players-ahead-2018-season|title=Options exercised on 9 players ahead of 2018 season|website=ColumbusCrewSC.com|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the club after just one season, and did not make an official appearance while in Columbus.

====Loan to Pittsburgh Riverhounds====
On March 25, 2017 Columbus sent Obinwa on loan to their affiliate [[Pittsburgh Riverhounds]] in the [[United Soccer League|USL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riverhounds seek strong start despite challenging opening matchup|url=http://triblive.com/sports/riverhounds/12106569-74/hounds-want-strong-start|website=TribLive.com|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obinwa made his professional debut on April 8, 2017 against [[Charleston Battery]], entering in the 13th minute to replace fellow Crew SC loanee [[Ben Swanson]] as the Riverhounds picked up a 2–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverhounds.com/news_article/show/779152?referrer_id=2869741|title=HOUNDS KNOCK OFF CHARLESTON IN EPIC FASHION, 2-1|website=Riverhounds.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, April 12, he started for the first time in his professional career, against [[Saint Louis FC]]. Obinwa played 67 minutes before being replaced by [[Michael Green (soccer)|Michael Green]] as the Riverhounds were defeated 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverhounds.com/news_article/show/780946?referrer_id=2869741|title=HOUNDS OUTLASTED BY SAINT LOUIS, 2-1|website=Riverhounds.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obinwa played sparingly for the remainder of the season, finishing the year with just seven appearances for Pittsburgh.

==International career==
Obinwa has represented the United States at U15, U16, [[United States men's national under-17 soccer team|U17]], [[United States men's national under-18 soccer team|U18]], and [[United States men's national under-20 soccer team|U20]] level. Obinwa made three appearances for the U18s at the 2014 U18 International Tournament in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where he played alongside future club teammate [[Ben Swanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/06/02/09/45/140602-u18-mnt-lisbon-tournament-roster-rel|title=U-18 MNT TO PLAY AT INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT IN PORTUGAL|website=USSoccer.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would be called up for the U20 team for the 2015 Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament in [[Serbia]], again playing alongside Swanson and making two appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2015/08/28/12/31/150828-u20mnt-begins-new-cycle-at-stevan-vilotic-tournament|title=U-20 MNT BEGINS NEW CYCLE AT STEVAN VILOTIC TOURNAMENT IN SERBIA|website=USSoccer.com|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a dual-citizen, Obinwa is eligible to represent the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] or [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbuscrewsc.com/players/abuchi-obinwa|title=Abuchi Obinwa – Columbus Crew SC|website=ColumbusCrewSC.com|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also qualifies for the Super Eagles through his parents, who are both Nigerian.

===Nigeria age fabrication scandal===
In July 2013, sixteen-year-old Obinwa [[Age fraud in association football#Introduction of MRI|controversially failed]] an MRI test when undergoing assessment to represent the [[Nigeria national under-17 football team|Nigeria U17]] team at the [[2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] despite having the necessary paperwork from his country of birth, the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=MRI/&gt; Nigeria went on to win the tournament and claim their fourth U-17 World Cup.

The '''Ajam of Bahrain''' or or '''Persian Bahrainis''' or '''Iranian Bahrainis''' ({{lang-fa|ایرانیان بحرین}}, {{lang-ar|عجم البحرین}}) are an [[ethnic group]] in [[Bahrain]] composed of [[Shia]] [[Bahrain]]i citizens of non-Arab [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Iranian diaspora|national background]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary]. Clive Holes. 2001. Page 135. {{ISBN|90-04-10763-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ajam are mostly bilingual in Persian and Arabic.

==History==
Persian migration into Bahrain  goes back to the days of the Sassanid and Achaemenid Persian empire, though in modern times it has been constant for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="constant"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|pages=XXX}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has always been a flow of Persian-speaking Shi'a into Bahrain.&lt;ref name="flow"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&amp;pg=PR26&amp;d|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|pages=XXVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1910, the Persian community funded and opened a [[private school]], Al-Ittihad school, that taught [[Persian language|Persian]] amongst other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirawi|first=May Al-Arrayed|title=Education in Bahrain - 1919-1986, An Analytical Study of Problems and Progress|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/6662/1/6662_3966.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|year=1987|publisher=Durham University|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Manama Souq]], many Persians were clustered in the neighborhood of [[Fareeq Mushbir|Mushbir]]. However they resettled in other areas with the development of new towns and expansion of villages during the era of late [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]]. Today, a significant amount of them are based in Muharraq's Shia enclaves and [[Bahrain Island]]'s modernized Shia towns.

==Matam Al-Ajam Al-Kabeer==
{{Main|Muharram in Bahrain}}
[[File:مأتم العجم الكبير Matam Ajam.jpg|thumb|Matam Al-Ajam Al-Kabeer in [[Manama]].]]
Matam Al-Ajam Al-Kabeer ([[Arabic]]:مأتم العجم الكبير) is the first Persian [[Hussainia|Matam]] and the largest such matam in Bahrain. The matam was founded in [[Fareej el-Makharqa]] by  Abdul-Nabi Al-Kazerooni, a rich Persian merchant who was representative of the Persian community in the council of the [[hakim (title)|hakim]] [[Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa]].&lt;ref name=Khuri&gt;{{cite book |last=Khuri |first=Fuad Ishaq |authorlink= |title=Tribe and state in Bahrain: The transformation of social and political authority in an Arab state. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/49926979/Tribe-and-State-in-Bahrain |accessdate= |year=1980 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=[[United States of America]] |isbn=0-226-43473-7 |page=160|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Himself an immigrant from the [[Bushehr County|Dashti]] region of Iran, he single-handedly organised processions, collected donations and hired [[orator]]s ({{lang-ar|خطيب}}) to speak at the matam.&lt;ref name=Khuri/&gt; Construction started in 1882 as a specialized building where [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], a holy day in [[Shia Islam]], would be marked with processions, [[Zanjeer zani|ceremonial flagellation]] and passion plays commemorating the death of [[Imam Hussain]].&lt;ref name=Nelida&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuccaro|first=Nelida|title=Mapping the Transnational Community: Persians and the Space of the City in Bahrain, c. 1869-1937|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415331357|pages=48, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEus420fcbgC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=931vsIKBcL&amp;dq=Mapping%20the%20Transnational%20Community%3A%20Persians%20and%20the%20Space%20of%20the%20City%20in%20Bahrain%2C%20c.%201869-1937&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=Mapping%20the%20Transnational%20Community:%20Persians%20and%20the%20Space%20of%20the%20City%20in%20Bahrain,%20c.%201869-1937&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matam is still used for this purpose.

It was originally built with simple construction material such as [[palm tree]] trunks and leaf stalks. The matam was formally established in 1904 where it was decided that the matam would be renovated with rocks, clay and cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matam Al Ajam Al Kabeer (Grand Mosque of Ajam)|url=http://bhguide.com/2010/08/24/matam-al-ajam-al-kabeer-grand-mosque-of-ajam/|publisher=Bahrain Guide|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially in the 1890s, the matam was primarily supported by Persian merchants, with two-thirds of the donation coming from the [[Bushehr]]i and Safar family, respectively. For much of the 20th century, the matam had relied on yearly donations of money and land from rich and poor members of the Persian community and from [[waqf]] revenue.&lt;ref name=Nelida/&gt; The matam also had an emergency relief fund that was to be distributed to the poor and to needy individuals; the matam provided financial aid and shelter to people following the collapse of the [[Pearl hunting|pearling]] market in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Nelida/&gt;

Upon the death of Abdul-Nabi Al-Kazerooni in 1927, Abdul Nabi Bushehri, himself a Persian immigrant from [[Bushehr]] and a well-respected figure in the Persian community, took control of the matam.&lt;ref name=Khuri/&gt; Unlike his close friend, Bushehri ran the matam with other notables of the Persian community, forming a [[de facto]] board. Upon Bushehri's death in 1945, the board took over. In order to prevent confusion, the board appointed a specific member, Hasan Baljik, to act as key carrier to the matam &amp; responsible for programs and budgetary issues. &lt;ref name=Khuri/&gt; In 1971, an administrative board consisting of a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and others was set up, all of whom were rich merchants.&lt;ref name=Khuri/&gt;

==Culture==

===Language===
They speak southern [[Persian language|Persian]] dialects distinctive to the cities they have originated from, e.g.

* "Why" in official Persian dialect is "''baráye che''" ({{lang-fa|برای چه؟}}) while in southern Persian dialect is "''seche''" ({{lang-fa|سیچه؟}})
* "Money" in official Persian dialect is "''Púl''" ({{lang-fa|پول}}) while in southern Persian dialect is "''payse''" ({{lang-fa|پِیسه}})
* "Do you want water?" in official Persian dialect is "''áb mikháhi''" ({{lang-fa|آب می خواهی؟}}) while in southern Persian dialect is "''ow mikhay''" ({{lang-fa|اُو مي خای؟}})
 
In addition to this, many names of villages in Bahrain are derived from [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name=Tajer/&gt; These names were thought to have been as a result influences during the [[Safavid]] rule of Bahrain (1501–1722) and previous Persian rule. City and Village names such as [[Manama]], [[Karbabad]], [[Salmabad]], [[Karzakan]], [[Samaheej]], [[Tashan, Bahrain|Tashan]], [[Duraz]], [[Barbar, Bahrain|Barbar]], [[Demistan]], [[Karrana]], [[Shakhura]], [[Shahrekan]], and [[Jurdab]] were originally derived from the Persian language, suggesting that Persians had a substantial effect on the island's history.&lt;ref name=Tajer/&gt;

===Food===
One of the notable local delicacies of the [[Persian people|Persians]] in Bahrain is [[mahyawa]], consumed in Southern Iran as well, is a watery earth brick coloured sauce made from sardines and consumed with bread or other food. Persians are known and are famous in Bahrain for bread-making. Another local delicacy is "pishoo" made from rose water (golab) and agar agar. Cham-Chamoo is a sweet naan that is made similar to Qeshm Island version. Other food items consumed are similar to [[Persian cuisine]].

The '''Alpine Club of Canada''' ('''ACC''') is an amateur athletic association with its national office in [[Canmore, Alberta]] that has been a focal point for Canadian [[mountaineering]] since its founding in 1906.  The club was co-founded by [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler]], who served as its first president, and [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]], a journalist for the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press|Manitoba Free Press]]''.  [[Byron Harmon]], whose 6500+ photographs of the [[Canadian Rockies]] in the early 20th century provide the best glimpse of the area at that time, was official photographer to the club at its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Pole, Graeme (1991) ''The Canadian Rockies: A History in Photographs'', p. 71-2. Altitude Publishing, Canmore, Alberta.  {{ISBN|1551539004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club is the leading organization in Canada devoted to [[climbing]], mountain culture, and issues related to alpine pursuits and ecology. It is also the Canadian regulatory organization for [[climbing competition]], sanctioning local, regional and national events, and assembling, coaching and supporting the national team.

The ACC is divided into 22 regional sections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/sections/ |title=ACC regional sections |publisher=Alpineclubofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204161455/http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/sections/ |archive-date=2012-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; across Canada that serve local members and focus on local issues and access, linking mountain enthusiasts to the national community.  The club also maintains membership in international organizations including the [[International Federation of Sport Climbing]] and the [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] ([[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme|U.I.A.A.]]), provides year-round mountain adventures and an extensive system of [[:Category:Mountain huts in Canada|alpine and backcountry huts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/info.html |title=ACC huts and hostels |publisher=Alpineclubofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the [[Canadian Rockies]], the ACC has grown from its early inception into a full-fledged mountain organization with a strong foundation of volunteer, professional and corporate support.  The club's goals remain the promotion of the sport of competitive climbing, mountain culture adventure, access, and environmental responsibility.  The ACC publishes the annual ''[[Canadian Alpine Journal]]'', which serves as the journal of record for Canadian achievements in [[climbing]], [[mountaineering]], [[ski mountaineering]], and [[exploration]] of mountains.

While the ACC's national office is in Canmore, Alberta, the core of the Club's activities are the volunteer-led outdoor recreation opportunities offered to its approximately 10,000 members through the 22 regional sections across the country.

In 2006, [[Canada Post]] issued a stamp to celebrate the club's centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountaineering: 1906-2006|url=http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/collecting/stamps/2006/2006_july_mountaineering.jsf|publisher=Canada Post|accessdate=14 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017070833/http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/collecting/stamps/2006/2006_july_mountaineering.jsf|archive-date=2013-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The founders===
[[File:Arthur Oliver Wheeler.jpg|thumb|A.O. Wheeler]]
In the spirit of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] created in England in 1857, and the [[American Alpine Club]] (founded 1902), the ACC was established in Winnipeg in 1906 by [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler|A.O. Wheeler]] and [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]], with the support of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Arthur O. Wheeler, who was born in 1860 in Kilkenny County, Ireland, immigrated to Canada in 1876 at the age of 16 with his family. Beginning in 1883, he worked for the Dominion Government and Canadian Pacific Railway as a land surveyor in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. His employment allowed him to experience mountaineering while exposing him to environmental concerns about the future of Canadian wilderness. He was described by climbing enthusiast Andrew J. Kauffman as having "Irish emotions, Irish sensitivity, Irish grace and, more frequently than some would like, an Irish temper". He was eager to create a Canadian climbing institution that focused on mutual appreciation of mountaineering and the environment rather than furthering social status, as it was in Britain's Alpine Club.

Wheeler's wrote many letters seeking support for the creation of a Canadian Alpine Club, which eventually ended up in the hands of columnist [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]]. A native of Winnipeg, Parker was an avid nationalist and an environmental enthusiast. Conscious of the benefit of mountains, she took her children to Banff in the summer of 1904. She spent 18 months there and began writing newspaper and magazine articles about the mountains. Even if her health did not allow her to be a climber she thought that mountaineering could help women become stronger and more confident.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Krause, Amy. "Sharing the Rope: Guiding and the ACC." The Alpine Club of Canada Gazette, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After reading her articles, an editor of the ''[[Manitoba Free Press]]'' referenced her to Wheeler's letters. Writing an article in response to his letter, Parker advocated the establishment of an Alpine Club. However, she believed that it should be solely Canadian to encourage the development of national identity and reaffirm Canadian independence. Together they combined their efforts to create the Alpine Club of Canada.

===Creation===
[[Image:ACC-triangle.png|center|thumb|ACC centennial logo]]
The inaugural meeting took place on March 27 and 28 1906. [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler|A.O. Wheeler]] became President and [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]] was named First Secretary. Several categories of members were created with different levels of involvement: Honorary Members (who had already distinguished themselves in the field of mountaineering), Active Members (who have made an assent of a peak of at least 10,000 feet). The first official camp of the ACC took place in July 1906. Thanks to the Canadian Pacific Railway, campers arrived at Field, B.C in Yoho National Park on July 8. The camp's chief mountaineer was Morrison Bridgland. The ACC received helped from professional mountain guides Edouard and Gottfried Feuz, from Switzerland. The Dominion Government, as recognition of its "spirit of patriotism", sponsored the camp, as well as the government of Alberta, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the [[North-West Mounted Police]]. Every member paid a dollar a day: with its 100 participants, the camp was considered a success. Morrison Bridgland chose the official climb, the 3066 meter-high Vice President: 44 members graduated and became Active Member of the Alpine Club of Canada.

===Purpose===
Molded after the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in Great Britain, the Alpine Club of Canada was created to give environmental enthusiasts an opportunity to explore and experience the Canadian wilderness. Unlike the Alpine Club of Great Britain, the Alpine Club of Canada was created to promote equality between men and women within mountaineering and climbing, and to promote the conservation and preservation of Canadian wilderness.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Reichwein, PearlAnn. Beyond the Visionary Mountains: The Alpine Club of Canada and the Canadian National Park Idea, 1906 to 1969. : Carleton University, 1996. http://search.proquest.com/docview/304235022 (accessed February 19, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century development in Canada expanded into mountain ecosystems, so founders [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]] and [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler|A.O. Wheeler]] created the ACC to advocate the prevention of human infiltrations such as electricity and housing in the Canadian wilderness. The ACC helped progress societies mindset towards nature, mountaineering and the environment. Established in the first club meeting in 1906, the committee created a charter with key points that would help progress the club and their vision.

This charter included:
# To encourage Canadians to value the rich mountain environments.
# The use of mountain wilderness as a recreational playground.
# The conservation of mountain ecosystems, and the organisms that live in them
# The exchange of wilderness literature with other environmentally focused organizations.
# Encourage the development of scientific exploration and study of Canadian alpine glaciers.
# Cultivation of artwork associated with the outdoors&lt;ref&gt;Goldsborough, Gordon. Manitoba Climbers: A Century of Stories from the Birthplace of the Alpine Club of Canada. University of Manitoba, 2006. http://search.proquest.com/docview/235989844/abstract (accessed February 19, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles reflected the member's goal to create a club that promoted the natural heritage of Canada while encouraging the urban classes of society to exercise in the outdoors. In 1923, the club was involved in activism concerning the construction of [[hydroelectric dams]] in places such as [[Waterton Lake]], the [[Spray Lakes]], and [[Lake Minnewanka]]. This put the ACC at the forefront of conservation groups, which helped it to create the [[National Parks of Canada]] in 1923. Beginning in 1906 and continuing until 1950, the Alpine Club of Canada progressed their relationship with the National Parks of Canada to promote outdoor activities, mountaineering and conservation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; After the two World Wars, the ACC's philosophy progressed from being centered around strict conservation of the environment to encouraging outdoor recreation while maintaining a respectful appreciation of Canada's wilderness. The ACC and the NPC worked together to expand the parks system for easier access to the public. During these formative years, the ACC surveyed much for the Canadian Rockies which had been previously unmapped.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsborough, Gordon. Manitoba Climbers: A Century of Stories from the Birthplace of the Alpine Club of Canada. University of Manitoba , 2006. http://search.proquest.com/docview/235989844/abstract (accessed February 19, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The club also acted as management for the new National Parks board and aided with administration. The ACC aided in restoration of natural areas that were to be integrated into the parks while establishing the Park's conservation policies. As the National Parks in both the United States and Canada gained popularity, outdoor recreation became a prominent activity for many Canadians, which helped shape the ACC's goal and mission.

The mission of the ACC has evolved since 1906, but since the creation of the original charters, the club has promoted the sport of climbing and the recreational use and protection of mountain wilderness. The ACC viewed the [[National parks of Canada]] as assets that should be used by the public for recreation, but also held in trust to be preserved for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgins, Bruce W., and John Marsh. Changing Parks:the history, future and cultural context of parks and heritage landscapes. Dundurn Press Ltd., 1998. https://books.google.com/books?id=jJIutMTbVnQC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=beyond the visionary mountains&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=22tIT5OfHeqiiQLM1LjbDQ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Alpine Club Of Canada (106704182rr0001) was registered with Canadian Revenue Agency as a Canadian amateur athletic association (RCAAA); therefore, they can issue official donation receipts and are eligible to receive gifts from registered charities since 1972-05-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/qlfd-dns/qd-lstngs/RCAAA-ACESA-lst-eng.html#reg|title=List of registered Canadian amateur athletic associations - Canada.ca|first=Canada Revenue|last=Agency|website=www.cra-arc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing competition===
Since the advent of [[sport climbing]] competitions on artificial surfaces in the mid-1980s, the Alpine Club of Canada has sanctioned (first through the UIAA, and since 2007 through the IFSC) national competitions and an international team. The first Canadian national championships were held in 1988 onstage in a theatre at the [[Banff Centre]]. Wholly as a part of the ACC, Climbing Escalade Canada (CEC) is a committee responsible for the regulation and development of the sport in Canada and by Canadians abroad. The CEC is working toward recognition by [[Sport Canada]] as the national sports organization for competitive climbing, by bringing together provincial sports organizations [currently established in the provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]. Canadians have been relatively successful internationally in the disciplines of [[climbing competition#Lead|Lead]] and [[Climbing competition#Bouldering|Bouldering]], with a legacy of athletes including the Weldon sisters and most recently [[Sean McColl]].

The Alpine Club of Canada also regulates the competitive sports of ice-climbing (through the UIAA) and ski-mountaineering (through the [[International Ski Mountaineering Federation]]).

===Club activities===
The main activities offered by the Club are its camps and its system of Mountain huts. The Club uses its 20 regional club sections to currently operate 28 huts representing the most extensive system of backcountry accommodation on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/info.html |title=Alpine Club of Canada - Clubhouse and Mountain Huts / Hut and Hostel Details |publisher=Alpineclubofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Club's first annual General Mountaineering Camp was held in July 1906 in [[Yoho National Park]], with the idea of educating Canadians about mountain travel and instilling a sense of national pride in their mountain heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Findlay|first=Andrew|title=Wheeler's Dream [Alpine Club of Canada]|journal=Canada's History|year=2006|volume=86|issue=1|pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The camps began as a very modest way to introduce middle-class Canadians to the life of mountaineering. With donations from both the Federal and the Alberta Provincial government, over a 100 members marched their way to the Yoho Pass where a temporary Tent village had been erected with the help of the CPR and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Amy. "Camps in the Clouds." The Alpine Club of Canada Gazette, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With the expedition a resounding success, the Club has made summer camps for members an annual feature. The summer camps have grown incredibly popular over the years. Acknowledged as an annual celebration by many, some camps have special historical significance such as the 1920 camp which was considered a coming home camp for members returning from [[World War I]]. Although the camps originated with only a few tents and cooking utensils, the camps now sometimes boast transport helicopters, propane cooking and hot showers as some of the amenities available to the hundreds of members who make the camps a memorable part of their membership. The style of the camps may have changed over the years; however, the goal remains the same: to improve mountaineering skills and push the limits of the members through tougher and tougher climbs.

While the ACC's national office is in [[Canmore, Alberta]], the core of the Club's activities are the volunteer-led climbing opportunities offered to its membership through 20 regional sections across the country. The ACC has a calendar of winter and summer programs including leadership training, technical climbing instruction and international expeditions (for example, in 1997 the Saskatchewan section of the Club held a successful trip to [[Cho Oyu]], an 8,201m peak in [[Nepal]] and more recently the Club offered a trip to the snowy peaks of [[Chile]] in January 2012). The different activities offered through the club are as diverse as mountaineering itself; one can learn to do Winter or Summer climbs, improve their backcountry skiing skills or refresh their ice climbing technique. Also accreditation for various certificates is available through the Club. The programmed adventures are also geared towards all skill levels and for all age groups. The only main criteria for the activities is that membership to the Club is required.  The dedicated group of volunteers who organize these excursions are members themselves. Finally, the Club is also the focal point for Canadian mountain culture through its website, publications and programs. For instance, it is a big supporter of the annual [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Banff Mountain Film]] &amp; [[Banff Mountain Book Festival|Book Festival]].

===Club legacy===

From its origins in Winnipeg more than a century ago to the current, the Alpine Club of Canada has altered slightly. As the Club's founders expected it, the ACC has played a crucial role in shaping both the Canadian territory and the Canadian identity. As A.O.Wheeler wrote it in 1953, "The Club is a permanency and in its 47 years of existence has done more than any other single institution to open up our mountains and bring revenue to the Parks and to Canada, both as a Club as such and from the explorations of its individual members, Canadian, British and American".&lt;ref&gt;"At the foot of the mountain: preliminary thoughts on the alpine club of Canada", 1906-1950, by Pearl Ann Reichwein, p 168, in Changing parks: the history, future and cultural context of parks and heritage landscapes, Hodgins Bruce W., John Marsh, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Club played a key role in the progression of the Canadian national park system, especially because of its longevity and its strongly rooted values, which enabled its members to always strike a balance between preservation and use. The author, Pearl Ann Reichwein, highlights the same idea, fifty years later: "Since creating its charter almost 90 year ago the ACC maintained extraordinary continuity as witnessed by the Canadian Alpine Journal, published annually. Conceived with a wide-ranging agenda beyond the scope of a simple mountaineering club, the ACC has remained an agile and long-lived national organization".&lt;ref&gt;"At the foot of the mountain: preliminary thoughts on the alpine club of Canada", 1906-1950, by Pearl Ann Reichwein, p 160, in Changing parks: the history, future and cultural context of parks and heritage landscapes, Hodgins Bruce W., John Marsh, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Canadian Alpine Journal''===
The ACC publishes the annual ''Canadian Alpine Journal'', "the oldest and most respected publication of its kind in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/whoweare/history.html |title=Bev Bendell, Members Handbook 1996 |publisher=Alpineclubofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110032915/http://alpineclubofcanada.ca/whoweare/history.html |archive-date=2013-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canadian Alpine Journal'' was established only a year after the ACC had its first general meeting and has been published over 90 times in the last century. According to the ACC website, the journal provides the reader with "articles and images that reflect the ways that Canadians approach mountain culture, history, sport and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/caj/index.html |title=Alpine Club of Canada - Publications / The Canadian Alpine Journal |publisher=Alpineclubofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515013135/http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/caj/index.html |archive-date=2013-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal was and still is published every year, collecting route descriptions, records of adventures, mountain photography, geographical and natural science observations, poems, songs, cartoons and obituaries remembering Club members. Whilst the Journal is an annual publication, the Club also publishes The Gazette, a newsletter released three times a year, one for the spring, summer and winter season. The year 2006 saw the publication of the Centennial Gazette, a special issue celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the ACC. In the ceremony's opening speech, Mike Mortimer, the Club president in 2006 declared: "Clearly the Centennial was an opportunity to look towards the future – we knew where we came from but what about where we are going? Obviously we would not have the hubris to plan the next century, but maybe we would be in a position to examine the guidelines set by our founding members and see if the cornerstones, that had been laid in Winnipeg and which had served us so well in the previous century, could do the same in the next century".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The club has expanded its activities over the last century – it is now responsible for the largest public backcountry hut system in North America and proposes trip opportunities around the world.

==Vision and mission==

===A place for women===
The ACC is known as the world's first national mountaineering club to welcome women. Most Alpine Clubs were fashioned after the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in England that did not welcome women and had separate organizations reserved for ladies. Because [[Elizabeth Parker (journalist)|Elizabeth Parker]] was one of the two founders of the Alpine Club of Canada, women were never excluded from the ACC. At the end of the first camp in 1906, 15 women (out of 44 members) graduated and became active members of the ACC.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Amy. "Building a National Alpine Tradition." The Alpine Club of Canada Gazette, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Women's participation alongside men became evident in the Club activities and summer camps and those events were frequently used to promote women as legitimate members. On a regular basis, women were perceived in the ACC as able as men. They were encouraged and helped, and after the ACC's first camp it was decided that the dress-code for women would be the same as for men (which was very unusual in the early 20th century society). However, this official equality was sometimes challenged. Indeed, Arthur Wheeler's efforts to publicly acknowledge women's contribution to the ACC led to the distinction of women as a special group. Praising women for their ability to perform basic mountaineering skills, accomplishments for which men's ability was not even questioned, contributed to a sort of patronizing attitude towards women members. For instance, before 1923, no women were to be found among the ACC members volunteer guides.&lt;ref&gt;Louie, Siri, Winona. Gender in the Alpine Club of Canada, 1906-1940. Calgary, Alberta: The University of Calgary, 1996. http://search.proquest.com/docview/304312493/ (accessed February 17, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ACC played an important part in women's mountaineering, and some women, both American and Canadian, became important and famous mountaineers, such as [[Phyllis Munday]].

===International===
The continuing mission of the Alpine Club of Canada is to "foster alpine experiences, knowledge and culture; promoting responsible access; and supporting excellence in alpine leadership and skills".  Membership in the national organization is approximately 10,000, and the Club also represents Canada as a member of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) – an international "organization of climbing organizations".  In this way the ACC works towards its vision of "Preserving, practicing and promoting Canadian mountain culture and self-propelled alpine pursuits."

==Huts==
[[Image:Balfour hut aug 2005.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Balfour Hut with Mount Balfour in the background, Sept. 2005]]

The Alpine Club of Canada operates an extensive system of [[alpine club huts]] available to both members and non-members, primarily in the Canadian Rockies, providing rustic accommodation  (though many of these huts are accessible only by experienced mountaineers).  These huts offer exceptional access to the backcountry, and a quick look at a few of these facilities and their surroundings provides a survey of the mountain recreation resources available in Canada.  For example:

*[[Abbot Pass Hut]], built in 1922 sits at 2,925m on the Alberta-British Columbia border (51.36406,-116.290204) between Mount Victoria and Mount Lefroy.
*[[Arthur O. Wheeler hut|A.O. Wheeler]] (51.263512,-117.489953) and Asulkan (51.211601,-117.463174) huts are in Glacier National Park, British Columbia and are popular year-round destinations for hikers and skiers.
*[[R.J. Ritchie Hut|Balfour]] (51.591562,-116.454921) and [[Bow Hut|Bow]] (51.634825,-116.489611) are two of four ACC huts on the Wapta Icefield near the Continental Divide, from there water flows to the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans.
*[[Bill Putnam hut|Fairy Meadow Hut]] (51.763257,-117.876534) in the Selkirk Mountains provides access to such popular backcountry skiing that a lottery system must be used to make a reservation there.
*[[Conrad Kain hut]] (50.738338,-116.763324), among the granite spires of Bugaboo Provincial Park, is named after an Austrian mountain guide who was the first to climb many Canadian mountains including Robson (3,954m), the highest point in the Rockies.
*[[Neil Colgan Hut]] built between Mount Little and Mount Bowlin is the highest permanent structure in Canada, sitting at 2,957m.

Most of these huts require advance reservation.  Members may reserve huts earlier than the general public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">The '''Bachgoti Khanzada''' is a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are a sub-group within the larger [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Common surnames include [[Khan (title)|khan]] and [[Kunwar (title)|kunwar]].&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Sultanpur District Volume XLVI: Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The Bachgoti Khanzada claim descent from Tilok Chand, a Bachgoti [[Rajput]] chieftain, who was a contemporary of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Babur|Babar]]. Tilok Chand is said to have been captured by the Emperor, after an unsuccessful rebellion, and given the option to convert to [[Islam]], or face long incarceration. He chose the former option, and took the new name Tatar Khan. His sons, Barid Khan and Jalal Khan adopted the name the khanzada, which literally means a son of a khan. Hasan Khan, a son of Barid Khan, is said to have founded the town of [[Hasanpur]], which was the headquarters of the tribe. The Bachgoti Khanzada were substantial landowners in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], and provided the [[taluqdar]] families of [[Hasanpur]], Maniarpur and Gangeo.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present Circumstances ==

The Bachgoti Khanzada are found mainly in the districts of [[Faizabad District|Faizabad]] and [[Sultanpur District|Sultanpur]]. They are [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s, the Bachgoti speak both [[Awadhi]] and [[Urdu]]. They were at one time substantial landowners, but with the carrying out of land reform by the [[government of India]] after independence in 1947, they lost many of their larger estates. The community are now small to medium-sized farmers, growing wheat, sorghum, pulses and sugar cane. They have no caste council or panchayat, although there are localized panchayats in their villages. Although the community did practice clan exogamy, this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and Castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of belonging to the [[Rajput]] community remains strong, with the Bachgoti Khanzada still strongly identifying themselves with the wider [[Rajput]] community of [[Awadh]], and often refer to themselves as simply [[Rajput]]. This is shown by the persistence in their marriages of Rajput customs, like bursting of fire crackers and sending specially made [[Laddu|laddoos]] to biradati members. Many members of the community continue to serve in the armed forces of [[India]], an activity traditionally associated with the Rajputs. However, like other [[Indian Muslim]]s, there is growing movement towards orthodoxy, with many of their villages containing [[madrasa]]s. The madrasas have also facilitated the growth of [[Urdu]], with it beginning to replace the [[Awadhi]] dialect they traditionally spoke.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/times-of-india-the/mi_8012/is_20070708/muslim-rajputs-india/ai_n39451474/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous Belarusians lived and created in Lithuania, mostly its capital [[Vilnius]]; it was in Vilnius that the first standardized Belarusian language grammar was printed in.

According to the 2011 census, only 18.4% of [[Belarusians]] speak Belarusian as their mother tongue, while Russian is native for 56.3%, Polish - 9.3%, Lithuanian - 5.2% of Belarusians.

The most widespread religion among Belarusians are Roman Catholicism (49.6%) and Orthodox (32.3%).

Francysk Skaryna gymnasium is the only Belarusian school in Vilnius. One Catholic church in Vilnius (St. Bartholomew’s Church) provides religious services in Belarusian.

'''Biographical research''' is a [[qualitative research]] approach aligned to the social interpretive paradigm of research. The biographical research is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The material for analysis consists of interview protocols ([[memorandum]]s), video recordings, photographs, and a diversity of sources. These documents are evaluated and interpreted according to specific rules and criteria. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual [[biography]] in terms of its social constitution. The biographical approach was influenced by the [[symbolic interactionism]], the [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Schütz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]). Therefore, biography is understood in terms of a [[Social constructionism|social construct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|last=Berger|first=Peter|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Garden City, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reconstruction of biographies can give insight on [[Figurational sociology|social processes and figurations]] (as in [[Norbert Elias]]), thus helping to bridge the gap between micro-, meso-, and macro- [[Level of analysis|levels of analysis]]. The biographical approach is particularly important in German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soziologie.de/de/sektionen/biographieforschung/portrait/|title=DGS - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie: Portrait|website=soziologie.de|language=DE|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is used in the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] as well as in [[Pedagogy]] and other disciplines. The Research Committee 38 "Biography and Society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=ISA - RC38 Biography and Society|website=ISA, International Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Sociological Association|International Sociological Association (ISA)]] was created in 1984 and is dedicated "to help develop a better understanding of the relations between individual lives, the social structures and historical processes within which they take shape and which they contribute to shape, and the individual accounts of biographical experience (such as life stories or autobiographies)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=Objectives of the RC 38 Biography and Society|last=|first=|date=|website=isa-sociology.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Biographical Research ==
[[Biography|Biographies]], including autobiographies, have always contained a sociological dimension since their advent in the Antiquity ([[Plutarch]]). For the most part of the usage of this notion, biographers dealt with outstanding individual personalities (such as politicians and artists) but there were also exceptions, such as [[Ulrich Bräker]]’s autobiography, “The Poor Man of Toggenburg” (''Der arme Mann im Toggenburg''). The emergence of [[Sociology]] influenced an approach to biography that extended this notion beyond the individual dimension, such as the works of [[Alphons Silbermann]] on the life of the composer [[Jacques Offenbach]] and [[Norbert Elias]] on the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mozart: Portrait of a Genius|last=Elias|first=Norbert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0520084759|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biography as a form of access to larger groupings ===
The biographical method as a research approach to understand larger groupings was used as sociological material by [[Florian Znaniecki]] and [[W. I. Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]] in the 1920s. After their work, the biographical approach was considered amongst the dominant research approaches in empirical social research. The study ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918–1920) by Znaniecki and Thomas used an extensive collection of diaries, letters, [[memoir]]s, [[Autobiography|autobiographies]], and other personal and archival documents as main source for a sociological investigation. The reception of this work was initially late due to linguistic barriers, but it was then absorbed and disseminated in the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC). The biographical research approach formed an important foundation for the development of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], which later influenced the [[symbolic interactionism]] and the work of sociologists such as [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess|Ernest W. Burgess]], and [[George Herbert Mead]].

Another milestone in the development of biographical research was the analysis of the [[Life course approach|life course]] of delinquent youths written by Clifford R. Shaw in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jack Roller. A Delinquent Boy's Own Story|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-70093-1|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Natural History of a Delinquent Career|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|orig-year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, the interest in biographical research declined due to the success of [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] and [[Structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] theories. The biographical approach influence was felt mainly in the study of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. In 1978, [[Aaron Cicourel|Aaron Victor Cicourel]] published a case study on the [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] of a boy named Mark, that received special attention in the discipline of [[social work]]. Cicourel’s study explored in detail how a criminal career was constructed through [[Interrogation|police interrogation]], individual and distorted interpretations, and institutional [[document]]s.

=== Recent Biographical Research ===
Since the 1980s, biographical research gained momentum in the wake of a growing interest for qualitative social research. Biographical research is now a recognized  approach in sociology, especially in the German Sociological Tradition (see [[Fritz Schütze]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schütze|first=Fritz|date=2007|title=Biography Analysis on the Empirical Base of Autobiographical Narratives: How to Analyse Autobiographical Narrative Interviews - Part I|url=http://www.zsm.ovgu.de/zsm_media/Das+Zentrum/Forschungsprojekte/INVITE/B2_1-p-140.pdf|journal=University of Magdeburg|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kohli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohli|first=Martin|date=1986|title=Biographical Research in the German Language Area|url=|journal=A Commemorative Book in Honor of Florian Znaniecki|volume=|pages=91–110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Fuchs-Heinritz and others). This development was supported by a tendency to shift the sociological focus from [[system]] and [[structure]] to the [[lifeworld]], the [[everyday life]], and the resurgence of [[Phenomenological sociology|phenomenological approaches]] in sociology (under the influence of [[Edmund Husserl]]). The sociology turned to the reconstruction of biographical cases and individual life courses as a form to gain insight on [[Process|social processes]].

With the increasing pluralization of [[Lifeworld|life-worlds]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], and [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]] in [[Postmodernity|Postmodern societies]], the dissolution of [[Social conservatism|traditional values]] and the conference of meaning, the biographical approach proved useful to study these [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] of the turn of the millennium. The actor became an intersection of different and sometimes divergent determinants, logics, expectations, normative models, and institutionalized mechanisms of control (see [[Georg Simmel]]’s chapter “The Intersection of Social Circles”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: inquiries into the construction of social forms|last=Simmel|first=Georg|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2009|isbn=978-90-04-17321-7|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|pages=363–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The “normal biography” broke up and prompted the [[Individualism|individual]] to manage his life course on his own and to find solutions amongst different and contradictory influencing factors and [[Figurational sociology|figurations]]. In this situation, the self-discovered biographical [[Identity (social science)|identity]] with its [[Risk society|endangered transitions, breaks, and status changes]] becomes a conflict between institutional control and individual strategy.

The reconstructive approach in biographical research, which is connected to the phenomenological and [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] approaches, was methodologically developed by the German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal used principles of the method of [[Hermeneutics|objective hermeneutics]] and the reconstructive analysis of [[Ulrich Oevermann]], and the Gestalt and structure considerations proposed by [[Aron Gurwitsch]] and [[Kurt Koffka]] to develop a method for the reconstruction of biographical cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=1993|title=Reconstruction of Life Stories: Principles of selection in generating stories for narrative biographical interviews|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/5929/ssoar-tnsl-1993-1-rosenthal-reconstruction_of_life_stories.pdf?sequence=1|journal=The Narrative Study of Lives|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=59–91|via=SSOAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research.

== Methods and Limitations of the Biographical Research ==

=== Individual Cases and Inductive Generalizations ===
In the context of qualitative researches, the biographical research is to be seen as a case-reconstructive approach. The decision to reconstruct cases is in itself an approach to the field rather than a specific [[Research|research method]]. Biographical  research does not use a single method for [[data analysis]]. The most commonly used methods for [[Data collection|data construction]] in biographical research is the biographical narrative interview (see Fritz Schütze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) and/or [[Open-ended question|open interviews]]. Many use [[content analysis]] to analyze the biographical data. The diversity of biographical sources turns an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive approach]], as used in quantitative social research, unfruitful. The logic of an [[abductive reasoning]] process is preferred by many researchers that use the biographical approach. The principles of a [[grounded theory]] (as in [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Discovery of Grounded Theory|last=Glaser|first=Barney|last2=Strauss|first2=Anselm|publisher=Aldine Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often applied alongside a biographical research.

The questions regarding the possibility to use individual cases to create [[Generalization|scientifically valid generalizations]] arise from the use of the [[abductive reasoning]]. This is que question of the sustainability of abductive conclusions (as in [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]). The abductive conclusion that biographical cases are socially relevant and bear general patterns of [[behavior]], [[Agency (philosophy)|action]], and [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] in them is common in sociological practice, although some think that it is not yet fully developed. Different approaches to the development of typologies exist, as well as for the contrastive comparison between types in order to allow for [[Theory|theoretical generalizations]] (see Uta Gerhardt, 1984; Gabriele Rosenthal, 1993;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Susann Kluge, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kluge|first=Susann|date=2000|title=Empirically Grounded Construction of Types and Typologies in Qualitative Social Research|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1124/2499|journal=Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=|via=FQS}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Experienced Life History and Narrated Life Story (''erlebte und erzählte Lebensgeschichte'') ===
A fundamental problem exists regarding the differences between the levels of the experienced (''erlebte'') [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] and the [[Narrative|narrated]] (''erzählte'') life story.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another fundamental implication is the interrelation of [[experience]], [[memory]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=2006|title=The Narrated Life Story: On the Interrelation Between Experience, Memory and Narration|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4894/2/Chapter_1_-_Gabriele_Rosenthal.pdf|journal=Narrative, Memory &amp; Knowledge: Representations, Aesthetics, Contexts|volume=|pages=1–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early studies of biographical research, great value was placed on the reconstruction of the actual life course of the individual using data from additional sources (such as institutional archives, diaries, interviews with relatives and friends, etc.) and thus eliminating “errors” in the memory and presentation of the interviewee. Today – according to the phenomenological “bracketing” of the being of objects (as by the grounded theory principles) – it is increasingly assumed that the actual life course cannot be reconstructed: experiences are always interpreted by the subject and are mediated by perception, thus constituting the memory in regard to the framework of the overall biography as well as to the situation (for more, see [[Erving Goffman]]n notion of [[frame analysis]]) where the narrative is collected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Thus, the main concern of the biographical research should be the life as experiences and narrated by subjects in clear contrast to the “true facts” of a life course reconstruction. Interpretations and constructions of meaning are of utmost importance to reconstruct a biographical case, as the actions and the self-interpretation of these actions by the individual turns his own biography into a coherent totality. Based on empirical experiences with narrated life history and using the research method of biographical narrative interviews, the method of biographical case reconstruction has developed in the last decades in fields that range from the study of migration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apitzsch|first=Ursula|last2=Siouti|first2=Irini|date=2007|title=Biographical Analysis as an Interdisciplinary Research Perspective in the Field of Migration Studies|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/res/researchintegration/Integrative_Research_Methods/Apitzsch%20Biographical%20Analysis%20April%202007.pdf|journal=University of York, UK|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to professional careers and healthcare.

=== Reconstruction of the Latent Structures of Meaning ===
The question of the construction of meaning leads to the questions of the subjectively intended and the objective meaning. Ulrich Oevermann says that an actor in a situation of interaction produces more meaning than he is aware of. Therefore, some researchers consider the task of the biographical research to be the reconstruction of both types of meaning – the intended and the objective.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oevermann|first=Ulrich|last2=Tilman|first2=Allert|last3=Konau|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Krambeck|first4=Jürgen|date=1987|title=Structures of Meaning and Objective Hermeneutics|url=|journal=In: Volker Meja, Dieter Misgeld, Nico Stehr (Eds.): Modern German Sociology|volume=|pages=436–447|isbn=978-0-231-05854-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind and below the interpretations expressed by the interviewees are the latent structures of meaning that constitute the sense of life and manifest themselves in biographical life situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In these latent, hidden patterns of meaning, individual experience and societal conditioning are intertwined. Thus, behind individual action lies a direction and a framework for action. According to Heinz Bude, the method of [[objective hermeneutics]] and reconstruction of structures of meaning is used in biographical research as a method for the reconstruction of the latent structures of meaning at play in specific situations of a case&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bude|first=Heinz|date=1984|title=Rekonstruktion von Lebenskonstruktionen.

'''Bob Barker Company, Inc.''' is an American company that sells supplies to [[Prison|prisons]]. The company was founded in 1972, with headquarters in [[Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina]], and a distribution and sales center in [[Ogden, Utah]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Company Overview of Bob Barker Company, Inc. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4372192 |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its products include prisoner and officer uniforms, bedding, toiletries, cleaning supplies and security and restraint equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Products : Jail and Correctional Supplies |url=https://www.bobbarker.com/products.html |website=www.bobbarker.com |accessdate=26 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the company's website, founder Bob Barker, a former newspaper editor from [[North Carolina]], initially started the company selling supplies and equipment to restaurants. The company began supplying to jails and prisons in the southeastern United States in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.bobbarker.com/history |website=www.bobbarker.com |accessdate=26 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, the company has been awarded at least $13 million in federal prison system contracts in the United States, representing about 100 federal prisons across the country.&lt;ref name="truthout"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prison Supply Chains Reveal Some Surprises |url=https://truthout.org/articles/is-orange-the-new-green/ |website=Truthout |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FPDS-NG ezSearch |url=https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?s=FPDSNG.COM&amp;q=Bob+Barker+GLOBAL_VENDOR_NAME%3A%22BOB+BARKER+COMPANY++INC.%22%20%20AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Federal%20Prison%20System%22&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;templateName=1.4.4 |website=www.fpds.gov |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company began a $4.15 million distribution center expansion in Fuquay-Varina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gargan |first1=Henry |title=Detention supplier Bob Barker Co. plans $4.15M expansion of Fuquay-Varina facility |url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/southwest-wake-news/article116652023.html |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=News &amp; Observer |date=November 23, 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company founded the philanthropic Bob Barker Company Foundation, with a focus on reducing [[recidivism]].&lt;ref name="truthout"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.bobbarkercompanyfoundation.org/history/ |website=Bob Barker Company Foundation |accessdate=26 July 2018 |date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While prison lore has suggested that the company is affiliated with game show host [[Bob Barker]], there is no relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FACT CHECK: Bob Barker Prison Toiletries |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pa-barker/ |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cajamarca Quechua''' is a variety of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] spoken in the districts of [[Chetilla District|Chetilla]], [[Los Baños del Inca District|Baños del Inca]] and [[Cajamarca District|Cajamarca]] ([[Porcón]]) in the [[Peru]]vian province of [[Cajamarca Province|Cajamarca]], along the northwest coast of Peru.

It was never spoken throughout the region, where other indigenous languages like [[Mochica language|Mochica]] were spoken .

Cajamarca Quechua is severely endangered, as hardly any children are now learning it.

Cajamarca Quechua belongs to [[Quechua II]], subgroup [[Cajamarca–Cañaris Quechua|Cajamarca–Cañaris]] (Quechua II a, Yunkay) and is closest to [[Lambayeque Quechua]], with which it has 94% lexical similarity.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; Félix Quesada published the first grammar and dictionary in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Diccionario_quechua_Cajamarca_Ca%C3%B1aris.html?id=gMAuAAAAYAAJ|title=Diccionario quechua, Cajamarca-Cañaris|last=Castillo|first=Félix Quesada|date=1976|publisher=Ministerio de Educación|language=qu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catallactics''' is a theory of the way the [[free market system]] reaches [[exchange ratio]]s and [[price]]s.  It aims to analyse all actions based on monetary calculation and trace the formation of prices back to the point where an agent makes his or her choices. It explains prices as they are, rather than as they "should" be. The laws of catallactics are not [[value judgment]]s, but aim to be exact, objective and of universal validity. It was used extensively by the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Catallactics is a [[praxeology|praxeological]] theory, the term [[catallaxy]] being used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] to describe "the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market."&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. ''Law, Legislation, and Liberty'', Vol. 2, pp. 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek was dissatisfied with the usage of the word "economy" because its Greek root, which translates as "household management", implies that economic agents in a market economy possess shared goals. He derived the word "Catallaxy" (Hayek's suggested Greek construction would be rendered καταλλαξία) from the Greek verb ''katallasso'' (καταλλάσσω) which meant not only "to exchange" but also "to admit in the community" and "to change from enemy into friend."&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. ''Law, Legislation, and Liberty'', Vol. 2. 1976. pp. 108–09. See also p. 185 n4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mises (''[[Human Action]]'', p. 3) and Hayek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aare.edu.au/99pap/dev99089.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717142407/http://www.aare.edu.au/99pap/dev99089.htm |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Richard Whately]] who coined the term "catallactics". Whately's ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1831) reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/readinglists/print/130-ian_dunois_free_market_foundations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717041003/http://oll.libertyfund.org/readinglists/print/130-ian_dunois_free_market_foundations |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }} A footenote to this paragraph continues: "It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe, that I do not pretend to have classical authority for this use of the word Catallactics; nor do I deem it necessary to make any apology for using it without such authority. It would be thought, I conceive, an absurd pedantry to find fault with such words as "thermometer," "telescope," "pneumatics," "hydraulics," "geology," &amp;c. on the ground that classical Greek writers have not employed them, or have taken them in a different sense. In the present instance, however, I am not sure that, if Aristotle had had occasion to express my meaning, he would not have used the very same word. In fact I may say he has used another part of the same verb in the sense of "exchanging;" (for the Verbals in  are, to all practical purposes, to be regarded as parts of the verbs they are formed from) in the third book of the Nicom. Ethics he speaks of men who hold their lives so cheap, that they risked them in exchange for the most trifling gain. The employment of this and kindred words in the sense of "reconcilement," is evidently secondary, reconciliation being commonly effected by a compensation; something accepted as an equivalent for loss or injury."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|source=|It is with a view to put you on your guard against prejudices thus created, (and you will meet probably with many instances of persons influenced by them,) that I have stated my objections to the name of Political-Economy. It is now, I conceive, too late to think of changing it. A. Smith, indeed, has designated his work a treatise on the "Wealth of Nations;" but this supplies a name only for the subject-matter, not for the science itself. The name I should have preferred as the most descriptive, and on the whole least objectionable, is that of CATALLACTICS, or the "Science of Exchanges."}}

'''Chinois''', also referred to by the [[Réunion Creole]] name '''''Sinwa''''' or '''''Sinoi''''', are [[overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] residing in [[Réunion]], a [[France|French]] [[Département d'outre-mer|overseas department]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YuSion"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2007|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, roughly 25,000 lived on the island, making them one of Africa's largest Chinese communities along with [[Chinese South Africans]], [[Chinese people in Madagascar]], and [[Sino-Mauritian]]s.&lt;ref name="ChineseLanguage" /&gt;

==Migration history==
Despite their [[French nationality law|French citizenship]], the Chinois form a group with origins distinct from the [[Chinese people in France|Chinese in metropolitan France]].&lt;ref name="YuSion" /&gt; The first Chinese to arrive in Réunion came not directly from China, but rather were [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]] drawn from among the population of [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese in Malaya]], who arrived on the island in 1844 to work in grain production and [[levee]]-building. They violently resisted the slave-like manner in which they were treated, and as a result, the colonial government put a stop to the immigration of Chinese indentured labourers just two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1850s, Cantonese-speakers began to arrive from Mauritius.&lt;ref name="YuSion_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for a [[Sino-Mauritian]] to bring his relatives over from China to Mauritius for a period of apprenticeship in his business; after they had gained sufficient familiarity with commercial practises and life in a colonial society, he would send them onwards with letters of introduction, lending them his own capital to start up businesses in neighbouring regions, including Réunion.&lt;ref name="Yap" /&gt; [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]-speakers, from [[Mauritius]] came as well in this manner starting only in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name="YuSion_b"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, re-migration from Mauritius was not the only source of free Chinese migration to Réunion. In 1862, Réunion's government liberalised their immigration laws, allowing any foreigner to take up employment. Each year, a few hundred Cantonese-speaking migrants from [[Guangdong]] took advantage of this law and arrived in Réunion.&lt;ref name="YuSion_a" /&gt; Hakkas from [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] and [[French Indochina]] began to arrive around the same time as those from Mauritius, in the late 1880s. As in other overseas Chinese communities, conflict between Cantonese- and Hakka-speakers was a common feature of social life, and the two groups tried to avoid contact with each other; the Hakka migrants settled in the south of the island, especially at [[Saint-Pierre, Réunion|Saint-Pierre]] and [[Le Tampon]].&lt;ref name="YuSion_b" /&gt; Re-migration from Mauritius to Réunion continued in this manner until around 1940.&lt;ref name="Yap" /&gt; Migrants were almost all male; until the late 1930s or early 1940s, fewer than one thousand had arrived on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, metropolitan French immigration laws were extended to cover Réunion. Along with the closure of China's borders in 1950, this meant that Chinese migration to the island largely came to a halt.&lt;ref name="YuSion_a" /&gt; By that time, the Chinese population of the island was roughly four thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's Chinois consist largely of their descendants.&lt;ref name="YuSion_a" /&gt; However, roughly 2,000 more new expatriates have come from the [[People's Republic of China]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and education==
The first Chinese school in Réunion was set up at [[Saint-Denis, Réunion|Saint-Denis]] in 1927, but closed three years later when the teacher returned to [[China]]. In the following decade, more schools were set up privately, financed by contributions from Chinese businessmen.&lt;ref name="YuSion_d"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1950s, locally born ethnic Chinese children typically attended these Chinese schools, and as a result, they spoke both Chinese and Creole fluently, but not French.&lt;ref name="YuSion_c" /&gt; However, authorities looked dimly on such schools, seeing them as promoting cultural separatism, and so imposed a variety of regulations on their operation, requiring that they spend more time on French-language teaching than Chinese-language teaching. As a result, new bilingual schools were established, the two most famous of which were the ones at Saint-Denis and [[Saint-André, Réunion|Saint-André]].&lt;ref name="YuSion_d" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], education in French schools became mandatory.&lt;ref name="YuSion_d" /&gt; As a result, the generation who entered school after then typically speak little Chinese; however, many of them went to metropolitan France for their higher education, and as a result speak both French and Creole fluently.&lt;ref name="YuSion_f"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to "return to their roots", members of this generation and the younger ones have been attempting to reconnect to Chinese culture through cultural and language courses, return trips to their ancestors' villages in China, and the like.&lt;ref name="YuSion_e"&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶16, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are largely assimilated to French and Creole culture, and feel little connection to today's China, which has undergone huge changes since their ancestors emigrated.&lt;ref name="YuSion_e" /&gt;

==Employment==
The immigrant generation, as well their children who were educated locally in Chinese schools, often found self-employment as shopkeepers; in the 1970s, with rising standards of living on the island, they were able to expand their small shops into spacious markets.&lt;ref name="YuSion_f" /&gt; Their children, who were educated in France, have entered the liberal professions, such as medicine, dentistry, law, and architecture, or found employment in accountancy and engineering firms or the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yu-Sion|2003|loc=¶17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
Chinese cuisine is now consumed by people all over Réunion. One of the most visible culinary legacies of South China are ''bouchons'', known as ''shumai'' in North American dim sum restaurants. Pork ''bouchons'' are commonly eaten in baguettes and paninis with melted cheese and hotsauce. ''Riz cantonais'', a basic fried rice with diced vegetables and roasted pork, is another common dish. Chinese migrants also introduced a number of different plants and animals to the island, including a Chinese variety of the [[guava]] known locally and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]] as ''goyave de Chine''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Réunion is famous for its [[lychee]]s, also from China.

'''Coloureds''' ({{lang-af|Kleurlinge}}) are a [[multiracial]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Southern Africa]] who have ancestry from more than one of the various populations inhabiting the region, including [[Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Afrikaner]], [[English people|English]], [[Austronesian]], [[East Asian]] or [[South Asian]]. Because of the combination of ethnicities, different families and individuals within a family may have a variety of different physical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=coloured|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coloured?q=coloured|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Posel2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.transformation.und.ac.za/issue%2047/47%20posel1.pdf |title= What’s in a name?

In the [[Western Cape]], a distinctive [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] and affiliated [[Cape Malay]] culture developed. In other parts of Southern Africa, people classified as Coloured were usually the descendants of individuals from two distinct ethnicities.

The apartheid-era [[Population Registration Act, 1950]], and subsequent amendments, codified the Coloured identity, and defined its subgroups. [[Indian South Africans]] were initially classified under the act as a subgroup of Coloured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://omalley.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01828/05lv01829/06lv01838.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Coloured community is predominantly descended from numerous [[Miscegenation|interracial sexual unions]], primarily between [[Western Europe]]an men and Khoisan or mixed-race women in the [[Cape Colony]] from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="cell.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

In [[KwaZulu-Natal]], the Coloured possess a diverse heritage including [[British people|British]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germany|German]], [[Mauritian]], [[Demographics of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha#Saint Helena|Saint Helenian]], [[Indian people|Indian]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]].&lt;ref name="Palmer2015"&gt;{{Cite thesis|title=Through a Coloured Lens: Post-Apartheid Indentity amongst Coloureds in KZN|last=Palmer|first= Fileve T.|date=2015|hdl=2022/19854|type=PhD|publisher=Indiana University|location=Bloomington, Ind }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zimbabwean Coloured are descended from [[Shona people|Shona]] or [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], and British and [[Afrikaner]] settlers. [[Griqua people|Griqua]], on the other hand, are descendants of [[Khoisan]] women and Afrikaner [[Trekboers]]. Despite these major differences, as both groups have ancestry from more than one ''naturalised'' racial group, they are classified as ''coloured'' in the South African context. Such mixed-race people did not necessarily self-identify this way; some preferred to call themselves ''black'' or ''Khoisan'' or just ''South African''.

The Griqua were subjected to an ambiguity of other [[creole peoples|creole]] people within Southern African social order. According to Nurse and Jenkins (1975), the leader of this “mixed” group, [[Adam Kok I]], was a former slave of the Dutch governor who was manumitted and provided land outside Cape Town in the eighteenth century (Nurse 1975:71). With territories beyond the [[Dutch East India Company]]’s administration, Kok provided refuge to deserting soldiers, runaway slaves, and remaining members of various [[Khoikhoi]] tribes.&lt;ref name="Palmer2015" /&gt; In South Africa and neighbouring countries, the white minority governments historically segregated Africans from Europeans after settlement had progressed. They classified all such ''mixed race'' people together in one class, despite their numerous ethnic and national differences in ancestry. The imperial and [[apartheid]] governments categorized them as Coloured. In addition, other distinctly homogeneous ethnic groups also traditionally viewed the mixed-race populations as a separate group.

During the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]] in South Africa of the second half of the 20th century, the government used the term "Coloured" to describe one of the four main racial groups it defined by law. This was an effort to impose [[white supremacy]] and maintain racial divisions. Individuals were classified as [[white South African]]s (formally classified as "European"), [[black South Africans]] (formally classified as "Native", "Bantu", or simply "African", and comprising the majority of the population), Coloureds (mixed-race), and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] (formally classified as "Asian").

Coloured people may have ethnic ancestry from Indonesia, mixed-race, and Khoisan ancestry. The Apartheid government treated them as one people, despite their differences. 'Cape Muslims' were also classified as 'coloured.' They generally have Indonesian and black ancestry, as many Indonesian slaves had children with African partners. Many [[Griqua people|Griqua]] began to self-identify as ''Coloureds'' during the apartheid era, because of the benefits of such classification. For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a ''[[dompas]]'' (an identity document designed to limit the movements of the non-white populace), while the Griqua, who were seen as an indigenous African group, did.

In the 21st century, Coloured people constitute a plurality of the population in the provinces of [[Western Cape]] (48.8%), and a large minority in the [[Northern Cape]] (40.3%), both areas of centuries of mixing among the populations. In the [[Eastern Cape]], they make up 8.3% of the population. Most speak [[Afrikaans]], as they were generally descendants of Dutch and Afrikaner men and grew up in their society. About twenty percent of the Coloured speak English as their mother tongue, mostly those of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Virtually all [[Cape Town]] Coloured are bilingual.&lt;ref name="Deumert2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deumert|first1=Ana|title=The unbearable lightness of being bilingual: English–Afrikaans language contact in South Africa|journal=Language Sciences|volume=27|issue=1|year=2005|pages=113–135| issn=03880001 |doi= 10.1016/j.langsci.2004.10.002| url= http://cariad.co.za/download/deumert%20on%20kmcc%20on%20district%20six.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encounter.co.za/article/25.html |title=The Vibrant, Colourful, Coloured People |publisher=Encounter.co.za |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some can comfortably [[Code-switching|codeswitch]] between ''[[Kaapse Afrikaans|Kaapse taal]]'' (a [[creolized]] dialect of Afrikaans spoken mostly in the [[Cape Flats]]) and ''suiwer Afrikaans'' (formal Afrikaans as used in schools and media), and [[South African English]].

=== Genetics ===
At least one genetic study indicates that Cape Coloureds have ancestries from the following ethnic groups; not all Coloureds in South Africa had the same ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genome-wide analysis of the structure of the South African Coloured Population in the Western Cape |journal=Human Genetics |date=August 2010 |pmid=20490549 |doi=10.1007/s00439-010-0836-1 |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=145–53 | last1 = de Wit | first1 = E | last2 = Delport | first2 = W | last3 = Rugamika | first3 = CE | last4 = Meintjes | first4 = A | last5 = Möller | first5 = M | last6 = van Helden | first6 = PD | last7 = Seoighe | first7 = C | last8 = Hoal | first8 = EG}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Indigenous [[Khoisan]]: (32–43%) 
* [[Bantu peoples]], chiefly from [[Southern Africa]]: (20–36%) 
* Peoples from [[Western Europe]], chiefly the [[Low Countries]]: (21–28%) 
* Peoples from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]: (9–11%)

The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] component in the Coloured composite gene pool is itself a blend of [[Malay race|Malay]] and Bantu [[genetic marker]]s.

This genetic admixture appears to be gender-biased. A majority of maternal genetic material is Khoisan. The Coloured population is descended predominantly from unions of European and European-African males with autochthonous Khoisan females.&lt;ref name="cell.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

==Pre-apartheid era==
Coloured people played an important role in the struggle against apartheid and its predecessor policies. The [[African Political Organisation]], established in 1902, had an exclusively Coloured membership; its leader [[Abdullah Abdurahman]] rallied Coloured political efforts for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/bios/abdurahman-a.htm|title=Dr Abdullah Abdurahman 1872 - 1940|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Coloured people later joined the [[African National Congress]] and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]]. Whether in these organisations or others, many Coloured people were active in the fight against apartheid.

The political rights of Coloured people varied by location and over time. In the 19th century they theoretically had similar rights to Whites in the [[Cape Colony]] (though income and property qualifications affected them disproportionately.) In the [[Transvaal Republic]] or the [[Orange Free State]], they had few rights. Coloured members were elected to [[Cape Town]]'s municipal authority (including, for many years, Abdurahman). The establishment of the [[Union of South Africa]] gave Coloured people the franchise, although by 1930 they were restricted to electing White representatives. They conducted frequent voting boycotts in protest. Such boycotts may have contributed to the victory of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1948. They carried out an apartheid programme that stripped Coloured people of their remaining voting powers.

Coloured people were subject to forced relocation. For instance, the government relocated Coloured from the urban Cape Town areas of [[District Six]], which was later bulldozed. Other areas they were forced to leave included [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]], [[Simon's Town]]. Inhabitants were moved to racially designated sections of the metropolitan area on the [[Cape Flats]]. Additionally, under apartheid, Coloured people received educations inferior to that of Whites. It was, however, better than that provided to Black South Africans.

==Apartheid era==
[[File:ApartheidPopulationGroups.jpg|thumb|Explanation of South African identity numbers in an identity document during apartheid in terms of official White, Coloured and Indian population subgroups]]
[[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|J. G. Strijdom]], known as ''the Lion of the North'', worked to restrict Coloured rights. He removed their ability to exercise their franchise. Strijdom's government expanded the number of Senate seats from 48 to 89. All of the additional 41 members hailed from the National Party. It increased its representation in the Senate to 77 in total. The Appellate Division Quorum Bill increased the number of judges necessary for constitutional decisions in the Appeal Court from five to eleven. Strijdom, knowing that he had his two-thirds majority, held a joint sitting of parliament in May 1956. The entrenchment clause regarding the Coloured vote, known as the South African Act, was amended.

Coloureds were placed on a separate voters' roll. They could elect four whites to represent them in the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]]. Two whites would be elected to the [[Cape Provincial Council]], and the [[Governor General of the Union of South Africa|governor general]] could appoint one [[Senate of South Africa|senator]]. Both blacks and whites opposed this measure. The [[Torch Commando]] was very prominent, while the [[Black Sash]] (white women, uniformly dressed, standing on street corners with placards) also made themselves heard.

Many Coloureds refused to register for the new voters' roll. The number of Coloured voters dropped dramatically. In the next election, only 50.2% of them voted. They had no interest in voting for white representatives—an activity which many of them saw as pointless.

Under the [[Population Registration Act]], as amended, Coloureds were formally classified into various subgroups, including [[Cape Coloureds]], [[Cape Malays]] and "other coloured". A portion of the small [[Chinese South African]] community was also classified as a coloured subgroup.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120423220247/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/wc/RaceClassificationBoard/article.aspx?id=591128][https://books.google.com/books?id=JkMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Population%20Registration%20Act%2C%201959%20cape%20coloured&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=Population%20Registration%20Act%2C%201959%20cape%20coloured&amp;f=false]

In 1958, the government established the Department of Coloured Affairs, followed in 1959 by the Union for Coloured Affairs. The latter had 27 members and served as an advisory link between the government and the Coloured people.

The 1964 [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]] turned out to be a constitutional hitch{{clarify|date=January 2012}} which never really got going. In 1969, the Coloureds elected forty onto the council to supplement the twenty nominated by the government, taking the total number to sixty.

Following the [[South African constitutional reform referendum, 1983|1983 referendum]], in which 66.3% of white voters supported the change, the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution]] was reformed to allow the Coloured and [[Asians in South Africa|Asian]] minorities limited participation in separate and subordinate Houses in a [[tricameral]] [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]]. This was part of a change in which the Coloured minority was to be allowed limited rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements were removed by the negotiations which took place from 1990 to provide all South Africans with the vote.

==Post-apartheid era==
During the 1994 all-race elections, some Coloured people voted for the white [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. The National Party recast itself as the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]], partly to attract non-White voters. This political alliance, often perplexing to outsiders, has sometimes been explained in terms of the culture and language shared by White and Coloured New National Party members, who both spoke Afrikaans. In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes that might give preference to non-Coloured Black people, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if [[African National Congress]] gained leadership in the government.

Since the late 20th century, Coloured [[identity politics]] have grown in influence. The Western Cape has been a site of the rise of opposition parties, such as the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA). The Western Cape is considered as an area in which this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] drew in some former New National Party voters and won considerable Coloured support. The New National Party collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance's victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.

[[Patricia de Lille]], former mayor of [[Cape Town]] and founder of the now-defunct [[Independent Democrats]], does not use the label Coloured but many observers would consider her as Coloured by visible appearance. The Independent Democrats party sought the Coloured vote and gained significant ground in the municipal and local elections in 2006, particularly in districts in the Western Cape with high proportions of Coloured residents. The firebrand [[Peter Marais]] (formerly a provincial leader of the New National Party) has sought to portray his [[New Labour Party (South Africa)|New Labour Party]] as the political voice for Coloured people.

Coloured people supported and were members of the African National Congress before, during and after the apartheid era: notable politicians include [[Ebrahim Rasool]] (previously Western Cape premier), [[Beatrice Marshoff]], John Schuurman and [[Allan Hendrickse]]. The Democratic Alliance won control over the Western Cape during the 2009 National and Provincial Elections and has since brokered an alliance with the Independent Democrats.

The Congress has had some success in winning Coloured votes, particularly among labour-affiliated and middle-class Coloured voters. Some Coloureds express distrust of the ANC with the comment, saying that the Coloured were considered "not white enough under apartheid, and not black enough under the ANC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsf.org.za/resource-centre/focus/issues-31-40/issue-37-first-quarter-2005/a-hollowing-out-of-our-democracy|title=A hollowing-out of our democracy?|last=Welsh|first=David|publisher=Helen Suzman Foundation|year=2005|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2004 election, voter apathy was high in historically Coloured areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idasa.org.za/index.asp?page=output_details.asp%3FRID%3D60%26Pub%3DY%26OTID%3D5|title=Election Synopsis - How the West was Won (and Lost) - May 2004|first=Jonathan|last=Faull|publisher=Institute for Democracy in Africa|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=2009-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618021945/http://www.idasa.org.za/index.asp?page=output_details.asp%3FRID%3D60&amp;Pub=Y&amp;OTID=5|archivedate=June 18, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermarriage===
According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', around 4 in 100 South African marriages occur between members of South Africa's major ethnoracial groups, with trepidation toward interracial marriage polling far lower among black South Africans than among white South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0507/p01s03-woaf.html|title = South African couples bridge racial divide|author = Abraham McLaughlin|date = May 7, 2004|publisher = Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many descendants of post-apartheid interracial relationships identify as Coloured or with the Coloured minority group.

==Southern Africa==
[[Image:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 1979, with data from the 1970 South African census.]]
The term [[Coloured People in Namibia|Coloured]] is also used in [[Namibia]], to describe persons of [[mixed race]], specifically part Khoisan, and part European. The ''[[Baster]]s'' of Namibia constitute a separate [[ethnic group]] that are sometimes considered a sub-group of the Coloured population of that country. Under South African rule, the policies and laws of apartheid were extended to what was then called [[South West Africa]]. In Namibia, [[Coloured People in Namibia|Coloureds]] were treated by the government in a way comparable to that of South African Coloureds.

In [[Zimbabwe]] and to a lesser extent [[Zambia]], the term Coloured or ''[[Goffal]]'' was used to refer to people of mixed race. Most are descended from mixed African and British, or African and Indian, progenitors. Some Coloured families descended from Cape Coloured migrants from South Africa who had children with local women. Under [[Rhodesia]]'s predominantly white government, Coloureds had more privileges than black Africans, including full voting rights, but still faced social discrimination. The term Coloured is also used in [[Swaziland]].

==Cuisine==
{{see also|South African cuisine}}
Numerous South African cuisines can be traced back to Coloured people. It is said that [[bobotie]], [[Thyrsites|snoek]] based dishes, [[koeksister]]s, [[Tomato bredie|bredies]], Malay [[roti]] are staple diets of Coloureds and other South Africans as well.&lt;ref&gt;Zainab Lagardien, Traditional Cape Malay Cooking, Random House Struik 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most dishes are passed down for many generations.

In [[India]], where [[Cattle slaughter in India#History|cows are venerated]] by a large segment of the population, '''cow vigilante violence''' involving mob attacks in the name of "[[Cow protection movement|cow protection]]" targeting mostly Muslims, has swelled since 2014.&lt;ref name=kazmin_ft_7_17_17&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmin|first=Amy|title=Indian PM distances himself from cow vigilante attacks|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f28160ca-6acb-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa|work=Financial Times|location=London|date=17 July 2017|quote=India's prime minister Narendra Modi has distanced himself from a spate of mob attacks in the name of “cow protection” that have mostly targeted Muslims.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biswas_bbc_7_10_17&gt;{{cite news|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|title=Why stopping India's vigilante killings will not be easy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40505719|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2017|quote=Last month Prime Minister Narendra Modi said murder in the name of cow protection is "not acceptable." ...

Cow-protection groups see themselves as preventing theft, protecting the cow or upholding the law in an Indian state which [[Cattle slaughter in India|bans cow slaughter]]. According to a Reuters report, a total of 63 cow vigilante attacks had occurred in India between 2010 and mid 2017, mostly since the Modi government came to power in 2014. In these attacks between 2010 and June 2017, "28 Indians – 24 of them Muslims – were killed and 124 injured", states the Reuter's report.&lt;ref name=reuters20102017&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests-muslims-beef-idINKBN19J2BV|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|work=Reuters|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a rise in the number of incidents of cow vigilantism since the election of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) to the Indian central government in 2014. The frequency and severity of cow vigilante violence has been described as "unprecedented".&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] has reported that there has been a surge in cow vigilante violence since 2015.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt; The surge is attributed to the recent rise in [[Hindu nationalism]] in India.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt;&lt;ref name=JobLoss/&gt; Many vigilante groups say they feel "empowered" by the victory of the Hindu nationalist BJP in the 2014 election.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|author=Soutik Biswas|publisher=BBC News|title=Why the humble cow is India's most polarising animal|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34513185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk/&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India]] in September 2017 ruled that each state should appoint a police officer in each district as a nodal officer to take strict action against cow vigilantism. The court also expressed its concerns that animals were being illegally slaughtered such as the case of 200 slaughtered cattle found floating in a Bihar river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/india/take-urgent-steps-to-stop-cow-vigilantism-supreme-court-tells-centre-and-states/articleshow/60387970.cms|title=Take urgent steps to stop cow vigilantism, Supreme Court tells Centre and states - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==

The BJP has run the Indian federal government since its election in 2014. Following Narendra Modi's rise to power, extremist Hindu groups have led attacks across the country that have targeted Muslim and [[Dalit]] communities. These attacks have been carried out with the stated intention of protecting cows.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holy Cow: As Hindu Nationalism Surges In India, Cows Are Protected But Minorities Not So Much|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/the-conversation/holy-cow-as-hindu-nationalism-surges-in-india-cows-are-protect_a_22059916/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amrit Dhillon|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Cow vigilantes take to the streets as India's Hindu leaders accused of 'right-wing' muscle flexing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/cow-vigilantes-take-to-the-streets-as-indias-hindu-leaders-accused-of-rightwing-muscle-flexing-20160910-grdbje.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=India: ‘Cow Protection’ Spurs Vigilante Violence|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/27/india-cow-protection-spurs-vigilante-violence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalit groups are particularly vulnerable to such attacks, as they are frequently responsible for disposing cattle carcasses and skins.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite news|last=Chatterji|first=Saubhadra|date=30 May 2017|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-name-of-cow-lynching-thrashing-condemnation-in-three-years-of-bjp-rule/story-vMRGhgagVaJG6l9bh884kM.html|title=In the name of cow: Lynching, thrashing, condemnation in three years of BJP rule|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators of these attacks, described as "vigilantism" by [[Human Rights Watch]], have stated that they are protecting the rights of Hindus, and that the police do not adequately deal with cow slaughter.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Scholar Radha Sarkar has argued that "cow vigilantism itself is not new in India, and violence over the protection of cows has occurred in the past. However, the frequency, impunity, and flagrance of the current instances of cow-related violence are unprecedented."&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt; In 2015 [[Business Insider]] reported that vigilante attacks on trucks carrying cattle had increased in [[Maharastra]].&lt;ref name=Pink&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Pink|url=http://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/buffalo-meat-exports-thriving-under-narendra-modi-government/story/217143.html|date=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported that according to the meat industry representatives, cow vigilantes have been stopping vehicles, extorting money and stealing valuable livestock.&lt;ref name=Risk&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Marlow and Bibhudatta Pradhan|title=Cow-Saving Vigilantes Are a Sign of Rising Political Risk in India|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-19/shuttered-abattoir-a-sign-of-rising-political-risk-in-india}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cow vigilante activity also increased during the run up to [[Bihar Legislative Assembly election, 2015]].&lt;ref name=Jha/&gt; BJP leader [[Sushil Kumar Modi]] said the election was "a fight between those who eat beef and those who are against cow slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NDA will ban cow slaughter in Bihar if it wins: Sushil Kumar Modi|url=http://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar2015/nda-will-ban-cow-slaughter-in-bihar-if-it-wins-sushil-kumar-modi/article7727021.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cow vigilantes chop away at secular India as Modi calls for peace|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/cow-vigilantes-chop-away-at-secular-india-as-modi-calls-for-peace/news-story/52d2920758fd77aec35acec8f6b4d61b|publisher=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' argued in 2016 that cow vigilantism can sometimes be a profitable business. It pointed to an ''[[Indian Express]]'' investigation that found that vigilantes in Punjab charge cattle transporters 200 rupees ($3) per cow in exchange for not harassing their trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Indians; Protecting India's cows|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21705374-udderworldly-debate-cowboys-and-indians|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysing the reasons for the vigilantism, scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]] stated that since its formation, the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] has intended to transform society from within, by instilling its own sense of discipline into it, which it thought was required for defending Hindus more effectively. He also said that the Hindu nationalists, who claim to represent society at large, do not want the state to prevail over society, and want the society to regulate itself, as per the emphasis on social order and “harmony” or hierarchy, that is suggested in the [[Hindutva]] ideology. According to him, this Hindu nationalist approach gives the act of policing a greater legitimacy and it is clearly synonymous with the populist behaviour, since for the populist leader, the people and their will prevail over the rule of law and public institutions.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/over-to-the-vigilante-gau-rakshak-cultural-policing-beef-ban-4653305/|title=Over to the vigilante|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe|date=2017-05-13|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-07-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffrelot further remarks:&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that the vigilantes “do the job” is very convenient for the rulers . The state is not guilty of violence since this violence is allegedly spontaneous and if the followers of Hinduism are taking the law into their hands, it is for a good reason — for defending their religion. The moral and political economies of this arrangement are even more sophisticated: The state cannot harass the minorities openly, but by letting vigilantes do so, it keeps majoritarian feelings satisfied. The private armies, which may be useful for polarising society before elections are also kept happy — not only can they flex their muscles, but they usually extort money (violence mostly occurs when they cannot do so, as is evident from the recent cases of lynching)."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=="Cow protection" vigilante groups==
As of 2016, cow protection vigilante groups were estimated to have sprung up in "hundreds, perhaps thousands" of towns and villages in northern India.&lt;ref name=Jha&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cow vigilantes who are threatening Modi’s grip on power|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/cowboys-and-indians|last=Jha|first=Prem Shankar|journal=Chatham House|date=October 2016|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=India's Prime Minister Modi Stands By as Cow Vigilantes Terrorize India|url=http://www.newsweek.com/modi-stands-cow-vigilantes-terrorize-india-506943|journal=Newsweek|last=Jha|first=Prem Shankar|date=10 September 2016|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were an estimated 200 such groups in [[National Capital Region (India)|Delhi-National Capital Region]] alone.&lt;ref name =Delhi/&gt; Some of the larger groups claim up to 5,000 members.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

One kind of cow protection groups are gangs who patrol highways and roads at night, looking for trucks that might be "smuggling" cows across the state borders.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; These gangs can be armed; they justify this by claiming that "cow smugglers" themselves are often armed. The Haryana branch of [[Bhartiya Gau Raksha Dal]] described to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that it had exchanged gunfire with alleged smugglers, killed several of them and lost several of its members too. The gangs have been described as "unorganized", and gang leaders admit that their members can be hard to control.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=On patrol with the Hindu vigilantes who would kill to protect India's cows|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/on-patrol-hindu-vigilantes-smuggling-protect-india-cows-kill|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gangs consist of volunteers, many of whom are poor [[laborer]]s.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The volunteers often tend to be young. According to a gang leader, "it’s easy to motivate a youth". Often the youth are given "emotional" motivation by being shown graphic videos of [[cruelty to animals|animals being tortured]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; One member said that cow vigilantism had given him a "purpose in life".&lt;ref name =Delhi&gt;{{cite news|title=The cow keepers: Some cattle vigilante groups operating in Delhi and neighbouring states|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/the-cow-keepers-the-cattle-vigilante-groups-operating-in-delhi-and-neighbouring-states/|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vigilantes often have a network of informers consisting of cobblers, rickshaw drivers, vegetable vendors etc., who alert them to supposed incidents of cow slaughter. The group members and their network often use [[social media]] to circulate information.&lt;ref name =Delhi/&gt; Their relationship with the police is disputed: some vigilantes claim to work with the police,&lt;ref name =Delhi/&gt; while others claim that the police are corrupt and incompetent, and that they are forced to take matters into their own hands.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

==Laws, state support, and legal issues==
[[File:Status of cow slaughter in India.png|thumb|300px|Cow slaughter laws in various states of India.

{{Violence against Muslims in India}}
The BJP government has placed a number of restrictions on the slaughter of cattle. In May 2017 it banned the slaughter of cattle for purpose of exporting beef. This restriction threatened an Indian beef export industry worth $4 billion annually.&lt;ref name=JobLoss&gt;{{cite news|title=Cattle trade ban to halt beef exports, lead to job losses|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/india-modi-politics-meat-idUSKBN18P129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Indian states have tightened restrictions on the slaughter of cows. For example, in March 2015, [[Maharashtra]] [[Cattle slaughter in India#Maharashtra|passed stricter legislation]] banning the sale, possession, and consumption of beef.&lt;ref name=PRI&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sacred Slaughter: An Analysis of Historical, Communal, and Constitutional Aspects of Beef Bans in India|journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology|volume=17|issue=4|author=Radha Sarkar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cow vigilantes have also been emboldened by these laws, and attack Muslims suspected of smuggling cattle for slaughter.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India bans sale of cows for slaughter, a move designed to appease conservative Hindus|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-cow-slaughter-20170526-story.html|publisher=[[LA Times]]|quote=The rules build on legislation passed in several states, most led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, to ban the slaughter of cattle. The laws have stoked violence by Hindu vigilante groups that have attacked Muslims and others on suspicion of smuggling cattle or possessing beef.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Indian states have been accused of having laws that enable cow protection groups. In April 2017 the Supreme Court asked the governments of six states: Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh; to respond to a plea asking for a ban against cow-protection related vigilantism, due to the violence perpetrated by these groups.&lt;ref name=banned&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Should cow vigilantes be banned,’ SC asks 6 states after Rajasthan killing|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/070417/after-rajasthan-killing-sc-seeks-reply-from-6-states-on-banning-cow-vigilantes.html|publisher=[[Deccan Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many vigilantes believe their actions are approved by the government and Hindus of the country. For example, the vigilante group "Gau Rakshak Dal", formed in Haryana in 2012, believe it is acting on government mandate. Scholar Radha Sarkar has stated that the bans on beef "tacitly legitimize vigilante activity." Cow protection groups formed in Haryana in 2012 see themselves to now be "acting upon the mandate of the government." Such groups across the country have "[taken] it upon themselves to punish those they believe to be harming the cow." Such incidents of violence have occurred even in situations in which no illegal actions have occurred, such as in the handling of dead cattle. According to Sarkar, cow protection groups have taken actions that they know to be illegal, because they believe that they have the support of the government.&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt;

In November 2016, the BJP-led Haryana government has decided to provide ID cards for cow vigilantes. However they were not issued despite collecting the details of vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/id-cards-for-cow-vigilantes-funding-hindutva-high-on-haryana-govt-agenda/story-h3reAuh7S798Tqi1p4UldI.html|title=ID cards for cow vigilantes, funding: Hindutva high on Haryana govt agenda|last=|first=|date=8 November 2016|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=28 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/cow-vigilantes-rue-delay-in-id-cards-promised-by-haryana-govt/story-D2f1HkVsnYfnJDoWH5xoLM.html|title=Cow vigilantes rue delay in ID cards promised by Haryana govt|last=|first=|date=20 January 2017|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=28 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Russia Today]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], many cow protection vigilante groups are allied with the BJP.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/386769-cow-vigilantes-kill-two-india/|title=‘Cow vigilantes’ kill two men over suspected animal theft in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt; According to [[BBC News]], many cow-protection vigilantes attend training camps organized by [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]], which is BJP's parent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A night patrol with India's cow protection vigilantes|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34634892}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mukul Kesavan]], in ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', accused BJP officials of justifying vigilantism. He pointed out that after some vigilante attacks, the BJP officials tried to get the police to charge the victims (or their family) for provoking the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mukul Kesavan|title=The cow as cause - Vigilantism and the BJP|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170409/jsp/opinion/story_145303.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court, made observations that such incidents of vigilantism was mob violence and a crime. In addition, it placed the responsibility  to prevent such crimes, on the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lynchings-by-cow-vigilantes-supreme-court-states-5243938/|title=Cow vigilantism unacceptable, onus on states to prevent lynchings: Supreme Court|date=2018-07-03|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-have-to-check-mob-violence-supreme-court-on-pleas-against-cow-vigilantism/story-ksserAmgolzw9KeIxZo3AO.html|title=States have to check mob violence: Supreme Court on pleas against cow vigilantism|date=2018-07-03|work=hindustantimes.com|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents of violence==
A number of incidents of violence have occurred since 2014. According to a June 2017 [[Reuters]] report, citing a data journalism website, a total of "28 Indians – 24 of them Muslims – have been killed and 124 injured since 2010 in cow-related violence".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests-muslims-beef-idINKBN19J2BV|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|work=Reuters|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency and severity of cow-related violence have been described as "unprecedented".&lt;ref name=PRI/&gt; The report stated that "Almost all of the 63 attacks since 2010 involving cow-related violence were recorded after Modi and his Hindu nationalist government came to power in 2014".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After an attack on four [[Dalits]] in Gujarat in July 2016, thousands of members of the Dalit community took to the streets to protest what they saw was "government inaction".&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The protests spread across the state.

Post 2014, the Documentation of the Oppressed ([[DOTO Database]]), an independent, non-profit documentation center, have created an online platform that compiles the instances of violence, with particular emphasis on marginalized groups and issues. The database aims to provide a repository of the instances of hate violence and giving a wholesome narrative of the same; providing reports that add and supplement media provided information, done for the purpose of aiding in intervention i.e., by advocacy or litigation. DOTO aims to tackle the issue with a right and community-based approach to increase all round vigilance on the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/database-for-religion-based-hate-crimes-launched-in-delhi-118030700923_1.html|title=Database for religion-based hate crimes launched in Delhi|last=IANS|date=2018-03-07|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International organization, [[Human Rights Watch]] in April 2017 reported that Indian authorities should promptly investigate and take action against the self-appointed "cow protectors", many linked to extremist Hindu groups, who have carried out attacks against Muslims and Dalits over rumors of selling, buying or killing of cows for beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/27/india-cow-protection-spurs-vigilante-violence|title=India: ‘Cow Protection’ Spurs Vigilante Violence|date=2017-04-27|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the BJP have denied supporting cow slaughter vigilantism. In May 2017, Union Minister and BJP leader [[Smriti Irani]] has said that the BJP does not support cow protection vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjp-does-not-support-cow-vigilantes-other-such-groups-smriti-irani-4667128/|title=BJP does not support cow vigilantes, other such groups: Smriti Irani}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that BJP is partly to blame, as they stoked inflammatory rhetoric over cow slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/opinion/vigilante-justice-in-india.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Vigilante Justice in India|last=Board|first=The Editorial|date=2017-05-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siddharth Nath Singh]] has denied allegations that the BJP administration condones vigilantism and said illegal attacks would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/shuttered-abattoir-a-sign-of-rising-political-risk-in-india|title=Cow Vigilantes Are Putting India's Meat Exports at Risk|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Modi has said that cow vigilantism made him angry, and condemned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/modi-condemns-rise-mob-violence-beef-eaters-india|title=Modi condemns rise in mob violence against beef-eaters in India|date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several observers such as [[Prem Shankar Jha]] and [[Zafarul Islam Khan]] remarked that Modi has selectively condemned vigilante attacks on Dalits but not on Muslims, since while condemning this vigilantism, Modi did not mention 'Muslims' who have been the major victims of the vigilante violence, despite mentioning 'Dalits'.&lt;ref name="Jha" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/2016/08/cowing-down/|title=Cowing down {{!}} Asad Ashraf {{!}} Tehelka|date=16 August 2016|website=tehelka.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crystal Darkness''''' is a 30-minute [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and Telly Award-winning documentary on the dangers and prevalence of the drug [[methamphetamine]].  The film features testimonies of young people who have gone through meth addiction, as well as interviews with high-profile politicians and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystaldarkness.com/documentry.asp About Crystal Darkness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919142311/http://www.crystaldarkness.com/Documentry.asp |date=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary is the centerpiece of a city-by-city, state-by-state campaign and has garnered the attention of residents in regions across the United States when it aired. In Arizona alone, the program reached an estimated 2.5 million residents and took over 1,200 phone calls from persons seeking help with meth addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114202 East Valley Tribune: ''Campaign working, can do more''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720183744/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114202 |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The ''Crystal Darkness'' documentary was created and produced in [[Reno, Nevada]] in 2006 by Michael Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=nl.newsbank.com|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LVRB&amp;p_theme=lvrb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=119752FA92669A10&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|title=Campaign aims to help people addicted and affected by methamphetamine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was directed and edited by Logan Needham. The entire program is produced by Global Studio.

A small portion of the film is pre-packaged with information on how meth affects the brain, how it's made, whom it affects and testimonials from law enforcement and individuals who have struggled through its addiction. The rest of the program is filmed in the host city or state with local experts, clinicians and providers, law enforcement, elected officials and recovering addicts.

It is unique in that each city it airs, it is run as a [[Ad serving#Advanced functions|media roadblock]], wherein all the network stations in a target region air it simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=sacbee.com|url=http://www.sacbee.com/127/v-print/story/792842.html|publisher= Sacbee|title=Media Savvy: United against meth''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also airs in Spanish on Spanish-language stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointogether.org/news/headlines/inthenews/2008/crystal-darkness-simulcast.html |website=Join Together|title=Crystal Darkness Simulcast Generates Calls for Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary features original music by [[alldaydrive]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystaldarkness.com/documentry.asp crystaldarkness.com: ''About the film.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919142311/http://www.crystaldarkness.com/Documentry.asp |date=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Today Is The Day NV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystaldarkness.com/documentry.asp crystaldarkness.com: ''About the film.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919142311/http://www.crystaldarkness.com/Documentry.asp |date=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups are based in Reno, Nevada.

==Childhelp sponsorship==
The program is sponsored by [[Childhelp]], a national child abuse prevention and treatment non-profit organization. Childhelp is responsible for maintaining the program’s hot line, 1-888-METH-AID, in addition to its child abuse hot line, 1-800-4-A-CHILD. The non-profit organization reports over two-thirds of the cases of child abuse it handles have a direct correlation to meth use or production by the child’s parents or guardian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childhelp.org/news-and-events/crystal-darkness---arizona#7KFw_OQT0FfMY5UjgkA2Rw Childhelp.org: ''Crystal Darkness - Arizona'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==

The campaign has reached a large audience wherever it is deployed because of how it is managed. Prior to agreeing to be a host city or state, representatives interested in bringing the program to their community are invited to attend a dinner event the night the program airs in another location. There, they learn from individuals who have run a past campaign what is involved, how the program operates and how they achieved success. Each host city is responsible for pitching the local media to run the program in a media roadblock, where all stations in the region agree to air the program at a certain time and date. The program is a collaboration of effort among religious organizations, law enforcement, elected officials, volunteers, treatment providers, educators, and more. Each is delegated responsibilities ranging from [[community outreach]] to compiling a comprehensive provider resource book. Listed below are the regions the campaign has aired in to-date and cities that have campaigns in motion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23859">'''Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit''' featured in press discussions of disputes over access to data from  [[instrumental temperature record]]s, particularly during the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] which began in November 2009.

The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|UK Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, and FOI requests were made to the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA) for the raw data from [[weather station]]s used in developing [[instrumental temperature record]] [[dataset]]s, for copies of agreements under which the raw data was obtained from [[List of meteorology institutions|meteorology institutions]], and also for email correspondence relating to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]].

In many cases the raw data which CRU had obtained from [[:Template:National Meteorological Organisations|National Meteorological Organisations]] was subject to restrictions on redistribution: on 12 August 2009 CRU announced that they were seeking permission to waive these restrictions, and on 24 November 2009 the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, with the remainder to be released when permissions were obtained. In a decision announced on 27 July 2011 the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) required release of raw data even though permissions had not been obtained or in one instance had been refused, and on 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request.

A 2008 FOI request by David Holland for emails discussing work on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report was refused by the university. In November 2009 he alleged that CRU emails posted online discussed deleting the emails he had requested: in January 2010 the Deputy Information Commissioner told a journalist that this indicated an offence under section 77 of the FOIA, but prosecution was time-barred by [[statute of limitations]]. Newspapers misrepresented this as a decision in relation to raw data, and the issue was discussed by the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] inquiry, which found there had been a lack of openness. The ICO decision published on 7 July 2010 stated that this potential offence had not been investigated as it was time-barred. As Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint against the university, no further action was needed, but the ICO would "consider whether further action is appropriate to secure future compliance."

In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities. This described exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers free from external scrutiny, as well as commending actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest.

==FOIA requests for raw climate data==
From 1978 onwards, the [[Climatic Research Unit]] developed its gridded [[HadCRUT|CRUTEM]] [[data set]] of land air temperature anomalies back to 1850, based on [[instrumental temperature record]]s held by [[:Template:National Meteorological Organisations|National Meteorological Organisations]] around the world, often under formal or informal confidentiality agreements that restricted use of this raw data to academic purposes. Beginning in 1991, [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] of CRU discussed data with Warwick Hughes (later of the [[New Zealand Climate Science Coalition]]). From 2002 onwards, Jones received requests from [[Stephen McIntyre]] for instrumental raw data (McIntyre became prominent in the "[[Hockey stick controversy]]" over the methodology of paleoclimate graphs shown in the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] of 2001). Jones says that at first he tried to meet McIntyre's requests, but he soon became inundated with requests that he could not fulfill due to time or confidentiality constraints, and began refusing requests.&lt;ref name="metdata"/&gt;

The new [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|UK Freedom of Information Act]] came into effect in 2005, and in February of that year Jones discussed with fellow climate researchers the potential implications of the Act for McIntyre's requests. In 2007 he told colleagues that, having seen what McIntyre's  [[Climate Audit]] blog was doing, UEA had been turning down FOIA requests associated with the blog. The scientists concerned saw such requests as disrupting the time available for their work, and those making them as nitpicking to suit an agenda rather than trying to advance scientific knowledge. Late in 2008, the university's FOI managers took advice from the  [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) on exceptions allowing refusal of requests.&lt;ref name="metdata" /&gt;

McIntyre complained that data denied to him had been sent to Peter Webster at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], who was working on a joint publication with Jones, and between 24 and 29 July 2009 the university received 58 FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from McIntyre and his readers at the Climate Audit blog.&lt;ref name="metdata"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heffernan | first1 = O. | title = Climate data spat intensifies | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7257 | pages = 787–787 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1038/460787a | pmid=19675615}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Heffernan | first = Olive | title = Climate Feedback: McIntyre versus Jones: climate data row escalates | url = http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2009/08/mcintyre_versus_jones_climate_1.html | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature.com]] | date = 12 August 2009 | accessdate =2 August 2011 }}&lt;br&gt;*{{citation

On  24 July [[Jonathan A. Jones]] of the University of Oxford made a FOIA request for the data that Jones had sent to Webster, the UEA refused this request on 14 August. Don Keiller of [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Cambridge]] then made a similar FOIA request, UEA refused this on 11 September 2009.&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Black | first = Richard | title = Climate unit releases virtually all remaining data | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14315747 |publisher=BBC News  | date = 27 July 2011 | accessdate =2 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FER0280033"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726092413/http://www.climateaudit.info/pdf/foi/cru/ICO_2011_jones_crutem.pdf letter to Jonathan Jones], and {{cite web |url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2011/fer_0282488.ashx |title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 50) Environmental Information Regulations 2004 Decision Notice |accessdate=15 August 2011 |date=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703034849/http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2011/fer_0282488.ashx |archivedate=3 July 2011 |format=PDF |work=FER0282488 |publisher=ICO }} FOI request made 24 July 2009, refused by UEA 14 August 2009.&lt;br&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2011/fer_0280033.ashx |title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 50) Environmental Information Regulations 2004 Decision Notice |accessdate=15 August 2011 |date=23 June 2011 |format=PDF |work=FER0280033 |publisher=ICO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829131139/http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2011/fer_0280033.ashx |archivedate=29 August 2011 |df= }} FOI request made 14 August 2009, refused by UEA 11 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2009, [[Nature (journal)|Nature News]] published a statement by Phil Jones that he was working to release the raw data in a systematic way, and was writing to all the National Meteorological Organisations requesting their agreement to waive confidentiality.&lt;ref name="metdata" /&gt; In mid October CRU issued a statement on data availability, describing how National Metereological Services (NMSs) and scientists had given or sold them data with written or verbal agreements that it must only used for academic purposes, and not passed onto third parties. There were difficulties in separating out raw data, some of which was subject to charges made by NMSs, and "These data are not ours to provide without the full permission of the relevant NMSs, organizations and scientists." They hoped to obtain consents and to publish all the data jointly with the Met Office.&lt;ref name="CRU Data Availability"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/availability/ | title = CRU Data Availability | accessdate = 2012-01-24 | publisher = [[Climatic Research Unit]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091016072500/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/availability/ | archivedate = 2009-10-16 | quote = Data storage availability in the 1980s meant that we were not able to keep the multiple sources for some sites, only the station series after adjustment for homogeneity issues. We, therefore, do not hold the original raw data but only the value-added (i.e. quality controlled and homogenized) data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2009, four days after the start of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, and the remainder would be released when permissions were given.&lt;ref name="update 2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = CRU update 2  | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRUupdate | publisher=University of East Anglia (UEA)  | date = 24 November 2009 | accessdate =2 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The university worked closely with the [[Met Office]], which sent requests to National Meteorological Organisations for agreement to waive confidentiality on raw instrumental data,&lt;ref name="cru3 11"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Climate data released – University of East Anglia (UEA) | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2011/July/crutem3 |date=27 July 2011| accessdate =4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as CRU had announced on 12 August 2009.&lt;ref name="metdata" /&gt; Some gave full or conditional agreement, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="FER0280033" /&gt;

In discussions with the ICO about the FOIA requests which Jonathan Jones and Don Keiller had made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations. The ICO required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request within 35 calendar days.&lt;ref name="FER0280033" /&gt; On 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The data are available for download from Met Office website and from CRU. The university remained concerned "that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations."&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cru3 11" /&gt;

==FOIA requests for emails discussing IPCC Fourth Assessment Report==
In May 2008 David Holland, an electrical engineer from [[Northampton]], made a FOI request for all emails to and from [[Keith Briffa]] about the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4); formal review exchanges had already been published. The [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA) information policy and compliance manager (IPCM) refused the request.

Holland appealed to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) about the UEA's refusals of FOI requests he had made for emails to and from Briffa about the IPCC AR4 report. On 23 November 2009, after the start of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], he wrote to the Commissioner explaining in detail the relevance of the alleged CRU emails to his case.&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-25"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICO decisions are enforced under Section 50 by notices defining steps to be taken by the public authority within defined time limits, and failure to comply can be taken to court. In addition, Section 77 makes it an offence to intentionally destroy or conceal information which has been requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Freedom of Information Act 2000, Part IV Enforcement, Section 50 | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/part/IV | publisher=ICO | date =30 November 2000  | accessdate =4 August 2011 }}, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/52 52: Enforcement notices],&lt;br&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/77 Part VIII Miscellaneous and supplemental, Section 77.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Information Commissioner Graham Smith replied on 22 January 2010 that "The FOI Act makes it an offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information. Mr Holland's FOI requests were submitted in 2007/8, but it has only recently come to light that they were not dealt with in accordance with the Act. The legislation requires action within six months of the offence taking place, so by the time the action came to light the opportunity to consider a prosecution was long gone." The ICO was looking into other investigations time-barred by [[statute of limitations]] restrictions to see if a case could be made to change the relevant law.&lt;ref name=hocFOIA /&gt; The journalist's report as published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 28 January portrayed this as an ICO decision that the university "broke the law by refusing to hand over its raw data for public scrutiny" but the ICO "could not prosecute those involved because the complaint was made too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Webster | first = Ben | last2 = Leake | first2 = Jonathan | title = Scientists in stolen e-mail scandal hid climate data – Times Online | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7004936.ece |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 28 January 2010 | accessdate =4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university promptly wrote to the ICO objecting to the damaging statement having been made to a journalist without first consulting the university. It described the misrepresentation by the press and requested retraction or clarification of the alleged breaches. The ICO declined to retract, but clarified that its investigation under Section 50 had not been completed and no decision notice had been issued. It said that "The fact that the elements of a section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter. The ICO is not resiling from its position on this", and that "Errors like this are frequently made in press reports and the ICO cannot be expected to correct them, particularly when the ICO has not itself referred to penalties or sanctions in its own statement."&lt;ref name=hocFOIA&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/38706.htm#a16 | title = The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia | publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom | work=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee |pages=28–31 | date = 31 March 2010 |quote =We regret that the ICO made a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate and that it took over a month for the ICO properly to put the record straight.

In its submission to the Science and Technology Select Committee, the university denied allegations that it had refused to release raw data in breach of the FOI Act,&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-25" /&gt; and said that the Deputy Information Commissioner's comments had been incorrectly reported as referring to such data.&lt;ref name="Kendall2010-02-26"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its inquiry report, the Science and Technology Select Committee criticised the ICO, which it said had made "a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate", and recommended that it should develop procedures to check its public comments, and "swiftly correct any mis-statements or misinterpretations of such statements". While there was ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a breach of Section 77 of the FOI Act, it would "be premature, without a thorough investigation affording each party the opportunity to make representations, to conclude that UEA was in breach of the Act." It called for a full investigation by the Muir Russell inquiry or by the Information Commissioner to resolve this issue, and accepted that the six month statute of limitations restriction was insufficient and should be reviewed. On the general issue of information requests, the committee said that information not covered by the exclusions provided by the FOIA should have been disclosed, and "in future information, including data and methodology, should be published proactively on the internet wherever possible." It blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests, and said it had “found ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics”.&lt;ref name=hocFOIA /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster2010-03-31"&gt;

The ICO decision on Holland's requests published on 7 July 2010 concluded that the [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004|Environmental Information Regulations]] (EIR) applied rather than the equivalent FOIA, and the university had failed to provide responses within the correct time, but as Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint, no further action was needed. Regarding the question of whether there had been a breach of section 77 of the FOIA or its equivalent in the EIR, the ICO stated "Although the emails referred to above indicated prime facie evidence of an offence, the Commissioner was unable to investigate because six months had passed since the potential offence was committed, a constraint placed on the legislation by the Magistrates Court Act 1980." On the more general issue of emails suggesting that attempts to circumvent the legislation had been considered, and a lack of openness, the ICO would "now consider whether further action is appropriate to secure future compliance."&lt;ref name="FOI2010-07-07guardian" /&gt; In an opinion piece, [[Edward Acton (academic)|Edward Acton]], Vice-Chancellor of the UEA, commended legislation in the US where "the FOI distinguishes between recorded factual material necessary to validate research findings, which must be disclosed, and ‘preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews [and] communications with colleagues’, which are exempted."&lt;ref name="Acton 810"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Acton | first = Edward | title = Where next for Freedom of Information? | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/CRUstatements/statements/FOIopinion | publisher=University of East Anglia (UEA)  | date = 31 August 2010 | accessdate =4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New freedom of information guidance to universities==
In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities, taking into account issues raised in relation to the CRU information requests. This describes exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers, leaving formulation of opinions on research free from external scrutiny. It notes the benefits of actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest&lt;ref name="guidance Sept 11"&gt;{{Cite web   | title = ICO issues FoI guidance for universities : Guardian Government Computing : Guardian Professional | url = https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/sep/26/higher-education-freedom-information-guidance?INTCMP=SRCH | publisher =''[[The Guardian]]''  | date =26 September 2011  | accessdate = 23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Govada Dyvasirvadam''' (born 28 March 1951) was the Bishop of [[Krishna-Godavari Diocese of the Church of South India]]''(incorporating [[Anglicans]], [[Methodists]], and [[Presbyterians]])''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/diocese.cfm?Idind=496 Anglican Communion, Provincial Directory: Krishna-Godavari]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Andrew's Cathedral in [[Machilipatnam]] is the seat of the Bishop-in-Krishna Godavari.

Earlier, in 1998, Dyvasirvadam was elected as the General Secretary of the CSI, the youngest ever in the church's history.&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Victor in Vinod Victor, Leslie Nathaniel (Eds.), ''Ecumenism: Prospects and Challenges – A Festschrift to the Rev. G. Dyvasirvadam'', Indian Society for Promotion of Christian Knowledge (ISPCK), New Delhi, 2001, pp.xxix – xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyvasirvadam was also a member of the Central Committee of the [[World Council of Churches]] headquartered in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;The eighty assembly of the world council of churches held from 3–14 December 1998 in Harare, Zimbabwe elected a total of 37 members to its central committee [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/assembly/ccmem.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a member of the General Committee of the [[Christian Conference of Asia]] headquartered in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;The eleventh assembly of the CCA held in Indonesia from 2–6 June 2000 elected Dyvasirvadam as a member of its general committee.[http://www.cca.org.hk/resources/archive/assembly/11ga/gamin.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Dyvasirvadam was born on 28 March 1951 in [[Challapalli]] in [[Krishna District]].  He was the tenth child of his parents, Rev. Govada Devamani and Smt. Suguna Sundaram.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Vinod Victor, Leslie Nathaniel (Eds.), ''[[op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling was in [[Krishna]] and [[West Godavari]] districts.  He had been an ''[[alumnus]]'' of Sreemanthu Raja Higher Secondary School, [[Challapalli]] in [[Krishna District]] and the Municipal School in [[Eluru]] in [[West Godavari District]].

He later did his college studies in A.V.N. College (''established in 1860''), one of the oldest institutes in Visakhapatnam.

Dyvasirvadam also pursued post-graduate studies in [[Noble College, Machilipatnam]] and was inspired by the then Bishop in Krishna-Godavari, [[N. D. Ananda Rao Samuel]].

==Ordination and pastorship==
After studying at the Bishop's College in Calcutta, the Diocese of Krishna Godavari first posted him to [[Kanumolu]] near [[Hanuman Junction]] in [[Krishna District]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In March 1978, he was ordained by Bishop Henry Lazarus as a Deacon in the St. Andrew's Church in [[Machilipatnam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ibid.]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was posted to Christ Church in [[Eluru]] in [[West Godavari District]].  The then Moderator's Commissary, The Right Reverend [[H. D. L. Abraham]] ''([[Bishop in Medak]])'' ordained him as a priest.

==Higher studies and professorship==
With interest to pursue higher studies in theology, the Diocese granted him study leave.  Dyvasirvadam proceeded to the [[United Theological College (Bangalore)|United Theological College]], Bangalore, ''[the only autonomous college under the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)|Senate of Serampore College]]]'' and enrolled himself for the post-graduate degree of [[Master of Theology]] ([[M. Th.]]) in the discipline of [[Systematic Theology]] studying between the years 1982-1984&lt;ref name="Hiwale"&gt;K. M. Hiwale (Compiled), ''Directory of the United Theological College 1910–1997'', Bangalore, 1997. Past students, postgraduate course, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked out a dissertation entitled ''Eschatological motifs in process theologies''&lt;ref&gt;G. Dyvasirvadam, ''Eschatological motifs in process theologies'' in ''Thesis Titles'', [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], Bangalore, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; under the Principalship of [[Joshua Russell Chandran]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ibid.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After successful completion of post-graduate studies in theology, his diocese assigned him a teaching task at the ecumenical [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] in which his diocese is a participating member.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ibid.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyvasirvadam taught [[Systematic theology]] to students pursuing [[Bachelor of Theology]] ([[B.Th.]]) and [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD) degrees.

==Research==
Later, on invitation from the [[UTC]], Bangalore, he went on study leave to serve as the Acting Registrar there.  Subsequently, he enrolled for pursuing the doctoral degree ([[Doctor of Theology]] – [[D. Th.]]) in the [[South Asia Theological Research Institute]] (SATHRI) in Bangalore.  He chose the discipline of Liberation Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Victor, Leslie Nathaniel ''(et al.)'', ''[[op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synod of the CSI==
In 1992, Dyvasirvadam was recalled to the [[Church of South India]] Society by then Moderator, [[Bird Ryder Devapriam]] and was assigned the responsibility of overseeing pastoral concerns and became Director of the Pastoral Aid Department of the [[Church of South India Synod]], [[Chennai]].

The biennial Synod of the CSI elected Rev. Dyvasirvadam as its general secretary in 1998 in Arogyavaram in [[Chittoor District]], succeeding George Koshy.&lt;ref name="George" /&gt; He was re-elected unanimously in the Synod of 2000 in [[Secunderabad]] and in the Synod of 2002 in Melukavumattam.
Bishop G.Dyvasirvadam has been elected as the Deputy Moderator of CSI in the Synod of 2012 at [[Kanyakumari]].

He has been elected as the Moderator of CSI in the Synod of 2014 at [[Vijayawada]].

==Bishopric==
The CSI Diocese of Krishna-Godavari is one of the largest extending from [[Ongole]] District in the south through [[Srikakulam District]] in the norther circars of [[Andhra Pradesh]].  Its Cathedral was first erected in Eluru and was subsequently shifted to Vijayawada.  Earlier Bishop's who served in this diocese were notable and exemplary.  Following the retirement of The [[Right Reverend]] [[T. B. D. Prakasa Rao]],&lt;ref name="George"&gt;K. M. George, ''Church of South India: life in union, 1947–1997'', Jointly published by Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and Christava Sahitya Samithi, Tiruvalla, 1999.  [https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=]&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. Dyvasirvadam contested and was elected unopposed.  Subsequently, the Cathedral was shifted to [[Machilipatnam]].  St. Andrew's Church was consecrated as a Cathedral.

The Moderator of the CSI during that time was The Most Reverend K. J. Samuel who principally consecrated him in the St. Andrew's Cathedral in [[Machilipatnam]].

==Honours==
In the year 2001, friends of the Bishop proceeded to write a 365-page [[festschrift]] in his honour on the occasion of the completion of fifty years.  Rev. Vinod Victor, Leslie Nathaniel and Rev. Dr. [[P. Surya Prakash]] edited the festschrift.

'''Hands Across America''' was a benefit event and publicity campaign staged on Sunday, May 25, 1986 in which approximately 6.5 million people [[holding hands|held hands]] in a [[human chain]] for fifteen minutes along a path across the contiguous United States. Many participants donated ten dollars to reserve their place in line; the proceeds were donated to local charities to fight hunger and homelessness and help those in poverty.

In order to allow the maximum number of people to participate, the path linked major cities and meandered back and forth within the cities. Just as there were sections where the "line" was six to ten people deep, there were also undoubtedly many breaks in the chain. However, enough people participated that if an average of all the participants had been taken and spread evenly along the route standing four feet (1.2&amp;nbsp;m) apart, an unbroken chain across the 48 contiguous states would have been able to be formed.

Hands Across America raised $34 million. According to ''The New York Times'', only about $15 million was distributed after deducting operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Adeel Hassan |date=May 25, 2016 |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/indexes/2016/05/25/nytnow/nytnow-email/index.html |title=Your Wednesday Briefing |website=The New York Times |access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was conceived and organized by [[Ken Kragen]]. Event implementation was through USA for Africa under the direction of Marty Rogol, the founding Executive Director. A [[theme song]], titled "Hands Across America," was played simultaneously on hundreds of radio stations at 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|Eastern time]] (noon [[Pacific Standard Time Zone|Pacific time]]). The song was written by Marc Blatte, John Carney, and [[Larry Gottlieb]] (the Spanish version was written by the composer [[Marcia Bell]]), and featured lead vocals by session singers [[Joe Cerisano]] and Sandy Farina, and the band [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. The song peaked at #65 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1986.

Hands Across America was a project of [[USA for Africa]]. USA for Africa produced "[[We Are the World]]" and the combined revenues raised by both events raised almost $100 million to fight famine in Africa and hunger and [[homelessness in the United States]].

The date and time chosen for the event inadvertently conflicted with another charity fundraiser, [[Sport Aid]], which was organized by USA for Africa on the same day.  Since Hands Across America was much better publicized in the United States, only 4000 runners participated in New York City for Sport Aid.

== Protests ==
Sen. [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] and Rep. [[Edward Markey]] led an official protest over every [[New England]] state being excluded from Hands Across America in spite of the fact New England was the most densely populated part of America. Political leaders in the South additionally weighed in against the route that was chosen to span the contiguous United States. Various protests broke out in the Upper Midwest, notably [[Minneapolis]] and [[Milwaukee]], as well as northwestern cities such as [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Seattle]]. In [[Hawaii]], actor [[Tom Selleck]] and Sen. [[Daniel Inouye]] led a counter Hands Across Hawaii program that was held to remind mainlanders that "Hawaiians are Americans, Too!"

== In popular culture ==

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?]]" Marge, Lisa, Bart, the Flanders family, and other characters are holding hands through the Simpsons' living room, while Homer schlumpily sits on the couch watching the event on TV. An unknown television announcer is heard reporting that "except for huge gaps in the Western states, Hands Across America was a complete success!"
* A Sunday strip of the newspaper comic "[[Doonesbury]]" had some of its characters in a chain. Said characters are singing the song of the same name, with the exception of [[Zonker Harris]] who sings "[[Just a Gigolo (song)|I'm Just a Gigolo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doonesbury Comic Strip, May 11, 1986 on GoComics.com|url=http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1986/05/11|publisher=GoComics.com|accessdate=3 February 2012|author=G.

* A 1992 episode of ''[[America's Funniest People]]'' had a parody called "Bananas Across America", in which a banana was handed from individual to individual in a chain showing various American landmarks, looking as if a banana had traveled in a chain from California to Washington D.C.

* In "[[Hiatus (30 Rock)|Hiatus]]", an episode of American sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'', [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) remembers having participated in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/smtessner/tgswithtracyjordan.com/hiatus_transcript.html Episode transcript from tgswithtracyjordan.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[It's Never Too Late for Now]]", another episode of ''30 Rock'', [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) answers a request for ID in order to verify her age with the response, "How about this for ID: I participated in Hands Across America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/02/18/30-rock-recap-its-never-too-late-for-now/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] is the trade of humans that can occur internationally or within a nation, often with a goal of [[sexual slavery]], [[forced labor]], [[commercial sexual exploitation]] or the removal of organs. Newest forms of human trafficking include ova and surrogacy trade. Persons that are victims of human trafficking are usually recruited or taken by the means of the threat or use of force, or by fraud, kidnapping, deception, abuse of power or a vulnerable position with the aim of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. Some of the biggest reasons for human trafficking are poverty, the global level of gender inequality and the [[feminization of poverty]] as well as different kinds of conflicts, cataclysms, religious and ethnic persecutions, violence and discrimination (of especially women).

[[Finland]] is a transit, destination, and a limited source country for women and girls subjected to [[sex trafficking]], and for men and women subjected to conditions of [[forced labor]]. Finnish legislation condemns trafficking as a [[crime]] and has met the standards of the EU Protocol even before the convention came into effect. [[NGO]]s and the government cooperate in providing help for the victims of trafficking in Finland. Although the Finnish Police investigated and referred more people to care in 2013, prosecution and conviction numbers of suspected offenders remain low relative to the number of potential victims. The government is currently working on improving the anti-trafficking laws and practices to improve the situation. U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
{{Slavery}}
Identifying a person as a victim of trafficking is one of the most difficult tasks when measuring human trafficking. According to Eurostat's 'Trafficking in human beings': "In accordance with Directive 2011/36/EU, the term "identified victim" refers to persons who have been formally identified by the relevant authorities as a victim of trafficking in human beings. The term "presumed victim" on the other hand is used for trafficking victims who have met the criteria of the EU Directive but have not been formally identified by the relevant formal authorities as a trafficking victim or who have declined to be formally or legally identified as a trafficking victim."&lt;ref name=Eurostat&gt;{{cite book|title=Trafficking in Human Beings|date=2014|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|location=Luxenbourg|isbn=978 - 92 - 79 - 40308 -8|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-is-new/news/news/docs/20141017_working_paper_on_statistics_on_trafficking_in_human_beings_en.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 30,146 identified and presumed victims were registered in the 28 [[EU Member States]] in 2010-2012, out of which over a thousand were children trafficked for sexual exploitation. 80 percent of registered victims were female, and 65 percent of registered victims were [[EU citizens]]. Of the registered victims who are confirmed  as  EU  citizens, the  top  5 countries of citizenship are [[Human trafficking in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Human trafficking in Romania|Romania]], [[Human trafficking in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Human trafficking in Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Human trafficking in Poland|Poland]]. Over the three years, the top 5 non-EU countries of citizenship of registered victims were [[Human trafficking in Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Human trafficking in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Human trafficking in China|China]], [[Human trafficking in Vietnam|Viet Nam]] and [[Human trafficking in Russia|Russia]]. There has been an increase in the number of ¨unknown¨ citizenships from 2010 to 2011. In addition, 71 percent of labor exploitation victims were male in the EU Member States during these three years.&lt;ref name=Eurostat/&gt;

Finland is both a transit and a destination country for human trafficking, but human trafficking is less prevalent in Finland than it is in most other EU countries.&lt;ref name=PoliisinToiminta&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muttilainen|first1=Vesa|last2=Huotari|first2=Vesa|title=Poliisin Toimintaympäristö (The Operational Environment of the Police)|date=2014|publisher=Juvenes Print|location=Tampere|isbn=978-951-815-274-6|url=http://www.polamk.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/files/7F5D1EBE712AABF6C2257D3A0029EA8A/$file/Raportteja_112_web.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent Finland is also considered a source country for human trafficking. No incidents of [[organ trade]] have been detected in Finland, and trafficking tends to mostly appear in forms of [[prostitution]] and procuring ([[pimping]]), as well as labor exploitation.&lt;ref name=ihmiskauppa&gt;{{cite web|title=Ihmiskauppa (Human trafficking)|url=http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/krp/home.nsf/pages/a95ae1046ba5196fc22571ed004a679a|website=www.poliisi.fi|publisher=Poliisi|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labor exploitation is especially prevalent in [[berry picking]], restaurant, cleaning, metal, transportation, construction and gardening industries as well as in personal households.&lt;ref name=PalvelujenKehitystarve&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yli-Krekola|first1=Marjaana|title=Ihmiskaupan Uhrien Palvelujen Kehittämistarpeet Suomessa (The Need for Developing the Assistance to the Victims of Human Trafficking in Finland)|url=http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/85366/Yli-Krekola_Marjaana.pdf?sequence=1|website=www.theseus.fi|publisher=Diakonia-ammattikorkeakoulu|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to statistics provided by Eurostat, in 2010-2012 there was a total of 231 registered victims of human trafficking in Finland.&lt;ref name=Eurostat/&gt; The Finnish Police estimate that about 200-250 women cross the Finnish border from the East weekly to work as [[prostitutes]] in Finland. Annually about 10,000-15,000 prostitutes spend some amount of time working in Finland. These women are mostly from Russia, Estonia and to some extent from Lithuania and Latvia. A chance of these women being forced to work as prostitutes cannot be excluded.&lt;ref name=NykyajanOrjuus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franz-Koivisto|first1=Larissa|last2=Hukari|first2=Anna|last3=Jääskeläinen|first3=Kati|last4=Kantanen|first4=Marja|last5=Laihia|first5=Marja-Liisa|last6=Nguyen|first6=Riina|last7=Suomalainen|first7=Nina|title=Ihmiskauppa – nykyajan orjuutta (Human trafficking - the Contemporary Form of Slavery)|date=2007|publisher=Tyylipaino Oy|location=Helsinki|isbn=952-9529-40-6|page=21|url=http://www.ekumenia.fi/data/liitteet/ihmiskauppa_2007.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the corresponding number of registered victims of human trafficking in [[Human trafficking in Sweden|Sweden]] was 311, 179 in [[Human trafficking in Denmark|Denmark]], 125 in [[Human trafficking in Norway|Norway]], 135 in [[Human trafficking in Estonia|Estonia]] and 4,474 in [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Eurostat/&gt;

Finland is also known to be a transit country for trafficking in children. The children that pass through Finland come mostly from East Asia and they are headed elsewhere in Europe. In Finland, children of immigrants still in the process of seeking asylum are considered to be at risk for being trafficked: a number of children have disappeared from the centers where immigrants stay during the asylum process, so [[trafficking of children]] with the aim of exploiting them sexually might also take place in Finland.&lt;ref name=NykyajanOrjuus/&gt;

Fewer than a hundred people seek help from the aid shelters annually in Finland.&lt;ref name=PoliisinToiminta/&gt;

==Reporting and conviction rates==

[[File:Police patch Finland 2.JPG|thumb|The sword insignia of Finnish police]]
A total of 8 551 prosecutions were reported by [[EU Member States]] over the years 2010-2012 for human trafficking. Of those cases, in 3,786 the prosecuted was convicted for human trafficking. More than 70 percent of suspected traffickers were male in the EU Member States.&lt;ref name=torjunta1014&gt;{{cite web|title=Ihmiskaupan torjunta vuosina 2010–2014 (The Prevention of Human Trafficking in years 2010-2014)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1164_fi.htm|website=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffickers are often adult males who operate in the country where they are from, but more women and foreigners are involved in human trafficking than in most other crimes. Although most of those prosecuted and/or convicted for trafficking in persons are men, trafficking has a quite high rate of females involved in it. Very few other crimes record a level of female participation in committing the crime such as that of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=UNreport&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2012|date=2012|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-130309-4|url=https://www.un.org/ru/publications/pdfs/global%20report%20on%20trafficking%20in%20persons%202012.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Venla Roth, Senior Adviser in Office of the Ombudsman for Minorities and the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings, has stated that the conviction rates are so low because in many cases in which the trafficker controlled the victim, the trafficker can say they were not aware of the fact that the victim was dependent on them. Taking advantage of a person's dependence is one of the details defining trafficking in the Finnish Penal Code.&lt;ref name=PalvelujenKehitystarve/&gt;

Since 2006, sentences have ranged from 1.5 to 5.5 years imprisonment: there were no reports of suspended sentences. The government did not prosecute any persons for suspected child sex tourism offenses in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

There were 23 trafficking investigations in Finland in 2012, while the number of people prosecuted for trafficking in 2012 was eight. Eight trafficking offenders were prosecuted in 2012.&lt;ref name=USreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafficking In Persons Report 2014|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226846.pdf|website=https://www.state.gov/|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, there were 12 sex trafficking investigations and 15 labor trafficking investigations in Finland, and 19 persons were prosecuted for trafficking. Two labor trafficking offenders were convicted in 2013 with sentences of 30 months’ imprisonment, which was a smaller number of convictions than the year before.&lt;ref name=USreport/&gt; In four additional cases, five other people were persecuted for trafficking but not found guilty. However, they were convicted on lesser charges. Additionally, the prior convictions of three human trafficking offenders were upheld by two [[appellate courts]]. No offenders were convicted for sex trafficking in 2013.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Finland". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USreport/&gt; The government also encourages victims of human trafficking to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. In 2013, 12 victims assisted law enforcement in pre-trial investigations, 10 of whom participated in the prosecutions of alleged traffickers.&lt;ref name=USreport/&gt;

[[Illegal immigration]] is also criminalized in Finland. It is an offence often associated with human trafficking because the persons being trafficked are considered clients of the [[smugglers]] or traffickers. The number of persons using fake or illegal travelling documents in [[border controls]] was over 200 in the year 2000. Only a few of these cases have resulted in prosecution.&lt;ref name=TIFinland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehti|first1=Matti|last2=Aromaa|first2=Kauko|title=Trafficking in Human Beings, Illegal Immigration and Finland|date=2002|publisher=Helsinki University Press|location=Helsinki|isbn=952-5333-11-6|url=http://heuni.fi/material/attachments/heuni/reports/6KjPMW3Ad/Report_38.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Finland has ratified [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SlaveryConvention.aspx the Conventions] of 1926 which deals with slavery, and the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|Convention of 1949]] which deals with trafficking in human beings and counteracting the exploitation of other people’s prostitution, with their subsequent amendments. The national legislation on human trafficking and prostitution is mostly based on these conventions and their requirements.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt; The whole 25th chapter of Finnish Penal Code deals with crimes on freedoms of persons. However, the only part in Finnish Penal Code that directly addresses human trafficking is § 25:3 and § 25:3a (9.7.2004/650). According to these two sections, both human trafficking and aggravated human trafficking, as well as the attempt of either, are punishable crimes in Finland.&lt;ref name=ihmiskauppa/&gt;&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finlex&gt;{{cite web|title=Rikoslaki (The Penal Code)|url=http://finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001?search%5Btype%5D=pika&amp;search%5Bpika%5D=ihmiskauppa#L25|website=www.finlex.fi|publisher=Oikeusministeriö|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws on human trafficking came to effect in the Penal Code 1. August 2004. Prior to this, cases of human trafficking were punishable bylaws that dealt with procuring and discrimination at work. If convicted for human trafficking, the offender is prescribed a minimum of four months and a maximum of six years in prison. The penalty scale for aggravated trafficking in human beings is 2 to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name=ihmiskauppa/&gt; Penalties commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; Although the government does not have a specialized anti-trafficking law enforcement unit, it integrated formal anti-trafficking awareness into police and border guard training curricula for new recruits and in-service personnel. The government has also provided anti-trafficking training to its prosecutors for the past four years.&lt;ref name="dos"/&gt; The government also distributed leaflets to thousands of visitors at a major annual travel fair warning that child sex tourism is a crime. Finland’s laws provide extraterritorial jurisdiction over child sex tourism offenses perpetrated overseas by Finnish nationals.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

===Definitions of human trafficking in the Penal Code===
The definition of human trafficking is strict in the Penal Code.&lt;ref name=PalvelujenKehitystarve/&gt; 
To fulfill the criteria for human trafficking it is crucial that the victim has been deceived or that the victim's dependent or insecure position has been taken advantage of when subjecting the person to work as, for example, a prostitute. Trafficking in persons is a crime against the individual.&lt;ref name=ihmiskauppa/&gt;

The sections below are translated from the Finnish Penal Code.&lt;ref name=Finlex/&gt;

====Human trafficking 3 § (9.7.2004/650)====
A person who
* takes advantage of the victim's dependent or insecure position or the victim is pressured
* deceives the victim or takes advantage of the victim's deception
* is paid compensation to a person who is keeping a victim under his/her control
* receives a compensation for oppressing a victim, recruiting a victim or for handing over, transporting, receiving or housing a victim with the aim of sexually exploiting him/her in a way described in the first clause of 9 § in the 20th chapter of Finnish Penal Code. Alternatively, a person who aims to take sexual advantage of the victim in a way that is comparable to the first clause of 9 § in the 20th chapter of Finnish Penal Code, or if he/she receives compensation for oppressing or recruiting a victim or for handing over, transporting, receiving or housing a victim with an aim of labor exploitation, or subjecting the victim to circumstances that violate human dignity or removal of organs or tissue, should be convicted.
**Chapter 20, 9 § (24.7.1998/563), first clause: a person who has organized a room or another space to be used for sexual intercourse or an act comparable to that, or if the space is to be used for a sexual act or an act comparable and that clearly violates sexual modesty and is committed by a child under the age of 18 should be convicted for human trafficking and sentenced to a minimum of four months and a maximum of six years of prison time.

(19.12.2014/1177)

A person who oppresses a person younger than 18 years old or recruits, hands over, transports, receives or houses the underage person with an aim mentioned in the first clause should be convicted even if none of the means mentioned in the first clause were used.

An attempt is also punishable.

====Aggrivated human trafficking 3 a § (9.7.2004/650)====
The human trafficking is considered aggravated if
* it uses violence, threatening or treachery in addition or instead of the means mentioned in 3 §
* it intentionally or with gross negligence causes the victim severe bodily harm, a serious illness or another life-threatening condition or considerable suffering comparable to those
* the offense is committed against a child who is under 18 years old or against a person whose ability to defend him/herself is substantially impaired, or
* if the offense is committed as a part of operations by an organized criminal group as mentioned in the fourth clause of 1a§ in the 17th chapter of the Penal Code
**Chapter 17, 1 a § (21.2.2003/142), fourth clause: a person who acquires, attempts to acquire or hand over business premises or any other spaces, means of transport, or crucial equipment the organized crime group might require

and if the crime is grave as a whole, the offender should be convicted for aggravated human trafficking and sentenced to 2–10 years in prison.

A person who enslaves a victim, transports slaves or sells them, and if the offense if the offense is aggravated when assessed as a whole.

An attempt is also punishable.

==Protection==

===Government===
The Finnish government continued to provide direct shelter, trafficking-specific rehabilitative assistance, and medical care to adult and child victims in addition to its provision of funding for NGO-run shelters. Police and border guard officials used a series of written guidelines on victim referral and treatment developed by the Finnish Immigration Service to proactively identify victims of trafficking; however, one official raised concerns that the threshold for referral to services was too high.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; During the reporting period, officials referred 13 victims to service providers, raising concerns about the low number of potential victims identified and the effectiveness of victim identification procedures. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Under the Act on Compensation for Crime Damage, victims of crime could receive government compensation for personal injury, damage to property, or other financial loss caused by a crime. Finnish authorities provided identified trafficking victims with a six-month reflection period, a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they consider whether to assist law enforcement.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; There were no indications, however, that the reflection period was used extensively. Victims of trafficking wishing to stay longer than six months were eligible to apply for an extended residence permit or asylum as an alternative to deportation. The government granted permanent residence permits to seven victims during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; The government made some effort to ensure victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The government provided anti-trafficking awareness training for labor inspectors, diplomatic personnel, public health workers, immigration adjudication staff and Finnair flight attendants.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

===Pro-support Centre===
The Pro-support Centre was established in 1990. It is a support service centre for prostitutes, subordinated to the private Diacone Institution in Helsinki. The main purpose of this cente is to provide [[health care]] and [[social services]]. In 2002, this centre was the only organisation in Finland that offered support services for prostitutes, whether Finnish or foreign. Most of the centre's activities were concentrated in the areas in close proximity to the capital.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;

The centre does not collect or file systematic information about the clients who come and seek help, and its employees work under a secrecy obligation. However, the employees of the support centre have the most long-standing and thorough knowledge of the prostitution situation and its developments in the Helsinki region, and this experience is also available for outside research purposes.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;

Pro-support Centre holds the role of the third sector in very high regard when it comes to anti-human trafficking. The centre carried out a project together with [[Finland's Slot Machine Association]] (RAY) in 2007-2009.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara&gt;{{cite web|last1=Virta|first1=Mari|title=VARASTETTUJA UNELMIA – KAUPPATAVARANA IHMINEN|url=http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/22297/Virta_Mari.pdf?sequence=1|website=www,theseus.fi|publisher=Turun Ammattikorkeakoulu|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the project was to produce new information on human trafficking and other similar phenomena in Finland, as well as to evaluate the existing support network for the victims of human trafficking and their families. Simultaneously many professionals who work closely with human trafficking and related phenomena, were trained to better recognize and support the victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt;

==Prevention==
Many different kinds of organizations work together in efforts to prevent human trafficking in Finland.
Some of these organizations are subordinated to the government and its ministries, some to the military and some are third sector organizations.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt;

The most important bodies working for anti-human trafficking in Finland include the Office of Immigration, Police, [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|National Bureau of Investigation]], The Finnish Border Guard, Ministry of Employment and the Economy along with multiple non-governmental organizations such as All Our Children Association, Amnesty International Finland Association, the Refugee Advice Centre and the Pro-support Centre.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt;

===Government===
National action plan against trafficking in human beings was submitted to the Government on 24 March 2005, and the Government's response was obtained on 27 September during the same year. The plan covers multiple aspects of the phenomena, including those of providing help to the victims as well as improving the process of convicting suspected human traffickers.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt; The plan also emphasizes raising the level of information available on trafficking as well as the awareness of human trafficking in Finland. Bettering the ability of professionals to recognize the victims of trafficking is also important. The Action Plan explicitly states that the concentrations of the plan are on human rights and on victim-centered approaches, and that the mutual cooperation of all authorities involved in human trafficking is crucial.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt;

The Ministry of Defense provided Finnish troops who were going to leave for international peacekeeping missions with intensive anti-trafficking training aimed at providing the forces with the ability to identify potential trafficking victims; there were no trafficking-related cases involving Finnish troops or government personnel deployed overseas in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government’s efforts to monitor and scrutinize its anti-trafficking actions reflected a high level of political will to address human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; Recently numerous Finnish political parties such as Vasemmistoliitto (Left Alliance), Vihreä Liitto (The Greens), Suomen Ruotsalainen Kansanpuolue and Suomen Kristillisdemokraatit (Christian Democrats) addressed the issue of human trafficking as well as gender equality in their manifestos for the parliamental election in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eduskuntavaalit 2015|url=https://www.thl.fi/fi/web/sukupuolten-tasa-arvo/paatoksenteko/vaalit/eduskuntavaalit-2015|website=www.thl.fi|publisher=Terveyden ja Hyvinvoinnin Laitos|accessdate=21 March 2015|ref=thlVaalit}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government cooperates with different NGOs and organizations in providing help for the victims of trafficking in Finland.&lt;ref name=ihmiskauppa/&gt; In addition to domestic prevention of human trafficking, Finland does anti-human trafficking work on EU and international levels.&lt;ref name=sisihm&gt;{{cite web|title=Ihmiskauppa|url=http://www.intermin.fi/fi/turvallisuus/ihmiskauppa|website=Sisäministeriö|publisher=Sisäministeriö|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Finnish government supported an anti-trafficking partnership with the Government of Nigeria by providing approximately $1.1 million toward Nigeria’s anti-trafficking agency:&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;  Human trafficking was criminalized in Nigeria fairly recently, in 2003. A national operator NAPTIP (National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons) was then established to enforce the new anti-trafficking laws. In addition to criminal investigations, NAPTIP is also responsible for prosecution, the protection and rehabilitation of victims as well as for educating and informing the victims and the people.&lt;ref name="Ulkoasiainministeriö"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suomelta tukea ihmiskaupan vastaiseen työhön Afrikassa|url=http://213.214.149.108/public/Print.aspx?contentid=171694&amp;nodeid=41566&amp;culture=fi-FI&amp;contentlan=1|website=Ulkoasiainministeriö|publisher=Ulkoasiainministeriö|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has also organized and hosted multiple seminars and conferences that addressed human trafficking and its prevention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a meeting concerning human trafficking in 2004 together with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which is the principal institution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The following year Finland hosted NATO's anti-human trafficking seminar.&lt;ref name=kauppatavara/&gt;

===The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health===
The Ministry for Social Affairs and Health started a project in 1998 with goal of prevention of prostitution.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt; This was a part of a five-year programme for "The prevention of violence against women and prostitution". The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) is the main organization executing the project.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt; STAKES is subordinated to the ministry for Social Affairs and Health. The project is based on the 1997 Equality between the Genders Programme of the Finnish Government and therefore also on the action plan of the Beijing IV Women’s Equality World Conference. STAKES has also done other research on prostitution, and this project is also utilized to continue that research.&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;

According to research conducted by Lehti and Aromaa, "The purpose of the project is to monitor prostitution at the national and international level, and to compile and produce information about the phenomena of commercial sex. Also, it provides expert support to authorities and also to other agencies, and disseminates information about prostitution and its prevention. The objective is to produce and support general research on prostitution, also to produce action proposals for the prevention of prostitution and the reduction of disadvantages and unacceptable circumstances related to this. Simultaneously, the project attempts to further co-operation between the authorities and civic organisations regarding this phenomenon."&lt;ref name=TIFinland/&gt;

'''Jacob K. Olupona''' is Professor of African Religious Traditions and Chair of the Committee on African studies at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] with a joint appointment as Professor of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at [[Harvard University]].

== Biography ==
Jacob K. Olupona is a scholar of indigenous African religions who came to Harvard after serving as a professor at the [[University of California, Davis]].

He is working on a study of the religious practices of the estimated one million [[Africans]] who have emigrated to the [[United States]] over the last 40 years, examining in particular several populations that remain relatively invisible in the American religious landscape: "reverse missionaries" who have come to the U.S. to establish churches, African [[Pentecostals]] in American congregations, American branches of independent [[Africa]]n churches, and indigenous African religious communities in the U.S. His earlier research includes African [[spirituality]] and ritual practices, [[spirit possession]], [[Pentecostalism]], [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] festivals, animal symbolism, icons, [[phenomenology (religion)|phenomenology]], and [[religious pluralism]] in [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]].

In his forthcoming book Ile-Ife: The City of 201 Gods, he examines the modern urban mixing of ritual, [[Royal family|royalty]], [[gender]], class, and power, and how the structure, content, and meaning of religious beliefs and practices permeate daily life.

He has authored or edited seven other books, including Kingship, Religion, and Rituals in a Nigerian Community: A Phenomenological Study of Ondo Yoruba Festivals, which has been used for ethnographic research among Yoruba-speaking communities.

Olupona has received grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the Davis Humanities Institute, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the [[Getty Foundation]]. He has served on the editorial boards of three journals and as president of the African Association for the Study of Religion. In 2000, Olupona received an honorary doctorate in divinity from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].

Jacob K. Olupona received his BA from the [[University of Nigeria]] and his MA and Ph.D. from [[Boston University]].

This is a '''list of lucky symbols, signs and charms'''. [[Luck]] is symbolized by a wide array of objects, numbers, symbols, plant and animal life which vary significantly in different cultures globally. The significance of each symbol is rooted in either [[folklore]], [[mythology]], [[esotericism]], [[religion]], [[tradition]], necessity or a combination thereof.

'''Maastrichtian''' ({{lang-li|Mestreechs}} {{IPA-all|məˈstʀeːxs|}}) or '''Maastrichtian Limburgish''' ({{lang-li|Mestreechs-Limburgs}} {{IPA-all|məˈstʀeːxsˈlimbœʀxs|}}) is the [[dialect]] and variant of [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] spoken in the [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Maastricht]] alongside [[Dutch language|the Dutch language]] (with which it is not mutually intelligible). In terms of speakers, it is the most widespread variant of Limburgish, and it is a [[tonal language|tonal]] one. Like many of the Limburgish dialects spoken in neighbouring [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Rob Belemans &amp; Benny Keulen, ''Taal in stad en land: Belgisch-Limburgs'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Maastrichtian retained much [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] (or more accurately, [[French language|French]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]]) influences in its [[vocabulary]].&lt;ref name="Veldeke"/&gt;

The French influence can additionally be attributed to the historical importance of French with the cultural elite and educational systems as well as the historical [[immigration]] of [[Walloons in the Netherlands|Walloon labourers]] to the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Despite being a specific variant of Limburgish, Maastrichtian remains [[mutually intelligible]] with other Limburgish variants, especially those of surrounding municipalities.

Whilst Maastrichtian is still widely spoken, regardless of social level, research has shown that it is suffering from a degree of dialect loss amongst younger generations. That is the case in dwindling of speakers but also in development of the dialect ([[dialect levelling]]) towards Standard Dutch (like the loss of local words and grammar).&lt;ref name="ga155"/&gt;

==Geographic distribution, social status and sociolects==
[[Image:Maastricht Mestreech - Achter de Oude Minderbroeders Achter d'n Awwe Minnebreure.jpg|280px|right|thumb|Bilingual street sign in Maastricht: ''Achter de Oude Minderbroeders'' is [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Achter d'n Awwe Minnebreure'' is Maastrichtian.]]
Maatrichtian being a city dialect, the terminology "Maastrichtian" (''Mestreechs'') is practically limited to the municipal borders, with the exception of some places within the Maastrichtian municipality where the spoken dialects are in fact not Maastrichtian. These exceptions are previously separate villages and/or municipalities that have merged with the municipality of Maastricht namely [[Amby]], [[Borgharen]], [[Heer (Netherlands)|Heer]] and [[Itteren]].

The social status of Maastrichtian speakers is determined by the type of [[sociolect]] spoken by a certain person, with a division between '''Short Maastrichtian''' or '''Standard Maastrichtian''' &lt;ref name="Verhaol vaan eus Taol"/&gt; (''Kort Mestreechs'', ''Standaardmestreechs'') and '''Long/Stretched Maastrichtian''' (''Laank Mestreechs''). Short Maastrichtian is generally considered to be spoken by the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es, whilst Long Maastrichtian is considered to be spoken by the [[working class]].

A particular feature of Maastrichtian is that it gives its speakers a certain prestige.&lt;ref name="Dialect loss in Maastricht"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialect loss in Maastricht|year=1989 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pb1dJDAcwUUC&amp;pg=PA99 |author=Muenstermann, H. |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research of the dialect showed that people talking the "purest" form of Maastrichtian, i.e. the Short Maastrichtian (''Kort Mestreechs'') sociolect, were perceived by others to be the well-educated ones.

==Written Maastrichtian==

The oldest known and preserved text in Maastrichtian dates from the 18th century. This text named ''Sermoen euver de Weurd Inter omnes Linguas nulla Mosa Trajestensi prastantior gehauwe in Mastreeg'' was presumably written for one of the [[carnival]] celebrations and incites people to learn Maastrichtian. As from the 19th century there are more written texts in Maastrichtian, again mostly oriented towards these carnival celebrations. Nowadays however, many other sources display written Maastrichtian, including song texts not written for carnival as well as books, poems, street signs etc.

===Standardisation and official spelling===

In 1999, the municipal government recognised a standardised spelling of Maastrichtian made by [[Pol Brounts]] and [[Phil Dumoulin]] as the official spelling of the dialect.&lt;ref name="Verhaol vaan eus Taol"/&gt;

===Local anthem===
In 2002, the municipal government officially adopted a local anthem (''Mestreechs Volksleed'') composed of lyrics in Maastrichtian. The theme had originally been written by [[Alfons Olterdissen]] (1865–1923) as finishing stanza of the Maastrichtian opera "Trijn de Begijn" of 1910.&lt;ref name="Municipality of Maastricht"&gt;{{cite web |title=Municipality of Maastricht: Maastrichts Volkslied|year=2008 |publisher=N.A.

==Phonology==

The [[phonology]] of the Maastrichtian dialect, especially with regards to [[vowels]] is quite extensive due to the dialect's [[tonal language|tonal]] nature.

* The front vowels {{IPA|/ɪ, eː, æ, aː/}} are somewhat retracted {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ|ɪ̞}}, {{IPA link|e|e̠ː}}, {{IPA link|æ|æ̠}}, {{IPA link|a|a̠ː}}]}}, but not retracted enough to be labelled as central vowels. On the other hand, {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is so retracted that it is best labelled as central {{IPAblink|ɵ}}.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;
* Among the central vowels, {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is rounded, whereas {{IPA|/ə/}} is unrounded.
** {{IPA|/ə/}} occurs only in unstressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|Aarts|1999|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Among the back vowels, {{IPA|/u, uː, ʊ, oː, ɔ, ɔː/}} are rounded, whereas {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is unrounded.
** {{IPA|/u, uː, ʊ, oː, ɔ, ɑ/}} are somewhat advanced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|u|u̟}}, {{IPA link|u|u̟ː}}, {{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̞}}, {{IPA link|o|o̟ː}}, {{IPA link|ɔ|ɔ̟}}, {{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̟}}]}}, but not advanced enough to be labelled as central vowels.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;
* The qualitative differences between the short {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʊ/}} and long {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} close-mid vowels are not very big; the short vowels are slightly higher and somewhat more central. In the case of the {{IPA|/ʏ/–/øː/}} pair, the difference is the smallest.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;
* Among the open-mid vowels, only {{IPA|/ɛː, œː, ɔ/}} are open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛː}}, {{IPA link|œː}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}]}}, whereas {{IPA|/ɛ, œ, ə/}} are actually mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ̝}}, {{IPA link|œ̝}}, {{IPA link|ə}}]}}.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;
* The open vowels {{IPA|/æ, ɑ, ɔː/}} are somewhat raised (i.e. near-open) {{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ|æ}}, {{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɒ|ɒ̝ː}}]}}. {{IPA|/æ/}} is similar in quality to {{IPA|/ɛː/}}; the main difference between them is backness ({{IPA|/æ/}} is somewhat more retracted), rather than height.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;
* The short counterpart of {{IPA|/aː/}} is {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, not {{IPA|/æ/}} (which does not have a long counterpart).

===Diphthongs===
[[File:Maastrichtian Limburgish diphthong chart.svg|thumb|250px|right|Diphthongs of the Maastrichtian dialect, from {{Harvcoltxt|Gussenhoven|Aarts|1999|p=159}}]]

Diphthongs in Maastrichtian are {{IPA|/ɛi, œy, ɔu/}} having closer starting points than the equivalent three in Standard Dutch. The start point of {{IPA|/ɔu/}} is rounded unlike standard Dutch {{IPA|/ʌu/}}.&lt;ref name="ga159"/&gt;

* {{IPA|/ɲ, c, ʃ, ʒ/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] postalveolar. Phonemically, they can be analysed as {{IPA|/nj, tj, sj, zj/}}.&lt;ref name="ga156"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ŋ, k, ɡ, x, ɣ/}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]], whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is [[Palatal consonant|palatal]].&lt;ref name="ga155"/&gt;
** Word-initial {{IPA|/x/}} is restricted to loanwords.&lt;ref name="ga156"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is a voiced fricative trill, either uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}} or pre-uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ̝|ʀ̝˖}}. The fricative component is particularly audible in coda, where a partial devoicing to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʀ̝̊}} ~ {{IPA link|ʀ̝̊|ʀ̝̊˖}}]}} also occurs.&lt;ref name="ga156"/&gt;

==Vocabulary==
{{For2|an extended overview of Maastrichtian words|[[:Wiktionary:Category:Maastrichtian Limburgish|this Wiktionary Category]]|}}

Maastrichtian contains many specific words ample or not used in other Limburgish dialects some being creolisations/"limburgisations" of Dutch, French and German words while others cannot be directly subscribed to one of these languages.

===(Historical) Vocabulary influences from other languages ===

Maastrichtian vocabulary, as the language family it belongs to suggests, is based on the [[Germanic languages]] (apart from the [[Limburgish|Limburgish language family]] this also includes varying degrees of influence from both archaic and modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German languages|German]]). However, what sets Maastrichtian apart from other variants of Limburgish is its relatively strong influences from [[French language|French]]. This is not only because of geographic closeness of a Francophone region (namely [[Wallonia]]) to [[Maastricht]] but also because of French being the predominant spoken language of the Maastrichtian cultural elite and the higher secondary educational system of the region in the past. Some examples:

Unique among other [[Danao languages]], Maranaoan is spoken with a distinct [[downstep]] accent, as opposed to [[stress accent]].

==Distribution==
Maranao is spoken in the following areas (''Ethnologue'').

*[[Lanao del Sur]]
*[[Lanao del Norte]]
*northwestern [[Maguindanao]]
*northwestern [[Cotabato]]
*northwestern [[Bukidnon]]

==Orthography==
Maranaoan was historically written in Arabic letters, which were known as ''Batang Arab''. It is now written with Latin letters.&lt;ref name= "Omniglot"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/maranao.htm |title=Maranao language and alphabet |website=Omniglot |access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is no officially proclaimed standard orthography, Maranao is more or less written phonetically as influenced by Filipino. The following are the letters used in writing out native words:

A, B, D, E, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, NG, O, P, R, S, T, U, W, Y &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://iloko.tripod.com/Maranao.htm |title=Maranao |last=Rubino |first=Carl |website=iloko.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In representing the [[mid central vowel]] (or schwa) {{IPA|/ə/}}, different authors have employed various means to represent this sound (e.g. "E" or "U").&lt;ref name="Lobel2013" /&gt; "Ë" may also be used as recommend by the Komisyong ng Wikang Filipino's ''Ortograpiyang Pambansa'' of 2013.

In 1996, McKaughan and Macaraya, in their revised Maranao dictionary, the digraph "ae" was introduced and used to represent the supposed presence of the vowel /ɨ/.

Double vowels are pronounced separately. For example, "kapaar" is pronounced as /kapaʔaɾ/.

In some older orthographies, "q" is used for the [[glottal stop]] regardless of position,&lt;ref name="A Maranao Dictionary 1967"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED013450.pdf |title=A Maranao Dictionary |last=McKaughan |first=Howard P. |last2=Macaraya |first2=Batua A. |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1967 |location=Honolulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others an apostrophe is used. Outside of linguistic literature, the glottal stop, regardless of position, is not marked in contemporary spelling.

The final /w/ sound in diphthongs and "W" were marked with "-o" in older orthographies, as in other Philippine languages, but both are nowadays spelled as "W". Also, "i" was used in older orthographies to transcribe /j/, which is currently spelled as "Y".

"H" is only used for Malay loanwords&lt;ref name="Omniglot" /&gt;, and "sh" (pronounced as /ʃ/) is used for Arabic loanwords and names such as "Ishak" ([[Isaac]])&lt;ref name="A Maranao Dictionary 1967" /&gt;.

"Di" or "j" are used to transcribe the /d͡ʒ/ sound, such as "[[Maharadia Lawana|radia]]/raja" (from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] word for "king", "[[Raja|Rāja]]") or the [[English language|English]] name "John"&lt;ref name="A Maranao Dictionary 1967" /&gt;.

==Phonology==
Below is the sound system of Maranao including underlying phonetic features.&lt;ref name="Lobel2013"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Lobel |first=Jason William |title=Philippine and North Bornean languages: issues in description, subgrouping, and reconstruction |date=2013 |degree=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JasonLobelFinal.pdf |place=Manoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Velar fricative [h]====
According to Lobel (2013), [h] only occurs in a select number of [[Malay_language|Malay]] [[loanwords]]:&lt;ref name="Lobel2013" /&gt;
*''to'''h'''an'' 'God'
*''ta'''h'''on'' 'astrological sign'
*'''''h'''adapan'' 'in front (of God)'

====Consonant elongation====
Consonants are also pronounced longer if preceded with a schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}. However, this process is not a form of [[gemination]] since consonant elongation in Maranao is not [[distinctive_feature|distinctive]] as seen in other [[Philippine languages]] such as [[Ilokano_language|Ilokano]] and [[Ibanag_language|Ibanag]]. Some of these are:
*''tëpad'' [təpːad] 'get off a vehicle'
*''tëkaw'' [təkːaw] 'startled; surprised'
*''Mëranaw'' is spoken by the [[Maranao]] [[tribe]].
*''Solutan'' [solutːan] (&lt;small&gt;Sultan of [[Warrior|Gandamatu]]&lt;/small&gt;) Sultan sa '''Gandamatu'''.

Since 2009, it has been proposed that previous studies on the phonology of Maranao had overlooked the presence of "heavy" consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobel |first1=Jason William |last2=Riwarung |first2=Labi Hadji Sarip |title=Maranao Revisited: An Overlooked Consonant Contrast and its Implications for Lexicography and Grammar |journal=Oceanic Linguistics |date=2009 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=403–438 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40783537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobe |first1=Jason William |last2=Riwarung |first2=Labi Hadji Sarip |title=Maranao: A preliminary phonological sketch with supporting audio |journal=Language Documentation &amp; Conservation |date=2011 |volume=5 |pages=31-59 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4487 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobel2013" /&gt; These four "heavy" consonants being / p’ t’ k’ s’/.

==Winning answer==
'''Final Question in Miss Earth 2003:''' "At the end of each rainbow, so the saying goes, is a pot of gold. As a woman of the earth, instead of a pot of gold, what else would you rather find at the end of the rainbow?"

'''Winning Answer of Miss Earth 2003:''' "Honestly, there are things that are much more important than gold. For me personally, the most important is the sentiments of the people. To give love and smile to a human being, to be able to give them a hand when needed, to give help to someone who needs your presence, and also God is always with us which is very important. The first thing I think when I open my eyes is heaven. When we have Him in our hearts and mind, everything is better. And I can see people how they really are inside, not if they have gold or not. For me the rainbow means life, God and happiness." - [[Dania Prince]], represented Honduras.&lt;ref name="articlearchives.com/fashion-apparel/fashion-designers/396103-1.html"&gt;{{cite news|title=Honduras beauty wins Miss Earth pageant title|url=http://www.articlearchives.com/fashion-apparel/fashion-designers/396103-1.html|publisher=Manila Bulletin|first=Jenny F.|last=Manongdo|date=2003-11-11|accessdate=2009-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421002337/http://www.articlearchives.com/fashion-apparel/fashion-designers/396103-1.html|archivedate=2012-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:1WHpfDQpWm8J:takenfromdwater.blogspot.com/2005/01/final-question.html+%22At+the+end+of+each+rainbow,+so+the+saying+goes,+is+a+pot+of+gold.+As+a+woman+of+the+earth,+what+else+would+you+rather+find+at+the+end+of+the+rainbow%3F%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us Taken from Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25136">The following is a '''list of medals, awards and decorations in use in Poland'''. Most of them are awarded by the [[Polish Army]], but some of them are civilian decorations that may be worn by the military personnel.

Most of these decorations ceased to be awarded; some were awarded before the [[World War II]] only, and some in the [[People's Republic of Poland]] only; order of some of them was changed by law.

The state awards may be awarded only by the [[President of Poland]]. The [[order of precedence]] was last reformed in 2007. The order of precedence is: 6 orders (''order'') in specific order of precedence (see table below); other orders in order they were received; 12 crosses (''krzyż''), 3 medals (''medal'') and 6 stars (''gwiazda'') in specific order of precedence; other crosses and awards in order they were received.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">The '''Patriot camps''' ({{lang-ka|პატრიოტული ბანაკი}}) are state-sponsored [[summer camp]]s for the [[teenagers]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

The Patriot camps were initiated by the [[president of Georgia]] [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] in 2005. Each year tens of thousands of young Georgians attend summer camps for ten days, with expenses paid by the Georgian government. Participation is voluntary. In 2007 seven patriot camps will operate.

The declared aim of the project is to raise national pride in young Georgians and to counter social problems of the country. The participants are from poor backgrounds aged 15 to 20. Activities in the camps focus on sporting and cultural events. President Saakashvili, the initiator of the program, himself a former pioneer, rebutted any parallels to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Young Pioneer camp]]s, saying that this is as different as it can get.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4250228.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriot camps have been criticized for featuring informal military training (e.g., firing [[AK-47]] rifles).&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Georgia's opposition has also criticized the camps for Saakashvili through them trying to gain political scores among the young people. Each year upon closing of the camps a large meeting is organized in the [[Palace of Sports (Tbilisi)|Palace of Sports]], with Saakashvili addressing the Patriots.

== Ganmukhuri camp ==
One of the Patriot camps was opened in 2007 at the village of [[Ganmukhuri]] close to the cease-fire line with breakaway [[Abkhazia]] with the declared purpose of bringing Georgian and [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] teenagers together.

In July 2007 the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], expressed concern that Georgia's decision to open a Patriot camp at Ganmukhuri could fuel tensions along the Abkhaz-Georgian ceasefire line, with Georgian officials in response accusing Ban Ki-moon of seeking appeasing of [[Russia]]. Georgian Foreign Minister [[Gela Bezhuashvili]] and newly appointed Conflict Resolution Minister [[Davit Bakradze]] responded that the UN should concentrate on "major issues," such as the repatriation of Georgian displaced persons referring to the victims of the [[ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/insight/072507gr.shtml Georgian Official Accuses UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of seeking to appease Russia.] ''Eurasia Insight'', July 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;     

A potentially dangerous incident took place at Ganmukhuri on October 30, 2007 when the patrol of Russian peacekeepers consisting of military personnel and hardware entered Georgian territory and approached the camp, detaining five Georgian policemen who refused the Russians entry. Russian peacekeepers claimed that the officers had been antagonizing and threatening to shoot them.  Georgia's Interior Ministry said the detained policemen were severely beaten{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, and had its forces in the area put on alert. Abkhazia dispatched additional forces to the border posts and put its troops "on high alert".  President Saakashvili personally arrived in the village and lashed out at Russian peacekeepers for provoking the incident and declared that Sergey Chaban, commander of Russia's peacekeeping forces in the area, is [[persona non grata]] in Georgia. The latter denied that beating took place and said that he is subordinate to the Council of the defence ministers of CIS and that he is not going to leave the country without an order. Soon, the Georgian policemen were released and the Russian troops left the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/30/europe/EU-GEN-Georgia-Abkhazia.php Georgia claims Russian peacekeepers apprehend, beat 3 policemen near Abkhazia].

In spite of the documental video presented by the Georgian side, an official Russian version has it that the Russian peacekeepers detained five Georgian policemen only after they attempted to hinder peacekeeper's unit to monitor the area. The Russians claim they were also ready to hand over detained Georgian policemen, but the local Georgian officials refused the deal after receiving instructions from their bosses to wait for President Saakashvili’s arrival. A statement issued later by the ministry said that the incident was a provocation by the Georgian authorities aimed at internal consumption amid wave of [[2007 Georgian demonstrations|anti-governmental protest rallies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16162 Russian MFA: Tbilisi Stirs up Tensions for Internal Consumption]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pitcairn Islanders''' also referred to as '''Pitkerners''', are the [[inhabitants]] or citizens of the [[Pitcairn Islands]]. The Pitcairn Islands is a nation, mainly inhabited by [[Euronesians]] of British and Tahitian descent.
The culture held in common by most Pitcairn Islanders is [[mainstream]] Pitcairn culture, a mixture of [[British culture|British]] and [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] culture derived from the traditions of the settlers who landed in 1790. Most of the people today are [[descendants of the Bounty mutineers|descended]] from the [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] mutineers of [[English people|English]], [[Cornish people|Cornish]], [[Manx people|Manx]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent and the [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] companions, including the few who settled afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigration.gov.pn/community/the_people/index.html The People of Pitcairn Island] - Government of the Pitcairn Islands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.government.pn/Pitcairnshistory.php www.government.pn] Pitcairn's History.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there are a total of 50 people [[List of countries and dependencies by population|inhabiting]] the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visitpitcairn.pn Pitcairn Islands Tourism] - Come Explore... The Legendary Pitcairn Islands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.immigration.gov.pn"&gt;[http://www.immigration.gov.pn/community/index.html Official Pitcairn Immigration and Repopulation Web Site] - Community&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a Pitcairn [[diaspora]] particularly in [[Norfolk Island]], [[New Zealand]] and mainland [[Australia]]. As a result from overcrowding on the island, in 1856 all 194 Pitkerners immigrated to Norfolk Island aboard the ''Morayshire'' (including a baby born en route) but 16 of them returned to Pitcairn on the ''Mary Ann'' in 1858, followed by a further four families in 1864.&lt;ref name="Pitcairn Island Diaspora Survey"&gt;[http://www.government.pn/Pitcairn%20Diaspora%20Survey%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf www.government.pn Pitcairn Island Diaspora Survey] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Discovery===
Pitcairn Island was sighted on 3 July 1767 by the crew of the British [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Swallow|1766|6}}, commanded by Captain [[Philip Carteret]]. The island was named after Scottish Midshipman [[Robert Pitcairn (midshipman)|Robert Pitcairn]], a fifteen-year-old crew member who was the first to sight the island. 
{{quote|“we discovered land to the northward of us. Upon approaching it the next day (Friday, 3 July), it appeared like a great rock rising from the sea... and it having been discovered by a young gentleman, son to Major Pitcairn of the Marines, we called it Pitcairn’s Island.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigration.gov.pn/history/index.html History of Pitcairn Island] - Government of the Pitcairn Islands&lt;/ref&gt;|Philip Carteret}}
These words, recorded in Carteret’s log, describe the first sighting. Robert Pitcairn was a son of British Marine Major [[John Pitcairn]], who later was killed at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in the [[American Revolution]].

===Settlement of Pitcairn===
In 1790, nine of the mutineers from the [[HMS Bounty|''Bounty'']], along with the native [[Tahiti]]an men and women who were with them (six men, eleven women and a baby girl), settled on Pitcairn Islands and set fire to the ''Bounty''. The wreck is still visible underwater in [[Bounty Bay]], discovered in 1957 by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' explorer [[Luis Marden]]. Although the settlers survived by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among them. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and Tahitian men. [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]] and [[Ned Young]] turned to the [[scriptures]], using the ship's [[Bounty Bible|Bible]] as their guide for a new and peaceful society. Young eventually died of an [[asthma]]tic infection. The Polynesians also converted to Christianity ([[Church of England]]). They later converted from their original form of Christianity to [[Seventh-day Adventism]], following a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s. After the rediscovery of Pitcairn, John Adams was granted [[amnesty]] for his part in the [[mutiny]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217050244/http://pitcairn.pn/Pitcairnshistory.php |archive-date=17 December 2014 |title=Pitcairn's History |url=http://pitcairn.pn/Pitcairnshistory.php |access-date=4 July 2015 |publisher=The Government of the Pitcairn Islands |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surnames===
As a result of the families who returned to the island starting in 1859 after settling Norfolk Island, most names therefore are descended from those six families. Occasionally a new person would arrive on the island bringing with them a new surname such as the American Samuel Russell Warren born 1830 in [[Rhode Island]], U.S., fathered children with Agnes Christian (daughter of [[Thursday October Christian II]]), whose descendants still live on the island today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demtullpitcairn.com/2008July.pdf Pitcairn News - 2008] - TIMOTHY YOUNG TULL about SAMUEL WARREN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
In the early 20th century a study was taken by [[Americans|America]]n author [[Harry L. Shapiro]] on the characteristics of the islanders, based on the analysis and observations, for example - Pitcairners were taller than their parents and had produced a healthy number of children. There were more blue-eyed and light haired people in the mixed-race descendants than in a typical [[Tahiti]]an population but more with very dark hair than people of ethnic [[England|English]] origin. A similar study was also taken on the Pitcairn diaspora in Norfolk Island.&lt;ref&gt;''Harry L. Shapiro: The Heritage of the Bounty'' (1936; now retitled ''The Pitcairn Islanders'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sJHfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Constructing+Race:+The+Science+of+Bodies+pitcairn+islanders&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbo9aWpdLWAhXPI1AKHddMC8oQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Constructing%20Race%3A%20The%20Science%20of%20Bodies%20pitcairn%20islanders&amp;f=false Constructing Race: The Science of Bodies and Cultures in American Anthropology] - By Tracy Teslow&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Hattie andre school, pitcairn island.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hattie Andre's school, Pitcairn Island.]]
The once-strict moral codes, which prohibited dancing, [[public displays of affection]], smoking, and consumption of alcohol, have been relaxed in recent years. Islanders and visitors no longer require a six-month licence to purchase, import, and consume alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610134919/http://government.pn/Laws/index.html Pitcairn Island Government Ordinance]. government.pn&lt;/ref&gt; There is now one licensed café and bar on the island, and the Government Store sells alcohol and cigarettes.

Fishing and swimming are two popular recreational activities. A birthday celebration or the arrival of a ship or yacht will involve the entire Pitcairn community in a public dinner in the Square, Adamstown. Tables are covered in a variety of foods, including fish, meat, chicken, philhi, baked rice, boiled plun (banana), breadfruit, vegetable dishes, an assortment of pies, bread, breadsticks, an array of desserts, pineapple and watermelon.

Public work ensures the ongoing maintenance of the island's numerous roads and paths. The island has a [[labour force]] of over 35 men and women (as of 2011).&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pc.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Pitcairn Islands |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{main|Languages of the Pitcairn Islands}}
The majority of the resident Pitcairn Islanders are the [[descendants of the Bounty mutineers|descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers]] and Tahitians (or other Polynesians). [[Pitkern]] is a [[creole language]] derived from 18th-century English, with elements of the [[Tahitian language]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461945/Pitcairn-Island Pitcairn Island]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside standard English at the island's only school. It is closely related to the creole language [[Norfuk]], spoken on [[Norfolk Island]], because Norfolk was repopulated in the mid-19th century by Pitcairners.

===Religion===
[[File:Pitcairn - Church of Adamstown.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Church of [[Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands|Adamstown]].]]
The entire population is [[Seventh-day Adventist]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; A successful Seventh-day Adventist mission in the 1890s was important in shaping Pitcairn society. In recent years, the church has declined, with only about eight islanders worshipping regularly, but most of them still attend church on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/2001/05/turig-poit-for-historic-avetist-commuity-o-pitcair-isla.html "Turning Point for Historic Adventist Community on Pitcairn Island"] 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sabbath and Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]] is observed as a day of rest and as a mark of respect for observant Adventists.

The church was built in 1954 and is run by the Church board and resident pastor, who usually serves a two-year term. The Sabbath School meets at 10&amp;nbsp;am on Saturday mornings, and is followed by Divine Service an hour later. On Tuesday evenings there is another service in the form of a prayer meeting.

==Diaspora==
===Australia===
The [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]] showed that there were a total of 746 people with Pitcairn ancestry. However, this includes the population claiming pitcairn descent in Norfolk Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC90004?opendocument 2016 Census QuickStats] - Norfolk Island - Ancestry, top responses&lt;/ref&gt;
There were 262 people of Pitcairn ancestry for the usually resident population in other [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] of Australia (notably [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2900.0Main+Features101422016?OpenDocument 2016 census Data, Australia] - Understanding ancestry in the Norfolk Island population&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 [[Australian census]], there were 75 people speaking the [[Pitkern language]] (also called Pitcairnese) at home, an increase of 21% from the 2006 census which had 62 people speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/LocalGovernment/The_People_of_Australia.pdf www.omi.wa.gov.au The people of Australia.The People of Australia - Statistics from the 2011 Census (Page: 32)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529194052/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/LocalGovernment/The_People_of_Australia.pdf |date=29 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norfolk Island====
The 2016 Australian census included Norfolk Island for the first time. It showed that 20.0% or 484 people claimed Pitcairn ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC90004?opendocument 2016 Census QuickStats] - Norfolk Island - Ancestry, top responses&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous censuses, the 2011 Census asked a question relating to Pitcairn descent. Though for the first time, the 2011 [[Norfolk Island]] Census focuses on the Pitcairn descent of the "ordinarily resident population" rather than the "permanent population" of previous Censuses. 45.0 percent of the ''permanent population'' are of Pitcairn descent and 38.4 percent of the ''ordinarily resident population'' were of Pitcairn descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolkisland.gov.nf/reports/Census/Census_2011_Addendum(17.01.12).pdf The Norfolk Island 2011 Census] Addendum to the Norfolk Island 2011 Census Report&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for every two persons of Pitcairn descent, there are three persons of non-Pitcairn descent in the ordinarily resident population on Norfolk Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_phc/Norfolk_Island/report.pdf 2011 Norfolk Island Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200110/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/Norfolk_Island/report.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} Ordinarily Resident Population of Pitcairn Descent (Page 16)&lt;/ref&gt;
Norfolk’s Pitcairn descendants are already at least 7th or 8th generation, and those in younger age groups are probably 9th generation and the affinity with their heritage is naturally waning.&lt;ref name="Pitcairn Island Diaspora Survey"&gt;[http://www.government.pn/Pitcairn%20Diaspora%20Survey%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf www.government.pn Pitcairn Island Diaspora Survey] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In the [[2013 New Zealand census]] the Pitcairn Islander ethnic group comprised 177 people. 80.7 percent were born in New Zealand with 36 born overseas - 91.7% on Pitcairn Island. Between 2006 and 2013, the population decreased by 13.4 percent. This compares with an increase of 15.5 percent between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/ethnic-profiles.aspx?request_value=24720&amp;tabname=Income&amp;sc_device=pdf Ethnic group profile: Pitcairn Islander] - 2013 New Zealand census&lt;/ref&gt;
* 96.6 percent lived in the North Island and 1.7 percent lived in the South Island.
* The most common region this group lived in was Wellington Region (59.3 percent).
* The median age (half are younger and half are older than this age) was 37.2 years.
* 80.7 percent were born in New Zealand and 21.1 percent were born overseas.
Ethnic identity:
* 27.1 percent said Pitcairn Islander was their only ethnicity.
* 35.6 percent said they belonged to two ethnic groups and 37.3 percent said they belonged to three or more ethnic groups.

[[Image:Pneumatic barrier.jpg|thumb|oil terminal with pneumatic barrier]]

A '''pneumatic barrier''' is a method to contain [[oil spill]]s. It is also called a [[bubble curtain]]. Air bubbling through a perforated pipe causes an upward water flow that slows the spread of oil. It can also be used to stop [[fish]] from entering [[water pollution|polluted water]]. A further application of the pneumatic barrier is to decrease the salt-water exchange in navigation locks and prevent salt intrusion in rivers.

Pneumatic barriers are also known as air curtains.
The pneumatic barrier is a (non-patented) invention of the Dutch engineer [[Johan van Veen]] from around 1940 
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;.

A pneumatic barrier is an ''active'' (as opposed to ''passive'') method of waterway oil spill control.  (An example of a passive method would be a [[Boom (containment)|containment boom]].)

==Method of operation==

The pneumatic barrier consists of a perforated pipe and a compressed air source.  Air escaping from the pipe provides a "hump" of rising water and air which contains the oil spill.  Anchors to keep the pipe in a particular spot are helpful. In case of a density current due to salinity differences the barrier mixes the salt water, but also slows down the speed of the density current.
[[Image:Bellenscherm Krammersluis.jpg|thumb|pneumatic barrier in navigation lock in the Netherlands]]

==Unique considerations==

At water-current speeds exceeding one foot per second, the pneumatic barrier no longer functions effectively, limiting deployable sites.

==Environmental issues==

The release of compressed air in the water adds oxygen to the local environment.  This may be particularly useful in areas that have become a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]] due to [[eutrophication]]. 

Air curtains may have another application. [[Cetacean_stranding|Dolphin and whale beaching]] has increased with the rise in ocean temperatures. On Thursday February 12th, 2017, a group of nearly 400 whales beached near Golden Bay on the tip of New Zealand’s South Island, following a similar incident earlier that week. The simplicity of an air curtain system, requiring only air compressors and perforated hoses, could allow for rapid deployment and create aerated zones of oxygenated seawater during a marine emergency.

Air curtains are also used to control the release of smoke particles into the environment. After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment. Similar to an air curtain to separate indoor air from outdoor air, for instance in restaurants and walk-in refrigerators, a powerful air curtain can defeat the chimney effect of the incineration process to eliminate any smoke from a brush incinerator. The air curtain acts as a lid on the process, and forces the smoke back into the fuel bed for a cleaner burn.

==Disadvantages==
Like all active systems of any type, a mechanical failure can result in total failure of protection.

[[File:Crown of a Prince of the Blood of France (variant).svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Heraldic crown]] of a ''prince du sang'']]

A '''''prince du sang''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁɛ̃s dy sɑ̃}}, Prince of the Blood) is a person legitimately descended in [[dynasty#dynasts|dynastic]] line from any of a [[realm]]'s [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchs]]. Historically, the term has been used to refer to men and women descended in the [[patrilineality|male line]] from a sovereign, although as [[primogeniture#absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] has become more common in monarchies, those with succession rights through female descent are more likely than in the past to be accorded the princely title (e.g., [[Monarchy of Belgium#Members of the Belgian Royal Family|Belgian Royal Family]]).

In some European kingdoms, especially France, this appellation was a specific rank in its own right, of a more restricted use than other titles.

==History==
Under the [[House of Capet]], the monarchy was feudal, and the younger sons and grandsons of kings did not have rights or precedence based on their royal descent. Feudal titles determined rank. Under Philip Augustus, the Duke of Burgundy, a peer of France, could be reckoned to be mightier than the Count of Dreux, a "baron of the second rank", even though the latter is a paternal cousin of the king, while the former was only a distant [[agnate]]. In the feudal era, the agnates of the king held no special status. This was because agnatic primogeniture had not yet received its sanction as the law governing the succession to the French throne.

Following the [[House of Valois|Valoi]]s succession, the agnates of the king, being "capable of the crown", rose in prominence. New peerages were created for the king's agnates, and for a long time this continued to be so, before the peerage was extended to non-royalty. Over time, the dignity of a peer, which is feudal in nature, and the dignity of a prince of the blood, which is dynastic in nature, clashed. Non-royal peers and princes of the blood who were peers constantly disputed for higher precedence than the other. As the royal line contracted, each prince of the blood gained greater prominence. Finally, in 1576, [[Henry III of France]] issued an edict, as a counterpoise to the growing power of the [[House of Guise]], which made the princes of the blood supreme over the peerage, and amongst themselves, the closer in the line of succession would outrank the more distant, without regard to the actual title that they held.

==As a rank==
In France, the rank of ''prince du sang'' was the highest held at [[court (royal)|court]] after the immediate family of the king during the ''[[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]]'' and the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref name="spanheim"&gt;{{cite book|last= Spanheim|first= Ézéchiel|authorlink=Ezekiel, Freiherr von Spanheim|editor= ed. Émile Bourgeois|title= Relation de la Cour de France|series= le Temps retrouvé|year = 1973|publisher=Mercure de France|location= [[Paris]]|language= French|pages= 70, 87, 313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rank of ''prince du sang'' or ''princesse du sang'' was restricted to legitimate [[patrilineality|agnates]] of the Capetian dynasty who were not members of the [[Fils de France|immediate family of the king]]. Originating in the 14th century, male ''princes du sang'' came to be recognized as entitled to seats on the ''[[Conseil du roi|Conseil du Roi]]'' and the ''[[Parlement of Paris|Parlement de Paris]]'', to precedence above all [[French peerage|peers]] and to precedence among each other according to their respective places in the [[order of succession]].

During the last century of the reign of the [[House of Valois]], when religious strife brought forth rivals for the throne, ''prince du sang'' became restricted in use to refer to dynasts who were distant members of the Royal Family  (i.e., those who were not children or grandchildren in the male line of a French king and, as such, entitled to specific, higher rank of their own as ''enfants'' and ''petits-enfants de France'').&lt;ref name="spanheim"/&gt;

In theory, the princes of the blood included all members of the [[Capetian dynasty]]. In practice, only the agnatic descendants of [[Saint Louis IX]], such as the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], were acknowledged as ''princes du sang''.&lt;ref name="spanheim"/&gt; France's kings, for instance, refused to recognize the [[Capetian House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] Capetians as princes of the blood. The Courtenays descended in legitimate male-line from [[Louis VI of France|King Louis VI]], but had become impoverished, minor nobles over the centuries. Their repeated petitions for recognition to the Bourbon rulers were in vain. When the [[Treaty of Montmartre]] was concluded in 1662, declaring the [[House of Lorraine]] to be heirs to the French throne in the event of extinction of the Bourbons, the Courtenays protested, requesting substitution of the phrase "the royal house issued in legitimate male line from the kings of France" to no avail. In 1715 Louis-Charles de Courtenay, his son Charles-Roger and his brother Roger were once again rebuffed in their attempt to seek recognition of their status. Roger, ''abbé'' de Courtenay, was the last male of the family, dying on 5 May 1733, and his sister Hélène de Courtenay, marquise de Bauffremont (1689–20 June 1768), obtained no redress when she appealed to the king in 1737 after the [[Parlement of Paris]] ordered the term "princesse du sang royal de France" deleted from court documents.

Even a [[cadet branch]] of the Bourbon line, the Bourbon-Carencys, who were most distantly related to the [[Duke of Bourbon#Peerage|Dukes of Bourbon]], were denied princely rank and excluded from the ''Conseil du Roi'' until their extinction in 1530. They descended from [[List of lords and princes of Carency#House of Bourbon-Carency (14th–16th centuries)|Jean, seigneur de Carency]] (1378–1457), the youngest son of [[John I, Count of La Marche|Jean I de Bourbon, Count of La Marche]].

Since 1733, all legitimate male Capetians were of the House of Bourbon, of the Vendôme branch, descended from [[Charles, Duke of Vendôme]]. Charles' eldest son [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine, King of Navarre]], was the ancestor of the royal dynasties of France and Spain, and of the [[House of Orléans]], while his youngest son [[Louis, Prince of Condé (1530–1569)]], was the ancestor of the [[Princes of Condé|House of Condé]]. A cadet branch of the Condés was the [[Princes of Conti|House of Conti]], who in male line descended of [[Henri, Prince of Condé (1588–1646)]].

In an edict of July 1714, Louis XIV declared his legitimized sons, the Duke of Maine and Count of Toulouse, to be ''princes du sang'' and accorded them rights of succession to the French throne following all other ''princes du sang''. Though the ''Parlement de Paris'' refused to register the decree, the king exercised his right to compel registration by conducting a ''[[lit de justice]]''. The edict was revoked and annulled on 18 August 1715 by the ''Parlement'' on the authority of the regent after the king's death. As a chancellor of Louis XIV had warned, a king could only make princes of the blood through his queen.&lt;ref&gt;The Institutions of France Under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598–1789, Volume 2, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
Those who held this rank were usually styled by their main [[peerage of France|ducal peerage]], but sometimes other titles were used, indicating a more precise status than ''prince du sang''.

The most senior princes used specific styles such as ''monsieur le prince'' or ''monsieur le duc'', whereas the junior princes used the style ''[[monseigneur]]'' followed by their noble title, such as ''[[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|monseigneur le duc de Montpensier]]''. The style [[Serene Highness]] (''altesse sérénissime'') was used in writing only.

==''Monsieur le Prince''==
This was the style of the '''First Prince of the Blood''' ({{lang-fr|premier prince du sang}}), which normally belonged to the most senior (by [[primogeniture]]) male member of the royal dynasty who is neither a ''[[fils de France]]'' ("son of France", i.e. of the King or the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]") nor a ''[[Fils de France#Petit-fils de France|petit-fils de France]]'' ("grandson of France", son of a ''fils de France''). In practice, it was not always clear who was entitled to the rank, and it often took a specific act of the king to make the determination.

The rank carried with it various privileges, including the right to a household paid out of state revenues. The rank was held for life: the birth of a new, more senior prince who qualified for the position did not deprive the current holder of his use of the style. The [[Prince de Condé|Princes of Condé]] used the style of ''Monsieur le Prince'' for over a century (1589–1709). The right to use the style passed to the [[House of Orléans]] in 1709; however, they seldom if ever used it. The title should theoretically have passed in 1747 to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Calabria]], the first great-grandson of the [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|''Grand Dauphin'']] that was neither a ''fils de France'' nor a ''petit-fils de France''; however, [[Louis XV]] left the title to the House of Orléans rather than to the Spanish branch of the Bourbons, which had renounced its right to succeed to the French throne by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. This meant that [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orleans|Louis Philippe]], duke of Orleans in the late 18th century, was the First Prince of the Blood immediately before the [[French Revolution]], entitling him to sit on various bodies, such as the [[Assembly of Notables#1787 assembly|1787 Assembly of Notables]], which he used as a platform to advocate liberal reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |host=[[Mike Duncan (podcaster)|Mike Duncan]]|title=Episode 3.5 "The Assembly of Notables" |website=Revolutions |publisher= |date=17 August 2014|url=http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2014/08/35-the-assembly-of-notables.html |access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Madame la Princesse''==
This style was held by the wife of ''Monsieur le Prince''. The duchesses/princesses that were entitled to use it were:
* 1646–1686: [[Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé]] (1628–1694). Niece of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and wife of the ''Grand Condé'', she was also the Duchess of Fronsac in her own right from 1646–1674.
* 1684–1709: [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|''Anna Henrietta'' Julia of Bavaria]] (1648–1723). She was the daughter of [[Anna Gonzaga]] and her husband [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua]]. In 1663 she married [[Henry III Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Henry Jules, Duke of Bourbon]] the son and heir of the ''Grand Condé''. Anne Henriette was the mother of [[Louis III, Prince of Condé]] and ''[[Marie Thérèse de Bourbon|Madame la Princesse de Conti Seconde Douairière]]''
* 1709–1723: [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon]] (1677–1749) – wife of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==''Monsieur le Duc''==
This style was used for the eldest son of the [[Princes of Condé|''Prince de Condé'']]. Originally, the eldest son was given the title of [[Duke of Enghien|''Duc d'Enghien'']], but that changed in 1709 when the Condés lost the rank of ''premier prince''. After that, the eldest son was often given the courtesy title of [[Duke of Bourbon|''Duc de Bourbon'']], which had been granted to [[Louis, Grand Condé|''le Grand Condé'']], and his eldest son was then given the title of ''duc d'Enghien''.
# 1689–1709: [[Henry III, Prince of Condé|Henri I, Duke of Enghien]] (1643–1709);
# 1709–1710: [[Louis III, Prince of Condé|Louis I, Duke of Enghien]] (1668–1710);
# 1710–1740: [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis II Henri, Duke of Enghien]] (1692–1740);
# 1740–1818: [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|Louis III Joseph, Duke of Enghien]] (1736–1818);
# 1818–1830: [[Louis Henry II, Prince of Condé|Louis IV Henri, Duke of Enghien]] (1756–1830).

==''Madame la Duchesse''==
This style was used for the wife of ''Monsieur le Duc''. The most famous holder of this [[honorific]] was:
* 1685–1709: [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon]] (1673–1743) – The illegitimate daughter of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and his mistress, [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]], she was married in May 1685, to [[Louis III, Prince of Condé]], then known by the [[courtesy title]] of ''[[Duke of Bourbon|duc de Bourbon]]''. Since his style at court was ''Monsieur le Duc'', she became known as ''Madame la Duchesse''. She later held onto the style even in her widowhood when she was the Princess of Condé. She was later known as ''Madame la Duchesse Douairière''.

'''Others included:'''
* 1713–1720: [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1689–1720)|Marie Anne de Bourbon]] (1689–1720) – first wife of [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon]];
* 1728–1741: [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg]] (1714–1741) second wife of the Duke of Bourbon;
* 1753–1760: [[Charlotte Élisabeth Godefride de Rohan]] (1737–1760) – wife of [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé]]
* 1770–1818: [[Bathilde d'Orléans|Louise Marie Thérèse ''Bathilde'' d'Orléans]] (1750–1820) – wife of the last Prince of Condé.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==''Monsieur le Comte''==
This address was used by the head of the most junior branch of the House of Bourbon, the comte de Soissons. The comtes de Soissons, like the [[Princes of Conti]], descended from the [[Princes of Condé]]. The line started in 1566 when the Soissons title was given to [[Charles de Bourbon, comte de Soissons|Charles de Bourbon]], the second son of [[Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé]], the first ''Prince of Condé''.

The first Prince had three sons:
* [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Henri de Bourbon]], second Prince of Condé;
* [[Charles de Bourbon, comte de Soissons|Charles de Bourbon]], first Count of Soissons and the founder of the [[Princes of Condé#House of Bourbon-Soissons|House of Bourbon-Soissons]]
* [[François, Prince of Conti|François de Bourbon, Prince de Conti]], first [[Princes of Conti|Prince of Conti]] but the Conti title lapsed upon his death in 1614 without legitimate heirs. It was later revived in 1629 for [[Armand de Bourbon, prince de Conti]], the second son of [[Henry II, Prince of Condé]].

The Soissons title was acquired by the first Prince of Condé in 1557 and was held by his descendants for two more generations:
* [[Charles, Count of Soissons]]
* [[Louis, Count of Soissons]]

File:Olympia Mancini by Mignard.png|[[Olympia Mancini]], known as ''Madame la Comtesse'' at court
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The 2nd Count of Soissons died without an heir, so the Soissons title passed to his younger sister, [[Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons|Marie de Bourbon]], the wife of [[Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano]], a member of the [[House of Savoy]]. She became known as ''Madame la comtesse de Soissons''. On her death, the title passed first to her second son,  [[Joseph-Emmanuel, Count of Soissons|Prince Joseph-Emmanuel of Savoy-Carignan]] (1631–1656), and then to her third son, [[Prince Eugène-Maurice of Savoy-Carignano|Prince Eugène-François of Savoy-Carignan]].

He married [[Olympia Mancini]], niece of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. She was known as ''Madame la Comtesse de Soissons''&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Mitford]], ''The Sun King'', 1966, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; like her mother-in-law. On his death, the title went to his eldest son, [[Prince Louis Thomas of Savoy-Carignano|Prince Louis-Thomas]], who was the older brother of the famous Austrian general, [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. The Soissons title became extinct upon the death of Prince Eugène-Jean of Savoy-Carignan in 1734.

==''Madame la Comtesse''==
This style was used by the wife of ''Monsieur le Comte''. The best example of this is  [[Olympia Mancini]].

==''Madame la Princesse Douairière''==
In order to tell the wives of the various Princes of Conti apart after their deaths, the widows were given the name of ''Douairière'' (or [[dowager]]) and a number corresponding to when they lost their husband. After being widowed their full style would be ''Madame la Princesse de Conti 'number' Douairière''. Between 1727 and 1732, there were three widowed Princesses de Conti. They were:
* [[Marie Anne de Bourbon]] (1666–1739), the legitimised daughter of [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louise de La Vallière]]; she was the wife of [[Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti]]. She was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti Première Douairière'' as she was the first to be widowed, in 1685. The title went to her husband's younger brother, [[François Louis, Prince of Conti]].
* [[Marie Thérèse de Bourbon]] (1666–1732), the wife of [[François Louis, Prince of Conti]]; she was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti Seconde Douairière'' after losing her husband in 1709.
* [[Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon]] (1693–1775), the wife of [[Louis Armand II de Bourbon, prince de Conti|Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti]], the son and successor of [[François Louis, Prince of Conti]]. She was the daughter of ''[[Louis III, Prince of Condé|Monsieur le Duc]]'' and ''[[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon|Madame la Duchesse]]''. After her husband died in 1727, she was known as ''Madame la Princesse de Conti Troisième/Dernière Douairière''. This was not a traditional style by right but was simply a means the court used to distinguish between the three widows who held the title of ''[[Prince de Conti|Princesse de Conti]]'' at the same time.

==Legitimised royal offspring==
[[Legitimation|Legitimised]] children of the King of France, and of other males of his dynasty, took surnames according to the branch of the [[House of Capet]] to which their father belonged, e.g. [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine]], was the elder son of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] by his mistress, [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Mme de Montespan]].&lt;ref name="spanheim"/&gt; After the legitimisation occurred, the child was given a title. Males were given titles from their father's lands and estates and females were given the style of ''Mademoiselle de X''. Examples of this are (children of Louis XIV and [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Mme de Montespan]]):
* Louise Françoise de Bourbon (1669–1672); [[File:The sisters Mademoiselle de Blois and Mademoiselle de Nantes by Philippe Vignon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sisters [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon|''Mademoiselle de Blois'']] and [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon|''Mademoiselle de Nantes'']], two legitimised daughters of Louis XIV and Mme de Montespan.]]
* Louis-Auguste de Bourbon (1670–1736), titled [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine|''duc du Maine'']]&amp;nbsp;– later married [[Anne-Louise-Bénédicte de Bourbon-Condé]].
* Louis César de Bourbon (1672–1683), titled [[Counts of the Vexin|''comte de Vexin'']];
* Louise-Françoise de Bourbon (1673–1743), titled [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon|''Mademoiselle de Nantes'']]&amp;nbsp;– later wife of [[Louis III, Prince of Condé|Louis III de Bourbon-Condé, ''prince de Condé'']]
* Louise Marie Anne de Bourbon (1674–1681), titled [[Louise Marie Anne de Bourbon|''Mademoiselle de Tours'']];
* Françoise-Marie de Bourbon (1677–1749), titled [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon|''Mademoiselle de Blois'']]&amp;nbsp;– wife of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe II d'Orléans]], ''[[Duke of Orléans|duc d'Orléans]]''.
* Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon (1678–1737), titled [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse|''comte de Toulouse'']]&amp;nbsp;– later married to [[Marie Victoire de Noailles]].

Also the child would be referred to as ''Légitimé de Bourbon''; such as [[Marie Anne de Bourbon|Marie Anne ''légitimée de Bourbon'', ''mademoiselle de Blois'']] daughter of [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louise de La Vallière]]. Her full brother was [[Louis de Bourbon, comte de Vermandois|Louis de Bourbon]], later given the title of ''comte de Vermandois''.

==Orléans-Longueville==
The branch of the ''ducs de Longueville'', extinct in 1672 (1694), bore the surname ''d'Orléans'', as legitimised descendants of [[Jean de Dunois|Jean, bâtard d'Orléans]], the [[wikt:illegitimate|natural]] son of a [[House of Valois|Valois]] prince who held the [[appanage]] of Orléans before the Bourbons did.&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-legitimised natural children of royalty took whatever surname the king permitted, which might or might not be that of the [[dynasty]].

Children born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] to a French king or prince were never recognised as ''fils de France''. However, if legitimised, the king might raise them to a rank just below or even equivalent to that of a ''prince du sang''.&lt;ref&gt;ib. Spanheim, Ézéchiel, pp. 100–105, 323–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prostitutes in Ghana are campaigning for the sex trade to be legalised,&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/prostitutes-in-ghana-battle-for-recognition/av-17036797|title=Prostitutes in Ghana battle for recognition|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=21 August 2013|author=Isaac Kaledzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanatrade.gov.gh/Latest-News/make-prostitution-legal-prostitutes-urge-govt.html|title=Make Prostitution Legal - Prostitutes Urge Gov't|publisher=ghanatrade.gov.gh|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussions have taken place.&lt;ref name="trust" /&gt;

Ghana's former Prime Minister, [[Kofi Abrefa Busia|Dr Kofi Abrefa Busia]], an Oxford sociologist, wrote a thesis on prostitution “Report on a social survey of Sekondi-Takoradi.“&lt;ref name="gweb" /&gt;

==Overview==
Prostitutes in Ghana are known locally as "ashawo",&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/682212/relationship-between-unemployment-and-prostitution-in-ghana.html|title=Relationship Between Unemployment And Prostitution In Ghana|website=Modern Ghana|author=Albert Opare|date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "toutou" (derived from 'two shillings, two pence'; a prostitute who doesn't charge much)&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WyPfynlwMC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=prostitution%20in%20ghana#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20ghana&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work|first=Melissa Hope|last=Ditmore|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=23 January 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313329708}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "maame-i-dey".&lt;ref name="gweb" /&gt;
There are [[brothels]] in most Ghana towns, cities and ports. Often these are in makeshift shacks or old warehouses, and some are attached to bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zammagazine.com/chronicle/chronicle-7/70-the-girls-behind-the-railway-line|title=The girls behind the railway line - ZAM|first=Selase|last=Kove-Seyram|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes not working in the brothels are known as either "seaters" or "roamers".&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; The seaters work from home, sitting in the doorway and inviting customers in.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; When they are with a customer they lower a curtain in front of the door.&lt;ref name="ency" /&gt; Seaters generally work in one area of town, creating a small red-light district. Generally they are older women or widows.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt;

Roamers tend to be younger women and work on the streets, bars and hotels.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; "Pilots", often taxi-drivers, work as intermediaries between the women and clients in hotels. They usually get a fee from both parties.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; They also help the women get into the hotels as most have a no single women rule.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; Hotel staff may also take bribes to let the women in.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt;

The women face occasional violence from the customers, or more commonly refusal to pay. Hotel staff may exploit them.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt;

Since oil production started in 2011, prostitution in the port of [[Takoradi]] has risen sharply due to the influx of oil workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/ghana-oil-revives-prostitution|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209022602/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/ghana-oil-revives-prostitution|archivedate=2014-02-03|title=Ghana: oil revives prostitution |author=Francis Kokutse |publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNAIDS]] estimate there are 52,000 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male prostitution==
The prevalence of male prostitution in Ghana has slowly risen over the years but not much is said about it because of the form it takes. Male prostitution is predominant in the following areas such as [[Tesano]], [[Adabraka]], [[Osu, Accra]] and Paloma in Accra. Male prostitutes go undercover as women because homosexuality is illegal in Ghana as per the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male prostitutes practice openly in Accra|url=https://www.modernghana.com/lifestyle/376/16/male-prostitutes-practice-openly-in-accra.html|website=Modern Ghana|publisher=Modern Ghana|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ennin Abbey|first1=Emelia|title='Man-woman' prostitute arrested by police in Accra|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/man-woman-prostitute-arrested-by-sowutuom-police.html|website=Graphic Online|publisher=Graphic Online|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHOTO: Male prostitute dressed as a Female arrested Agbogbloshie|url=http://etvghana.com/2017/09/19/photo-male-prostitute-dressed-as-a-female-arrested-agbogbloshie/|website=e.tv Ghana|publisher=e.tv Ghana|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of these prostitutes are most commonly patronized by men in the elite class who have enough resources to be discreet about their sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Prostitutes Invade Accra|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Gay-Prostitutes-Invade-Accra-124290|website=GhanaWeb|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a relevant increase in the price of engaging homosexual prostitutes given the limited supply of these prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male prostitutes practice openly in Accra|url=https://www.modernghana.com/lifestyle/376/16/male-prostitutes-practice-openly-in-accra.html|website=Modern Ghana|publisher=Modern Ghana|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement==
Law enforcement is variable, and there are also occasional crack-downs on prostitutes.&lt;ref name="usstate" /&gt; Prostitutes are often abused by law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name="DW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt; In a survey across 26 town and cities, a third of the prostitutes told of problems with the police. These included intimidation, extortion, threats and raids. Many reported that they had had to have sex with the officers to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref name="redef" /&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 251 law enforcement agents, 15% admitted they had demanded sex in return for not prosecuting arrested prostitutes.&lt;ref name="usstate" /&gt;

Police and politicians are sometimes bribed or blackmailed to turn a blind eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse.com.gh/news/sin-city-how-prostitution-illicit-sex-and-immorality-rule-ashaiman-id4208969.html|title=Sin City?

==Sex tourism==
Ghana has established itself as a destination for [[sex tourism]] from western tourists. This kind of tourism has attracted paedophiles due to the country's lax child protection laws and poor law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghana Trafficking China's Prostitutes|work=West African Democracy Radio|date= |url=http://wadr.org/en/site/news_en/2444/%27Ghana-Trafficking-China%27s-Prostitutes%27--EPAWA.htm |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicle.com.gh/children-active-in-commercial-sex-work-in-ghana/ |title=Children active in commercial sex work in Ghana|publisher=Thechronicle.com.gh|date=2012-06-05|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZJPT3XUM81AC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=prostitution%20in%20ghana#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20ghana&amp;f=false|title=Children's Rights in Ghana: Reality or Rhetoric?|first1=Robert Kwame|last1=Ame|first2=DeBrenna LaFa|last2=Agbényiga|first3=Nana Araba|last3=Apt|date=22 February 2011|publisher=Lexington Books|accessdate=23 January 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780739169100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78737.htm |title=Ghana|publisher=State.gov|date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/ghana-%E2%80%9Cparadise-paedophiles%E2%80%9D-says-oneworld|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708201626/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/ghana-%E2%80%9Cparadise-paedophiles%E2%80%9D-says-oneworld|archivedate=2012-07-08|title=Ghana is "paradise for paedophiles", says OneWorld |date=8 July 2012|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graphic&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.graphic.com.gh/features/features/ghana-not-a-sex-tourism-destination.html|title=Ghana news: Ghana not a sex tourism destination |date=2 July 2013|first=Arku|last=Jasmine|publisher=Graphic Online|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecoi.net/local_link/308763/446602_de.html|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2015 - Country Narratives - Ghana|author=US Department of State|date=27 July 2015|publisher=European Country of Origin Information Network|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child prostitution]] is increasing is a problem with girls being vulnerable and boys to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name=OW&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.oneworld.nl/wereld/paradijs-voor-pedos |author=Sanne Terlingen |title=Paradijs voor Pedo's |language=nl|publisher=OneWorld.nl |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/31586|title=IOM Study shows HIV vulnerability among female sex workers in Ghana |date=15 April 2015 |publisher=Newstime Africa|agency=African Press Organization|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Ex_Summary_GHANA_FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=Executive summary : Ghana |website=Ecpat.org |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=Prue|title=PM - Poverty in Ghana driving children into prostitution|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1481873.htm|accessdate=12 March 2017|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=13 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/77388/ghana-profile-child-sex-worker|title=Profile of a child sex worker|date=20 March 2008|publisher=IRIN|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blay|first1=Pius Amihere|title=Cape Coast tops child prostitution in Ghana- UNICEF Report|url=http://citifmonline.com/2015/08/31/cape-coast-tops-child-prostitution-in-ghana-unicef-report/|publisher=Ghana News|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right on Crime initiative began its public affairs campaign in December 2010, in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gritsforbreakfast |url=http://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com/2010/12/tppf-launches-right-on-crime-campaign.html |title=Grits for Breakfast: TPPF launches 'Right on Crime' campaign |publisher=Gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a January 2011 article in the ''Washington Post'' by former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former California Speaker of the House Pat Nolan, "The Right on Crime Campaign represents a seismic shift in the legislative landscape. And it opens the way for a common-sense left-right agreement on an issue that has kept the parties apart for decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/06/AR2011010604386.html|title=Prison reform: A smart way for states to save money and lives|work=[[Washington Post]]|author=[[Newt Gingrich]]|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The New York Times''' [[Charlie Savage]] noted the conservative movement's growing support for Right on Crime in a ''Times'' editorial in October 2011, writing "The [corrections overhaul] movement has attracted the support of several prominent conservatives, including Edwin R. Meese III, the attorney general during the Reagan administration. He is part of a campaign, called 'Right on Crime,' which was begun last December to lend weight to what it calls the 'conservative case for reform.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/us/13penal.html?_r=2&amp;|work=New York Times|title=Trend to Lighten Harsh Sentences Catches On in Conservative States|date=12 August 2011|author=[[Charlie Savage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2011, Right on Crime expanded its campaign into individual states, including Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2011/02/16/right_on_crime_launches_texas.html|work=Austin Statesman|title=Right on Crime launches Texas drive|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiapolicy.org/right-on-crime-launches-criminal-justice-reform-initiative-today-in-georgia/|publisher=Georgia Public Policy Foundation|title=Right on Crime Launches Criminal Justice Reform Initiative Today in Georgia|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitolbeatok.com/reports/right-on-crime-launches-oklahoma-effort-with-blue-room-conference |title=Right on Crime launches Oklahoma effort with Blue Room conference |publisher=Capitolbeatok.com |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Florida. The ''Los Angeles Times'' explained the initiative is "setting the pace in states such as Texas," in a November 2011 editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/13/opinion/la-ed-realign-20111113|title=Prison realignment done right|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[BBC]] reported that in Texas, rather than building new prisons, Right on Crime has led to the closure of three prisons.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Texas is closing prisons in favour of rehab|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30275026|accessdate=2 December 2014|work=BBC|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created by [[Béatrice Bonifassi]], with [[Robert Lepage]] as stage director. The pair launched the show on June 26, 2018, during the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]]. 

''SLĀV'', billed as "a theatrical odyssey based on slave songs", was met with growing controversy, with protesters accusing it of [[cultural appropriation]] and cultural insensitivity. Musician [[Moses Sumney]] cancelled his performance at the festival in protest, saying: {{quote| there is no context in which white people performing black slave songs is okay.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Teacher and Parent Rating Scale''' ('''SNAP'''), developed by James Swanson, Edith Nolan and William Pelham, is a 90-question [[self-report inventory]] designed to measure [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD) [[symptoms]] in children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=MS|last2=Pelham|first2=WE|last3=Licht|first3=MH|title=A comparison of objective classroom measures and teacher ratings of Attention Deficit Disorder.|journal=Journal of abnormal child psychology|date=March 1985|volume=13|issue=1|pages=155–67|pmid=3973249|doi=10.1007/bf00918379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each question measures the frequency of a variety of symptoms or behaviors, in which the respondent indicates whether the behavior occurs "not at all", "just a little", "quite a bit", or "very much". The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes to complete and is designed for use with children and young adults ages 6–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring Instructions for the SNAP-IV-C Rating Scale|url=http://www.adhd.net/snap-iv-form.pdf|website=Scoring Instructions for the SNAP-IV-C Rating Scale|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire is currently in its 4th version, and its scores have shown good [[reliability (research methods)|reliability]] and [[test validity|validity]] across multiple different study samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bussing|first1=R|last2=Fernandez|first2=M|last3=Harwood|first3=M|last4=Wei|first4=Hou|last5=Garvan|first5=CW|last6=Eyberg|first6=SM|last7=Swanson|first7=JM|title=Parent and teacher SNAP-IV ratings of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms: psychometric properties and normative ratings from a school district sample.|journal=Assessment|date=September 2008|volume=15|issue=3|pages=317–28|pmid=18310593|doi=10.1177/1073191107313888|pmc=3623293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Question breakdown, scoring and interpretation ==

Scoring the SNAP-IV is based on a 0-3 scale, with each question being scored as follows based on participant response:
*'''0 points:''' "not at all" 
*'''1 point:''' "just a little" 
*'''2 points:''' "quite a bit"
*'''3 points:''' "very much"

=== Domain breakdown ===
The questions measure different domains of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[Oppositional defiant disorder|ODD]]. The item breakdown is as follows:
*'''1-10''': Measures attention deficit hyperactivity disorder inattention symptoms
*'''11-20''': Measures attention deficit hyperactivity disorder hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms
*'''21-30''': Measures ODD symptoms
*'''31-40''': Measures "general childhood problems"
*'''41-80''': Measures non-ADHD disorders
*'''81-90''': Measures academic performance and deportment

=== Interpretation of subscale scores ===

Subscale scores add all scores on the items in the subset and divided by the total number of items in the subset. Subscale score cutoffs for the disorders are as follows:

*'''ADHD inattentive type''': Teacher score of 2.56, parent score of 1.78.
*'''ADHD hyperactive/impulsive type''': Teacher score of 1.78, parent score of 1.44.
*'''ADHD combined type''': Teacher score of 2.00, parent score of 1.67.
*'''ODD''': Teacher score of 1.38, parent score of 1.88.

Historically they played a major role in economic life in Japan and among the [[Japanese diaspora]], and still survive on an informal basis in some parts of the country.

==Name==
''Tanomoshi'' or ''Tanomoshiko'' (頼母子講) has also been called ''mujin'' (無尽) or ''moai'' (模合) in Japan. The name may be derived from ''tanomu'' meaning begging, or from ''tayori ni naru mono'' meaning reliance.&lt;ref name=ACRN /&gt;

==History==
''Tanomoshi'', denoting a locally organized social finance scheme, has existed in Japan at least since the middle [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333).&lt;ref name="Odo2013" /&gt; The principle was that each member would contribute a sum at regular intervals and would receive a single payment when their turn came round; it required mutual trust among those involved.&lt;ref name="HolliJones1995" /&gt; The institution facilitated personal savings, investment in property and enterprise, insurance, personal loans and assistance of poorer people. By the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]] (1603–1868) ''tanomoshi'' was widespread.&lt;ref name="Odo2013" /&gt; During the later 19th century under the [[Meiji period|Meiji]], commercial [[bank]]s developed, but as the banks were reluctant to offer small-scale and personal banking services they did not altogether supersede ''tanomoshi'', which were incorporated into mutually financed ''mujin'' companies in 1915.&lt;ref name="Tatewaki2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kazuo Tatewaki|title=Banking and Finance in Japan (RLE Banking &amp; Finance): An Introduction to the Tokyo Market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXAQxdFMxZMC&amp;pg=PA9|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-26906-6|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither was ''tanomoshi'' fully replaced by state [[social security]] when it was implemented in the early 20th century. The system also operated among Japanese immigrants to the United States and Brazil, helping them in establishing new businesses there.&lt;ref name="HolliJones1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melvin Holli|author2=Peter d'Alroy Jones|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&amp;pg=PA415|date=19 May 1995|publisher=Wm.

''Tanomoshi'' still functions in certain areas, especially [[Kyushu]] and [[Okinawa]].

In Aizu region of Fukushima prefecture, ''tanomoshi'' called ''mujin'' has supported savings for leisure mainly in restaurants once a month (e.g., Kimura, 2001). However, in general, it is considered that traditional financial services based on mutual help and solidarity is not necessary anymore. Instead, consumer loans emerged as a new way to borrow money.

Most ''tanomoshiko'' are organized within a workplace or among friends. The members may use the funds built up to finance a trip or a banquet. It is most used by members of social minorities who are less prone to borrow money from financial institutions. The institution has little or no legal status.

The '''Thadou''' (''Thadou/Thado te'') are an ethnic group inhabiting in [[Northeast India]], Chin state and Sagaing Division in [[Burma]] and eastern [[Bangladesh]]. [[Thadou language|Thadou]] is a language of the Tibeto-Burman family. Thadou is spoken in the different parts of North East India and adjacent portions of Burma and Bangladesh.  It was the second language after Meiteilon (Manipuri) in the Manipur state during British Colonial Period. In Manipur, the Thadous are mostly found in Churachandpur district, Senapati district, Ukhrul district, South-Western Hills and Sadar Hills, Chandel district and Jiribam. They are the largest Tribe in Manipur according to Manipur census 2011. Thadous also live in Mizoram, Nagaland and Assam, etc.

==Religion==
A great majority of the Thadou people are Christians. Christianity among the Thadous can be traced back to an [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] named [[William Pettigrew]] who worked in Manipur as a missionary from 1894. The 100th anniversary of the Thadou people embracing Christianity was held at Motbung, Sadar Hills, Manipur India on 13 December 2008 under the aegis of the Thadou Baptist Association. Some 10% of the Thadou populace around the world are following [[Judaism]] as they are believed to be descendants of [[Manasseh]], one of the 12 tribes of [[Israel]]. Some 5000 of Thadou people are now settled in Israel.

==History==
The Thadou people believed that Chongthu, a great Chief of Thadou, emerged out from a cave called "Chhinlung or [[Sinlung|Shinlung]] or Khul" the location of which was believed to be somewhere in Central China, whereas others claimed it to be in [[Tibet]]. (Ginzatuang 1973:5) Mc. Culloch (1857:55). Those ancestors emerging from the cave include Chongthu/Songthu, Khupngam, Vangalpa and some clansmen, leaving behind Noimangpa, Chongja and others of the group.

William Shaw's (1929) description about the origin of Thadou is recorded from collected oral traditionals. According to the Thadou narrative recorded by Shaw (1929), Noimangpa was the chief of subterranean region. Chongthu, a relative of Noimangpa, while hunting in the jungle with his dog, discovered a large cave. Chongthu, rejoiced at this discovery, gave up his hunting and went back to his village. He conjured up ideas of forming his own village on the earth. Meanwhile, Noimangpa the chief of the underworld was performing the ‘chon’ festival, in which everyone including chongja, the elder brother of Chongthu, Noimangpa’s son Chonkim participated. During this feast Chongthu started waving his sword so vigorously that he injured some of the people present, at which all were annoyed. This action of Chongthu was premeditated so that he can find an excuse to go to the upper world to form a village of his own. When Noimangpa came to know this he wanted Chongthu dead. Chongthu on hearing Noimangpa’s wrath, prepared to leave for the uninhabited earth, ‘khul’, as spoken of by the Thadous. So, Chongja and Chongthu along with the cavemen feasted before their departure. On their journey to the upper crust of the earth there was a great darkness, which lasted for seven days and seven nights, called “Thimzin” by the Thadou’s. They found a stone blocking their passage out and after making many attempts Chongja and party gave up and returned to Noimangpa and reported the result’. Pi Nemneh, wife of Songja, cursed Chongthu and party for leaving them at doom in ‘Khul’. It is also believed that Chongja, Noimangpa and other clansmen who were left behind are assimilated with the Chinese and Japanese people.

===The Anglo-Kuki War (1917–19)===
[[File:Pu Khotinthang Sitlhou @ Kilkhong.jpg|thumbnail|right|A life size statue of Pu Khotinthang Sitlhou (Chief of Jampi)]]
The Kuki Rebellion (1917–19) was one of the important uprisings against the British imperialism which went on par with the Indian National Movement for Freedom. This movement was known by different names. The Thadous called it "Thadou gal". The Meiteis called it "Khongjai Laal"(Khongjai war). The Zous called it Zougal . However, in the official records of Manipur it was known as Kuki Rebellion 1917–1919. It commenced from 17 March 1917 and concluded on 20 May 1919

As a mark of protest against the British and to stop further recruitment of the Thadous and its cognate tribes in the non-combatant force at the battlefront in France in the First World War as per the appeal received from the Secretary of State for India, London, in his telegram dated 28 January 1917, the Thadous in Manipur openly revolted against the British in the month of December 1917. The Chief of Aisan, '''Chengjapao Doungel''', who was the "Piba" or head of the Thadous, sent orders to all the leading Thadou chiefs to resist the British with force, if necessary. A very important meeting was held at Jampi Village. The chiefs who attended the meeting were:

#Pu '''Khotinthang Sitlhou''' alias '''Kilkhong''', Chief of Jampi
#Pu '''Khupkhotintong (Tintong) Haokip'''
#Pu '''Songchung Sitlhou''', Chief of Sangnao
#Pu '''Lunkholal Sitlhou''', Chief of Chongjang
#Pu '''Vumngul Kipgen''', Chief of Tujang
#Pu '''Lhunjangul Kipgen''', son of Vumngul Kipgen
#Pu '''Enjakhup Kholhou''', Chief of Thenjang
#Pu '''Leothang Haokip''', Chief of Goboh
#Pu '''Mangkho-on Haokip''', Chief of Tingkai
#Pu '''Heljason Haokip''', Chief of Loibol
#Pu '''Onpilen Haokip''', Chief of Joupi
#Pu '''Onpilal Haokip''', Chief of Santing
#Pu '''Jamkhokhup''', Chief of Boljang
#Pu '''Nguljahen Haokip''' of Boljang

The Thadous chiefs appointed Khupkhotintong Haokip as Field Commander of the war. Khotinthang Sitlhou (Kilkhong), the Chief of Jampi killed one Mithun to entertain the chiefs and "Sajam" was distributed to all the chiefs. Thus, a powerful conspiracy of the Thadou chiefs was established. And the '''Singson''' chief cut off the tail of a mithun as a mark of declaration of war against the British government on behalf of his clan. In Manipur, the rebellion spread like wild-fire, particularly in the Thadou inhabited areas – Jampi, Dulen, Sangnao, Khauchangbung and Laijang in the west; Chasat and Maokot in the east; Mombi and Lonza in the south-east and Henglep and Loikhai/Ukha in the southwest.

After many months of aggressive fight between the tenacious Thadou warriors and the mighty British force the Thadou Rebellion finally came to an end on 20 May 1919, with the subjugation of the Thadou by the British Rulers. The colonial authorities recorded the war as 'Kuki Rebellion" however, the Thadou and its cognate tribes called it Thadou gal. Sir Nicholar Beatson Bell, the former Chief Commissioner of Assam, also said that the Anglo-Kuki War, 1917–19 was confined entirely to the Thadous.

===Modern history===
Thadou&lt;ref&gt;Thadous are the single largest tribe in Manipur as per population census 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; has been recognised as [[List of Scheduled Tribes in India|Scheduled Tribe in India]] since 1956. The followings covered under the Amended Vide Govt. of India Ministry of Law Notification Order No. S.R.O. 2477A, dated 29 October 1956, New Delhi, India.

Thadou subgroups (clans) are as follows.

==Marriage==
There are four forms of marriages among the Thadou: ''chongmou, sahapsat, jol-lhah','kijam mang''. The latter two, sahapsat, jol-lhah', are non-ceremonial betrothal forms akin to elopement. The first of these forms involves the following elements.

#The negotiation of a bride-price between the parents of the groom and the parents of the bride (however one must note that the concept of 'bride price' mentioned here is very different from the Hindu concept of the 'dowry system')
#The establishment of a date for the departure of the bride from her parents' house to that of her husband
#The sending (by the groom) of strong young men to bring the bride to her new home; ceremonial feasting and wrestling then followed
#The triumphant return of the groom's representatives with the bride

The 'sahapsat' marriage form contains only the marital negotiations between families. The "jol-lhah" marriage is resorted to in the case of a pregnancy resulting from premarital relationships. In this case, a bride-price is usually agreed upon before the cohabitation process, which begins  immediately when the pregnancy is discovered.  The "kijam mang" is a marital arrangement that results from the union of two parties Without the consent of the parents of either bride, groom, or both by eloping. The bride-price is settled at some point after the union takes place. Post-marital residence is patrilocal . Inheritance is exclusively through the male line, i.e., eldest son. Thadou women are the chief agents of socialisation among the Thadou society. Children are permitted a great degree of independence once they learn to walk. Little structured education is provided by the parents, thereby leaving the Thadou child to learn through experiential means.

==Literature==
Dr. G.C. Crozier along with his wife Mrs M.B. Crozier and [[Pu Ngulhao Thomsong]] worked in full co-operation to translate the Bible especially in Thadou after obtaining permission from the British and Foreign Bible Society. Pu Ngulhao earlier works included, 1) Pathen La- 1922 2) Thukidong leh Kidonbut – 1924 3)Pathen Thu – 1925 4) [[John the Apostle|John]] Sut Kipana Thupha- 1925 5) Lung Phatvet- 1930, 6) [[Epistle to the Romans|Rome]] Mite Henga [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] Lekha Thot – 1933.

The first edition of "Lekha bul:Thadou Kuki first primer" was written by Pu Ngulhao Thomsong in 1927

Pu Longkhobel Kilong (1922) and was another native scholar of this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">The '''Tokitsukaze stable hazing scandal''' occurred in Japan on June 26, 2007, when {{nihongo|'''Takashi Saito'''|斉藤 俊|''Saitō Takashi''}}, a seventeen-year-old junior [[sumo wrestler]] who fought under the ''[[shikona]]'' of '''Tokitaizan''', collapsed and died after a training session at [[Tokitsukaze stable]]'s lodgings in [[Inuyama]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It emerged that he was beaten with a [[beer bottle]] and a metal [[baseball bat]] at the direction of his trainer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/09/AR2008030901742.html Brutal Beating Death Brings Sumo's Dark Side to Light], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Saito's cause of death had been reported as [[heart failure]], but his father insisted on an [[autopsy]], which revealed the abuse.

Saito's stable master, [[Futatsuryū Jun'ichi|Jun'ichi Yamamoto]], admitted to beating the 17-year-old novice, who had only been in sumo for three months, and ordering other sumo wrestlers to beat him, due to Saito's "vague attitude" towards the sport. It was also reported that Saito had run away from the stable on a number of occasions. Yamamoto was expelled by the [[Japan Sumo Association]]. Yamamoto and three wrestlers from the stable were arrested in February 2008 and were charged with [[manslaughter]]. In May [[2009 in sumo|2009]] Yamamoto was sentenced to six years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former stable master gets six years for young wrestler's hazing death|publisher=[[Japan Times]]|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090530a3.html|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident brought substantial political pressure to the governance of the sport in Japan.

Partly as a result of the Saito case, the [[Diet of Japan]] drafted a law promoting cause-of-death investigations which was enacted in 2012.&lt;ref name="shimbun180123"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201801230003.html|title=Police heighten forensics after botching death of sumo wrestler|date=23 January 2018|publisher=''Asahi Shimbun''|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate law in 2013 gave discretion to local police chiefs to allow autopsies even in cases where there were apparently few signs of foul play.&lt;ref name="shimbun180123"/&gt;

'''''Unsung: A History of Women in American Music''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Christina Ammer]] about the subject of [[women in music]] and was first published in 1980 with a second edition published in 2001. The book covers approximately 200 years of  [[United States|American]] women's involvement in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010122/30891-spring-2001-book-list.html|title = Spring 2001 Book List|last = Riippa|first = Laurele|date = 22 January 2001|journal = Publishers Weekly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|volume = 247|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unsung'' has become a "standard text" for the subject of American women in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/music_and_letters/v087/87.1garnett.html|title = New Historical Anthology of Music by Women|last = Garnett|first = Liz|date = 2006|journal = Music &amp; Letters|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|subscription = yes|via = Project MUSE|volume = 87|issue = 1|pages = 167–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unsung'' covers many aspects of women in music with the exception of singers, due to the author's assertion that they do not experience the same level of [[Sexism|gender discrimination]] as other endeavors women pursue in music, such as [[conducting]] or composing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Unsung''  discusses this sexism that many women face during their musical careers, especially in the world of [[classical music]] and [[academia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=hft&amp;AN=510077034&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Gendering Musical Modernism|last = Thomson|first = Andrew|date = 15 October 2001|journal = Musical Times|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|pages = 62–63|volume = 142|issue = 1876|via = EBSCO|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First edition ==
Ammer wrote the first edition of ''Unsung'' because there was a lack of material about women in music at the time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When ''Unsung'' was first published in 1980 it was considered "a pioneering volume at a time when women in music was a fledgling area located at the margins of [[musicology]]," according to ''[[Music &amp; Letters]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=7307004&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Unsung (Book)|last = Citron|first = Marcia|date = August 2002|journal = Music &amp; Letters|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|volume = 83|issue = 3|via = EBSCO|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the first edition of ''Unsung'' bring attention to women's roles in music, but also helped music from the [[United States]] gain "scholarly legitimacy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Library Journal]]'' praised the first addition for its accessible prose and for the information about living composers "available nowhere else."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=5747451&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Unsung (Book Review)|last = Newlin|first = Dika|date = April 1980|journal = Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|page = 860|volume = 105|issue = 7|subscription = yes|via = EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second edition ==
The second edition contains much of the same work as the original, with the additions of women's contributions to [[jazz]] and [[popular music]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other changes include the additions of women involved in [[electronic music]], music for film, [[performance art]], and "international fusion."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=4086052&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Unsung (Book Review)|last = Dopp|first = Bonnie Jo|date = 15 February 2001|journal = Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 January 2016|volume = 126|issue = 3|page = 169|via = EBSCO|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
''Library Journal'' felt that the title was somewhat negative, saying that "many of these fine musicians have been widely acclaimed."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The roles of '''women in Indonesia''' today are being affected by many factors, including increased modernisation, globalisation, improved education and advances in technology. Many [[Indonesia]]n women choose to reside in cities instead of staying in townships to perform agricultural work because of personal, professional, and family-related necessities, and economic requirements. These women are moving away from the traditional dictates of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], wherein women act simply and solely as wives and mothers. At present, the women of Indonesia are also venturing actively into the realm of national development, and working as active members of [[List of women's organizations|organisations]] that focus and act on [[feminism|women's issues]] and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ingham |first=Xylia |url=http://www.acicis.murdoch.edu.au/hi/women.html |title=Career Women in Indonesia: Obstacles Faced, and Prospects for Change |publisher=Australian Consortium for 'In-Country' Indonesian Studies|year=2005 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TWNS/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of [[Majapahit]], portrayed as [[Parvati]].]]
In Indonesian society, women performed vital roles both within and outside the family. In rural [[Native Indonesian|native]] society, certain positions, such as ''dukun beranak'' (traditional [[midwife]]), [[Traditional medicine|traditional healer]], ritualist, and [[Shamanism|shaman]], are often held by women. Despite their roles seeming to being reduced, if not rather confined, after the adoption of somewhat [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] cultures of [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hinduism]], [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhism]], [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]], and [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christianity]], women still hold important positions, especially within families.

In [[Balinese people|Balinese]] society, women traditionally play important roles, especially concerning family and economic life. Despite traditional values that hold Balinese women responsible for fostering balance and harmony within families and producing high-quality offspring, in a fast changing society, their economic role has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Balinese Women in a Changing Society
| author = Luh Ketut Suryani | url = http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jaap.32.1.213.28335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for Balinese women to pursue economic activities outside of their household; thus, Balinese traditional marketplaces are filled with women running businesses.

The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabaus]] are known as one of the few traditional societies that apply [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] and [[matrilineal]] culture, where property and family names are inherited from mother to daughter, and husbands are considered as "guests" in their wives' household.&lt;ref name="BBC-Minangkabau"&gt;{{cite news | title = World’s largest matrilineal society | author = Rathina Sankari | date = 22 September 2016 | work = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160916-worlds-largest-matrilineal-society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minangkabau culture also recognizes a prominent historic female figure, [[Dara Jingga|Bundo Kanduang]], the matriarch of Minangkabau society. Today, Bundo Kanduang refers to the traditional institution consisting of female elders revered in [[adat]] (tradition) of Minangkabau society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Perempuan Minangkabau | newspaper = Harian Haluan | date = 23 January 2016 | url = http://harianhaluan.com/news/detail/47622/perempuan-minangkabau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], there are records of some prominent women that held and exercised considerable power and influences within their society, despite usually reserved only for elite ruling class. Among others are [[Shima (queen)|Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga Kingdom]] (c. 7th century), [[Pramodhawardhani]] of [[Medang Kingdom]] (c. 9th century), [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]] of Medang [[Isyana dynasty]] (c. 10th century), [[Mahendradatta]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] (c. 10th century), [[Ken Dedes]] of [[Singhasari]] (c. 13th century), also queens of [[Majapahit]] (c. 13th-15th century); [[Gayatri Rajapatni]], [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]] and [[Suhita]]. Later after the coming of Islam in Java, [[Ratu Kalinyamat]] of Jepara also a notable female leader. [[Aceh Sultanate|Sultanate of Aceh]] also recorded several [[Sultana (title)|sultanahs]] ever ruled the Aceh sultanate. Indonesian Republic recognized several historic [[National Hero of Indonesia|national heroines]] that fought against Dutch colonialism; among others are [[Nyi Ageng Serang]], [[Martha Christina Tiahahu]], [[Cut Nyak Dhien]] and [[Cut Nyak Meutia]].

The [[Women's rights|women's emancipation]] movement was started in late 19th century colonial [[Dutch East Indies]], when a handful of upperclass native woman advocated for women's rights and education for women. These women's right pioneers are [[Kartini]] of Jepara and [[Dewi Sartika]] of Bandung, both of them established school for girls, and has been recognized as the national heroine of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Women in Indonesia"&gt;{{cite book | title = Women in Indonesia: Gender, Equity and Development, Volume 8 dari Indonesia assessment series | author1 = Kathryn May Robinson | author2= Sharon Bessell | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789812301581 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jUOYUTPXkhwC&amp;dq=Women+in+Indonesia&amp;hl=id&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=5}}

[[Women's suffrage]] was never an issue in Indonesia, since [[Indonesian legislative election, 1955|its first election in 1955]] Indonesia held that women has equal rights with men in politics, although in practice politics is still a male-dominated realm. In 2001, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]—then serving as Vice President—became the first female president of Indonesia after the removal of President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]].&lt;ref name="Women in Indonesia"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}}

== Women's rights ==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
Indonesia signed the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] in 1980 and ratified it in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4517841/The_Implementation_of_CEDAW_Related_to_Women_s_Quota_in_Indonesian_Parliament|title=The Implementation of CEDAW Related to Women’s Quota in Indonesian Parliament|last=Zahra|first=Tri Inaya|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National law and sharia ===
The Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women noted that more regulations that discriminate against women are being adopted throughout the country than are being repealed.
&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/indonesia-commission-finds-many-laws-that-discriminate-against-women/|title=Indonesia: Commission Finds Many Laws that Discriminate Against Women |work= Global Legal Monitor|date=19 September 2012|publisher=Library of Congress}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the Commission noted 282 bylaws in various jurisdictions across Indonesia that it deemed discriminatory, compared with 154 such instruments in 2009.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;
There are 96 that impose criminal sanctions on women through regulations on prostitution and pornography, 60 that contain dress codes and religious standards, and 38 that place restrictions on women’s mobility.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; Although such bylaws can be found in 28 Indonesian provinces, the six provinces in which they are largely concentrated are East Java, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, West Java, West Nusa Tenggara, and West Sumatra.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;

In many parts of Indonesia, local laws compelling women and girls to wear the [[hijab]] are increasingly in place in schools, government offices and public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/11/indonesia-women-srightsvirginitytestsfemalepoliceofficers.html|title=OPINION: Indonesian women’s rights under siege|last=Harsono|first=Andreas|work=Al Jazeera America|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual crime and harassment ===
More than 90 percent of [[rape]] cases in Indonesia go unreported, victims fear being blamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20160725143529-udc98|title=Over 90 percent rape cases go unreported in Indonesia - poll|author=Beh Lih Yi|editor-last=Whiting|editor-first=Alex|date=25 July 2016|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women-only transport ====
[[File:KRL Jabotabek 8500 Gambir 20111126.JPG|thumb|right|A women-only car at the front of a KRL Jabotabek commuter train]]
An Indonesian railway company, ''[[Kereta Api Indonesia|PT Kereta Api]]'', introduced [[Women-only passenger car|women-only carriages]] on some [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek|KRL Jabotabek]] commuter trains in the [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]] from August 2010 in response to many reports of sexual harassment in public places, including commuter trains and buses.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/indonesia-railway-company-launches-women-only-carriages/391784|title=Indonesia Railway Company Launches Women-Only Carriages|author=|date=|website=thejakartaglobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women-only carriages on commuter trains are usually denoted by large pink or purple stickers, which read "''Kereta Khusus Wanita''", and are located at each end of the train. This kind of carriage was previously only able to be found on air-conditioned EMUs, but a number of recently repaired non-air conditioned EMUs have also been equipped with the women-only carriage stickers.

Recently, ''PT Kereta Api'' launched a special women-only train (the train itself uses an ex-[[Tokyo Metro 6000 series]] EMU, set number 6107F), which intended as further protection for female passengers from sexual harassment. To give difference from standard EMUs (which only provides women-only carriages on each end of the train), the women-only train had all of its cars decorated with large "''Kereta Khusus Wanita''" stickers coloured purple or pink. Since 1 October 2012, ''PT Kereta Api Indonesia'' (Persero) Commuter Jabodetabek launch the women-only trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charleskkb.blogspot.com/2012/10/operasi-perdana-rangkaian-khusus-wanita.html|title=ジャボデタベク電気鉄道センター: Operasi Perdana Rangkaian Khusus Wanita - 女性専用編成最初運転|first=Charles|last=Yulianto|date=1 October 2012|website=charleskkb.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice ended in May 2013 after reports found that mixed-use cars were overcrowded during rush hour while women's only cars were underutilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/542689/indonesian-women-only-trains-are-scrapped.html|title=What Real Women Think Of Women-Only Train Carriages|author=|date=24 August 2017|website=marieclaire.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and family life ==
[[File:Minangkabau wedding 2.jpg|thumb|right|Minangkabau wedding, the [[Minangkabau people|Minangs]] are one of the few ethnic groups that practice [[matrilineality]].]]
[[Dowry]] is seldom to never practiced in [[Indonesian culture]], yet [[bride price]] is practiced by certain ethnic groups. For example, the ''uang panai'' bride price in [[Bugis]] culture. The more prominent the education, career, beauty, social and economic strata, or noble background of the bride, the more expensive the ''uang panai'' should be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = "Uang Panai", Tanda Penghargaan untuk Meminang Gadis Bugis-Makassar | author = Hendra Cipto | work = Kompas.com | date = 13 March 2017 | url = http://regional.kompas.com/read/2017/03/13/08532951/.uang.panai.tanda.penghargaan.untuk.meminang.gadis.bugis-makassar | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Minangkabau matrilineal culture, the payment of the bride price—or more correctly addressed as the "groom price", is given to the groom's parents, as the husband is entering his newly wed wife's household. The more prominent the education and career of the groom, the more expensive the groom price should be paid. The custom is called ''bajapuik'' or ''uang japuik'', although historically a widespread practice in Minangkabau land, today only people of [[Padang Pariaman Regency|Pariaman]] that persistently practice this custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Uang Japuik, Tradisi Unik 'Beli' Laki-laki dari Ranah Minang | work = Otonomi.co.id | language = Indonesian | url = https://www.otonomi.co.id/ragam/uang-japuik-tradisi-unik-beli-laki-laki-dari-ranah-minang-1701170.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more commonly prevailing national culture is the ''mas kawin'' (lit. "marriage gold") or ''mahar'' which refer to a gift provided by the groom to be given to the bride. It may contain a sum of money or gold, sometimes because of the adoption of Islamic culture, also include or replaced by symbolic religious items such as ''seperangkat alat sholat'' (Islamic praying equipment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 26 July 2011 | title = Mahar dengan Seperangkat Alat Sholat | newspaper = Republika | url = http://www.republika.co.id/berita/konsultasi/ustadz-menjawab/11/07/26/lox8ko-mahar-dengan-seperangkat-alat-sholat | language = Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pregnant women in Indonesia do not have the financial capability to pay for hospital deliveries and [[Childbirth|birthing]] by [[Caesarean section]], because of disproportionate salaries and medical expenses. Thus, these women require the support and assistance of "[[home birth|birth]] sanctuaries" that provide "free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid", such as the ''Yayasan Bumi Sehat'' (Healthy Mother Earth Foundation) health clinics established by [[Robin Lim]], an American midwife, in 2003. Such 24-hour nativity havens, mostly located in [[Bali]] and [[Aceh]], help Indonesian women to escape the common practice of private hospitals in Indonesia that entails detaining newborn infants until medical bills are fully remunerated by the birth mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruffins|first=Ebonne|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/10/cnnheroes.lim.midwife/index.html |title=CNN Heroes: 'Mother Robin' delivers for poor women in Indonesia |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=10 March 2011 |access-date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the economy now seems to be improving (high GDP growth in 2012 as high as 6.2%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia|title=Indonesia|author=|date=|website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some programs had been done by the government to help promote the health and welfare of women and child. A ministry that especially concerns in the field had been established for a long time since the regime of the late President [[Suharto]] during the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indonesia.go.id/in/kementerian/kementerian/kementerian-negara-pemberdayaan-perempuan-dan-perlindungan-anak/1647-profile/274-kementerian-pemberdayaan-perempuan-dan-perlindungan-anak&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
[[File:Ubud Bali Indonesia The Market.jpg|thumb|In a traditional market, women commonly run businesses.]]
In Indonesian culture, it is a social norm for husbands to economically provides for his wife and the whole family. Which means husband's earnings is expected to be given to the wife monthly and to be managed by her for family spending and savings. However, it is normal for women to pursue economic activity. For example, ''[[warung]]'', a small scale family-owned store, is often run equally by men or women. In most parts of the country, Indonesian women traditionally enjoyed a degree of social and economic freedom. To support their family's economy, Indonesian women are involved in economic activities outside of their households, although mostly informal small-scale business. It is common to find women run businesses in traditional Indonesian marketplaces.

After a surge of foreign [[Multinational corporation|multinational investors]] began investing in Indonesia during the 1970s, many Indonesian women became the "prime workforce" and a source of [[Sweatshop|cheap labourers]] in manufacturing businesses.&lt;ref name=TWNS&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahmad |first=Abdul Razak |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/abdul-cn.htm |title=Redefining the role of women in Indonesia|date=29 December 1998 |work=[[New Straits Times]] |publisher=Third World Network |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some women in Indonesia, including adolescents and the homeless, resorted to engage in employment as [[sex worker]]s and [[maid|housemaids]] due to financial hardship. Some of the women who were forced into such work [[Indonesian migrant worker|opted to go abroad]], into countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. Some have since become victims of torture, sexual abuse, murder, illegal detention, rape, sodomy, and other forms of sexual assault. Health-wise, as a consequence of becoming prostituted by human traffickers, some have contracted [[HIV/AIDS]] and other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook/Indonesia.php |title=Indonesia |publisher=Coalition Against Trafficking in Women |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More and more women are becoming scholars. The ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary schools is also even as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (%)  |url=http://data.worldbank.org|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More scholarships awarded by the Indonesian government (and some other institutions other than the government) were given to women, and resulted in higher achievement in their later life.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In most major cities like Jakarta and Surabaya, the educated female workforce tends to postpone the marital age and girls who finish secondary school are six times less likely to marry early.&lt;ref name="Bachelet"/&gt;

Indonesian women could be making considerable shifts to national employment - women currently hold 33% of non-agricultural employment as they also work in the prestigious and traditionally male-dominated field such as architecture, medicine, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Share of women employed in the nonagricultural sector (% of total nonagricultural employment)|url=http://data.worldbank.org|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian women has pursued various line of works and some has excel in their career.

'''World Climate Report''', a newsletter edited by [[Patrick Michaels]], was produced by the [[Greening Earth Society]], a non-profit organization created by the [[Western Fuels Association]].

Early editions were paper based; it was then transferred to a web-only format, having ceased publication as a physically based report with Volume 8 in 2002. It continues to exist in [[blog]] form at &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.worldclimatereport.com www.worldclimatereport.com]&lt;/span&gt;, although the website itself has not been updated since late 2012.

World Climate Report presents a scientific skeptical view of populist [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]-driven mass global climate change, or as it describes, '[[Global Warming Alarmism]]'. However, it does not reject the concepts of global climate change or [[greenhouse effect|greenhouse theory]] (or other well-established and widely accepted scientific theories or empirical studies),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= World Climate Report |title= Methane Matters |url= http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2007/04/13/methane-matters/ |work= World Climate Report |date= April 13, 2007 |accessdate= 2007-05-03 |quote= "There is no doubt that fossil fuel burning around the world is causing an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) concentration, and {{CO2}} remains the number one anthropo-generated greenhouse gas." [and] "[M]ethane is far more powerful as a greenhouse gas than {{CO2}} – the same mass of [[methane]] would warm the earth 23 times more than the same mass of {{CO2}}."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= World Climate Report |title= Global Warming: Something New Under the Sun? |url= http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2005/05/10/global-warming-something-new-under-the-sun/ |work= World Climate Report |date= May 10, 2005 |accessdate= 2007-05-09 |quote= "Before you kill the greenhouse effect, please note that we think this is a lot of hooey. But if you accept these results, that’s where you have to go." [and] "That’s our take, because it’s the only one that seems internally consistent. But, if somehow we are wrong (a rare event), then greenhouse warming is over, as the sensitivity of the earth’s temperature to carbon dioxide has been grossly overestimated. Believe us, we’d like to hope the latter is correct, but we have to call things in the most logical fashion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; in general attempting to engender itself as giving a well balanced and scientific view of the sources (though often at a contrary expense of its perceived adversaries: the aforementioned alleged 'Global Warming Alarmists').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Patrick  |last= Michaels |title= New Climate for Global Energy Policy |url= http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=7501 |work= [[Cato Institute]] Opinion &amp; Commentary |date= February 6, 2007 |accessdate= 2007-05-03 |quote= In summary, what's not new in today's IPCC report – that humans are warming the planet – will be treated as big news, while what is new – that sea levels are not likely to rise as much as previously predicted – will be ignored, at least by everyone except the extremist fringe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WCR says of itself:

: ''World Climate Report, a concise, hard-hitting and scientifically correct response to the global change reports which gain attention in the literature and popular press. As the nation's leading publication in this realm, World Climate Report is exhaustively researched, impeccably referenced, and always timely. This popular biweekly newsletter points out the weaknesses and outright fallacies in the science that is being touted as "proof" of disastrous warming. It's the perfect antidote against those who argue for proposed changes to the [[Rio Climate Treaty]], such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which are aimed at limiting carbon emissions from the [[United States]] ... World Climate Report has become the definitive and unimpeachable source for what ''nature'' now calls the “mainstream skeptic” point of view.''

In addition to Patrick Michaels (chief editor), the staff is listed as [[Robert Balling|Robert C. Balling, Jr]] (contributing editor), [[Robert E. Davis (climatologist)|Robert Davis]] (contributing editor), and [[Paul Knappenberger]] (Administrator).

[[New Hope Environmental Services]], an advocacy science consulting firm, claims WCR as its biweekly newsletter.
