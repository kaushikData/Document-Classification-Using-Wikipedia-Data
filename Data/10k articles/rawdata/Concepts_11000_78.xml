[[Image:Manifest I of De Stijl.JPG|thumb|300 px|[[De Stijl]] manifesto, 1918]]
An '''art manifesto''' is a public declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of an artist or artistic movement. [[Manifesto]]s are a standard feature of the various movements in the [[modernist]] avant-garde and are still written today. Art manifestos are sometimes in their rhetoric intended for shock value, to achieve a revolutionary effect. They often address wider issues, such as the political system. Typical themes are the need for revolution, freedom (of expression) and the implied or overtly stated superiority of the writers over the status quo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The manifesto gives a means of expressing, publicising and recording ideas for the artist or art group—even if only one or two people write the words, it is mostly still attributed to the group name.

In 1855 [[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition. And in 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]].

The first art manifesto of the 20th century was introduced with the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]] in Italy in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |title=Back to the Futurists |first=Lawrence |last=Pollard |newspaper=News.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Dada]]ists and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]: the period up to World War II created what are still the best known manifestos. Although they never stopped being issued, other media such as the growth of broadcasting tended to sideline such declarations. Due to the internet there has been a resurgence of the form, and many new manifestos are now appearing to a potential worldwide audience. The [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] have made particular use of this to start a worldwide movement of affiliated groups.

Manifestos typically consist of a number of statements, which are numbered or in bullet points and which do not necessarily follow logically from one to the next. [[Tristan Tzara]]'s explanation of the manifesto (''Feeble Love &amp; Bitter Love, II'') captures the spirit of many:
{{cquote|A manifesto is a communication made to the whole world, whose only pretension is to the discovery of an instant cure for political, astronomical, artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis. It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's strong, vigorous and logical. Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable.}}

==Concept==
Before the early 20th century, the manifesto was almost exclusively a declaration with political aims. The intention of artists adopting the form, therefore, is to indicate that they are employing art as a political tool.

The art manifesto has two main goals. The first is to define and criticize a paradigm in contemporary art or culture; the second is to define a set of aesthetic values to counter this paradigm. Often, manifestos aspire to be works of art in their own right; for instance, many manifesto writers intend for their texts to be performed. Other manifestos cannot be fully appreciated simply as written statements because they rely heavily on graphic design for communication, a common feature in Dada manifestos. Several artists have written manifestos about artistic mediums not their own.

Historically, there has been a strong parallel between the art manifesto and the political manifesto. It was not uncommon for manifesto writers of the early 20th century to also be politically active. In Italy, Futurist founder Filippo Tomasso Marinetti ran for office, and both Russian and Italian Futurists issued political manifestos. In England, Vorticist Wyndham Lewis supported the Suffragettes, while in France, Surrealist André Breton supported the Communist party. Often however, these political organizations rejected the artists’ attention; in other cases, artists were censored and persecuted by European authoritarian governments, like Fascist Italy and Communist Russia, which institutionally rejected the avant-garde.

==Pre-1900==

===Realist Manifesto 1855===
[[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition, 1855, echoing the tone of the period's political manifestos. In it he asserts his goal as an artist "to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my epoch according to my own estimation."&lt;ref name="Realist Manifesto"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm The Metropolitan Museum of Art, ''Nineteenth–Century French Realism'', Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027081619/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |date=October 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html Musée d'Orsay, Courbet speaks, ''Exhibition and sale of forty paintings and four drawings by Gustave Courbet, Paris 1855''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801012842/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html |date=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist Manifesto 1886===
In 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]]. It defined and characterized [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as a style whose "goal was not the ideal, but whose sole purpose was to express itself for the sake of being expressed." It names [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Paul Verlaine]] as the three leading poets of the movement.&lt;ref name="Symbolist Manifesto"&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 54. {{ISBN|0500201250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seminal 1909–45==

===Futurist Manifesto 1909, 1914===
{{main article|Futurist Manifesto}}
The Futurist Manifesto, written by the [[Italy|Italian]] poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], was published in the Italian newspaper ''Gazzetta dell'Emilia'' in [[Bologna]] on February 5, 1909, then in French as ''Manifeste du futurisme'' in the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on February 20, 1909. It initiated an artistic [[philosophy]], [[Futurism]], that was a rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry; it  was also an advocation of the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of [[Italy]].

Since the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, the Futurists attempted to create one in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft|title=I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti [et al.]|first=Filippo Tommaso|last=Marinetti|publisher=[Firenze Lacerba]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting and sculpture. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubist Manifesto 1912===
{{main article|Du "Cubisme"}}
[[File:Du "Cubisme", 1912, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Eugène Figuière Editeurs (cover).jpg|thumb|Du "Cubisme", 1912, [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière Éditeurs]] (cover)]]
Du "Cubisme", written in 1912 by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], was the first major theoretical text on [[Cubism]]. The book was illustrated with works by Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]. In this highly influential treatise Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] were used to convey a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] sense of fluidity of consciousness.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent |date=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Du "Cubisme"]] introduced the concept of 'simultaneity' into the theoretical framework of Cubism. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on the authors understanding of [[Henri Poincaré]] and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. It was based both on philosophical and scientific ideas, on [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in the widely available publication, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Concrete Manifesto 1959===
Neo-Concrete Manifesto, by [[Ferreira Gullar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420213302/http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2 |date=April 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; begins:
:We use the term "neo-concrete" to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative "geometric" art (neo-plasticism, constructivism, suprematism, the school of Ulm) and particularly the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously acute rationalism. In the light of their artistic experience, the painters, sculptors, engravers and writers participating in this first Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to evaluate the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains."

===Manifesto of Industrial Painting 1959===
"Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art", written by [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html |title=Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio |publisher=Notbored.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1959, was originally published in Italian in ''Notizie Arti Figurative'' No. 9 (1959). Shortly afterwards it was published in ''Internationale Situationniste no.3'' in a French translation. It was translated into English in 1997 by Molly Klein. It has only 70 points and is written a grand utopian rhetorical manner, with statements such as, "A new, ravenous force of domination will push men toward an unimaginable epic poetry." One of its themes is the reconciliation of industry and nature:
:The return to nature with modern instrumentation will allow man, after thousands of centuries, to return to the places where Paleolithic hunters overcame great fear; modern man will seek to abandon his own, accumulated in the idiocy of progress, on contact with humble things, which nature in her wisdom has conserved as a check on the immense arrogance of the human mind.

==Counterculture 1960–75==
Manifestos in the 1960s reflected the changing social and political attitudes of the times: the general ferment of "[[counterculture]]" revolution to overthrow the existing order and the particular rise of [[feminism]] and [[Black Power]], as well as the pioneering of new art forms such as [[body art]] and [[performance art]].

===Situationist Manifesto 1960===
The [[Situationist International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/manifesto.html |title=Situationist International Online |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |date=May 17, 1960 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded at Cosio d’Arroscia April 27, 1957 by eight members, who wanted a revolutionary art with a state of constant transformation, and hence newness, as well as abolishing the gap between art and life. The manifesto espousing this was issued May 17, 1960 and reprinted in ''Internationale Situationniste'' number 4 in June 1960. It advocated the "new human force" against technology and the "dissatisfaction of its possible uses in our senseless social life", stating "We will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the crafts. The role of amateur-professional situationist—of anti-specialist—is again a specialization up to the point of economic and mental abundance, when everyone becomes an 'artist'". Its final sentence is: "Such are our goals, and these will be the future goals of humanity."

===The Chelsea Hotel Manifesto 1961===
[[Image:HotelChelsea.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]]]]
This manifesto, written by [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Yves|title=The Chelsea Hotel Manifesto|url=http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/chelsea_us.html|work=Yves Klein Archives|accessdate=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115221051/http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/chelsea_us.html|archive-date=January 15, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been copyrighted since 1989 by the [[Gagosian Gallery]]. It begins with the prompts for the later statements in the manifesto, the first line being, "Due to the fact that I have painted monochromes for fifteen years". It is a meditation by the artist about his work and life:
:An artist always feels uneasy when called upon to speak of his own work. It should speak for itself, particularly when it is valid.
:What can I do? Stop now?
:No, what I call "the indefinable pictorial sensibility" absolutely escapes this very personal solution.
:So...
He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriates]] the sky:
:Once, in 1946, while still an adolescent, I was to sign my name on the other side of the sky during a fantastic "realistico-imaginary" journey. That day, as I lay stretched upon the beach of Nice, I began to feel hatred for birds which flew back and forth across my blue, cloudless sky, because they tried to bore holes in my greatest and most beautiful work.
:Birds must be eliminated.
He ends with an affirmation that he is "ready to dive into the void".

===I Am For An Art... Manifesto, 1961===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], a Pop artist, reacting against [[Abstract Expressionism]], along with other young artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oldenburg|first=Claes|title=Claes Oldenburg: I am for an Art|url=http://artiststatements.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/claes-oldenburg-i-am-for-an-art/|work=Artist Statements|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto ‘I am for an Art’ was originally made to be included in the catalogue of the 'Environments, Situations and Spaces’ exhibition.

&lt;br /&gt;"I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum.&lt;br /&gt;I am for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all, an art given the chance of having a starting 
point of zero... "&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, C. and Wood, P. (2006) ''Art in Theory, 1900-2000: an Anthology of Changing Ideas.'' 2 ed. USA: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus Manifesto 1963===
Written by [[George Maciunas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas-manifesto.html |title=Manifesto |publisher=Artnotart.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this short hand-printed document consists of three paragraphs interspersed with [[collage]] elements from dictionary definitions related to "flux". It is written in lower case, with upper case for certain key phrases, some underlined. Its first paragraph is:
:Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, — purge the world of "Europanism"!
It advocates revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals."

===[[SCUM Manifesto]] 1967===
SCUM, by [[Valerie Solanas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solanas|first=Valerie|title=The SCUM Manifesto|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/rants/scum.html|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an acronym for the "Society for Cutting up Men" and the manifesto was not specifically about art. However, it has become part of art history, because it was published in 1968, the same year that Solanas, who had spent time in [[Andy Warhol]]'s "Factory", shot and nearly killed him. It also has sections that address art ideas. Solanas spent her last years as a street prostitute and died in 1988.

It is a document of just over 11,000 words. Its tone and basic theme are evident from the title, but it is not quite as clear cut as it seems and some women are admitted to be as bad as men (women artists, for example). SCUM wants to "destroy all useless and harmful objects — cars, store windows, "Great Art", etc." In a section on "'Great Art' and 'Culture'" it states:
:The male 'artist' attempts to solve his dilemma of not being able to live, of not being female, by constructing a highly artificial world in which the male is heroized, that is, displays female traits, and the female is reduced to highly limited, insipid subordinate roles, that is, to being male.
:The male 'artistic' aim being, not to communicate (having nothing inside him he has nothing to say), but to disguise his animalism, he resorts to symbolism and obscurity ('deep' stuff). The vast majority of people, particularly the 'educated' ones, lacking faith in their own judgment, humble, respectful of authority ('Daddy knows best'), are easily conned into believing that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, ambiguity and boredom are marks of depth and brilliance ...
:Absorbing 'culture' is a desperate, frantic attempt to groove in an ungroovy world, to escape the horror of a sterile, mindless, existence. `Culture' provides a sop to the egos of the incompetent, a means of rationalizing passive spectating; they can pride themselves on their ability to appreciate the `finer' things, to see a jewel where this is only a turd (they want to be admired for admiring).

===Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969===
The full title of the manifesto is "Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition"; it is considered a seminal document of feminist art. [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] was pregnant at the time, and decided to reinterpret household chores by becoming a "maintenance artist", where she would "perform" them. Through this such "maintenance" revealed itself as an important condition for freedom and social functioning and she extended the idea beyond feminism to projects like the 11 month ''Touch Sanitation'', involving 8,500 New York workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |title=Touch Sanitation |first=Robert C. |last=Morgan |publisher=Communityarts.net |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308031259/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |archivedate=March 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently she has addressed a landfill site on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |title=Learning from Landfill |first=Daniel |last=Belasco |work=Jewish Culture News |date=Spring 2001 |accessdate=April 7, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220154152/http://www.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto was followed by a questionnaire (1973–76) and was concerned with making art of what would normally be seen as routine, mundane chores. She wrote, "After the revolution, who is going to pick up the garbage on Monday morning?". She followed this up with a "Sanitation Manifesto!" (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.schroederromero.com/press/nyt1002.html |title=Power and Glory in Sisterhood |first=Edward M. |last=Gomez |work=New York Times |date=October 13, 2002 |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |publisher=schroederromero.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maintenance Manifesto stated:

:Maintenance is a drag; it takes all the fucking time (lit.) The mind boggles and chafes at the boredom. The culture confers lousy status on maintenance jobs--minimum wages, housewives — no pay. Clean your desk, wash the dishes, clean the floor, wash your clothes, wash your toes, change the baby's diaper, finish the report, correct the typos, mend the fence, keep the customer happy, throw out the stinking garbage, watch out don't put things in your nose, what shall I wear, I have no sox, pay your bills, don't litter, save string, wash your hair, change the sheets, go to the store, I'm out of perfume, say it again — he doesn't understand, seal it again — it leaks, go to work, this art is dusty, clear the table, call him again, flush the toilet, stay young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |title=Quotes from Maintenance Art Manifesto |publisher=artgroove.com |date=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426171609/http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |archivedate=April 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AfriCobra Manifesto 1970===
Afri-Cobra was a black artist collective founded in the late 1960s by [[Jeff Donaldson (artist)|Jeff Donaldson]] and based in Chicago. He helped organise international shows of black artists and wrote influential manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |title=African American Art |publisher=artlex.com |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326174351/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |archivedate=March 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AfriCobra is an acronym for "African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists". This was derived from combining the term for Africa with "Cobra", the "Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists". The manifesto stated the groups objectives to be the development of a new African American art, involving social responsibility, community artistic involvement and promotion of pride in Black identity. There were parallels with African American musical innovations, and the advocacy of a complementary aesthetic involving sublime imagery and high-key colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asrc.cornell.edu/blacknessincolor/galleries/galllery7left.html |title=Movements, Groups and Kindred Spirits |publisher= Asrc.cornell.edu |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAR Manifestos early 1970s===
WAR is an acronym for "Women Artists in Revolution" of which [[Nancy Spero]] was a member. Prior to this in 1966–70 she had created a series of anti-[[Vietnam War]] "manifestos" which were images created with water paints and inks on paper. She then attended AWC (Art Workers Coalition) meetings, which had men and women members, and became part of WAR, which was an offshoot. She said, "I loved it. I was so angry at that time about so many things, especially about not being able to get my art out, to get people to look. I thought, "WAR"— that's it. We started to organize some actions and protests and wrote manifestos. For example, a few of us marched into the Museum of Modern Art and demanded equality for women artists. Then, I joined another, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists. It all went very fast in those days."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html The Brooklyn rail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219030742/http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html |date=February 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Art: A Manifesto 1972===
[[Valie Export]] is a Viennese performance artist who worked with the [[Viennese Actionism|Actionists]] and catalogued their events. She did her own confrontational body art, with a philosophy of "Feminist Actionism", inviting people to touch her in the street. She issued "written manifestos predicting with 
vengeance the future of women's art" and "made important theoretical contributions to communicating a personal feminism in performance. She felt that it was important politically to create art. 'I knew that if I did it naked, I would really change how the 
(mostly male) audience would look at me.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etd-submit.etsu.edu/etd/theses/available/etd-1115104-000557/unrestricted/BrandenburgA121504f.pdf |title=Inducing Knowledge by Enduring Experience: The Function of a Postmodern Pragmatic Aesthetic in Linda Montano's Living Art |first=Alisa A. |last=Brandenburg |year=2004 |publisher=Etd-submit.etsu.edu |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512075045/http://etd-submit.etsu.edu/etd/theses/available/etd-1115104-000557/unrestricted/BrandenburgA121504f.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French [[Sociological art]] Collective was founded by [[Fred Forest]], [[Jean-Paul Thénot]] and [[Hervé Fischer]] and had their manifesto published in the newspaper [[Le Monde]].  Its main purpose was using sociology to underpin artistic actions, or using artistic actions to elucidate sociological phenomena.  One such action was the auctioning of a "artistic square meter" in 1976 to spoof the inflation of prices in the housing and art markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/20_en.htm#text |title=Web Net Museum-Fred forest-Retrospective-Sociologic art-Aesthetic of communication-Artworks-Actions-The artistic square meter |publisher=Webnetmuseum.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective made heavy use of mass media and live performance using video, telephones, etc.  The group was dissolved in 1981, though some of its tenets were brought by [[Fred Forest]] and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] with the [[Communication aesthetics]] movement of 1983.&lt;ref name=crono/&gt;

===Body Art Manifesto 1975===
In 1975 [[François Pluchart]] promoted the first [[Body Art]] show at the [[Galerie Stadler]] in Paris, with work from 21 artists, including [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Katharina Sieverding]]. The first Body Art manifesto was published.&lt;ref name=crono/&gt;

=== A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism  1975===
by [[Paul Hartal]]

This is a four-page document illustrated with nine black and white images of the artist's paintings, collages and multimedia, published in Montreal in 1975.
"My art is a painted metaphor; the past machine of a perpetual second, the fossil emotion of an infinite longing, the magic desire evolving on the broken axis of the compressed space, reflected in the form of inner, personal landscapes", writes Hartal in the manifesto. "Art ought to be total", he suggests. "The biotic separated from the geometrical is arbitrary, and ignores the human nature." The idea of  "Lyrical Conceptualism is based on the wholeness of the psychological coordinate", he says. It "derives from the id, ego and superego"; an "art in which the primarily twofold character of the artist's view evolves into a lyrical, intuitive and conceptual triad". In The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science (Lanham: University Press of America, 1988, 341 pp), Hartal discusses in more detail the theory of ''Lyrical Conceptualism'' or ''Lyco art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federationofpoets.com/featurepaulhartal.htm |title=Canadian Federation of Poets Member Feature |publisher=Federationofpoets.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthbys.com/Paul_Hartal.htm |title=Paul Hartal: Love and Cosmos, Lyrical Conceptualism, Contemporary Paintings, Works on Paper |publisher=Arthbys.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicboard.com |title=publicboard.com |publisher=publicboard.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Online |first=Saatchi |url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/yourgallery/artist_profile//11739.html |title=Sell Artwork, Buy Original Paintings, Art Prints, Discover New Artists &amp;#124; Saatchi Online |publisher=Saatchi-gallery.co.uk |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |title=Monkdogz Urban Art/ |publisher=Monkdogz.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206002338/http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arteutile.net/Hartal/Hartal.htm |title=Hartal |publisher=Arteutile.net |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punk and cyber 1976–1998==
The rise of the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement with its basic and aggressive DIY attitude had a significant input into art manifestos, and this is reflected even in the titles. Some of the artists overtly identified with punk through music, publishing or poetry performance. There is also an equivalent "shocking" interpretation of feminism which contradicts the non-objectification advocated in the 1960s. Then the growing presence of the computer age began to assert itself in art proclamations as in society.

===Crude Art Manifesto 1978===
Artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] promoted the Crude Art Manifesto 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/CrudeArtManifesto.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was posted in [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Maidstone Art College]] by Charles Thomson, then a student at the college. 21 years later he co-wrote the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] manifestos with [[Billy Childish]]. Thomson was also a member of the punk-based [[The Medway Poets]]. The manifesto rejects "department store" art and "elitist" gallery art, as well as sophistication and skill which are "easily obtainable ... and are used both industrially and artistically to conceal a poverty of content." The priority is stated to be "the exploration and expression of the human spirit".

===Smile Manifestos 1982===
by [[Stewart Home]]

At this time Stewart Home operated as a one-person movement "Generation Positive", founding a punk band called White Colours and publishing an art fanzine ''Smile'', which mostly contained art manifestos for the "Generation Positive". The rhetoric of these resembled the 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos. His idea was that other bands round the world should also call themselves White Colours and other magazines be titled ''Smile''. The first part of the book ''Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers'' featured abriged versions of his manifesto-style writings from ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|"Stewart Home", Wikipedia]] Retrieved April 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Association of Astronomical Artists Manifesto 1982===
The basic tenet of the IAAA is the depiction of space (as in the cosmos) through realist painting. They disassociate themselves from science fiction and fantasy artists: "a firm foundation of knowledge and research is the basis for each painting. Striving to accurately depict scenes which are at present beyond the range of human eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | title=The IAAA Manifesto | work=International Association of Astronomical Artists | accessdate=September 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921183906/http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | archive-date=September 21, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group now has over 120 members representing 20 countries.

The whole title is "the Why Cheap Art? manifesto". It is a single sheet, issued by the Bread and Puppet Theater "in direct response to the business of art and its growing appropriation by the corporate sector." There are seventeen statements, most of them beginning "Art is" and ending with an exclamation mark, set out mostly in upper case, sometimes mixed in with lower case, in different typefaces which get bolder through the leaflet till the final statement of a large HURRAH. It starts:
:People have been thinking too long that art is a privilege of the museums &amp; the rich.
:Art is not business!
It stresses the positive nature of art which is beneficial to all and should be available to all, using poetic images such as "Art is like green trees", and urging, "Art fights against war &amp; stupidity! ... Art is cheap!

===A Cyborg Manifesto 1985===

This has the full title of "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth-Century." Donna Haraway is a cultural historian. She advocates the development of cyborgs ("cybernetic organisms") as the way forward for a post-gender society. This had a significant effect initially amongst academics. VNS Matrix, a group of Australian women artists and British cultural historian, [[Sadie Plant]], established a cyberfeminist movement in 1994. From 1997, the Old Boys Network (OBN) has organised "Cyberfeminist Internationals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/overview_of_media_art/society/scroll/ |title=Social Technologies: Deconstruction, subversion and the utopia of democratic communication |first= Inke |last=Arns |date=April 7, 2006 |publisher=Medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto is five paragraphs, each with a subtitle, the first of which is "Art for All", summing up the popularist intent of their manifesto:
:We want Our Art to speak across the barriers of knowledge directly to People about their Life and not about their knowledge of art. The twentieth century has been cursed with an art that cannot be understood. The decadent artists stand for themselves and their chosen few, laughing at and dismissing the normal outsider. We say that puzzling, obscure and form-obsessed art is decadent and a cruel denial of the Life of People.
There is also an intent to change people, but "The art-material must be subservient to the meaning and purpose of the picture." It states:
:We want to learn to respect and honour "the whole". The content of mankind is our subject and our inspiration. We stand each day for good traditions and necessary changes. We want to find and accept all the good and bad in ourselves.
The conclusion is an affirmation of "our life-search for new meanings and purpose to give to life."

The manifesto was signed by [[Veronica Vera]] and [[Candida Royalle]] (both ex porn stars who had then directed their own porn movies), [[Annie Sprinkle]] (who gives explicit sexual one woman shows) and performance artist [[Frank Moore (performance artist)|Frank Moore]], among other significant artists  who use sex in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikonenmagazin.de/interview/Ovidie.htm |title=Beyond the Porno Manifesto |first=Martin |last=Kreischer |date=January 2005 |accessdate=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 7 short points, it founds an art movement, which "celebrates sex as the nourishing, life-giving force. We embrace our genitals as part, not separate, from our spirits." It  advocates the "attitude of sex-positivism" and wishes to "communicate our ideas and emotions ... to have fun, heal the world and endure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drsusanblock.com/editorial/moore/postporn.htm |title=Post Porn, Post Sex, A New Art Movement |first=Frank |last=Moore |date=1989–1993 |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VNS Matrix was a cyberfeminist art collective founded in Adelaide, Australia, in 1991. Their manifesto, written in 1991, was translated over the years into many languages including Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Finnish. It begins:
:we are the modern cunt
:positive anti reason
:unbounded unleashed unforgiving
:we see art with our cunt we make art with our cunt
In 1996 they wrote the Bitch Mutant Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303104255/http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html |date=March 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ____________ Manifesto proposed an interactive, fill-in-the-blanks view of prohibitions and claims to be made about art and art movements. It was an early interactive piece of net art that appeared in webzines and in newsgroups, inviting participation. It begins:
:Today, ____________ itself is obsolete.
The manifesto ends with a ''Reset'' button. The text is sampled from Tristian Tzara's Dada manifestos, but key pieces from the original text have been omitted and replaced with blanks to be filled-in.

It is one of the earliest manifestos to be published on the Internet as well as in print.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Taylor. ''The Literature of Society Series: The Manifesto in Literature, vol. 3,'' St James Press, New York, 2013, pp. 84-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Group Hangman was started by [[Billy Childish]], [[Tracey Emin]] and two others in [[Medway]], [[Kent]] in 1983 for a short time. Fourteen years later it reformed with more members (nearly all of whom later joined the Stuckists art group), but without Emin. At this point Childish wrote 6 short manifestos, each containing 7 – 12 statements. He says, "they were anarchic and contradictory - my favourite!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trakmarx.com/2004_02/10_billy.htm |title=Billy Childish interview |publisher= Trakmarx.com |accessdate= April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas resurfaced in the Stuckist manifestos written two years later. Point 9 of ''Communication 0001'' states:
:Western art has been stupefying its audience into taking the position of an admiring doormat. We, at Group Hangman however, intend to wipe our mud-encrusted boots on the face of conceptual balderdash.
Style must be smashed ("Artistic talent is the only obstacle") and the unacceptable must be embraced. The last communication, of only two short sentences, was written in 2000 and recommends, "It is time for art to grow up."

(A genre of the [[Transhumanist art]] movement whose manifesto was written in 1982)

This was written on January 1, 1997, and was apparently "on board the [[Cassini Huygens]] spacecraft on its mission to Saturn." Following the statement "We are transhumans", there is the explanation, "Transhumanist Art reflects an extropic appreciation of aesthetics in a technologically enhanced world." After the manifesto is a "FAQ", which states, "Transhumanist Arts include creative works by scientists, engineers, technicians, philosophers, athletes, educators, mathematicians, etc., who may not be artists in the traditional sense, but whose vision and creativity are integral to transhumanity." The Manifesto is based on a ''Transhumanist Art Statement'' written in 1982. Cited as specific influences are "Abstract Art, Performance Art, Kinetic Art, Cubism, Techno Art, science fiction and Communications Art."

Widespread access to the internet has created a new incentive for artists to publish manifestos, with the knowledge that there is an instant potential worldwide audience. The effect of the internet on art manifestos has been described: "One could almost say we are living through a new boom time for the manifesto. The Web allows almost anybody to nail a broadsheet to the virtual wall for all to see."&lt;ref name=manifestodestiny&gt;{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Simon  |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0120,reynolds,24748,10.html |title=Manifesto destiny |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date= May 15–22, 2001 |accessdate= August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the manifestos also appear in print form; others only exist as virtual text. It has also led to a great diversity of approaches, as well as a noticeable trend looking back at earlier traditions of Modernism or the Renaissance to create a present and future paradigm. The Stuckists manifesto has become well known, though most others have achieved little individual reputation or impact.

The [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] have grown in eleven years from 13 artists in London to 209 groups in 48 countries, and claim, "Stuckism is the first significant art movement to spread via the Internet"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#Virtual |title=A Stuckist on Stuckism |first=Charles |last=Thomson |year= 2004 |accessdate= April 7, 2006 |work=Essay from: Ed. Frank Milner (2004), "The Stuckists Punk Victorian", National Museums Liverpool |ISBN =1-902700-27-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 3 points of their numbered eponymous manifesto proclaim "a quest for [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]", "painting is the medium of self discovery" and "a model of art which is holistic". The 4th point states, "Artists who don't paint aren't artists"; the 5th is, "Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art." Points are made against [[conceptual art]], [[Young British Artists|Britart]], [[Charles Saatchi]], art gimmicks and white wall galleries, while the amateur is hailed. The final point is:
:Stuckism embraces all that it denounces. We only denounce that which stops at the starting point — Stuckism starts at the stopping point!
This manifesto is available on their web site in 7 languages. They have issued at least 8 other manifestos, including the [[Remodernism|Remodernist]] Manifesto (2000), which inaugurates "a new spirituality in art" (to replace [[Postmodernism]]'s "scientific materialism, nihilism and spiritual bankruptcy"), the [[Turner Prize]] Manifesto, handed out in their [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstrations]] at [[Tate Britain]] and a Critique of Damien Hirst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503150414/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate]] gallery holds three of the manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.tate.org.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=tb-calm&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='stuckists') |work=Tate archive catalogue |title=Stuckists |publisher= Archive.tate.org.uk |accessdate=July 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin-offs by other Stuckists include a [[Camberwell College of Arts]] Students for Stuckism manifesto (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/manifest_Student.html |title=Sensational? |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a teenagers' Underage Stuckists Manifesto (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Allen Herndon]] published ''The Manifesto of the American Stuckists'', whose content was challenged by the Los Angeles Stuckists group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=La-stuckism.com |url=http://www.la-stuckism.com/blog/2006/12/against-national-chauvinism-in-art.html |title=Against national chauvinism in art |location= Stuck in L.A. |date=December 17, 2006 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an anti-Stuckist manifesto published in 2005 by the London Surrealist Group.

===Versatilist Manifesto 2007===
by [[Denis Mandarino]]&lt;ref name=USP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.monografias.com/trabalhos-pdf/reflexoes-manifesto-versatilista-artista-consciencia/reflexoes-manifesto-versatilista-artista-consciencia.shtml|author=Luko, C. S.|year=2011|title=Reflections on the versatilist manifesto|publisher=[[University of São Paulo|USP]]|accessdate=August 25, 2012|language=pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Versatilist Manifesto]] was written by [[Brazil]]ian composer, artist and writer, [[Denis Mandarino]], with the intention of freeing people from the expert analysis and promote the practice of art as a form of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and spiritual enhancement, in [[São Paulo]] in July 2007. In Versatilism, there are no art contests, as no man or group is capable of judging other men. An art critic always analyses a situation from a profoundly limited point of view because his knowledge is also limited. Contests and prizes can be a way of directing public opinion and on doing so, valorizing this or that artist that aims financial or social advantages. Nevertheless, [[cultural|ethical cultural]] initiatives are praiseworthy.

===The Remodernist Film Manifesto 2008===
by [[Jesse Richards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html |title=Waarschuwing over inhoud |publisher=Jesse-richards.blogspot.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manifesto on filmmaking written by former [[Stuckist]] painter, photographer and filmmaker Jesse Richards that like the closely related [[Remodernism]] manifesto, calls for a "new spirituality", but in this instance, in relation to cinema. The manifesto proclaims a spiritual film to be "not about religion. It is cinema concerned with humanity and an understanding of the simple truths and moments of humanity. Spiritual film is really ALL about these moments". Point 4 of the manifesto discusses [[Japan]]ese aesthetics in relation to the idea of [[Remodernist film]]: "The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film". The manifesto also criticizes filmmakers that shoot on video, arguing that film, particularly Super-8 film "has a rawness, and an ability to capture the poetic essence of life, that video has never been able to accomplish" and also criticizes [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s work, as being "dishonest and boring", as well as [[Dogme 95]]'s "pretentious checkist" of rules. Instead, the Remodernist film philosophy seems to be somewhat anti-ego, with Richards noting that "this manifesto should be viewed only as a collection of ideas and hints whose author may be mocked and insulted at will". The manifesto was recently translated into Turkish and published by the film website Bakiniz, and is being translated into Polish and published by the Polish underground art and culture magazine, RED.

===The Superstroke Art Movement Manifesto 2008===
by [[Conrad Bo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Superstroke Art Movement |url=http://superstrokeartmovement.blogspot.com/ |title=Superstroke Art |publisher=Superstrokeartmovement.blogspot.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This manifesto was written by the South African conceptual artist [[Conrad Bo]], who believes the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement is the first internationally known art movement in Africa since the [[Fook Island]] art movement started by [[Walter Battiss]]. The manifesto is quite specific in what the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement want to achieve. [[Superstroke]] is short for the super expressive brush stroke.
The Manifesto for the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement written by Conrad Bo is as follows: 1.Paintings should be executed using expressive even violent brush strokes on at least some part of the picture. 2.Should a photograph be used for a figurative painting, the objection should not be Photorealism, but Expressionism. 3.If mediums such as pen, pencil, etc. are used, the pen and pencil strokes must at least be overly expressive for it to be considered a Superstroke picture. 4.Paintings can be executed in both the abstract and figurative. 5.Subject matters such as Africa, light, dark, life and death are encouraged. 6.Collage, Stencil and Calligraphy may be used for impact. 7.The concept, Art for the sake of art, does not apply in Superstroke. In Superstroke it is art for the sake of Superstroke, as the artist must always strive for paintings rich in texture, or excessive brush or pencil strokes.

===Examples of manifestos on the internet===
{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}
These manifestos are cited not for their individual significance, but as examples of the diversity of approaches that can be found in manifestos on the web, ranging through computer art, "Gothic" art, jokes, traditional art, punk provocation and the use of the form by commerce. This also allows the influence of historical manifestos on contemporary ideas to be assessed.

by [[Kerry Mitchell]]

There is an introduction followed by two sections—"Fractal art is" (4 bullet points) and "Fractal art is not" (3 bullet points). Fractal art has been around "15–20 years". It is obviously concerned with computer-generated fractal images, but advanced as art "in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers." The need for selection and skill is stressed, as is the need for the practitioner to be "expressive" and "creative". It concludes, "Most of all, Fractal Art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."

This was written tongue-in-cheek, beginning, "'OK art' is an OK idea,—not great, but not bad either." It has the ring of truth when it states in point 4: "Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying 'that was OK'. No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either."

This British manifesto is signed by over 100 painters and sculptors of professional standing. It opens by stating "the visual arts have reached a point of crisis. The art that has enjoyed critical acclaim in recent decades is shallow, trivial, ill-crafted and bankrupt of ideas." It condemns [[abstract art|abstraction]], "the same tired formula" of [[conceptual art|conceptualism]], the Turner Prize and the destruction of art school academic training by the [[Coldstream Committee]] in the mid-20th century. It advocates technical accomplishment, reverence for the "great art that has been in the past" and a return to tradition while also, ironically, acknowledging:
:The arrival of the internet means it is no longer necessary to exhibit one's work in the tiny handful of fashionable London galleries, for at the touch of a switch it can be placed before a world wide public.
An organisation with similar aims in America is the Art Renewal Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrenewal.org/ |title=artrenewal.org |publisher=artrenewal.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This represents the adoption of a revolutionary medium by mainstream commercialism, in this case the Cass Art chain of artshops in London. As part of their promotion they have issued a "manifesto" in the style of an art group. It begins, "Art is freedom. Cass Art believes in art." There are seven points. The sixth starts, "Lets fill this town with artists", which has also been displayed across their shop fronts in a banner.

According to the [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]], BPEO "''emphasises the protection and conservation of the environment across land, air and water. The BPEO procedure establishes for a given set of objectives, the option that provides the most benefits or the least damage to the environment, as a whole, at acceptable cost, in the long term as well as in the short term.''"

'''Birgitta Karlström Dorph''' (born 5{{nbsp}}June 1939) is a Swedish diplomat. She is mostly known for her clandestine work in channeling funds from the Swedish government to the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] in South Africa during the 1980s.

== Early life and education ==
Märta Birgitta Karlström Dorph grew up in [[Karlstad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Sven L-O|title=Karlstadstösen som blev diplomat i Afrika|trans-title=The gal from Karlstad who became diplomat in Africa|url=http://www.vf.se/nyheter/allman/karlstadstosen-som-blev-diplomat-i-afrika|website=www.vf.se|date=13 August 2013|publisher=[[Värmlands Folkblad]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she went to the [[Tingvallagymnasiet]]. After graduating she studied in the United States, attended the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and worked in France. She finally entered an education at the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] where she remained and worked as a diplomat for 44 years.&lt;ref name=svt1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlsson|first1=Inger|title=Hon var "Palmes hemliga agent"|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/varmland/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During twenty of Karlström Dorph's years within the diplomatic corps she worked in Africa where she was stationed in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia and [[Gaborone]], Botswana, among other places. In 1982–88, she worked in [[Pretoria]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt;

== Secret mission ==
While stationed as second in command at the [[List of diplomatic missions of Sweden|Swedish legation]]{{efn|At the time the Swedish embassy in South Africa was called a "legation".&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;}} in Pretoria and working as a diplomat,&lt;ref name=expressen1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Claes|title=Hon var Palmes hemliga agent|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent/|website=www.expressen.se|date=24 September 2015|publisher=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also had a secret mission. Her job was to get in contact with the leaders of the then prohibited anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and Namibia,&lt;ref name=NAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Birgitta Karlström-Dorph|url=http://www.liberationafrica.se/intervstories/interviews/karlstrom-dorph/?by-name=1|website=www.liberationafrica.se|publisher=[[Nordic Africa Institute]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find ways to transfer money from Sweden to support their cause.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; The operation was initiated by [[Olof Palme]] and the Swedish government. These arrangements were clandestine and were not discussed in public in the [[Riksdag]]. A total sum of about SEK 1.6 billion ($200 million)&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; were transferred to the [[African National Congress]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; Karlström Dorph established a contact net of recipients and ways to transfer the money. Information about the transfers were sent as [[Encryption|encrypted]] [[Telegraphy|telegrams]], by couriers or as hidden messages in gifts.&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; The money came mainly from the humanitarian [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency]] [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA) but could not be channeled directly since officially, Sweden was not giving any aid to South Africa.&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;

A significant part of the money was used for legal help in defending black persons accused of breaking any of the [[Apartheid legislation|apartheid laws]] that were in effect at the time. This help led to a number of people escaping the death penalty, or had their jail sentences drastically reduced. Money also went to churches, newspapers, unions and women's organizations and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]].&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

{{quote|"I used my ears, my eyes, all my senses, and my heart."

== Recognitions ==
Karlström Dorph has been celebrated as a hero among the South African anti-apartheid activists and she was invited to a birthday party for [[Nelson Mandela]] as well as the ANC's centennial celebration.&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Sveriges Television]] made a documentary about Karlström Dorph called ''Palmes hemliga agent'' ("Palme's secret agent").&lt;ref name=agent&gt;{{cite web|title=Palmes hemliga agent|trans-title=Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.svt.se/dokumentarfilm/palmes-hemliga-agent|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Karlström Dorph has five children and her husband is deceased.&lt;ref name=agent /&gt; She had kept her mission in South Africa a secret from her family up until the documentary about her was made. She says that when her children saw the film "They clapped their hands and gave me a high five!"&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, she still works for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs from time to time.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; She currently lives in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title=Märta Birgitta Karlström Dorph|url=http://www.merinfo.se/person/Stockholm/M%C3%A4rta-Birgitta-Dorph-1939/bjlvx-kri0|website=www.merinfo.se|publisher=Merinfo|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4801">'''Cave conservation''' is the protection and restoration of [[cave]]s to prevent or minimise the effects of human activities.

Some caves have delicate features that can be disturbed by changes in light levels, humidity, temperature or air flow.  Caves that have lighting that remains on are prone to having algae grow within the cave changing the appearance and ecology.  [[Speleothems]] grow as a result of water both on cave surfaces and the humidity of the cave air. Changes to these because of a high number of visitors, changes to the cave air flow and changes to the [[hydrology]] will alter speleothem development.

Speleothems can have a slow growth rate and therefore removing them as souvenirs or breakage due to movement within the cave will be visible for a long time, often throughout several generations of human interaction.

The use of [[calcium carbide]] for lamps has led to soot marks and deposits of discarded spent carbide. Using electric lamps avoids these problems.

==Cave conservation by region==

===New Zealand===
The [[New Zealand Speleological Society]] (NZSS), a recreational caving organisation, promotes cave conservation by its members.  The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DoC) is responsible for caves on land under its administration and has developed a management policy for caves and [[karst]]. DoC publish a "Caving care code" which is in turn based in part on the caving ethics of NZSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=38542|title=Minimising your impact - Caving care code|last=DoC|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The [[British Cave Research Association]] administers the United Kingdom Cave Conservation Emergency Fund (UKCCEF), a charitable fund for protection of caves and cave features. The aims are:
* To assist in the publication of material intended to promote the conservation of caves and features therein or the conservation of a specific site or group of caves     
* To assist with the physical protection of features within a specific cave or group of caves
* To assist in works designed to maintain access to a cave or part of a cave, but not solely to assist exploration
* To assist in the purchase of land or property where such acquisition is intended to ensure the protection of, or maintenance of access to, a cave or caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcra.org.uk/ukccef/ ukccef info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Caving Association]] has a Cave Conservation Code with the following recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm Conservation Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415231401/http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cave with care and within your abilities
*Keep to marked routes and do not cross conservation tapes and barriers
*Protect cave wildlife and do not disturb bats
*Do not pollute the cave, leave nothing behind
*Archaeological and other remains should not be disturbed
*Do not interfere with scientific equipment
*Set a good example for others to follow
*Avoid touching or damaging formations
*Take nothing but photographs
*Comply with any access requirements
*Respect the rights and privacy of land owners

===United States===
The [[National Speleological Society]] believes:
* Caves have unique scientific, recreational, and scenic values
* These values are endangered by both carelessness and intentional vandalism
* These values, once gone, cannot be recovered
* The responsibility for protecting caves must be formed by those who study and enjoy them. 
* A common phrase on ethical caving: "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, waste nothing but time."
Also involved in cave conservation are the:
* [[Butler Cave Conservation Society]]
* [[Cave Research Foundation]]
* [http://scci.org Southeastern Cave Conservancy]

===India===

The [[National Cave Research and Protection Organization]] is formed to protect the caves and explore the caves scientifically to know them better.

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Comparative neuropsychology''' refers to an approach used for understanding human [[brain]] functions. It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.

Over many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain [[lesion]]s on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use.  Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] in human and nonhuman animals alike.

Currently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.

The comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills.  Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.

Comparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition.  Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with [[brain damage|brain-damaged]] patients.

Within the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.

==History==

Comparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oscar-Berman|first1=M|title=A comparative neuropsychological approach to alcoholism and the brain.|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism Supplement|date=1994|volume=2|pages=281–9|pmid=8974348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.

==George Ettlinger==

George Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, A. D. (1998). Introduction: Comparative Neuropsychology. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys,&lt;ref name="cowey"&gt;Cowey, A., Dean, P., &amp; Weiskrantz, L. (1998). Ettlinger at Bay: can visual agnosia be explained by low-level visual impairments? Chicago: Oxford University Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate [[Ablative brain surgery|ablation]]. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist [[Colin Blakemore]] and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy.&lt;ref name="oxbury" /&gt; Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.&lt;ref name="oxbury"&gt;Oxbury, J. M., &amp; Oxbury, S. (1998). Memory and the human temporal lobes. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counterfactual conditional''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{Sc|'''cf'''}}), is a conditional containing an if-clause which is contrary to fact. The term "counterfactual conditional" was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 44, No. 5, (27 February 1947), pp. 113–28.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "'''contrary-to-fact conditional'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol. 55, No. 220, (October 1946), pp. 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of counterfactual speculation has increasingly engaged the interest of scholars in a wide range of domains such as philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 44, No. 5, (27 February 1947), pp. 113–28; Brown, R, &amp; Watling, J., "Counterfactual Conditionals", ''Mind'', Vol. 61, No. 242, (April 1952), pp. 222–33; Parry, W.T., "Reëxamination of the Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 4, (14 February 1957), pp. 85–94; Cooley, J.C., "Professor Goodman’s ''Fact, Fiction, &amp; Forecast''", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 10, (9 May 1957), pp. 293–311; Goodman, N., "Parry on Counterfactuals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 14, (4 July 1957), pp. 442–45; Goodman, N., "Reply to an Adverse Ally", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 17, (15 August 1957), pp. 531–35; [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis, D.]], Counterfactuals, Basil Blackwell, (Oxford), 1973, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; human geography, psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Fillenbaum, S., "Information Amplified: Memory for Counterfactual Conditionals", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', Vol. 102, No. 1, (January 1974), pp. 44–49; Crawford, M.T. &amp; McCrea, S.M., "When Mutations meet Motivations: Attitude Biases in Counterfactual Thought", ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', Vol. 40, No. 1, (January 2004), pp. 65–74, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A., "The Simulation Heuristic", pp. 201–08 in Kahneman, D., Slovic, p.  &amp; Tversky, A.

In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case:
{{quotation|"… we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''. Or in other words, ''where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed'' …" — David Hume, ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (Beauchamp, T.L., ed.), ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1999, (7), p. 146: emphasis in the original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Counterfactualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the view that [[disposition]]s are a type of counterfactual property.&lt;ref&gt;David Stewart Blanks, [https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1440118716&amp;disposition=inline ''The Metaphysics of Dispositions: A Case for Counterfactualism''], Ph.D. thesis, Ohio State University, 2015, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

The difference between [[indicative conditional|indicative]] and counterfactual conditionals, in a context of past time reference, is one of emphasis. This can be illustrated with a pair of examples in which the ''if'' clause is in the past indicative in the first example but in the pluperfect subjunctive in the second:
* ''If [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]] '''did not shoot''' [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], then someone else '''did'''.''
* ''If Oswald '''had not shot''' Kennedy, then someone else '''would have'''.''

The [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (the ''if'' clause) of the first sentence may or may not be true according to the speaker, so the [[Conditional sentence|apodosis]] (the ''then'' clause) also may or may not be true; the apodosis is asserted by the speaker to be true if the protasis is true. In this sentence the ''if'' clause and the ''then'' clause are both in the past tense of the [[indicative mood]].

In the second sentence, the speaker is speaking with a certainty that Oswald ''did'' shoot Kennedy. According to the speaker, the ''if'' clause is false, so the ''then'' clause deals with the counterfactual result, i.e., what would have happened. In this sentence the ''if'' clause is in the [[English subjunctive#Pluperfect subjunctive|pluperfect subjunctive]] form of the [[subjunctive mood]], and the ''then'' clause is in the [[conditional perfect]] form of the [[conditional mood]].

A corresponding pair of examples with present time reference uses the present indicative in the ''if'' clause of the first sentence but the past subjunctive in the second sentence's ''if'' clause:
* ''If it '''is raining''', then he '''is''' inside. ''
* ''If it '''were raining''', then he '''would be''' inside.''

Here again, in the first sentence the ''if'' clause may or may not be true; the ''then'' clause may or may not be true but certainly (according to the speaker) is true conditional on the ''if'' clause being true. Here both the ''if'' clause and the ''then'' clause are in the present indicative. In the second sentence, the ''if'' clause is not true, while the ''then'' clause may or may not be true but certainly would be true in the counterfactual circumstance of the ''if'' clause being true. In this sentence, the ''if'' clause is in the [[English subjunctive#Use of the past subjunctive|past subjunctive]] form of the subjunctive mood, and the ''then'' clause is in the conditional mood.

==Reversal of clauses==

The use of the terms "antecedent" and "subsequent" is ambiguous. In logic, while "antecedent" usually means the if-clause, it might refer to whichever comes first.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Protasis and apodosis avoid the issue entirely.

==Psychology==

People engage in [[counterfactual thinking]] frequently. Experimental evidence indicates that people's thoughts about counterfactual conditionals differ in important ways from their thoughts about indicative conditionals.

===Comprehension===
Participants in experiments were asked to read sentences, including counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if Mark had left home early he would have caught the train'. Afterwards, they were asked to identify which sentences they had been shown. They often mistakenly believed they had been shown sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'Mark did not leave home early' and 'Mark did not catch the train' (Fillenbaum, 1974). In other experiments, participants were asked to read short stories that contained counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if there had been roses in the flower shop then there would have been lilies'. Later in the story they read sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'there were no roses and there were no lilies'. The counterfactual conditional 'primed' them to read the sentence corresponding to the presupposed facts very rapidly; no such priming effect occurred for indicative conditionals (Santamaria, Espino, and Byrne, 2005). They spend different amounts of time 'updating' a story that contains a counterfactual conditional compared to one that contains factual information (De Vega, Urrutia, and Riffo, 2007) and they focus on different parts of counterfactual conditionals (Ferguson and Sanford, 2008).

===Reasoning===
Experiments have compared the inferences people make from counterfactual conditionals and indicative conditionals. Given a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'If there had been a circle on the blackboard then there would have been a triangle', and the subsequent information 'in fact there was no triangle', participants make the [[modus tollens]] inference 'there was no circle' more often than they do from an indicative conditional (Byrne and Tasso, 1999). Given the counterfactual conditional and the subsequent information 'in fact there was a circle', participants make the [[modus ponens]] inference as often as they do from an indicative conditional. See [[counterfactual thinking]].

===Psychological accounts===
[[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] proposed in [https://www.amazon.com/The-Rational-Imagination-Alternatives-Bradford/dp/0262025841 ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality''] that people construct [[mental representation]]s that encompass two possibilities when they understand, and reason from, a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'if Oswald had not shot Kennedy, then someone else would have'. They envisage the conjecture 'Oswald did not shoot Kennedy and someone else did' and they also think about the presupposed facts 'Oswald did shoot Kennedy and someone else did not' (Byrne, 2005). According to the [[mental model theory of reasoning]], they construct [[mental models]] of the alternative possibilities, as described in [https://books.google.com/books/about/Deduction.html?id=ZQPFQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Deduction''] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

==Philosophical treatments==
=== Connective ===
In order to distinguish counterfactual conditionals from [[material conditional]]s, a new logical connective '&gt;' is defined, where ''A'' &gt; ''B'' can be interpreted as "If it were the case that ''A'', then it would be the case that ''B''."

The [[truth value]] of a material conditional, ''A'' → ''B'', is determined by the truth values of ''A'' and ''B''. This is not so for the counterfactual conditional ''A'' &gt; ''B'', for there are different situations agreeing on the truth values of A and B but which yield different evaluations of ''A'' &gt; ''B''. For example, if Keith is in [[Germany]], the following two conditionals have both a false antecedent and a false consequent:

# if Keith were in [[Mexico]] then he would be in [[Africa]].
# if Keith were in Mexico then he would be in [[North America]].

Indeed, if Keith is in Germany, then all three conditions "Keith is in Mexico", "Keith is in Africa", and "Keith is in North America" are false. However, (1) is obviously false, while (2) is true as [[Mexico]] is part of [[North America]].

=== Possible world semantics ===
Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]] modeled counterfactuals using the [[possible world semantics]] of [[modal logic]]. The semantics of a conditional ''A'' &gt; ''B'' are given by some function on the relative closeness of worlds where A is true and B is true, on the one hand, and worlds where A is true but B is not, on the other.

On Lewis's account, A &gt; C is (a) vacuously true if and only if there are no worlds where A is true (for example, if A is logically or metaphysically impossible); (b) non-vacuously true if and only if, among the worlds where A is true, some worlds where C is true are closer to the actual world than any world where C is not true; or (c) false otherwise. Although in Lewis's ''Counterfactuals'' it was unclear what he meant by 'closeness', in later writings, Lewis made it clear that he did ''not'' intend the metric of 'closeness' to be simply our ordinary notion of overall similarity.

Example:
:If he had eaten more at breakfast, he would not have been hungry at 11 am.
On Lewis's account, the truth of this statement consists in the fact that, among possible worlds where he ate more for breakfast, there is at least one world where he is not hungry at 11 am and which is closer to our world than any world where he ate more for breakfast but is still hungry at 11 am.

Stalnaker's account differs from Lewis's most notably in his acceptance of the ''limit'' and ''uniqueness assumptions''. The uniqueness assumption is the thesis that, for any antecedent A, there is a unique possible world where A is true, while the limit assumption is the thesis that, for a given antecedent A, there is a unique set of worlds where A is true that are closest. (The uniqueness assumption [[logical consequence|entails]] the limit assumption, but the limit assumption does not entail the uniqueness assumption.) On Stalnaker's account, A &gt; C is non-vacuously true if and only if, at the closest world where A is true, C is true. So, the above example is true just in case at the single, closest world where he ate more breakfast, he does not feel hungry at 11 am. Although it is controversial, Lewis rejected the limit assumption (and therefore the uniqueness assumption) because it rules out the possibility that there might be worlds that get closer and closer to the actual world without limit. For example, there might be an infinite series of worlds, each with a coffee cup a smaller fraction of an inch to the left of its actual position, but none of which is uniquely the closest. (See Lewis 1973: 20.)

One consequence of Stalnaker's acceptance of the uniqueness assumption is that, if the [[law of excluded middle]] is true, then all instances of the formula (A &gt; C) ∨ (A &gt; ¬C) are true. The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p is true. If the uniqueness assumption is true, then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A is true. If the law of excluded middle is true, any consequent C is either true or false at that world where A is true. So for every counterfactual A &gt; C, either A &gt; C or A &gt; ¬C is true. This is called conditional excluded middle (CEM). Example:

:(1) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads.
:(2) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed tails (i.e. not heads).
On Stalnaker's analysis, there is a closest world where the fair coin mentioned in (1) and (2) is flipped and at that world either it lands heads or it lands tails. So either (1) is true and (2) is false or (1) is false and (2) true. On Lewis's analysis, however, both (1) and (2) are false, for the worlds where the fair coin lands heads are no more or less close than the worlds where they land tails. For Lewis, "If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads or tails" is true, but this does not entail that "If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads, or: If the coin had been flipped it would have landed tails."

=== Other accounts ===
====Ramsey====
Counterfactual conditionals may also be evaluated using the so-called [[Belief revision#The Ramsey test|Ramsey test]]: ''A'' &gt; ''B'' holds if and only if the addition of ''A'' to the current body of knowledge has ''B'' as a consequence. This condition relates counterfactual conditionals to [[belief revision]], as the evaluation of ''A'' &gt; ''B'' can be done by first revising the current knowledge with ''A'' and then checking whether ''B'' is true in what results.  Revising is easy when ''A'' is consistent with the current beliefs, but can be hard otherwise. Every semantics for belief revision can be used for evaluating conditional statements.  Conversely, every method for evaluating conditionals can be seen as a way for performing revision.

====Ginsberg====
Ginsberg (1986) has proposed a semantics for conditionals which assumes that the current beliefs form a set of [[propositional formula]]e, considering the maximal sets of these formulae that are consistent with ''A'', and adding ''A'' to each. The rationale is that each of these maximal sets represents a possible state of belief in which ''A'' is true that is as similar as possible to the original one. The conditional statement ''A'' &gt; ''B'' therefore holds if and only if ''B'' is true in all such sets. &lt;ref name="rev. no. 03011"&gt;{{citation | title = Review of the paper: M. L. Ginsberg, "Counterfactuals," Artificial Intelligence 30 (1986), pp. 35–79 | pages = 13–14 | publisher = FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure GmbH | journal = Zentralblatt für Mathematik | zbl=0655.03011 | year = 1989 | url = https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0655.03011&amp;format=complete}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within empirical testing===
The counterfactual conditional is the basis of experimental methods for establishing [[causality]] in the natural and social sciences, e.g., whether taking antibiotics helps cure bacterial infection. For every individual, ''u'', there is a function that specifies the state of ''u'''s infection under two hypothetical conditions: had ''u'' taken antibiotic and had ''u'' not taken antibiotic. Only one of these states can be observed in any instance, since they are mutually exclusive. The overall effect of antibiotic on infection is defined as the difference between these two states, averaged over the entire population. If the treatment and control groups are selected at random, the effect of antibiotic can be estimated by comparing the rates of recovery in the two groups.

====Pearl====
The tight connection between causal and counterfactual relations has prompted [[Judea Pearl]] (2000) to reject both the possible world semantics and those of Ramsey and Ginsberg. The latter was rejected because causal information cannot be encoded as a set of beliefs, and the former because it is difficult to fine-tune Lewis's similarity measure to match causal intuition. Pearl defines counterfactuals directly in terms of a "[[structural equation model]]" –  a set of equations, in which each variable is assigned a value that is an explicit function of other variables in the system. Given such a model, the sentence "''Y'' would be ''y'' had ''X'' been ''x''" (formally, ''X = x'' &gt; ''Y = y'' ) is defined as the assertion: If we replace the equation currently determining ''X'' with a constant ''X = x'', and solve the set of equations for variable ''Y'', the solution obtained will be ''Y = y''. This definition has been shown to be compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics and forms the basis for causal inference in the natural and social sciences, since each structural equation in those domains corresponds to a familiar causal mechanism that can be meaningfully reasoned about by investigators.

'''Crimes against humanity''' are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], and the [[International Criminal Court]]) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of [[customary international law]]. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]].

Unlike [[war crime]]s, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. DeGuzman,[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1745183 "Crimes Against Humanity"] RESEARCH HANDBOOK ON INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, Bartram S. Brown, ed., Edgar Elgar Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a [[de facto]] authority. [[War crime]]s, [[murder]], [[massacre]]s, [[dehumanization]], [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation]]s, [[unethical human experimentation]], [[extrajudicial punishment]]s including [[summary execution]]s, [[weapon of mass destruction|use of WMDs]], [[state terrorism]] or [[State-sponsored terrorism|state sponsoring of terrorism]], [[death squad]]s, [[kidnapping]]s and [[forced disappearance]]s, [[military use of children]], [[internment|unjust imprisonment]], [[slavery|enslavement]], [[cannibalism in humans|cannibalism]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[political repression]], [[Institutional racism|racial discrimination]], [[religious persecution]], and other [[Human rights#Violations|human rights abuses]] may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.

==History of the term==

The term "crimes against humanity" is potentially [[ambiguous]] because of the ambiguity of the word "humanity", which can mean [[humankind]] (all human beings collectively) or [[humanity (virtue)|the value of humanness]]. The history of the term shows that the latter sense is intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Luban |title=A Theory of Crimes Against Humanity |url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/146/ |journal=[[The Yale Journal of International Law]] |volume=29 |number=1 |date=2004 |pages=85–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of the slave trade===
There were several bilateral treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the multilateral treaty of [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] (1815) that used wording expressing condemnation of the [[slave trade]] using moral language. For example, the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] between Britain and France included the wording "principles of natural justice"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the [[Treaty of Ghent (1814)]] that the slave trade violated the "principles of humanity and justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Francisco Forrest |year=2007 |title=The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139467186 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilateral ''Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815'' (Which also formed [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/Act XV|Section XV]] of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the "principles of humanity and universal morality" as justification for ending a trade that was "odious in its continuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Plenipotentiaries of the treaty |title=The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time |publisher= s.n. |year=1816|volume=32 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPT24,M1 p. 200]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "crimes against humanity" was used by [[George Washington Williams]] in a pamphlet published in 1890 to describe the practices of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s administration of the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa. Houghton Mifflin, 1999. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of [[international humanitarian law]]. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the “laws of humanity” as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The term is part of what is known as the [[Martens Clause]].

On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging for the first time ever another government of committing "a crime against humanity". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:

{{quote|In view of these new crimes of [[Ottoman Empire]] against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the [[Sublime Porte]] that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the [[Young Turks|Ottoman Government]], as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres.&lt;ref&gt;1915 declaration

At the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a [[tribunal]] to try "violations of the laws of humanity". However, the US representative objected to references to "law of humanity" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer|first=Robert|title=An Introduction to International Criminal Law and Procedure|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=188|author2=Hakan Friman |author3=Darryl Robinson |author4=Elizabeth Wilmshurst }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuremberg trials===
{{Main article|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nuremberg Trials. Defendants in the dock. The main target of the prosecution was [[Hermann Göring]] (at the left edge on the  first row of benches), considered to be the most important surviving official in the [[Nazi Germany|Third ''Reich'']] after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] death.]]

After the Second World War, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to respond to [[the Holocaust]] and grave crimes committed by the [[Nazi regime]]. A traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for crimes committed by a power on its own citizens. Therefore, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and [[crime against peace|crimes against peace]], but also ''crimes against humanity'', defined as
{{quote|[[Murder]], extermination, [[Slavery|enslavement]], [[deportation]], and other [[wikt:inhumane|inhumane]] acts committed against any [[civilian]] population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuremberg War Crimes Trial: The Charter Provisions|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judprov.asp |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under this definition, crimes against humanity could only be punished insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145/&gt; The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, [[Robert H. Jackson]], who pointed out that it "has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business". Thus, "it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war".&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilberg|first1=Raul|title=The Destruction of the European Jews|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300095579|edition=3rd|pages=1145–1147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that "the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as "revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with," war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgement : The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity] contained in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]] were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=Robert |title=Flaws in the Nuremberg Legacy: An Impediment to International War Crimes Tribunals' Prosecution of Crimes Against Humanity |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |date=1 January 1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=443–444 |doi=10.1093/hgs/12.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo Trial===
{{See also|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}

[[File:IMTFE defendants.jpg|thumb|300px|The defendants at the Tokyo International Tribunal.  General [[Hideki Tojo]] was one of the main defendants, and is in the centre of the middle row.]]

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, was convened to [[criminal procedure|try]] the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for three types of crimes: "Class A" ([[crimes against peace]]), "Class B" ([[war crime]]s), and "Class C" (crimes against humanity), committed during the Second World War.

The legal basis for the trial was established by the [[Tokyo Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE)]] that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.

In the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity  (Class C) was not applied for any suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,Tokyo Saiban(Tokyo Trial),Kodansya-Gendai-Shinsho,Kodansha Limited,2008,p.26,pp.116-119.Hirohumi Hayashi,BC kyu Senpan Saiban,Iwanami Shoten Publishers,2005,p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prosecutions related to the [[Nanking Massacre]] were categorised as infringements upon the [[Laws of War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,op.cit.,pp.116-119.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A panel of eleven [[judge]]s presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers ([[United States]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[British India]], and the [[Philippines]]).

==Types of crimes against humanity==
The different types of crimes which may constitute crimes against humanity differs between definitions both internationally and on the domestic level. Isolated inhumane acts of a certain nature committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may instead constitute grave infringements of [[human rights]], or –&amp;nbsp;depending on the circumstances&amp;nbsp;– [[war crimes]], but are not classified as crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apartheid===
{{Main article|Crime of apartheid}}

The systematic persecution of one racial group by another, such as occurred during the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011235327/http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm |date=October 11, 2009 }} dopted and opened for signature, ratification by General Assembly resolution 3068 (XXVIII) of 30 November 1973. Entry into force 18 July 1976, in accordance with article X (10)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (Article 13, 14, 15) makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html "Charter of the United Nations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093634/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.

===Rape and sexual violence===
Neither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters contained an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes{{snd}} including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence{{snd}} as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy-Paper-on-Sexual-and-Gender-Based-Crimes--June-2014.pdf "ICC Prosecutor's Policy Paper on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes"] June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the events of [[Khojaly Massacre|Khojaly]] and [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]] can be shown that the world strongly condemns. International institutions have asked for a ransom to avoid such incidents. There are hundreds of massacres, thousands of prisoners and wounded in these incidents.

In 2008, the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".&lt;ref name="Un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE HALT TO ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT ZONES, UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTING RESOLUTION 1820 (2008) |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status of crimes against humanity in international law==

In 2008, the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]] was launched by Professor [[Leila Nadya Sadat]] at the [[Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute]] to address this gap in international law. The Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Gareth, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx "Crimes Against Humanity and the Responsibility to Protect"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105053758/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx |date=January 5, 2015 }} International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2013, the United Nations [[International Law Commission]] voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Marcela Bailliet, [http://ilg2.org/2014/08/06/un-international-law-commission-to-elaborate-new-global-convention-on-crimes-against-humanity/ "UN International Law Commission to Elaborate New Global Convention on Crimes Against Humanity"] IntLawGrrls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William A.

International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Sean D. Murphy, the United States’ Member on the United Nations’ International Law Commission, has been named the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity. Sean D. Murphy attended the 2008 Experts' Meeting held by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative prior to this appointment.

There is some debate on what the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law is. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of ''jus cogens'' and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt;

==United Nations==
The United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/A/RES/260(III)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the [[International Law Commission]] was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a ‘code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind’. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., "murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group." This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed “before or during the war”, thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity#_ftnref1 |title=ICD - Crimes against humanity |publisher=Asser Institute |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]] (DPRK). The Commission is mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which may amount to crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement "Resolution A/HRC/RES/22/13: Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829031840/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 29, 2013 }} Human Rights Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea - A/HRC/25/63, available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425025103/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Report by the commission found "the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State... These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place." Additionally, the commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s, and are being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation, in order to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

===Security Council===
[[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]], adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 28 April 2006, "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef%21OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|resolution]] commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.

In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”.&lt;ref name="Un.org"/&gt;

==International courts and criminal tribunals==
After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945-1946, the next international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Peter, [http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/Site%20Map/ICC/AspectofCrimesAgainstHumanity.pdf "Aspect of Crimes Against Humanity and the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031709/http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/site%20map/icc/aspectofcrimesagainsthumanity.pdf |date=2012-10-21 }} International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia}}

In 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that {{quotation|The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons responsible for the following crimes when committed in armed conflict, whether international or internal in character, and directed against any civilian population:&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf "ICTY Statute"] Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) murder;
:(b) extermination;
:(c) enslavement;
:(d) deportation;
:(e) imprisonment;
:(f) torture;
:(g) rape;
:(h) persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds;
:(i) other inhumane acts."}}

This definition of crimes against humanity revived the original ‘Nuremberg’ nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape.&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"/&gt; Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}

The UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a “systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icls.de/dokumente/ictr_statute.pdf "ICTR Statute"] Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.

[[File:International Criminal Court Headquarters, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|278px|Headquarters of the ICC in The Hague]]

In 2002, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was established in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over [[genocide]], crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a "crime against humanity" for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN.&lt;ref name="crimesofwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |title=Crimes Against Humanity |accessdate=2006-07-23 |author=Cherif Bassiouni |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718113035/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.

Article 7 of the treaty stated that:

{{quotation|For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm#2 Rome statute of the International Criminal Court] Article 7: Crimes against humanity. [https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) [[Homicide|Murder]];
:(b) Extermination;
:(c) [[Slavery|Enslavement]];
:(d) [[Population transfer|Deportation or forcible transfer of population]];
:(e) [[Imprisonment]] or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
:(f) [[Torture]];
:(g) [[War rape|Rape]], [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution|enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], or any other form of [[sexual violence]] of comparable gravity;
:(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, [[Human race|racial]], national, ethnic, [[Culture|cultural]], [[Religion|religious]], [[gender]] as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
:(i) [[Forced disappearance|Enforced disappearance]] of persons;
:(j) The [[crime of apartheid]];
:(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health;}}

The [[Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity
{{quotation|are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of one or more human beings. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. However, murder, extermination, torture, rape, political, racial, or religious persecution and other inhumane acts reach the threshold of crimes against humanity only if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice. Isolated inhumane acts of this nature may constitute grave infringements of human rights, or depending on the circumstances, war crimes, but may fall short of meriting the stigma attaching to the category of crimes under discussion. On the other hand, an individual may be guilty of crimes against humanity even if he perpetrates one or two of the offences mentioned above, or engages in one such offense against only a few civilians, provided those offenses are part of a consistent pattern of misbehavior by a number of persons linked to that offender (for example, because they engage in armed action on the same side or because they are parties to a common plan or for any similar reason.) Consequently when one or more individuals are not accused of planning or carrying out a policy of inhumanity, but simply of perpetrating specific atrocities or vicious acts, in order to determine whether the necessary threshold is met one should use the following test: one ought to look at these atrocities or acts in their context and verify whether they may be regarded as part of an overall policy or a consistent pattern of an inhumanity, or whether they instead constitute isolated or sporadic acts of cruelty and wickedness.&lt;ref name="Horton2"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be "part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". Article 7.2.a states "For the purpose of paragraph 1: "Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack." This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a State policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]]. In a section entitled "Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity" he states that "the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity," i.e. 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]]{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |title=OTP letter to senders re Iraq |accessdate=2006-02-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225075607/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-25 |df= }}  9 February 2006.

The ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute - genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity - which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060448/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About%2Bthe%2BCourt/ |archivedate=2011-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur.

==Council of Europe==
The [[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]] on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section "Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: "penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Explanatory Memorandum on this recommendation when considering paragraph 69:
{{quotation|Reference should be made to the [[Rome Statute|Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal]] adopted in Rome in July 1998. Article 7 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity, as crimes against humanity. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence as a serious breach of the Geneva Conventions and as war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 100&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The UN pointed out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) specifically Article 7 (Crimes against Humanity which defines large-scale acts of violence against a locality’s civilian populace. These acts consist of murder; annihilation; enslavement; bondage; forced removal of the population; imprisonment or deprivation of physical liberty that violates international laws; maltreatment; forced prostitution and rape; discrimination and tyranny against certain groups; apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation); and, other inhumane acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998|last=Pronto|first=Arnold N.|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been collated starting in 1990. These were the 1993 Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (now called the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 1994 Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal.

The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that participating [[government]]s exploited it to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 11, 2003, accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=March 13, 2008|work=Wired.com|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon [[human rights]]. It is argued that the term [[war]] is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]), since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2004-09-02 |publisher=''The Baltimore Sun'' |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic: calling it a "war on terror" obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley."&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;".

==Terminology==
Various critics dubbed the term "War on Terror" as nonsensical.
For example, billionaire activist investor [[George Soros]] criticized the term "War on Terror" as a "false metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0815-35.htm A Self-Defeating War]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Wall Street Journal]], August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Linguist [[George Lakoff]] of the [[Rockridge Institute]] argued that there cannot literally be a [[Wiktionary:war|war]] on terror, since [[Wiktionary:terror|terror]] is an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]]. "Terror cannot be destroyed by weapons or signing a peace treaty. A war on terror has no end."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff/gwot_rip 'War on Terror,' Rest In Peace]&lt;/cite&gt;".[[Rockridge Institute]], February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason Burke]], a journalist who writes about radical Islamic activity, describes the terms "[[definitions of terrorism|terrorism]]" and "[[War on Terror|war against terrorism]]" in this manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are multiple ways of defining [[terrorism]] and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems with the use of the term persist.

Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term '[[militant (word)|militancy]]'. This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Jason|title=Al-Qaeda|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2003|pages=22|chapter=2|isbn=978-1-85043-396-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Perpetual war===
Former [[United States|U.S.]] President [[George W. Bush]] articulated the goals of the War on Terror in a September 20, 2001 speech, in which he said that it "will not end until every [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release
|publisher=The White House
|date=September 20, 2001
|title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People
|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010920-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same speech, he called the war "a task that does not end", an argument he reiterated in 2006 State of The Union address.

===Preventive war===
One [[Rationale for the Iraq War|justification given for the invasion of Iraq]] was to prevent terroristic, or other attacks, by Iraq on the United States or other [[nation]]s. This can be viewed as a [[conventional warfare]] realization of the War on Terror.

A major criticism leveled at this justification is that it does not fulfill one of the requirements of a [[just war]] and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined [[international law]] and the authority of the [[United Nations]], particularly the [[United Nations Security Council]]. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the [[UN Charter]] and the [[Nuremberg Principles|Nuremberg principle]]s, therefore committing a [[war of aggression]], which is considered a [[war crime]]. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a [[precedent]], under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.

[[Richard N. Haass]], president of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], argues that on the eve of U.S. intervention in 2003, [[Iraq]] represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Richard N.|title=The Irony of American Strategy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume= 92|issue= 3|page=57|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139106/richard-n-haass/the-irony-of-american-strategy|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. "The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives to using military force, such as strengthening existing sanctions."&lt;ref name="FA Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Richard N.|title=The Irony of American Strategy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=May–June 2013|volume= 92|issue= 3|page=58|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139106/richard-n-haass/the-irony-of-american-strategy|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed "into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President [[Barack Obama]]` decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to 'take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east' of the country."&lt;ref name="FA Haas" /&gt; Afghanistan, according to Haass, eventually became a war of choice.

==War on Terror seen as pretext==
Excerpts from an April 2006 report compiled from sixteen U.S. government intelligence agencies has strengthened the claim that engaging in Iraq has increased terrorism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Glaister, Dan. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1880275,00.html Campaign in Iraq has increased threat, says American intelligence report]&lt;/cite&gt;".

In the [[United Kingdom]], critics have claimed that the [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government used the War on Terror as a pretext to radically curtail civil liberties, some enshrined in law since [[Magna Carta]]. For example, the detention-without-trial in [[Belmarsh]] prison:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3714864.stm|title= Belmarsh - Britain's Guantanamo Bay? |last=Winterman|first=Denise|date=2004-10-06|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; controls on free speech through laws against protests near Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4523838.stm|title= Falconer defends new protest law|date=2005-12-13|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and laws banning the "glorification" of terrorism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4834738.stm|title= Lords back down on glorification|date=2006-03-22|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reductions in checks on police power, as in the case of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5173032.stm|title= Profile: Jean Charles de Menezes|date=2006-07-13|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mohammed Abdul Kahar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5075952.stm|title= Brothers looking for 'justice'|last=Summers|first=Chris|date=2006-06-13|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Leader [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] has also condemned Blair's inaction over the controversial U.S. practice of [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]], arguing that the human rights conventions to which the UK is a signatory (e.g. [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) impose on the government a "legal obligation" to investigate and prevent potential torture and human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4863776.stm|title= UK airspace 'used for rendition' |date=2006-03-31|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unilateralism===
U.S. President George W. Bush's remark of November 2001 claiming that "You're either with us or you are with the terrorists,"&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/11/06/ret.bush.coalition/index.html Bush says it is time for action]&lt;/cite&gt;" has been heavily criticized. [[Cable News Network]], 6 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; has been a source of criticism.  Thomas A. Keaney of Johns Hopkins University's Foreign Policy Institute said "it made diplomacy with a number of different countries far more difficult because obviously there are different problems throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Susan Martin. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/05/09/Columns/With_us_or_against_us.shtml With us or against us? Mideast is not that simple]&lt;/cite&gt;". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', 9 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a war against Islam===
{{See also|War against Islam}}

Since the War on Terror revolved primarily around the United States and other NATO states intervening in the internal affairs of Muslim countries (i.e. in [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], etc.) and [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|organisations]], it has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-[[United States Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/17/stories/2007121754781100.htm|title=Ramsey Clark Interview|last=Dam|first=Marcus|date=2007-12-17|publisher=''The Hindu''|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. 
After his release from Guantanamo in 2005, ex-detainee [[Moazzam Begg]] appeared in the Islamist propaganda video ''21st Century CrUSAders'' and claimed the U.S. was engaging in a new [[Crusades|crusade]]:&lt;ref name="CrusadersVideo"&gt;"21st Century CrUSAders: A War on Muslims in Iraq and Palestine" [[DVD]]/[[VHS]], ''Green 72 Media'', 2005.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that history is definitely repeating itself and for the Muslim world and I think even a great part of the non-Muslim world now, are beginning to recognize that there are ambitions that the United States has on the lands and wealth of nations of Islam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Aiding terrorism===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Each month, there are more suicide terrorists trying to kill Americans and their allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as other Muslim countries than in all the years before 2001 ''combined''. From 1980 to 2003, there were 343 suicide attacks around the world and at most 10 percent were anti-American inspired. Since 2004, there have been more than 2,000, over 91 percent against U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as other countries.|source=[[Robert Pape]]&lt;ref name="PapeOccupation"&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid It's the Occupation, Stupid]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[University of Chicago]] professor and political scientist, [[Robert Pape]] has written extensive work on [[suicide terrorism]] and states that it is triggered by [[military occupations]], not extremist ideologies. In works such as ''[[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]]'' and ''Cutting the Fuse'', he uses data from an extensive terrorism database and argues that by increasing military occupations, the US government is increasing terrorism. Pape is also the director and founder of the [[Robert Pape#CPOST|Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST)]], a database of every known suicide terrorist attack from 1980 to 2008.

In 2006, a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] stated that the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism. The estimate was compiled by 16 intelligence agencies and was the first assessment of global terrorism since the start of the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spy Agencies Say Iraq War Worsens Terrorism Threat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/world/middleeast/24terror.html|first=Mark|last=Mazzetti|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2006|name-list-format=vanc|postscript=|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelia Beyer explains how terrorism increased as a response to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to 'structural violence'. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of backwardness which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Cornelia (2008), "Violent Globalisms", Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] politician [[Shirley Williams]] wrote that the United States and United Kingdom governments "must stop to think whether it is sowing the kind of resentment which is the seedbed of future terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Guardian]], 28 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom [[ambassador]] to [[Italy]], [[Ivor Roberts (ambassador)|Ivor Roberts]], echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was "the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda."&lt;ref&gt;Richburg, Keith B. "&lt;cite&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58041-2004Sep28?language=printer Kerry Is Widely Favored Abroad]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Washington Post]], p. A14, 29 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The United States also granted "protected persons" status under the Geneva Convention to the [[Mojahedin-e-Khalq]], an Iranian group classified by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] as a terrorist organization, sparking criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Scott. "&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0729/p07s01-wome.html Why the U.S. granted 'protected' status to Iranian terrorists]&lt;/cite&gt;". [[The Christian Science Monitor]], 29 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics further noted that the American government granted political asylum to several alleged terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime, while the American government claims to be anti-terrorism.

In 2018, ''New York Times'' terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi said "there are more terrorists now than there are on the eve of September 11, not less...There are more terror groups now, not less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callimachi|first1=Rukmini|title=Prologue: The Mission|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/prologue-the-mission/id1357657583?i=1000409222178&amp;mt=2|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Caliphate (New York Times podcast)|date=19 April 2018|location=3:25 - 3:55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypocrisy of the Bush Administration===

Venezuela accused the U.S. government of having a double standard towards terrorism for giving safe haven to [[Luis Posada Carriles]].&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Science Monitor. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0929/dailyUpdate.html "Venezuela accuses U.S. of 'double standard' on terrorism".] Retrieved August 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Americans also commented on the selective use of the term War on Terrorism, including 3 star general [[William Odom]], formerly President Reagan's [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Director, who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As many critics have pointed, out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and  [[United States and state-sponsored terrorism|using terrorist tactics]], the slogans of today's war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of "sustained hysteria" over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence and refuse to let al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.&lt;ref name="odom_terrorismtactic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/32938989/American-Hegemony-How-to-Use-It-How-to-Lose American Hegemony How to Use It, How to Lose at Docstoc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misleading information===
In the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated they possessed information which demonstrated a link between [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]]. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, ''Newsweek'' magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaresearch.org/rm/cyber/2004/binladen061704/segment1.ram Link between Saddam and al-Qaeda] - ABC News video report&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration believed there was a possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath regime]] following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan. [[Amnesty International]] Secretary General [[Irene Khan]] criticized the use of pro-humanitarian arguments by [[Coalition of the willing|Coalition]] countries prior to its [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], writing in an open letter: "This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists. Let us not forget that these same governments turned a blind eye to Amnesty International's reports of widespread human rights violations in Iraq before the [[Gulf War]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irene Khan|Khan, Irene]].

===Torture by proxy===
{{main|Extraordinary Rendition|Torture and the United States#Torture and Extraordinary Rendition}}
{{See also|Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture}}

The term "torture by proxy" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Retrieved 29 March 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other US agencies transferred supposed terrorists, whom they captured during their efforts in the 'War on terrorism', to countries known to employ [[torture]] as an interrogation technique. Some also claimed that US agencies knew torture was employed, even though the transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law.  Nonetheless, [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;the United States has not transported anyone and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This US programme also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states, including those related with the so-called War on Terrorism. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated that 100 people were kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres ("[[black site]]s"), some located in Europe, utilised by the CIA. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where these alleged 'terrorists' could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Religionism and Islamophobia==
One aspect of the criticism regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically [[Islamophobia]]. Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that "Islam is reduced to the concept of jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Lawrence. "Islamophobia, the Israel Lobby and American Paranoia: Letter From America." Holy Land Studies, 10.1 (2011): 90. DOI: 10.3366/hls.2011.0005.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of argument echoes [[Edward Said]]’s famous piece [[Orientalism (book)|''Orientalism'']] in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward W. "Islam Through Western Eyes." The Nation 26 April 1980. Posted on-line 1 January 1998. Accessed 13 December 2010 http://www.thenation.com/article/islam-through-western-eyes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decreasing international support==
In 2002, strong majorities supported the U.S.-led War on Terror in [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[India]] and [[Russia]], according to a sample survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]]. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), Germany (47%), France (43%) and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the War on Terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of Spaniards supported the War on Terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population still supports the War on Terror and less than a fifth of the populations of [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], as well as [[Jordan]] support the efforts. The report also indicated that Indian public support for the War on Terror has been stable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/commentary/display.php?AnalysisID=1019 Pew Global Attitudes Project: America's Image in the World: Findings from the Pew Global Attitudes Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000000/http://pewglobal.org/commentary/display.php?AnalysisID=1019 |date=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Kohut, while speaking to the [[U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], noted that and according to the [[Pew Research Center]] polls conducted in 2004, "the ongoing conflict in Iraq continues to fuel anti-American sentiments. America’s global popularity plummeted at the start of military action in Iraq and the U.S. presence there remains widely unpopular."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/congress/koh111005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Testimony of Andrew Kohut United States House of Representatives International Relations Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|date=2005-11-10|publisher=Air War College - [[Maxwell Air Force Base]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of U.S. media==
Researchers in communication studies and political science found that American understanding of the "War on Terror" is directly shaped by how mainstream news media reports events associated with the conflict.   In ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuypers|first=Jim A.|title =Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age|date =2006-10-28|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3653-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] illustrated "how the press failed America in its coverage on the War on Terror." In each comparison, Kuypers "detected massive bias on the part of the press." This researcher called the mainstream news media an "anti-democratic institution" in his conclusion. "What has essentially happened since 9/11 has been that Bush has repeated the same themes and framed those themes the same whenever discussing the War on Terror," said Kuypers. "Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, ''USA Today'', ''The New York Times'', as well as ''The Washington Post'') did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president's themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus."

This goes beyond reporting alternate points of view, which is an important function of the press. "In short," Kuypers explained, "if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea what the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech." The study is essentially a "comparative framing analysis." Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.

"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner," wrote Kuypers. These findings suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the War on Terror.

Others have also suggested that press coverage contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the U.S. posed by terrorism. In his book, ''Trapped in the War on Terror''&lt;ref name="Lustick 2006"/&gt; political scientist Ian S. Lustick, claimed, "The media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response." Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage. [[Scott Atran]] writes that  "publicity is the oxygen of terrorism"  and the rapid growth of international communicative networks renders publicity even more potent, with the result that "perhaps never in the history of human conflict have so few people with so few actual means and capabilities frightened so many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atran|first=Scott |title= Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists|date=2010-10-19|publisher=Ecco Press/ HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-134490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media researcher Stephen D. Cooper's analysis of media criticism ''Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Stephen D.|title=Watching the Watchdog: Bloggers As the Fifth Estate|date=2006-06-12|publisher=Marquette Books|isbn=0-922993-47-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains several examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the War on Terror.  Cooper found that bloggers' criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggers' discovery of the mainstream press' failure to adequately verify facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.

Cooper found that bloggers specializing in criticism of media coverage advanced four key points:
*Mainstream reporting of the War on Terror has frequently contained factual inaccuracies.  In some cases, the errors go uncorrected: moreover, when corrections are issued they usually are given far less prominence than the initial coverage containing the errors.
*The mainstream press has sometimes failed to check the provenance of information or visual images supplied by Iraqi "stringers" (local Iraqis hired to relay local news).
*Story framing is often problematic: in particular, "man-in-the-street" interviews have often been used as a representation of public sentiment in Iraq, in place of methodologically sound survey data.
*Mainstream reporting has tended to concentrate on the more violent areas of Iraq, with little or no reporting of the calm areas.

[[David Barstow]]  won the 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]]  by connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on television and radio networks. The Department of  Defense recruited retired generals to promote the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired  generals and defense contractors. He reported that "the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse".

==British objections==
The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ken Macdonald|Ken McDonald]], Britain's most senior criminal prosecutor, stated that those responsible for acts of terrorism such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] are not "soldiers" in a war, but "inadequates" who should be dealt with by the [[criminal justice system]]. He added that a "culture of legislative restraint" was needed in passing anti-terrorism laws and that a "primary purpose" of the violent attacks was to tempt countries such as Britain to "abandon our values." He stated that in the eyes of the UK criminal justice system, the response to terrorism had to be "[[Proportionality (law)|proportionate]] and grounded in due process and the rule of law":
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[London]] is not a battlefield. Those innocents who were murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, [[narcissistic]] inadequates. They were criminals. They were [[fantasy|fantasists]]. We need to be very clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such thing as a war on terror. The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2563401,00.html There is no war on terror in the UK, says DPP]'', [[The Times]], January 24, 2007, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stella Rimington]], former head of the British intelligence service [[MI5]] criticised the War on Terror as a "huge overreaction" and had decried the militarization and politicization of U.S. efforts to be the wrong approach to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |title=Response to 9/11 was "hugh overreaction" |journal=[[The Guardian]] |issue=October 18 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/stella-rimington-9-11-mi5 |accessdate=2008-10-22 | location=London | date=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Miliband]], former UK foreign secretary, has similarly called the strategy a "mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Berger |title='War on Terror' was a mistake, says Miliband  |work=[[The Guardian]]  |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote=democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/15/war-on-terror-miliband | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Miliband |title='War on Terror' was wrong |work=[[The Guardian]]  |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote= The call for a "war on terror" was a call to arms, an attempt to build solidarity for a fight against a single shared enemy. But the foundation for solidarity between peoples and nations should be based not on who we are against, but on the idea of who we are and the values we share. Terrorists succeed when they render countries fearful and vindictive, when they sow division and animosity, when they force countries to respond with violence and repression. The best response is to refuse to be cowed.

[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|300px||right|Apple pie, baseball, and the United States flag are three American cultural icons]]

A '''cultural icon''' is an [[cultural artifact|artifact]] that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture. The process of identification is subjective, and "icons" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Kent|last2=Martinec|first2=Radan|date=2004-09-01|title=Consumer Perceptions of Iconicity and Indexicality and Their Influence on Assessments of Authentic Market Offerings|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/2/296/1824949/Consumer-Perceptions-of-Iconicity-and-Indexicality|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=296–312|doi=10.1086/422109|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motley|first=Carol M.|last2=Henderson|first2=Geraldine Rosa|date=2008-03-01|title=The global hip-hop Diaspora: Understanding the culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307001609|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Cross-Cultural Business Research|volume=61|issue=3|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[mass media|media]], many items and persons of [[popular culture]] have been called "iconic" despite their lack of durability; and the term "[[pop icon]]" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3713610.html Heard about the famous icon? We have - far too often], ''The Independent'' (London), January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an [[apple pie]] is a cultural icon of the [[United States]], but its significance varies among Americans.

National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/dec/09/smashing-statues-sweetest-revenge-protesters-lenin-kiev|publisher=Guardian|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|title=Why smashing statues can be the sweetest revenge}}&lt;/ref&gt; or burning the [[American flag]] to protest US actions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-film-protests-idUSBRE88D0O320120914|publisher=Reuters|date=September 14, 2012|first=ulf|last=Laessing|title=Anti-American fury sweeps Middle East over film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious icon]]s can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the [[Madonna_(art)|Madonna]] in societies with a strong Catholic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating Ourselves, African Americans and Hispanic Americans on popular culture and religious expression|editors=Anthony B Pinn and Benjamin Valentin|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Describing something as ''iconic'' or as an ''icon'' has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' calls "iconic" "a word that makes my flesh creep", a word "pressed into service to describe almost anything."&lt;ref name="LDP"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191891103.html Let's hear it for the Queen's English], ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Christian Examiner]]'' nominates "iconic" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 "iconic" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for "icon", including its use for ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html Modern word usage amazingly leaves us yearning for gay, old times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101358/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html |date=2010-12-25 }}, ''[[Christian Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7902">'''Culture &amp; Social Cognition''' is the relationship between human culture and human [[cognitive]] capabilities.  Cultural cognitive [[evolution]] proposes that humans’ unique cognitive capacities are not solely due to biological inheritance, but are in fact due in large part to cultural transmission and evolution (Tomasello, 1999). Modern humans and [[great apes]] are separated evolutionarily by about six million years. Proponents of cultural evolution argue that this would not have been enough time for humans to develop the advanced cognitive capabilities required to create tools, language, and build societies through biological evolution. Biological evolution could not have individually produced each of these cognitive capabilities within that period of time. Instead, humans must have evolved the capacity to learn through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999). This provides a more plausible explanation that would fit within the given time frame. Instead of having to biologically account for each cognitive mechanism that distinguishes modern humans from previous relatives, one would only have to account for one significant biological adaptation for cultural learning. According to this view, the ability to learn through cultural transmission is what distinguishes humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999). Cultural learning allows humans to build on existing knowledge and make collective advancements, also known as the “[[ratchet effect]]”. The ratchet effect simply refers to the way in which humans continuously add on to existing knowledge through modifications and improvements.  This unique ability distinguishes humans from related primates, who do not seem to build collaborative knowledge over time. Instead, primates seem to build individual knowledge, in which the expertise of one animal is not built on by others, and does not progress across time.

==Cultural learning==
Human cultural learning involves:
* Imitation- the ability to learn by observing others
* Instruction- the ability to learn through direct instruction
* Collaboration- the ability to learn in cooperation with other individuals
Cultural learning is made possible by a deep understanding of social cognition. Humans have the unique capacity to identify and relate to others and view them as intentional beings. Humans are able to understand that others have intentions, goals, desires, and beliefs. It is this deep understanding, this cognitive adaptation, that allows humans to learn from and with others through cultural transmission (Tomasello, 1999).

==Social Cognition in Mammals and Primates==
Primates show distinct characteristics of social cognition in comparison to mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic social hierarchies, make predictions about others’ behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999).  Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and social hierarchies, but they also have an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on social hierarchies, but primates have an understanding of social hierarchies and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans’ deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999).

Although it is now believed that non-human primates such as chimpanzees have some limited understanding of others as intentional beings, it is clear that these understanding are not as deep as human understanding of others as intentional agents.  Chimpanzees, for example, demonstrated an ability to think about what others see, and predict behavior based on these beliefs in several studies conducted by Tomasello and Hare (2003). For example, subordinate chimpanzees in one experiment avoided food that they knew the dominant chimpanzee could see, but sought food that the dominant chimpanzee could not see due to a physical barrier. In another experiment, subordinate chimpanzees made decisions about approaching food based on whether or not the dominant chimpanzee had seen the human researcher place the food behind the barrier. Chimpanzees were also found to react differently to humans who were unwilling versus unable to provide food (teasing the chimpanzee with food, or pretending to have an accident with it), thereby showing some ability to discriminate intentionality.

Dogs have also shown some interesting but limited abilities at social cognition in a series of studies by Hare and Tomasello (2005). Dogs have the ability to read human social cues, even to a greater extent than chimpanzees. Dogs are able to respond to human pointing, the human gaze, and subtle human nods without training. Researchers now believe that these abilities are the result of convergent evolution between humans and dogs through domestication. Research with domesticated foxes has shown that the likely mechanism for this convergent evolution was the selection of tame behavior in dogs. This finding suggests that perhaps humans had to evolve a propensity to cooperate before cultural evolution was able to take place (Hare &amp; Tomasello, 2005).

==Sociogenesis &amp; Human Ontogeny==
Sociogenesis refers to collaborative inventiveness. It is the process by which two or more humans collectively interact and invent something new which could not have been developed by one individual alone, such as language and mathematics (Tomasello, 1999). Sociogenesis can occur across time, or simultaneously (Tomasello, 1999).  Socigenesis across times occurs through the ratchet effect, when one individual modifies something they had previously learned through others. Over time, ideas, tools, and language advance. Simultaneous sociogenesis occurs when two or more individuals work together at the same time and develop something new.

In response to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology must take into account historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if you look at these concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.

In [[economics]], a '''durable good''' or a '''hard good''' is a [[Good (economics)|good]] that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields [[utility]] over time rather than being completely [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] in one use. Items like [[brick]]s could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as [[refrigerator]]s or [[car]]s usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Examples of consumer durable goods include [[automobiles]], [[books]], [[household goods]] ([[home appliance]]s, [[consumer electronics]], [[furniture]], [[tools]], etc.), [[sports equipment]], [[jewelry]], [[medical equipment]], [[firearms]], and [[toy]]s.

'''Nondurable goods''' or '''soft goods''' ([[consumables]]) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.

Examples of nondurable goods include [[fast-moving consumer goods]] such as [[cosmetics]] and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.

While durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.

== Durability ==
According to Cooper (1994, p5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|last=Cooper|first=Tim|publisher=The New Economics Foundation|year=1994|oclc=48830517|location=Whitechapel Road, London|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[durability]] is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair''". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ===
The life span of household goods is significant for [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume= 3| issue = 1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume= 9| issue = 1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[[Durability#cite note-5|[5]]].

'''Epistemological rupture''' ('''epistemological break''' or '''epistemological obstacle'''; {{lang-fr|obstacle épistémologique, rupture épistémologique}}), is a notion introduced in 1938 by French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard, ''The Formation of the Scientific Mind: A Contribution to a Psychoanalysis of Objective Knowledge'', Beacon Press, 1986 [1938], {{ISBN|978-0-8070-1501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Tiles, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YzQd3RY2ZJ4C&amp;pg=PA12 ''Bachelard, science and objectivity''], 1984, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Althusser, ''[[For Marx]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Bachelard proposed that the history of science is replete with "epistemological obstacles"—or unthought/unconscious structures that were immanent within the realm of the sciences, such as principles of division (e.g., mind/body). The history of science, Bachelard asserted, consisted in the formation and establishment of these epistemological obstacles, and then the subsequent tearing down of the obstacles. This latter stage is an epistemological rupture—where an [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] obstacle to scientific thought is thoroughly ruptured or broken away from.

==Etymology==
[[Epistemology]], from the Greek words ''episteme'' (''knowledge'') and ''logos'' ("word, speech") is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin and scope of knowledge. Rupture, from Old French ''rupture'' or Latin ''ruptura'', is defined as an instance of breaking or bursting suddenly and completely, as well as a breach of a harmonious link in a figurative way.

In [[Buddhism]], a mental '''fetter''', chain or bond  ([[Pāli]]: ''samyojana'', ''saŋyojana'', ''saññojana'') shackles a sentient being to [[Samsara (Buddhism)|sa{{IAST|ṃ}}sāra]], the cycle of lives with [[dukkha]].  By cutting through all fetters, one attains [[Nirvana|nibbāna]] ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''nirvā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'').

== Fetter of suffering ==

Throughout the [[Pali canon]], the word "fetter" is used to describe an intrapsychic phenomenon that ties one to suffering.  For instance, in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s Itivuttaka 1.15, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] states:

:"Monks, I don't envision even one other fetter — fettered by which beings conjoined go wandering &amp; [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|transmigrating]] on for a long, long time — like the fetter of [[Tanha|craving]]. Fettered with the fetter of craving, beings conjoined go wandering &amp; transmigrating on for a long, long time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-015 Thanissaro (2001)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, the suffering caused by a fetter is ''implied'' as in this more technical discourse from [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.232, where Ven. [[Sariputta]] converses with Ven. Kotthita:

:Ven. Kotthita: "How is it, friend Sariputta, is ... the ear the fetter of sounds or are sounds the fetter of the ear?..."

:Ven. Sariputta: "Friend Kotthita, the ... ear is not the fetter of sounds nor are sounds the fetter of the ear, but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both: that is the fetter there...."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1230.  Tangentially, in discussing the use of the concept of "the fetter" in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] (regarding mindfulness of the six  [[ayatana|sense base]]s), Bodhi (2005) references ''this'' sutta (SN 35.232) as explaining what is meant by "the fetter," that is, "desire and lust" (''chanda-raga'').  (While providing this exegesis, Bodhi, 2005, also comments that the Satipatthana Sutta commentary associates the term "fetter" in that sutta as referring to all ten fetters.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lists of fetters==
{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
The fetters are enumerated in different ways in the [[Pali canon]]'s [[Sutta Pitaka]] and [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]].

===Sutta Pitaka's list of ten fetters===

The Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka identifies ten "fetters of becoming":&lt;ref&gt;These fetters are enumerated, for instance, in [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.179 and 45.180 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1565-66).  This article's Pali words and English translations for the ten fetters are based on [https://archive.is/20120707234429/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2509.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 656, "Saŋyojana" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09).&lt;/ref&gt;
#belief in a self (Pali: ''{{IAST|sakkāya-diṭṭhi}}'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707211711/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2684.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 660-1, "Sakkāya" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09), defines ''{{IAST|sakkāya-diṭṭhi}}'' as "theory of soul, heresy of individuality, speculation as to the eternity or otherwise of one's own individuality."  Bodhi (2000), p. 1565, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.179, translates it as "identity view"; Gethin (1998), p. 73, uses "the view of individuality"; Harvey (2007), p. 71, uses "views on the existing group"; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.013.than.html Thanissaro (2000)] uses "self-identify views"; and, Walshe (1995), p. 26, uses "personality-belief."&lt;/ref&gt; 
#doubt or uncertainty, especially about the Buddha's awakeness and nine supermundane consciousnesses (''[[vicikicchā]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707163716/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:1406.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 615, "Vicikicchā" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09), defines ''vicikicchā'' as "doubt, perplexity, uncertainty."  Bodhi (2000), p. 1565, SN 45.179, Gethin (1998), p. 73, and Walshe (1995), p. 26, translate it as "doubt."  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.013.than.html Thanissaro (2000)] uses "uncertainty."  Harvey provides, "vacillation in commitment to the three refuges and the worth of morality" (cf. M i.380 and S ii.69-70).&lt;/ref&gt;
#attachment to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa'')&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [https://archive.is/20120718141541/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:236.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 713, "Sīla" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09), regarding the similar concept of ''sīlabbatupādāna'' (= ''sīlabbata-[[upādāna]]''), "grasping after works and rites."  Bodhi (2000), p. 1565, SN 45.179, translates this term as "the distorted grasp of rules and vows"; Gethin (1998), p. 73, uses "clinging to precepts and vows"; Harvey (2007), p. 71, uses "grasping at precepts and vows"; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.013.than.html Thanissaro (2000)] uses "grasping at precepts &amp; practices"; and, Walshe (1995), p. 26, uses "attachment to rites and rituals."&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey (2007), p. 72, uses "spiritual ignorance."&lt;/ref&gt;

As indicated in the adjacent table, throughout the Sutta Pitaka, the first five fetters are referred to as "lower fetters" (''orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni'') and are eradicated upon becoming a [[non-returner]]; and, the last five fetters are referred to as "higher fetters" (''uddhambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni''), eradicated by an [[arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;For single-sutta references to both "higher fetters" and "lower fetters," see, [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33 (section of fives) and [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.13. In other instances, a sutta regarding the lower fetters is followed by a sutta regarding the higher fetters, as in:  [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.179 and 45.180; SN 46.129 and 46.130; SN 46.183 and 46.184; SN 47.103 and 47.104; SN 48.123 and 48.124; SN 49.53 and 49.54; SN 50.53 and 50.54; SN 51.85 and 51.86; SN 53.53 and 53.54; and, AN 9.67 and 9.70.  In addition, the five lower fetters alone (without reference to the higher fetters) are discussed, e.g., in [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three fetters===

Both the Sa{{IAST|ṅ}}gīti Sutta ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33) and the Dhammasa{{IAST|ṅgaṇ}}i (Dhs. 1002-1006) refer to the "three fetters" as the first three in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten:
#belief in a self (''{{IAST|sakkāya-diṭṭhi}}'')
#doubt (''[[vicikicchā]]'')
#attachment to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa'')&lt;ref&gt;For the Sa{{IAST|ṅ}}gīti Sutta's list of three fetters, see, e.g., Walshe (1995), p. 484.  For the Dhammasa{{IAST|ṅgaṇ}}i's list of three, see Rhys Davids (1900), pp. 256-61.  Also see, [https://archive.is/20120707234429/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2509.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 656, entry for "Saŋyojana"] (retrieved 2008-04-09), regarding the ''tī{{IAST|ṇ}}i saŋyojanāni''.  (C.A.F. Rhys Davids (1900), p. 257, translates these three terms as: "the theory of individuality, perplexity, and the contagion of mere rule and ritual.")&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Canon, these three fetters are eradicated by [[stream-enterer]]s and [[once-returner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 6 and MN 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of ten fetters===
The [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'s [[Dhamma Sangani]] (Dhs. 1113-34) provides an alternate list of ten fetters, also found in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s Culla [[Niddesa]] (Nd2 656, 1463) and in post-[[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[atthakatha|commentaries]].  This enumeration is:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707234429/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2509.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 656, "Saŋyojana" entry] references Cula Niddesa 657, 1463, and Dhamma Sangani 1113.  In fact, an entire chapter of the Dhamma Sangani is devoted to the fetters (book III, ch. V, Dhs. 1113-34), see also Rhys Davids (1900), pp. 297-303. (Rhys Davids, 1900, p. 297, provides the following English translations for these Pali terms:  "sensuality, repulsion, conceit, speculative opinion, perplexity, the contagion of mere rule and ritual, the passion for renewed existence, envy, meanness, ignorance.")  In post-canonical texts, this list can also be found in  [[Buddhaghosa]]'s commentary (in the ''Papañcasudani'') to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]]'s section regarding the six [[ayatana|sense base]]s and the fetters [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wayof.html (Soma, 1998)].&lt;/ref&gt; 
# sensual lust (Pali: ''kāma-rāga'')
# anger (''{{IAST|[[paṭigha]]}}'')
# conceit (''[[māna]]'')
# views (''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'')
# doubt (''[[vicikicchā]]'')
# attachment to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa'')
# lust for existence (''bhava-rāga'')
# jealousy (''[[issā]]'')
# greed (''[[macchariya]]'')
# ignorance (''[[avijjā]]'').
The commentary mentions that views, doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, jealousy and greed are thrown off at the first stage of Awakening (sotāpatti); gross sensual lust and anger by the second stage (sakadāgāmitā) and even subtle forms of the same by the third stage (anāgāmitā); and conceit, lust for existence and ignorance by the fourth and final stage (arahatta).

===Fetters related to householder affairs===

Uniquely, the Sutta Pitaka's  "Householder Potaliya" Sutta ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 54), identifies ''eight'' fetters (including three of [[the Five Precepts]]) whose abandonment "lead[s] to the cutting off of affairs" (''vohāra-samucchedāya saṃvattanti''): 
# destroying life (''{{IAST|pāṇātipāto}}'')
# stealing (''{{IAST|adinnādānaṃ}}'')
# false speech (''musāvādo'')
# slandering (''pisunā'')
# coveting and greed (''giddhilobho'')
# aversion (''nindāroso'')
# anger and malice (''kodhūpāyāso'') 
# conceit (''atimāno'')

For English translations, see &lt;ref&gt;Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 467-469, and [http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/2Majjhima-Nikaya/Majjhima2/054-potaliya-e1.html Upalavanna (''undated'')].

==Individual fetters==
The following fetters are the first three mentioned in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten fetters, and the Sa{{IAST|ṅ}}gīti Sutta's and the Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of "three fetters" (DN 33, Dhs. 1002 ''ff''.).  As indicated below, eradication of these three fetters is a canonical indicator of one's being irreversibly established on the path to [[bodhi|Enlightenment]].

=== Identity view (sakkāya-di{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hi) ===

Etymologically, ''kāya'' means "body," ''sakkāya'' means "existing body," and ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'' means "[[view (Buddhism)|view]]" (here implying a ''wrong'' view, as exemplified by the views in the table below).

In general, "belief in an individual self" or, more simply, "self view" refers to a "belief that in one or other of the [[Skandha|khandha]]s there is a permanent entity, an ''attā''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707211711/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2684.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 660-1, "Sakkāya" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09). See also, ''[[anatta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 2, the Sabbasava Sutta, the Buddha describes "a fetter of views" in the following manner:

{{PaliCanonSamanaViews}}
:"This is how [a person of wrong view] attends inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? ... Shall I be in the future? ... Am I? Am I not? What am I? ...'

:"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: ... 
:*'I have a self...'  
:*'I have no self...' 
:*'It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self...'
:*'It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self...'
:*'It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self...' 
:*'This very self of mine ... is the self of mine that is constant...'
:"This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed ... is not freed, I tell you, from suffering &amp; stress."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Thanissaro (1997a)].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doubt (vicikicchā) ===

In general, "doubt" ([[vicikicchā]]) refers to doubt about the Buddha's teachings, the [[Dhamma]]. (Alternate contemporaneous teachings are represented in the adjacent table.)

More specifically, in [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 22.84, the Tissa Sutta,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.084.than.html Thanissaro (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha explicitly cautions against uncertainty regarding the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], which is described as the right path to Nibbana, leading one past ignorance, sensual desire, anger and despair.

=== Attachment to rites and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāso) ===

''[[Śīla]]'' refers to "moral conduct", ''vata'' (or ''bata'') to "religious duty, observance, rite, practice, custom,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707112213/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:987.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 597, "Vata (2)" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''parāmāsa'' to "being attached to" or "a contagion" and has the connotation of "mishandling" the Dhamma.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120801030825/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:1775.pali ''Ibid.'', p. 421, "Parāmāsa" entry] (retrieved 2008-04-09).&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, ''sīlabbata-parāmāso'' has been translated as "the contagion of mere rule and ritual, the infatuation of good works, the delusion that they suffice"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120718141541/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:236.pali ''Ibid.'', p. 713, "Sīla" entry regarding the  suffix "bbata"] (retrieved 2008-04-09).&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply, "fall[ing] back on attachment to precepts and rules."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an06/an06.055.than.html Thanissaro (1997b)].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the fetter of doubt can be seen as pertaining to the teachings of competing [[shramana|''samana'']] during the times of the Buddha, this fetter regarding rites and rituals likely refers to some practices of contemporary brahmanic authorities.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Gethin (1998), pp. 10-13, for a discussion of the Buddha in the context of the sramanic and brahmanic traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cutting through the fetters ==

"Here, O [[bhikkhu]]s, a bhikkhu understands the eye and material forms and the fetter that arises dependent on both (eye and forms); he understands how the arising of the non-arisen fetter comes to be; he understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be; and he understands how the non-arising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be. [And thus] he understands the ear and sounds .... the organ of smell and odors .... the organ of taste and flavors .... the organ of touch and tactual objects .... [and] consciousness and mental objects ...."
| source = &amp;ndash; ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wayof.html#discourse Soma, 1998, section on "The Six Internal and the Six External Sense-bases."]  It is worth underlining that only the fetter is abandoned, ''not'' the [[ayatana|sense organs]] or sense objects.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
In [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 64, the "Greater Discourse to Mālunkyāputta," the Buddha states that the path to abandoning the five lower fetters (that is, the ''first'' five of the aforementioned "ten fetters") is through using [[jhana]] attainment and [[vipassana]] insights in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 537-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.54, "Abandoning the Fetters," the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[impermanence|impermanent]]" (Pali: ''anicca'') the twelve [[ayatana|sense bases]] (''āyatana''), the associated six sense-consciousness (''{{IAST|viññaṇa}}''), and the resultant [[Sparśa|contact]] (''phassa'') and [[Vedana|sensations]] (''vedanā'').&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1148.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in SN 35.55, "Uprooting the Fetters," the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[Anatta|nonself]]" (''anatta'') the sense bases, sense consciousness, contact and sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1148. Note that the referenced suttas (MN 64, SN 35.54 and SN 35.55) can be seen as overlapping and consistent if one, for instance, infers that one needs to use jhanic attainment and vipassana insight in order to "know and see" the impermanence and selfless nature of the sense bases, consciousness, contact and sensations.  For a correspondence between impermanence and nonself, see [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pali canon traditionally describes cutting through the fetters in [[four stages of enlightenment|four stages]]:
*one cuts the first three fetters (Pali: ''{{IAST|tīṇi saŋyojanāni}}'') to be a [[Sotapanna|"stream enterer" (''sotapanna'')]];
*one cuts the first three fetters and significantly weakens the next two fetters to be a [[Sakadagami|"once returner" (''sakadagami'')]];
*one cuts the first five fetters (''orambhāgiyāni samyojanāni'') to be a [[Anagami|"non-returner" (''anagami'')]];
*one cuts all ten fetters to be an [[arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bhikkhu Bodhi's introduction in Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 41-43.  Bodhi in turn cites, for example, MN 6 and MN 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other core concepts==

Similar Buddhist concepts found throughout the Pali Canon include the [[five hindrances]] (''nīvara{{IAST|ṇ}}āni'') and the ten defilements ([[kilesa|''kilesā'']]). Comparatively speaking, in the [[Theravada]] tradition, fetters span multiple lifetimes and are difficult to remove, while hindrances are transitory obstacles.  Defilements encompass ''all'' mental defilements including both fetters and hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;Gunaratana (2003), dhamma talk entitled "Dhamma [Satipatthana] - Ten Fetters."&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''graded category''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] concept.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[category theory|category]], then a
'''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category'''
is a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[functor]]
&lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Monoid]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s can be thought of as categories with a single [[element (mathematics)|element]]. A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each [[morphism]] is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with [[function composition|composition]], in the sense that compositions have the product grade.

==Definition==

There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above.  A more concrete definition of a semigroup-graded Abelian category is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J. J.|title=Twisted Graded Algebras and Equivalences of Graded Categories|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|date=1 March 1996|volume=s3-72|issue=2|pages=281–311|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-72.2.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Abelian category]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; a [[semigroup]].  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{ S_{g} : g\in G \}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of [[functor]]s from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  If

* &lt;math&gt;S_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity functor on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}S_{h}=S_{gh}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,h\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Full and faithful functors|full and faithful functor]] for every &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;

we say that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category.

'''Hari-Bhari''' (Fertility) is 2000 [[Hindi]] film by [[Shyam Benegal]], starring [[Shabana Azmi]], [[Rajit Kapur]], [[Rajeshwari Sachdev]], [[Surekha Sikri]] and  [[Nandita Das]] in lead roles.

The film revolves around the story of five women, belonging to different generations, each looking emancipation and the right to run their lives their own way. The film's main theme is the issue of women's '[[Reproductive rights|fertility rights]]' empowerment.

The film won the 2000 [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare]].

==Plot==

The movie tells the story of a middle aged Muslim woman Gazala (Shabana Azmi), who is ill-treated by her husband and sent back to her parent's home, just because she is unable to give birth to a son.  Gazala does have a daughter Salma (Rajeshwari Sachdev). The plot revolves around Gazala's stay at her mother's home and the problems faced by the women of the house, being her mother and sisters-in-law. The film is a beautiful description of the problems faced by women in the name of fertility, or in a different sense the urge to have a male child, especially in rural India.[[Shyam Benegal]] provides a masterpiece, reflecting on the sorrowful plight of rural Indian women. The irony lies in the point where the movie begins with a scene which shows a bull being brought to impregnate a buffalo. Five different women, each with a different story depicting the harsh realities of a woman's life.

A '''house mark''' was originally a mark of property, later also used as a family or clan emblem, incised on the facade of a building, on animals, in signet and similar in the farmer and burgher culture of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The tradition originates with the [[mason's mark]]s used in the [[Middle Ages]].

These marks have the appearance of [[glyph]]s or [[Runic script|runes]] consisting of a pattern of simple lines, without the application of colour.

==Background==
The purpose of a house mark is to have a recognisable mark that a person, a nuclear family, multiple generations of an extended family or an owner of a property can use to mark objects, [[cattle]] or buildings for recognition of ownership. The use of house marks dates back to long before [[writing]] was public knowledge.

Besides farmers, house marks have also been used by [[merchant]]s, [[tradesman]], [[artisan]]s and other town [[Citizen#Middle Ages|burgher]]s on for example [[Bryggen]] in [[Bergen]], on building blocks in the [[Nidaros Cathedral]], and on personal [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] in other Norwegian cities. There are also house marks written by hand on documents, for instance house marks of [[mining]] workers at [[Røros]].

The Norwegian word ''b'''o'''merke'' or ''b'''oe'''merke'' probably came from [[Denmark]]. There is no Norwegian reference before the 17th century. Today ''b'''o'''merke'' is mainly written as ''b'''u'''merke'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Both in Denmark and [[Sweden]], the word bomerke (with multiple spellings) is used since the 14th century and in the 16th century. In the [[Iceland]]ic codes of law from the [[Middle Ages]], one finds the word ''einkunn'' used to denote owner marks used to tag animals. It is likely that this word has also been used in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cappelen-krefting.no/hans/bumerkerinorge.htm Hans Cappelen: ''Bumerker i Norge'' (Oslo 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finnish, the word ''puumerkki'' ("insignia") means a distinguishing mark or sign used by illiterate persons as a replacement of a written signature in official documents.

==Description==
The form of house marks is based on function. They should be easy to cut, scratch or engrave with a knife or similar tool. At the same time, they should be distinctive and easy to remember. House marks differ from the more complicated patterns of a [[coat of arms]] or flags, which include surfaces and solid colors.

House marks can be made from one or two lines and up to quite a complex pattern of line figures. Based on appearance, house marks resemble line figures in [[Petroglyph|rock carving]]s and in early [[writing system]]s. It is unclear how extensively such ancient line figures were used as marks for people or property ownership.

The basic forms of a house mark is often [[runic alphabet|runes]], characters and numbers, stylized figures, international symbols like crosses, stars, and [[astrology|astrological]] or [[astronomy|astronomical]] characters.

One characteristic of house marks is that they may consist of a basic form with addition or deduction of lines. In this way, related people can have marks that resemble each other, but differ by details. This is equivalent to [[cadency]] and adding [[Cadency|brisure]]s as a method to change a coat of arms.

Many house marks are placed in [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]]-shaped frames. We see this in seals, on buildings and on [[Headstone|tombstone]]s, for both farmers and city dwellers in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany|German]] areas, during the 1700s and 1800s. Some of these house mark shields also had color and approached the heraldic coat of arms.

In French, '''''jouissance''''' means enjoyment, in terms both of rights and property,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; and of sexual [[orgasm]]—the latter  has a meaning partially lacking in the English word "enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jouissance|work=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=602|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poststructuralism]] has developed the latter sense of ''jouissance'' in complex ways, so as to denote a transgressive, excessive kind of pleasure linked to the division and splitting of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;J.

English editions of the works of [[Jacques Lacan]] have generally left ''jouissance'' untranslated in order to help convey its specialised usage.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacan first developed his concept of an opposition between ''jouissance'' and the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in his Seminar "The Ethics of Psychoanalysis" (1959–1960). Lacan considered that "there is a ''jouissance'' beyond the pleasure principle"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the partial drive; a ''jouissance'' which compels the subject to constantly attempt to transgress the prohibitions imposed on his enjoyment, to go beyond the pleasure principle.

Yet the result of transgressing the pleasure principle, according to Lacan, is not more pleasure but pain, since there is only a certain amount of pleasure that the subject can bear. Beyond this limit, pleasure becomes pain, and this "painful principle" is what Lacan calls ''jouissance''.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (2002) p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''jouissance'' is suffering (''ethics'')—something which may be linked to the influence of the erotic philosophy of [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], epitomised in Lacan's remark about "the recoil imposed on everyone, in so far as it involves terrible promises, by the approach of ''jouissance'' as such".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. xvi and p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan also linked ''jouissance'' to the [[castration complex]],&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 319-24&lt;/ref&gt; and to the aggression of the [[death drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis'' (1992) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In his seminar "The Other Side of Psychoanalysis" (1969–1970) Lacan introduced the concept of "surplus-''jouissance''" (French ''plus-de-jouir'') inspired by [[Marx]]'s concept of [[surplus-value]]: he considered ''[[objet petit a]]'' is the excess of ''jouissance'' which has no use value, and which persists for the mere sake of ''jouissance''.

Lacan considered that ''jouissance'' is essentially [[phallic]], meaning that it does not relate to the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" as such. In his seminar "Encore" (1972–1973), however, Lacan introduced the idea of specifically feminine ''jouissance'', saying that women have "in relation to what the phallic function designates of ''jouissance'', a supplementary ''jouissance''...a ''jouissance'' of the body which is...''beyond the phallus''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Mitchell/J. Rose eds., ''Feminine Sexuality'' (1982) p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This feminine ''jouissance'' is ineffable, for both women and men may experience it but know nothing about it.

== In philosophy and literary theory ==
The Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], a known Lacanian theorist, has adopted the term in his philosophy; it may also be seen in the works, both joint and individual, of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], and it plays an important role in the writing of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Roland Barthes]].

In his 1973 [[literary theory]] book ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'', Barthes divides the effects of texts into two: ''plaisir'' (translated as "pleasure") and ''jouissance''. The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between "readerly" and "writerly" texts. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader's position as a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.

For Barthes ''plaisir'' is, "a pleasure... linked to cultural enjoyment and identity, to the cultural enjoyment of identity, to a homogenising movement of the ego."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. "The Death of the Author." Image—Music—Text. Trans. and ed. Stephen Heath. New York: Hill, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] puts it, "''Plaisir'' results, then, from the operation of the structures of signification through which the subject knows himself or herself; ''jouissance'' fractures these structures."&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In feminist theory ==

The French feminist writer [[Hélène Cixous]] uses the term ''jouissance'' to describe a form of women's pleasure or sexual rapture that combines mental, physical and spiritual aspects of female experience, bordering on mystical communion: "explosion, diffusion, effervescence, abundance...takes pleasure (jouit) in being limitless".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Cixous maintains that ''jouissance'' is the source of a woman's creative power and that the suppression of ''jouissance'' prevents women from finding their own fully empowered voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html Introduction to Cixous&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409090818/http://www.engl.niu.edu/wac/cixous_intro.html |date=2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Popular Culture|author=J. Fiske|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''jouissance'' is explored by Cixous and other authors in their writings on ''[[Écriture féminine]]'', a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s.

Other feminists have argued that [[Freudian]] "hysteria" is ''jouissance'' distorted by patriarchal culture and say that ''jouissance'' is a transcendent state that represents freedom from oppressive linearities. In her introduction to Cixous' ''The Newly Born Woman'', literary critic [[Sandra Gilbert]] writes: "to escape hierarchical bonds and thereby come closer to what Cixous calls ''jouissance'', which can be defined as a virtually metaphysical fulfillment of desire that goes far beyond [mere] satisfaction... [It is a] fusion of the erotic, the mystical, and the political."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sandra M. Introduction. The Newly Born Woman. By Hélène Cixous and Catherine Clement, 1975. Trans. Betsy Wing. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6685">'''Ka Hsaw Wa''' (born 1970) is a Burmese [[human rights]] activist. He is a  member of the [[Karen people|Karen]] [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group. Along with his wife, environmental and human rights attorney [[Katie Redford]], he is the co-founder and co-director of EarthRights International (ERI), an organization that focuses on human rights in Burma and other areas "where protection of human rights and the [[natural environment|environment]] is intrinsically connected."&lt;ref name="earthrights1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthrights.org/misc/ka_hsaw_wa_bio.html |title=Ka Hsaw Wa &amp;#124; EarthRights International |publisher=Earthrights.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ka Hsaw Wa and Katie Redford have two young children.

==Biography==
Ka Hsaw Wa was born under a different name, which he keeps secret in order to protect his family in [[Burma]].  He has not seen his parents in over 15 years. He adopted the name "Ka Hsaw Wa", which means "the White Elephant", while in exile in the United States. White Elephants are traditionally thought of by the [[Karen people]] as symbolizing righteousness and strength as well as a harbinger of great positive change.

Ka Hsaw Wa grew up in [[Burma]] as the son of a doctor and enjoyed relative economic privilege in his youth.  However, when he entered college he soon became active in political causes, and quickly developed into a strong student leader.  The Burmese government [[8888 Uprising|attacked the students brutally in 1988]], killing many.  Ka Hsaw Wa was captured and [[torture]]d.  He then left Burma, but re-entered the country in order to participate in a lengthy photographic campaign documenting environmental and indigenous destruction, as well as severe human rights abuses, including [[starvation]], [[systematic rape]], and the destruction of entire villages.  Most of the problems he documented were connected to the construction and operation of a [[petroleum]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] in the area of [[Yadana]] for the oil companies [[Unocal]] (U.S.-based) and [[Total S.A.]] (based in France).

Ka Hsaw Wa, Katie Redford and EarthRights launched a federal [[Katie Redford#Human Rights Law|lawsuit against Unocal]], employing a unique legal strategy utilizing the U.S. [[Alien Tort Statute]] of 1789, which says that "federal courts have jurisdiction for torts that occur in violation of the [[Law of Nations]], [which] includes abuses of fundamental human rights [and] genocide",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconnection.org/shows/2003/09/20030930_b_main.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001230830/http://www.theconnection.org/shows/2003/09/20030930_b_main.asp |date=October 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to force the company to assume responsibility for human rights abuses caused by its actions. In the case [[Unocal]] eventually agreed to pay compensation to the 15 anonymous villagers who suffered forced labor, rape, and the effects of killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/business/14unocal.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=unocal+settles+burma&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Unocal Settles Rights Suit in Myanmar | date=2004-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka Hsaw Wa continues his front-line activism, and was featured in the 2006 film, ''[[Total Denial]]''. A description based on his role in the film is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ka Hsaw Wa dedicated his life to human rights activism, speaking fluent English and Burmese, dodging back and forth as he plays cat-and-mouse with the border guards, marrying another rights worker and even raising a family. All the while he is fighting to live and protect his homeland. At one point he describes how he was himself tortured. When he goes into difficult areas of the jungle, he takes a gun with a single bullet - to commit suicide if captured (to avoid torture)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0976178/ |title=Total Denial (2006) - IMDb |publisher=Uk.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ka Hsaw Wa and EarthRights are also involved in the current struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma, wherein a number of protesters, including monks, have been killed, and hundreds of protesters arrested.  They are working to bring an end to the current violence against the people. In response to the 2007 protests, Ka Hsaw Wa has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As someone who experienced this regime's brutality in 1988, I am glad that this time around, the world is watching. But that is not enough. The international community, including multinational corporations, must act now to prevent further bloodshed in Burma. The people have suffered profoundly for too long — they have already sacrificed so much, and they will not stop."[http://watsonblogs.org/mak/]

[[File:The looking glass self.png|right|thumb|300px|This drawing depicts the looking-glass self. The person at the front of the image is looking into four mirrors, each of which reflects someone else's image of him back to him.]]

The '''looking-glass self'''&lt;ref&gt;The term is sometimes [[hyphen]]ated in the literature, sometimes not. Compare, for example, the titles of Shaffer (2005) and Yeung &amp; Martin (2003), below.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Social Psychology|social psychological]] concept introduced by [[Charles Cooley|Charles Horton Cooley]] in 1902 (McIntyre 2006). The concept of the looking-glass self describes the development of one's self and of one's identity  through one's interpersonal interactions within the context of society. Cooley clarified that society is an interweaving and inter-working of mental selves. The term "looking glass self" was coined by Cooley in his work, ''Human Nature and the Social Order'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;From Charles Horton Cooley, ''Human Nature and the Social Order'', New York: Scribner's, 1902, pp. 152:&lt;/ref&gt;

The looking-glass self has three major components and is unique to humans (Shaffer 2005). According to Lisa McIntyre’s ''The Practical Skeptic: Core Concepts in Sociology'', the concept of the looking-glass self expresses the tendency for one to understand oneself through their own understanding of the perception which others may hold of them. This process is theorized to develop one's sense of identity. Therefore identity, or [[self]], is the result of learning to see ourselves as others do (Yeung &amp; Martin 2003). 

==Symbolic interaction==
In hypothesizing the framework, "the mind is mental" because "the human mind is social".  From the time they are born, humans define themselves within the context of their social interactions. The child learns that the symbol of his/her crying will elicit a response from his/her caregivers, not only when they are in need of necessities such as food or a diaper change, but also when the child is in need of attention. Schubert references Cooley's ''On Self and Social Organization'', "a growing solidarity between mother and child parallels the child's increasing competence in using significant symbols.  This simultaneous development is itself a  necessary prerequisite for the child's ability to adopt the perspectives of other participants in social relationships and, thus, for the child's capacity to develop a social self."

[[George Herbert Mead]] described the creation of the self as the outcome of "taking the role of the other", the premise for which the self is actualized. Through interaction with others, we begin to develop an identity of our own as well as developing a capacity to empathize with others. As stated by Cooley, "The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind" (Cooley 1964).

==Three main components==
The looking-glass self comprises three main components (Yeung &amp; Martin 2003).{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}

# We imagine how we must appear to others.
# We imagine and react to what we feel their judgment of that appearance must be.
# We develop our self through the judgments of others.

==Studies==
The term "looking-glass self" was coined by Cooley after extensive psychological testing in 1902. In 1976 Arthur L Beaman, [[Edward Diener]], and Soren Svanum  (1979) performed an experiment on the looking-glass self’s effect on children. Another study in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the  context of familial relationships.

===Self reflection study===

On Halloween night, 363 children trick-or-treated at 18 different homes in Seattle, Washington. Each of these 18 homes was selected to take part in the experiment and was in turn arranged in similar ways. In a room near the entry way there was a low table and on it was a large bowl full of bite sized candy. A festive backdrop was also placed in sight of the candy bowl with a small hole for viewing; behind the backdrop was an observer who would record the results of the experiment. The experiment was conducted in the same way at each of the 18 different homes, with each home conducting two different conditions of the experiment, self-awareness manipulation and individuation manipulation. All of the homes conducted both conditions; half of the homes conducting self-awareness manipulation while the other half conducted individuation manipulation. In each of the conditions a woman would answer the door commenting on the children’s costumes and inviting them in. She would then instruct the children to take only one piece of candy from the bowl and excuse herself to another room.

====Self-awareness manipulation====

[[Self-awareness]] manipulation was the first of two conditions performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum’s experiment. The self-awareness manipulation condition was performed with a mirror placed at a ninety degree angle directly behind the entry-way table fifty percent of the time. The mirror was placed in such a way that the children could always see their reflection in the mirror when taking candy from the bowl; the other half of the time there was no mirror in place and the children were left anonymous.

====Individuation manipulation====

There was some concern that the children involved in the study would only see their Halloween costumes and not their own self reflections, so a second condition was performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum's experiment. This second condition was called individuation manipulation. The individuation manipulation condition was performed in the same way as the self-awareness manipulation. After greeting the children the woman at the door would ask each of the children their name and where he or she lived. These questions were asked in such a way that the children would think nothing of it because many other homes asked the children their names on Halloween night; however, no effort was made to identify the children involved. Just as in the first condition, a mirror was used half of the time and was removed for the other half of the experiment.

====Results====

The children involved in the experiment were split into several different categories based on the results of the experiment.   The criteria consisted of age, group size, and gender.  Out of the 363 children involved in the study, 70 children transgressed when instructed not to.  Children who arrived in groups were more likely to transgress than those children who arrived alone; 20.4% to 10.3% respectively.  Children arriving with adults were not included in the study.

====Gender====

The genders of those who participated in the study were recorded by the unobtrusive observer from behind the festive backdrop.  Out of the 363 children, only 326 children’s genders could be determined because they were wearing Halloween costumes.  Of those children whose genders could be determined there were 190 boys and 136 girls.  While Cooley suggests that girls have a far higher impressionable social sensibility it was not the case in this study, as boys transgressed more often than girls.  Fewer boys transgressed with the mirror present, than without; 15.6% to 35.8%. This trend was the same for girls; 8.4% to 13.2%.

====Year====

While the exact age of each child could not be determined due to the children’s anonymity, approximate ages were given to each child by the unobtrusive observer.  The average age of the children was eight years old.  The results of the study were split up into different categories based on the approximate age given to each child.  The age groups were as follows: ages 1–4, 5–8, 9–12 and 13 or older.  The rate of transgression rose with the age of the child; the 1–4 year olds had a rate of transgression of only 6.5% while the 5–8 year olds transgressed 9.7% of the time.  The two older age groups transgressed far more often than the younger groups; children aged 9–12 transgressed 23.6% of the time while the children aged 13 and older had a rate of transgression of 41.9%.

===Family study===
The research article was included in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998.  The researchers, Cook and Douglas, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the  context of familial relationships. The study analyzed the accuracy of a college student's and an adolescent's perceptions of how they are perceived by their parents.  The 51 participants of this study included four family members (mother, father, college student and adolescent) who returned surveys. The families were primarily white and middle class.  The college student and adolescent were paid ten dollars each, if each family member completed the survey.

Three areas were investigated: assertiveness, firmness, and cooperation. In reference to the three areas respondents were asked the following: how they behave toward the target, how the target behaves toward them, and how they think they are viewed by the target. The study identified the looking glass self as a "metaperception" because it involves "perception of perceptions."  One of the hypotheses tested in the study was: If "metaperceptions" cause self-perceptions they will necessarily be coordinated. The hypothesis was tested at the individual and relationship levels of analysis

====Findings====
The study determined that the hypothesis is strongly supported at the individual level for cooperation for both college students and adolescents, but is only partially supported for assertiveness for college students.  Also for college students, at the relationship level with their mothers the study supported assertiveness. There was an irregular finding regarding firmness in the mother-adolescent relationship that indicated that the firmer adolescents were perceived by their mothers, the less firm they rated themselves in the relationship. While there was not strong support of the hypothesis on the relationship level, on the individual level the findings suggest that how college students and adolescents think about themselves is directly correlated to how they think they are perceived by their parents.

==Critical perspectives==

It has been argued that the looking glass self conceptualization of the social self is critically incomplete in that it overlooks the divergent roles of [[ingroups and outgroups]] in self-definition.&lt;ref name="Onorato &amp; Turner (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Onorato | first2 = R. S. | editor1-last = Tyler | editor1-first = T. R. | editor2-last = Kramer | editor2-first = R. M. | editor3-last = John | editor3-first = O. P. | year = 1999 | title = Social identity, personality, and the self-concept: A self-categorization perspective | pages = 11–46 | journal = The psychology of the social self | location = Mahwah, NJ | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it has been demonstrated that while individuals will converge upon the attitudes and behaviours of ingroup members, they will also diverge from the attitudes and behaviours of outgroup members.&lt;ref name="David &amp; Turner (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = David | first1 = B. | last2 = Turner | first2 = J. C. | year = 1992 | title = Studies in self-categorization and minority conversion: Is being a member of the outgroup an advantage? | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 35 | pages = 179–200 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01091.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neglect of the latter scenario is attributed to the looking glass approaches’ implicit focus on ingroup member appraisals. This alternative perspective is derived from the [[self-categorization theory]] analysis of [[social influence]].&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is further argued that the looking glass self metaphor fails to reflect the fact that influence derives from the self-categorization of other individuals as part of the self.&lt;ref name="Onorato &amp; Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=J. C.|title=Some current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories|journal=Social identity|year=1999|pages=6–34|editor1-first=N.|editor1-last=Ellemers|editor2-first=R.|editor2-last=Spears|editor3-first=B.|editor3-last=Doosje|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people are not shaped by the reflections from ‘others’, but rather are shaped by the creation of a collective social identity that contrasts ‘us’ ''against'' relevant ‘others’. Therefore, the concept of self-identity may be considered  an example of a [[Social constructionism|social construction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">'''Material flow accounting''' ('''MFA''') is the study of material flows on a national or regional scale. It is therefore sometimes also referred to as regional, national or economy-wide [[material flow analysis]].

==Introduction==
Material flow accounting provides economy-wide data on material use. Through international standardization, this data has become reliable and comparable across countries.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer-Kowalski, M., Krausmann, F., Giljum, S., Lutter, S., Mayer, A., Bringezu, S., Moriguchi, Y., Schütz, H., Schandl, H., Weisz, H., 2011. Methodology and Indicators of Economy-wide Material Flow Accounting. J. Ind. Ecol. 15, 855–876. http://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/weisz/recent-publications-1/JIEMFAStateoftheart2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat, 2012. Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA) - Compilation Guide 2012. Eurostat, Luxembourg. http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/environmental_accounts/documents/Economy-wide%20material%20flow%20accounts%20compilation%20guide%20%20-.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, the data are also being made available in medium- to long-term time series allowing for the analysis of past trends as well as potential future developments. Material flow accounts provide information on the material inputs into, the changes in material stock within, and the material outputs in the form of exports to other economies or discharges to the environment of an economy. Material flow accounting can be used in national planning, especially for scarce resources, and also allows for forecasting. The method can be used to assess environmental burdens associated with the economic activities of a nation and to determine how material intensive an economy is.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The principle concept underlying MFA is a simple model of this interrelation between the economy and the environment, in which the economy is an embedded subsystem of the environment. Similar to living beings, this subsystem is dependent on a constant throughput of materials and energy. Raw materials, water and air are extracted from the natural system as inputs, transformed into products and finally re-transferred to the natural system as outputs (waste and emissions). In order to highlight the similarity to natural metabolic processes, the terms “industrial” or “societal” metabolism have been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Definition taken from http://www.materialflows.net&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In MFA studies for a region or on a national level the flows of materials between the natural environment and the economy are analyzed and quantified on a physical level. The focus may be on individual substances (e.g. Cadmium flows), specific materials, or bulk material flows (e.g. steel and steel scrap flows within an economy).
Researchers in this field are organized in the Socio-Economic Metabolism (SEM) section&lt;ref&gt;http://isie-sem.blogspot.co.at/&lt;/ref&gt; of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.is4ie.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics related to material flow accounting are usually compiled by national statistical offices, using economic, agricultural and trade statistics measuring the exchange of material between different products available in an economy.

== Scope and Indicators ==
Aside from calculating the '''net additions to stock (NAS)''' as a balancing item, flows within the economy are not considered (advances are currently being made in the field of [[dynamic stock modelling]]). MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, mobilized by humans or by their livestock, with the exception of bulk water and air. The unit of measurement is most commonly (metric) tonnes per year (t/a). Flows are distinguished by whether they are extracted domestically ('''domestic extraction, DE''') or are trade flows ('''imports or exports'''). Materials are most commonly grouped according to four main material categories: biomass, fossil energy carriers, metals, and non-metallic minerals. The former category may be further differentiated by type of use into industrial and construction minerals. It is very important to note that MFA seeks to provide a complete picture of an economy’s material use so that materials are included in these accounts irrespective of whether or not they have direct market value. The most prominent non-market flows covered by MFA are grazed biomass and used crop residues as well as waste rock extracted during mining activities. In 2010, these material flows accounted for 21% of global extraction.
The data collected in MFA is used to calculate several different standardized indicators:
'''Direct Material Input (DMI)''' is a measure of the total material inputs into an economy and is calculated as the sum of domestic extraction (DE) and imports.
The '''Physical Trade Balance (PTB)''' is a measure of net-imports and is calculated as the difference between imports and exports. Reflecting that material and money flow in opposite directions during trade, this is a contrast to the monetary trade balance which calculates net-exports.
'''Domestic Material Consumption (DMC)''' is a measure of apparent consumption and calculated from domestic extraction plus imports minus exports (or DE plus PTB).
Economy-wide MFA is a satellite system to the system of national accounts and provides a rich empirical database for analytical studies. More information on how the statistics are collected, under what legal framework and how they are defined is available on [[Economy-wide material flow accounts]].

In addition, the following indicators are may be used in material flow accounting:

* '''Total Material Requirement (TMR)''' includes the domestic extraction of resources (minerals, fossil fuels, biomass), the indirect flows caused by and associated with the domestic extraction (called "Hidden Flows") and the imports.
* '''Hidden Flows''' are materials that are extracted or moved, but do not enter the economy. According to OECD, the "displacement of environmental assets without absorption into the economic sphere",&lt;ref&gt;OECD Glossary http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6472&lt;/ref&gt; such as overburden from mining operations.
* '''Domestic Processed Output (DPO)''' is defined by the OECD as "the total mass of materials which have been used in the national economy, before flowing into the environment. These flows occur at the processing, manufacturing, use, and final disposal stages of the economic production-consumption chain."&lt;ref&gt;OECD Glossary http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6403&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Total Domestic Output (TDO)''' includes the domestic processed output (DPO) plus the hidden flows associated with the domestic production.
* '''Raw Material Consumption (RMC)''' includes the raw materials that are embodied in traded products (e.g. metal ores from which metals have been extracted). RMC does not include hidden flows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.materialflows.net/background/accounting/indicators-on-the-economy-wide-level/&lt;/ref&gt; RMC is most commonly calculated via [[environmentally extended input-output analysis]].

The '''microscopic scale''' (from {{Lang-el|μικρός}}, ''mikrós'', "small" and σκοπέω, ''skopéō'' "look") is the scale of objects and events smaller than those that can easily be seen by the [[naked eye]], requiring a [[lens (optics)|lens]] or [[microscope]] to see them clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The microscopic scale|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Exploring-with-Microscopes/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/The-microscopic-scale|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=The University of Waikato|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics]], the microscopic scale is sometimes regarded as the scale between the [[macroscopic scale]] and the [[quantum realm|quantum scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reif|first=F.|title=Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics|year=1965|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=007-051800-9|edition=International student edition.|page=2|quote=We shall call a system {{'}}''micro''scopic' (i.e., {{'}}''small'' scale') if it is roughly of atomic dimensions or smaller (say of the order of 10 [[Angstrom|Å]] or less).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic units and measurements are used to classify and describe very small objects.  One common microscopic [[length scale]] unit is the [[micrometre]] (also called a ''micron'') (symbol: μm), which is one millionth of a [[metre]].

==Biology==
By convention, the microscopic scale also includes classes of objects that are most commonly too small to see but of which some members are large enough to be observed with the eye. Such groups include the ''[[Cladocera]]'', planktonic green [[algae]] of which ''[[Volvox]]'' is readily observable, and the protozoa of which ''[[Stentor (protozoa)|stentor]]'' can be easily seen without aid.
The submicroscopic scale similarly includes objects that are too small to see with an [[optical microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9244">'''Model-based enterprise''' (MBE) is a term used in manufacturing, to describe a strategy where an annotated digital three-dimensional (3D) [[3D modeling#Models|model]] of a product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in that [[Product lifecycle|product's lifecycle]].&lt;ref name=NIST1753&gt;[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1753.pdf "Model Based Enterprise / Technical Data Package Summit Report"]. NIST Technical Note 1753. Retrieved 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Isha|title=3D Product &amp; Manufacturing Information Implications for Design for Manufacturing|url=https://www.pddnet.com/article/2016/03/3d-product-manufacturing-information-implications-design-manufacturing|website=Product Design and Development|publisher=Advantage Business Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage of MBE is that it replaces 2D drawings. In MBE, a single 3D model contains all the information typically found on in an entire set of engineering drawings, including geometry, topology, dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, and weld call-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Chad|title=The Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Study|url=http://www.lifecycleinsights.com/study/the-model-based-enterprise-mbe-study/|website=Lifecycle Insights|publisher=Lifecycle Insights|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBE was originally championed by the aerospace and defense industries, with the automotive industry following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Scott|title=Model Based Enterprise|url=http://www.aiag.org/quality/model-based-enterprise/model-based-enterprise|website=aiag|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adopted by many manufacturers around the world, in a wide range of industries. Significant benefits for manufacturers include reduced time to market and savings in production costs from improved tool design and fabrication, fewer overall assembly hours, less rework, streamlined development and better collaboration on engineering changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Model-based enterprise|url=http://searchmanufacturingerp.techtarget.com/definition/model-based-enterprise|website=TechTarget|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two prerequisites to implementing MBE: The first is the creation of annotated 3D models, known as a [[Model-based definition|Model-based definitions (MBD)]]. This requires the use of a [[Computer aided design|CAD]] system capable of creating precise [[Solid modeling|solid models]], with [[Product and manufacturing information|product and manufacturing information (PMI)]], a form of 3D annotation which may include dimensions, [[Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing|GD&amp;T]], notes, surface finish, and material specifications. (The mechanical CAD systems used in aerospace, defense, and automotive industries generally have these capabilities.) The second prerequisite is transforming MBDs into a form where they can be used in downstream lifecycle activities. As a rule, CAD models are stored in proprietary data formats, so they must be translated to a suitable MBD-compatible standard format, such as 3D [[PDF]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dpdfconsortium.org/ 3D PDF Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; [[JT (visualization format)|JT]], [[ISO 10303|STEP AP 242]], or [[ANSI]] QIF&lt;ref&gt;[http://qifstandards.org "Quality Information Framework"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The core MBE tenet is that models are used to drive all aspects of the product lifecycle and that data is created once and reused by all downstream data consumers. Data reusability requires [[Machine-Readable Documents|computer interpretability]], where an MBD can be processed directly by downstream applications, and associativity of PMI to specific model features within the MBD.&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt;

==History==

Historically, engineering and manufacturing activities have relied on hardcopy and/or digital documents (including 2D [[Engineering drawing|drawings]]) to convey engineering data and drive manufacturing processes. These documents required interpretation by skilled practitioners, often leading to ambiguities and errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ambiguity in drawing| url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/sota/tracey/journal/ambi/images/Willats.pdf|author=John Willats|publisher=TRACEY the online journal of contemporary drawing research |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tandler|first1=Bill|title=GD&amp;T Workshop: A Top Down View|url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/88676-gd-t-workshop-a-top-down-view|website=Quality Magazine|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, improvements in 3D [[solid modeling]] made it possible for CAD systems to precisely represent the shape of most manufactured goods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weisberg, David|title=The Engineering Design Revolution|url=http://www.cadhistory.net/16%20Parametric%20Technology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—however, even enthusiastic adopters of solid modeling technology continued to rely upon 2D drawings (often CAD generated) as the authority (or master) product representation. 3D models, even if geometrically accurate, lacked a method to represent dimensions, tolerances, and other annotative information required to drive manufacturing processes.

In the early-to-middle 2000s, the [[ASME Y14.41-2003| ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16792:2006 Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/31065.html|publisher=ISO TC 10 Technical product documentation |accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; standards were released, providing support for PMI annotations in 3D CAD models, and introducing the concept of MBD (or, alternatively, digital product definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Quality Assurance Standard For Digital Product Definition At Boeing Suppliers |url= http://www.boeingsuppliers.com/supplier/D6-51991.pdf|publisher=Boeing D6-51991|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model-based enterprise concept first appeared about 2005. Initially it was construed broadly, referring to the pervasive use of modeling and simulation technologies (of almost any type) throughout an enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Richard, [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2005/systems/wednesday/neal.pdf "Next Generation Manufacturing Technology Initiative and the Model-Based Enterprise"], NDIA Systems Engineering Conference, San Diego, California October 26, 2005. Retrieved on 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s, An active community advocating development of MBE grew, based on the collaborative efforts of the Office of the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Army Research Laboratory]], [[ARDEC|Armament Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC)]], [http://www.armymantech.com/ Army ManTech], [[BAE Systems]], [[NIST]], and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leonarf|first1=Scott|title=Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Strategic Baseline|url=https://www.dodmantech.com/JDMTP/Files/AME_Strategic_Baseline_03_Nov_11.pdf|website=DoD ManTech|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "MBE Team" included industry participants such as [[General Dynamics]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] [[Rocketdyne]], Elysium, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], EOS, ITI TranscenData, Vistagy, [[PTC (software company)|PTC]], [[Dassault Systemes]] Delmia, [[Boeing]], and [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref name=osd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittenburg|first1=Mitzi|title=Model Based Enterprise and its Impact on Small Businesses|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/councils/marc/resources/201103-model-based-enterprise.pdf|website=osd.mil|publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, based on community feedback, MBE became more narrowly construed, referring to the use of MBD data to drive product lifecycle activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frechette|first1=S|title=Model Based Enterprise for Manufacturing|url=http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=908343|website=NIST|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt; In 2011, the MBE Team published these definitions:

* MBD: A 3D annotated model and its associated data elements that fully define the product definition in a manner that can be used effectively by all downstream customers in place of a traditional drawing.
* MBE: A fully integrated and collaborative environment founded on 3D product definition detail and shared across the enterprise; to enable rapid, seamless, and affordable deployment of products from concept to disposal&lt;ref name=osd /&gt;

By 2015, with improvements to ASME Y14.41 and ISO 16792, and the development of open [[CAD data exchange]] standards capable of adequately representing PMI, MBE started to become more widely adopted by manufacturers.

'''Monica Seles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-hu|Szeles Mónika}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈsɛlɛʃ ˈmoːnikɒ|pron}}; {{lang-sr|Monika Seleš, Моника Селеш}}; born December 2, 1973) is a retired American and Yugoslav professional tennis player, who last represented the United States and is also a member of the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]. An ethnic [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], she was born and raised in [[Novi Sad]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. She became a naturalized [[American citizen]] in 1994 and also received Hungarian citizenship in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Grossly Abbreviated|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Gross/2007/07/01/4305162-sun.html |work=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |date=2007-07-01|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titokban lett magyar állampolgár Szeles Mónika (Szeles Mónika has become a Hungarian citizen in secret) |work=[[Heti Világgazdaság]] |language=Hungarian |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20070607_szeles_monika_allampolgar.aspx?s=24h |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world no. 1]], she won nine [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, eight of them as a teenager while representing Yugoslavia, and the final one while representing the United States.

In 1990, Seles became the youngest ever [[1990 French Open|French Open]] champion at the age of 16. She went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday and was the year-end world no. 1 in 1991 and 1992. However, on April 30, 1993, she was the victim of an on-court attack, when a man stabbed her in the back with a {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}} long knife. Seles did not return to tennis for over two years.&lt;ref name="stabbed"/&gt; Though she enjoyed some success after rejoining the tour in 1995, including a fourth [[1996 Australian Open|Australian Open title in 1996]], she was unable to consistently reproduce her best form. She played her last professional match at the [[2003 French Open]], but did not officially retire until February 2008.

Regarded by many in the sport as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future – Monica Seles|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2079150_2079148_2079130,00.html|publisher=''TIME''|accessdate=August 19, 2011|author=William Lee Adams|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several players and historians have stated that Seles had the potential to become the most accomplished female player of all time had she not been stabbed.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/05/monica-seles-interview |title=Interview: Monica Seles |first=Tim |last=Adams |work=theguardian.com |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espnw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/04/20-years-later-remembering-monica-seless-stabbing/47277/ |title=20 Years Later: Remembering Monica Seles' Stabbing |first=Jonathan |last=Scott |work=Tennis.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

==Early life and career==
Seles was born in Yugoslavia into an [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|ethnic Hungarian]] family. Her parents are Ester and Karolj&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/7354|title=Players|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has an older brother, Zoltán. She began playing tennis at age five, coached by her father, a professional [[cartoonist]] employed for decades at the ''[[Dnevnik (Serbia)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Magyar Szó]]'' newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/03/najbolja-jugoslovenska-teniserka-monika.html Najbolja jugoslovenska teniserka Monika Seleš (1.deo) – Naša Mala Mo!];''Studio'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; who drew pictures for her to make her tennis more fun. He is responsible for developing her two-handed style for both the forehand and backhand.&lt;ref&gt;Seles, Monica with Nancy Ann Richardson (1996) Monica From Fear to Victory&lt;/ref&gt; Later, her coach was [[Jelena Genčić]]. In 1985, at the age of 11, she won the [[Junior Orange Bowl]] tournament in [[Miami]], Florida, catching the attention of tennis coach [[Nick Bollettieri]]. In early 1986, Seles and her brother Zoltán moved from Yugoslavia to the United States, and Seles enrolled at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, where she trained for two years and continued to practice until March 1990. Nine months after their arrival at the Academy, Seles' mother and father joined her and Zoltán in Florida.

Seles played her first professional tournament as an amateur in 1988 at age 14. The following year she turned professional on February 13, 1989, and joined the professional tour full-time, winning her first career title at [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in May 1989, where she beat the soon-to-retire [[Chris Evert]] in the final. A month later, Seles reached the semifinals of her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles tournament at the French Open, losing to then-world no. 1 Steffi Graf. Seles finished her first year on the tour ranked world no. 6.

==Tennis career==

===1990–92===
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--only one citation in section--&gt;
After a slow start at the beginning of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title at the [[1990 French Open]]. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four set points in a first-set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months. Her winning streak was stopped by [[Zina Garrison]] at Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, where Seles had a match point before Garrison eventually won 9–7 in the 3rd set. Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], defeating [[Gabriela Sabatini]] in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships. She finished the year ranked world no. 2.

1991 was the first of two years in which Seles dominated the women's tour. She started out by winning the Australian Open in January, beating [[Jana Novotná]] in the final. In March, she replaced Graf as the world no. 1. She then successfully defended her French Open title, beating the former youngest-ever winner, [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], in the final. Unable to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], suffering from [[shin splints]], Seles took a six-week break. But she was back in time for the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], which she won by beating [[Martina Navratilova]] in the final, her third Grand Slam title of the year, to cement her position at the top of the world rankings. She also won the year-end Virginia Slims Championships for the second consecutive time, defeating Navratilova in four sets. At the end of season, Seles had won 10 out of the 16 tournaments she entered (reaching the final of every tournament that she entered that year). She ended the year as the no. 1 ranked player in the world.

1992 was an equally dominant year. Seles successfully defended her titles at the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. She also reached her first-ever final at Wimbledon, but lost to Graf. During Wimbledon, Seles encountered difficulty because of her habit of grunting or shrieking loudly when hitting shots. Her quarterfinal opponent [[Nathalie Tauziat]] was the first to complain to the chair umpire about it. During the third set of her semi-final match against [[Martina Navratilova]], Navratilova also complained to the chair umpire about the grunting after Seles went up a break at 4–2. Seles ended up losing the game and the break, but broke back and closed out the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-03/sports/sp-1393_1_monica-seles |title=WIMBLEDON : Seles Quiets Navratilov |first=Thomas |last=Bonk |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1992-07-03 |access-date=2018-04-28 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1991 through February 1993, Seles won 22 titles and reached 33 finals out of the 34 tournaments she played. She compiled a 159–12 win-loss record (92.9% winning percentage), including a 55–1 win-loss record (98%) in Grand Slam tournaments. In the broader context of her first four years on the circuit (1989–1992), Seles had a win-loss record of 231–25 (90.2%) and collected 30 titles. She once again ended the year as the #1 ranked player in the world.

===1993 stabbing attack===
Seles was the top ranked women's player heading into 1993, having won the [[French Open]] for three consecutive years and both the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Australian Open]] in consecutive years. In January 1993, Seles defeated Graf in the final of the Australian Open, which to date was her third win in four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finals against Graf. She then won the Virginia Slims of Chicago over Martina Navratilova in three sets. This was the last title that Seles won before the attack in Hamburg, Germany.

On April 30 during a quarterfinal match with [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in [[WTA Hamburg|Hamburg]] in which Seles was leading, Günter Parche, an obsessed fan of Steffi Graf, ran from the middle of the crowd to the edge of the court during a break between games and stabbed Seles with a [[boning knife]] between her shoulder blades, to a depth of 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.59&amp;nbsp;inches). She was quickly taken to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the [[Yugoslav Wars|ongoing conflict there]]. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.&lt;ref name=stabbed&gt;{{cite news|title=1993: Tennis star stabbed |work=On This Day 30&amp;nbsp;April 1993 |publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/30/newsid_2499000/2499161.stm |date=1993-04-30 |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parche was charged following the incident, but was not jailed because he was found to be psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and psychological treatment. The incident prompted a significant increase in the level of security at tour events.&lt;ref name=stabbed /&gt; At that year's [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the players’ seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying "From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =O'Sullivan | first =John | title =Seles still has issues with security | work=The Irish Times | date =2011-04-09 | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0409/1224294297903.html | accessdate =2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the [[German legal system]]. "What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wood |title=WTA Under Fire from Seles |date=November 16, 2000 |publisher=BBC |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/1025898.stm |work=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, ''Tennis.com'' reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Graf visited Seles while she was hospitalized.&lt;ref name=articletwo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/05/navratilova-seles-would-have-won-most-slams/47293/ |title=Navratilova: Seles would have won most Slams |first=Matt |last=Cronin |work=Tennis.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young Elders]], a band from Melbourne, Australia, sent their song called "Fly Monica Fly" to Seles while she was recuperating from the stabbing incident. She later said that the song provided inspiration to her at that time, and subsequently met the band (who later changed their name to the Monicas) following her victory at the Australian Open in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1996|title=Monica: From Fear to Victory| first1= Monica | last1= Seles| first2= Nancy Ann | last2= Richardson

The WTA suggested that Seles' [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|No. 1 ranking]] be preserved during her absence, but did not do so.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=8 July 2015 |publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=78|title=Comeback: Back stabbers |date=31 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Seles' autobiography, all active tour players opposed the idea except [[Gabriela Sabatini]], who abstained.&lt;ref name="it61008"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/seles-is-back-in-the-limelight-1.61008|title=Seles is back in the limelight|date=26 June 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canchallena"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170730063335/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |archivedate= 30 July 2017|url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1630170-gaby-sabatiniahora-disfruto-de-todo-lo-que-no-hice-cuando-jugaba |language=Spanish |title=Gaby Sabatini.

===Comeback===
Seles returned to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president [[Martina Navratilova]] proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] and [[Gigi Fernández]], whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/sports/tennis-it-s-not-easy-being-the-third-wheel.html | title=NY Times: It's not easy being a third wheel | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not be determined by the minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required of everyone else. Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings.&lt;ref name="newyork1995"/&gt; Seles won her first comeback tournament, the [[1995 Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]], beating [[Amanda Coetzer]] in the final and setting a tournament record for the fewest number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).

The following month at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Seles reached the final defeating world No.10 [[Anke Huber]], No. 4 Jana Novotná, and No. 3 Conchita Martínez (all in straight sets), but lost to Graf in the final.

In January 1996, Seles won her fourth Australian Open, beating Anke Huber in the final. Her pivotal match was the semifinal vs rising American star Chanda Rubin who led her 5–3 in the final set, and had 2 break points to lead 5–1. Seles came back from 2 points from defeat to triumph and reach the final. This was to be Seles' last [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title, as she struggled to recapture her best form on a consistent basis. Seles was the runner-up at the US Open to Steffi Graf again in 1996. Seles' last Grand Slam final came at the French Open in 1998, just a few weeks after the death of her father and former coach, Karolj, from cancer. In the run to the final she had defeated world no. 3 [[Jana Novotná]] in three sets and world no. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] in straight sets, but lost to Sánchez Vicario in the three-set final.

While she did not reach another [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles final, she did consistently reach the quarterfinal and semifinal stages in those tournaments and was a fixture in the WTA Tour's top 10. In 2002, her last full year on the tour, she finished the year ranked world no. 7, defeated [[Venus Williams]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Jennifer Capriati]], [[Justine Henin]], [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Kim Clijsters]], and [[Lindsay Davenport]], and reached at least the quarterfinals at each Grand Slam tournament.

Seles competed at the [[Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|1996 Olympic Games]] in Atlanta, where she beat Sabatini in a third round match before losing to Jana Novotná in the quarterfinals. Four years later, at the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Seles captured her first Olympic medal, a bronze in singles. She defeated [[Jelena Dokic]] in the bronze medal match, after pushing eventual gold medalist Venus Williams to a tough 3 setter in the semis, losing 6–3 in the final set.

After becoming a U.S. citizen in 1994, Seles helped the U.S. team win the [[Fed Cup]] in 1996, 1999, and 2000.

===Hiatus and retirement===
[[File:Monica Seles.jpg|thumb|160px|Seles in the 2007 exhibition against [[Martina Navratilova]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]]]
In the spring of 2003, Seles sustained a foot injury. She was forced to withdraw during the second set of a match against [[Nadia Petrova]] at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]]. Then, a couple of weeks later and still injured, she lost in straight sets to the same player in the first round of the [[2003 French Open]]. It was the only time she ever lost a first-round match at a Grand Slam. She never again played an official tour match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/PlayerActivity.asp?PlayerID=190141 Monica Seles playing activity] [[WTA Tour]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, Seles played two exhibition matches in New Zealand against Navratilova. Despite losing both matches, she played competitively and announced that she could return to the game early in 2006; however, she did not do so. She played three exhibition matches against Navratilova in 2007. On April 5, she defeated Navratilova in Houston, Texas, on [[clay court|clay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 Seles Sighting: Monica plays Martina in exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209034256/http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=73172 |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, Seles defeated Navratilova on an indoor court in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. On September 16, she beat her on clay in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstennisblog.com/2007/09/17/monica-seles-defeats-martina-navratilova-in-exhibition-match-in-bucharest |title=Monica Seles defeats Martina Navratilova in exhibition match in Bucharest |publisher=Womenstennisblog.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Seles told the press that [[Lindsay Davenport]]'s successful return to the tour had inspired her to consider her own limited comeback to play [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and the major warm-up events for those tournaments. However, on February 14, 2008, Seles announced her official retirement from professional tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2045 |title=Seles Announces Retirement From Professional Tennis |publisher=Sonyericssonwtatour.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Seles was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/sports/tennis/16tennis.html?_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Seles Is Elected to Hall of Fame | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===

Seles was listed at #19.

Seles won eight Grand Slam titles during her teenage years. However, her career was greatly affected by the stabbing incident. Some involved with the sport have declared that Seles could have become the most accomplished female player. In an article written 20 years after Seles was stabbed, Jonathan Scott of ''Tennis.com'' stated, "Would Monica Seles have been the greatest female tennis player ever? The world will never know."&lt;ref name=article/&gt; In a 2013 interview, Martina Navratilova theorized that if Seles had not been stabbed, "We'd be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] [[Margaret Court]] or Steffi Graf."&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Mary Joe Fernandez declared that Seles would have at least doubled her Grand Slam championship tally, had she not been attacked.&lt;ref name=espnw/&gt; Tim Adams of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Seles would have become "the greatest female tennis player ever to pick up a racket."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

During the height of her career (the 1990 French Open through the 1993 Australian Open), she won eight of the 11 Grand Slam singles tournaments she contested. With eight Grand Slam singles titles before her 20th birthday, Seles holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a teenager in the Open Era.

Until her loss to [[Martina Hingis]] at the [[1999 Australian Open]], Seles had a perfect record at the event (33–0), which is the longest undefeated streak for this tournament (although Margaret Court won 38 consecutive matches there from 1960 to 1968 after losing a match in 1959). It also marked her first defeat in Australia, having won the [[Medibank International|Sydney tournament]] in 1996. Seles was the first female tennis player to win her first six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals: [[1990 French Open]], [[1991 Australian Open]], [[1991 French Open]], [[1991 US Open (tennis)|1991 US Open]], [[1992 Australian Open]], and [[1992 French Open]]. Seles was also the first female player since [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] in 1937 to win the women's singles title three consecutive years at the French Open, a feat subsequently achieved by [[Justine Henin]] in 2005-7. (Also, [[Chris Evert]] won the title in four consecutive appearances in 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980).

Shortly after her retirement, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jon Wertheim]] summed up her later career:
{{quote|Yet, transformed from champion to tragedienne, Seles became far more popular than she was while winning all those titles. It became impossible to root against her. At first, out of sympathy. Then, because she revealed herself to be so thoroughly thoughtful, graceful, dignified. When she quietly announced her retirement last week at age 34, she exited as perhaps the most adored figure in the sport's history. As happy endings go, one could do worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/jon_wertheim/02/20/mailbag/index.html |title=Tennis Mailbag: Saluting Seles |first=Jon |last=Wertheim |work=SportsIllustrated.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] on July 11, 2009. In 2011, Seles was named one of the "30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

==Equipment and endorsements==
In the early 1990s, Seles signed a $4-million endorsement contract with [[Fila (company)|Fila]] to promote its footwear and tennis apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-26/business/fi-640_1_tennis-star |title=Athletic Firms Going to the Net in Quest for Next Tennis Celebrity |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=June 26, 1990 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She used a [[Prince original graphite]] racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/finding-the-spin/story-fnay3ubk-1226410204866?nk=ff5b5e1a7e3b23eca0390c14fd756c7e |title=Finding the spin may be a racquet |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=June 30, 2012 |first=Tom |last= Perrotta |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the 1990 season, Seles switched to a Yonex racquet.

When she returned to the tour in 1995 after the stabbing sabbatical, Seles wore apparel by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and used a Yonex racquet on court.

In the 2000s, Seles wore apparel by Yonex and used [[Yonex]] SRQ Ti-800 Pro Long racquet on court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2000/08/20000828/No-Topic-Name/WHAT-THEYRE-WEARING-AND-HITTING-WITH-AT-THE-US-OPEN.aspx |title=WHAT THEY'RE WEARING (AND HITTING WITH) AT THE U.S. OPEN |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |date=28 August 2000 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On April 21, 2009, Seles released her [[memoir]] ''Getting A Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self'' which chronicles her bout with depression and [[binge eating disorder]] (BED) after her stabbing, her father's [[cancer]] diagnosis and eventual death, her journey back to the game and a life beyond tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103289593|title=Monica Seles On 'Getting A Grip' After Tragedy|newspaper=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seles is married to businessman [[Tom Golisano]],&lt;ref name= yacht&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/21404458/billionaire-thomas-golisano-husband-monica-seles-suing-yacht-renovations | agency= Associated Press| title= Former Sabres owner Thomas Golisano sues over yacht renovations| date= November 17, 2017 | location= Rochester, New York | website= ESPN.com| access-date= January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is 32 years her senior.

As of 2015, Seles is a paid spokesperson for Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the first drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to treat BED, to raise awareness of the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal amounts of food at meals, and then secretly eat large amounts of junk food when she was alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/03/08/monica-seles-gabriela-sabatini-exhibition-new-york/24609499/|title=Monica Seles sheds light on binge eating disorder|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|author=Casey, Tim|language=en| date=Mar 11, 2015|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1996, Seles made a guest appearance in the TV sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Nanny|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=opksAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pfwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5821,68672&amp;dq=monica+seles+the-nanny&amp;hl=en|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=March 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in 2008 in the TV series ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' as one of the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Dancing Stars Monica Seles and Cristian de la Fuente|url=http://www.tvguide.com/dancing-stars/meet-dancing-stars-10240.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=TV Guide|date=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by persistent [[grandiosity]], excessive need for [[admiration]], and a personal disdain and lack of [[empathy]] for others.&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=5th |location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–72|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ronningstam2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2016|title=New Insights Into Narcissistic Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/new-insights-narcissistic-personality-disorder|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]]|volume=33|issue=2|page=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of superiority, and they seek to establish [[abusive power and control]] over others.&lt;ref name="pmid21430487"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2011|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Clinical Perspective|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Practice]]|volume=17|issue=2|pages=89–99|doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000396060.67150.40|pmid=21430487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder - Symptoms &amp; causes|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=November 18, 2017|accessdate=June 28, 2018|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego ([[self-concept]]), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

The [[DSM-5]] indicates that persons with NPD usually display some or all of the following symptoms, typically without the commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

# Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from other people
# Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.
# Self-perception of being unique, superior, and associated with high-status people and institutions
# Needing continual admiration from others
# Sense of [[entitlement]] to special treatment and to obedience from others
# Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain
# Unwilling to empathize with the feelings, wishes, and needs of other people
# Intensely envious of others, and the belief that others are equally envious of them
# Pompous and arrogant demeanor

Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; It is not uncommon for children and adolescents to display traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and below the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they significantly impair the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

===Associated features===
People with NPD tend to exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their level of intimacy with people they consider high-status. This sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; or to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation,&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be [[control freak|controlling]], blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others' views, unaware of others' needs and the effects of their behavior on others, and insist that others see them as they wish to be seen.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate, insult, and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality|first=Elsa F|last=Ronningstam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of [[shame]], humiliation, and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; The merging of the "inflated self-concept" and the "actual self" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of [[denial]], [[idealization and devaluation]].&lt;ref name="pmid16937998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Siegel|first=Judith P.|date=|year=2006|title=Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders|url=|journal=[[Journal of Family Psychology]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=418–22|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.3.418|pmid=16937998|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DSM-5: "Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder."&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Due to the high-functionality associated with narcissism, some people may not view it as an impairment in their lives.&lt;ref name="ronningstam" /&gt; Although overconfidence tends to make individuals with NPD ambitious, it does not necessarily lead to success and high achievement professionally. These individuals may be unwilling to compete or may refuse to take any risks in order to avoid appearing like a failure.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; In addition, their inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements, or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional relationships with superiors and colleagues.&lt;ref name="gol2"&gt;{{citation|last=Golomb|first=Elan|title=Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self|volume=|page=22|pages=|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Experts tend to apply a [[biopsychosocial model]] of causation,&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paris|first=Joel|date=|year=2014|title=Modernity and narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=220–226|doi=10.1037/a0028580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a combination of environmental, social, genetic and neurobiological factors are likely to play a role in formulating a narcissistic personality.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

=== Genetic ===
There is evidence that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals are much more likely to develop NPD if they have a family history of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;&lt;ref name= Torgersen/&gt; Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high [[heritability]] for narcissistic personality disorder.&lt;ref name="Torgersen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torgersen|first1=Svenn|last2=Lygren|first2=Sissel|last3=Øien|first3=Per Anders|last4=Skre|first4=Ingunn|last5=Onstad|first5=Sidsel|last6=Edvardsen|first6=Jack|last7=Tambs|first7=Kristian|last8=Kringlen|first8=Einar|date=December 2000|title=A twin study of personality disorders.|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|volume=41|issue=6|pages=416–25|doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560|pmid=11086146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichborn-Kjennerud|first1=Ted|date=1 March 2010|title=The genetic epidemiology of personality disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181941/pdf/DialoguesClinNeurosci-12-103.pdf|journal=[[Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–14|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181941|pmid=20373672|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the specific [[genes]] and [[Epistasis|gene interactions]] that contribute to its cause—and how they may influence the developmental and physiological processes underlying this condition—have yet to be determined.

=== Environment ===
Environmental and social factors are also thought to have a significant influence on the onset of NPD.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to their primary caregivers, usually their parents.&lt;ref name="Magid"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Magid|title=High risk children without a conscience|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/High_Risk.html?id=88C74pQcIm4C|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=1987|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-553-05290-X|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in the child's perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted.&lt;ref name="Johns"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen M. Johnson|title=Humanizing the narcissistic style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxV2QgAACAAJ|accessdate=29 October 2013|date=1 May 1987|publisher=W.W.

According to Leonard Groopman and Arnold Cooper, the following have been identified by various researchers as possible factors that promote the development of NPD:&lt;ref name="AMN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder|author1=Groopman|first=Leonard C.|author2=Cooper|first2=Arnold M.|date=|year=2006|work=Personality Disorders – Narcissistic Personality Disorder|publisher=Armenian Medical Network|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515054225/http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|archivedate=15 May 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An oversensitive [[temperament]] (personality traits) at birth.
* Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback.
* Excessive [[praise]] for good behaviors or excessive [[criticism]] for bad behaviors in childhood.
* Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents, other family members, or peers.
* Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or abilities by adults.
* Severe [[emotional abuse]] in childhood.
* Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents.
* Learning [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviors from parents or peers.
* Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own [[self-esteem]].

Cultural elements are believed to influence the prevalence of NPD as well since NPD traits have been found to be more common in modern societies than in traditional ones.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
There is little research into the neurological underpinnings of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of [[gray matter]] in the left anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name="Schulze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulze|first=Lars|last2=Dziobek|first2=Isabel|last3=Vater|first3=Aline|last4=Heekeren|first4=Hauke R.|last5=Bajbouj|first5=Malek|last6=Renneberg|first6=Babette|last7=Heuser|first7=Isabella|last8=Roepke|first8=Stefan|date=|year=2013|title=Gray matter abnormalities in patients with narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Research]]|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1363–69|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.05.017|pmid=23777939|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychCentral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|title=Narcissists’ Lack of Empathy Tied to Less Gray Matter|last=Pedersen|first=Traci|date=6 October 2015|website=|publisher=[[PsychCentral]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424210941/http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|archivedate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-04-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nenadic|first1=Igor|last2=Güllmar|first2=Daniel|last3=Dietzek|first3=Maren|last4=Langbein|first4=Kerstin|last5=Steinke|first5=Johanna|last6=Gader|first6=Christian|date=February 2015|title=Brain structure in narcissistic personality disorder: A VBM and DTI pilot study|url=|journal=[[Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging]]|publisher=Elsevier Ireland|volume=231|issue=2|pages=184–86|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2014.11.001|pmid=25492857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain regions identified in the above studies are associated with [[empathy]], [[compassion]], [[emotional regulation]], and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronningstam|first1=Elsa|date=19 January 2016|title=Pathological Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Recent Research and Clinical Implications|url=http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports|volume=3|issue=1|pages=34–42|doi=10.1007/s40473-016-0060-y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817021647/http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|archive-date=17 August 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-5===
The formulation of narcissistic personality disorder in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s (APA) [[DSM-IV-TR|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', 4th Edition, Text Revision]] (DSM-IV-TR) was criticised for failing to describe the range and complexity of the disorder. Critics said it focuses overly on "the narcissistic individual's external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns—at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering", which they argued reduced its clinical utility.&lt;ref name="ronningstam"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2010|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Current Review|url=|journal=[[Current Psychiatry Reports]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=68–75|doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0084-z|pmid=20425313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group originally proposed the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in [[DSM-5]] as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DSM-5: Proposed Revisions: Personality and Personality Disorders|date=2010-02-13|publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]''|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203170307/http://www.dsm5.org/PROPOSEDREVISIONS/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20223959"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holden|first=Constance|date=|title=Psychiatry.

Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shedler|first=Jonathan|last2=Beck|first2=Aaron|last3=Fonagy|first3=Peter|last4=Gabbard|first4=Glen O.|last5=Gunderson|first5=John|author-link5=John G.

===ICD-10===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) [[ICD-10|''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'', 10th Edition]] (ICD-10) lists narcissistic personality disorder under ''Other specific personality disorders''. It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#General diagnostic criteria 2|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Subtypes===
While the DSM-5 regards narcissistic personality disorder as a homogeneous syndrome, there is evidence for variations in its expression.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; In a 2015 paper, two major presentations of narcissism are typically suggested, an "overt" or "grandiose" subtype, characterized by grandiosity, arrogance, and boldness, and a "covert" or "vulnerable" subtype characterized by defensiveness and hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; Those with "narcissistic grandiosity" express behavior "through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pincus|first=Aaron L.|last2=Emily B.|first2=Ansell|last3=Pimentel|first3=Claudia A.|last4=Cain|first4=Nicole M.|last5=Wright|first5=Aidan G. C.|last6=Levy|first6=Kenneth N.|date=|year=2009|title=Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory|url=|journal=[[Psychological Assessment (journal)|Psychological Assessment]]|volume=21|issue=3|pages=365–79|doi=10.1037/a0016530|pmid=19719348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] described the subtype, which he referred to as the "oblivious" subtype as being grandiose, arrogant, and thick-skinned. The subtype of "narcissistic vulnerability" entails (on a conscious level) "helplessness, emptiness, low self-esteem, and shame, which can be expressed in the behavior as being socially avoidant in situations where their self-presentation is not possible so they withdraw, or the approval they need/expect is not being met."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Gabbard described this subtype, which he referred to as the "[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]" subtype as being easily hurt, oversensitive, and ashamed. In addition, a "high-functioning" presentation, where there is less impairment in the areas of life where those with a more severe expression of the disorder typically have difficulties in, is suggested.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

[[Theodore Millon]] suggested five subtypes of narcissism.&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Theodore |last= Millon |year=1996 |title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |page=393 |isbn= 0-471-01186-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=millon9&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |title=Millon, Theodore, Personality Subtypes |publisher=Millon.net |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055645/http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few pure variants of any subtype,&lt;ref name=millon9/&gt; and the subtypes are not recognized in the DSM or ICD.

|-
| '''Pure Narcissist'''
| Mainly just NPD characteristics.
| Someone who has narcissistic features described in the DSM and ICD and lacks features from other personality disorders.
|-
| '''Attention Narcissist'''
| Including histrionic (HPD) features.
| They display the traditional NPD characteristics described in the ICD &amp; DSM along with histrionic features due to the fact that they think they are superior and therefore they should have everyone's attention, and when they do not have everyone's attention they go out of their way to capture the attention of as many people as possible.
|-
| '''Beyond The Rules Narcissist'''
| Including antisocial (ASPD) features.
| This type of narcissist thinks that because they are so superior to everyone they do not have to follow the rules like most people and therefore show behavior included in the ICD for dissocial personality disorder and behavior, included in the DSM for antisocial personality disorder.

===Comorbidity===
NPD has a high rate of [[comorbidity]] with other mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Individuals with NPD are prone to bouts of depression, often meeting criteria for co-occurring [[depressive disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{citation|last=Berger|first=FK|date=31 Oct 2014|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|title=Medical Encyclopedia: Narcissistic personality disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, NPD is associated with [[bipolar disorder]], [[anorexia]], and [[substance use disorders]],&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; especially [[cocaine use disorder|cocaine]].&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; As far as other personality disorders, NPD may be associated with [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], and [[paranoid personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

==Treatment==
Narcissistic personality disorder is rarely the primary reason for people seeking mental health treatment. When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[substance use disorder]]s, [[bipolar disorder]], or [[eating disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; or at the insistence of relatives and friends.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor [[Insight#Psychiatry|insight]] and [[Egosyntonic and egodystonic|fail to recognize]] their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive [[self-image]].&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

Treatment for NPD is centered around [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name=mayo2&gt;{{cite web |title=Narcissistic personality diorder - Diagnosis and treatment |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366690 |website=www.mayoclinic.org |accessdate=28 June 2018 |language=en |date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Heinz Kohut]] and [[Otto Kernberg]] challenged the conventional wisdom of the time by outlining clinical strategies for using psychoanalytic psychotherapy with clients with NPD that they claimed were effective in treating the disorder. Contemporary treatment modalities commonly involve [[transference|transference-focused]], [[metacognitive]], and [[schema therapy|schema-focused]] therapies. Some improvement might be observed through the treatment of symptoms related to comorbid disorders with psychopharmaceuticals, but {{asof|2016|lc=y}}, according to Elsa Ronningstam, psychologist at [[Harvard Medical School]], "Alliance building and engaging the patient's sense of agency and reflective ability are essential for change in pathological narcissism."&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt;

Pattern change strategies performed over a long period of time are used to increase the ability of those with NPD to become more empathic in everyday relationships. To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema, the strategy is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others for reasons other than their own personal gain. This is not so much to change their self-perception of their "entitlement" feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change.&lt;ref name=sperry&gt;{{citation|last=Sperry|first=Lynn|year=1999|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Cognitive Behavior Therapy of DSM-IV Personality Disorders: Highly Effective Interventions for the Most Common Personality Disorders|pages=131–38|location=Ann Arbor, MI|publisher=Edwards Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Anger, rage, impulsivity, and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Therapy may not be effective because patients may receive feedback poorly and defensively. [[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] and [[Somatoform Disorders|somatoform disorders]] are prevalent, but the most common would be depression.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Group psychotherapy|Group treatment]] has its benefits, as the effectiveness of receiving peer feedback rather than the clinician's may be more accepted, but group therapy can also contradict itself as the patient may show "demandingness, [[egocentrism]], social isolation and withdrawal, and socially deviant behavior". Researchers originally thought group therapy among patients with NPD would fail because it was believed that group therapy required empathy that NPD patients lack. However, studies show group therapy does hold value for patients with NPD because it lets them explore boundaries, develop trust, increase self-awareness, and accept feedback. Relationship therapy stresses the importance of learning and applying four basic interpersonal skills: "...effective expression, empathy, discussion and problem solving/conflict resolution".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Relationship counseling|Marital/relationship therapy]] is most beneficial when both partners participate.&lt;ref name=sperry/&gt;

No [[Psychiatric medication|medications]] are indicated for treating NPD, but may be used to treat co-occurring mental conditions or symptoms that may be associated with it such as depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness if present.&lt;ref name=mayo2/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The effectiveness of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] interventions in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder has yet to be systematically and empirically investigated. Clinical practice guidelines for the disorder have not yet been created, and current treatment recommendations are largely based on theoretical [[psychodynamic]] models of NPD and the experiences of clinicians with afflicted individuals in clinical settings.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

The presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Lifetime prevalence of NPD is estimated at 1% in the general population and 2% to 16% in clinical populations.&lt;ref name="bd2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|title=Megalomaniacs abound in politics/medicine/finance|last=|first=|date=January 7, 2011|work=Business Day Live|accessdate=17 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924072524/http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|archivedate=24 September 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMN/&gt; A 2010 [[systematic review]] found the prevalence of NPD to be between 0% to 6% in community samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=Nikhil|last2=Kunik|first2=Mark E.|last3=Oldham|first3=John|last4=Coverdale|first4=John|date=|title=Prevalence and treatment of narcissistic personality disorder in the community: a systematic review|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=July–August 2010|volume=51|issue=4|pages=333–39|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2009.09.003|pmid=20579503|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small gender difference, with men having a slightly higher incidence than in women.&lt;ref name=Grijalva/&gt;

According to a 2015 meta-analysis that looked at gender differences in NPD, there has recently been a debate about a perceived increase in the prevalence of NPD among younger generations and among women. However, the authors found that this was not reflected in the data and that the prevalence has remained relatively stable for both genders over the last 30 years (when data on the disorder were first collected).&lt;ref name="Grijalva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grijalva|first=Emily|last2=Newman|first2=Daniel A.|last3=Tay|first3=Louis|last4=Donnellan|first4=M.

==History==
The [[history of narcissism|use of the term "narcissism"]] to describe excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern medical classification of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], a [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] youth who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grief for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside himself.

The term "narcissistic personality structure" was introduced by [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Kernberg, Otto, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "narcissistic personality disorder" first proposed by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut H The Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders: Outline of a Systematic Approach, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Freudianism===
[[Sigmund Freud]] commented, regarding the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, "this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly concluded: "we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of [[Paranoia|paranoic]] disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] also considered megalomania to be normal in the child,&lt;ref&gt;Bergler, Edmund, "The Psychology of Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) pp. 176, 182&lt;/ref&gt; and for it to be reactivated in later life in [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Lindner, "The Psychodynamics of Gambling", in Halliday/Fuller eds., p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] states that, for those who react in later life to narcissistic [[Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|hurt]] with [[denial]], a similar [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to the megalomania of childhood is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, Otto, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object relations===
Whereas Freud saw megalomania as an obstacle to [[psychoanalysis]], in the second half of the 20th century, [[object relations theory]], both in the United States and among British [[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]], set about revaluing megalomania as a [[defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]] that offered potential access for therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach built on [[Heinz Kohut]]'s view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal development, by contrast with [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]]'s consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological development distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
In popular culture, narcissistic personality disorder has been called megalomania.&lt;ref name=bd2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Par2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=War Is Not Inevitable: On the Psychology of War and Aggression|last1=Parens|first1=Henri|date=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739195291|location=|page=63|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908145308/https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|archivedate=8 September 2017|deadurl=no|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
An article on the Victorian Web argues that Rosamond Vincy, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871–72), is a full-blown narcissist as defined by the DSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/eliot/winnington.html|title=The Narcissism of Rosamond Vincy|last=Winnington|first=G.

In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman]]'s character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted: "[she] was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|last2=Schliewe|first2=Sanna|last3=Thomsen|first3=Rasmus R.|date=|year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|deadurl=no|journal=[[BMC Psychiatry]]|location=London|publisher=BioMed Central|volume=5|page=45|pages=|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|pmc=1325244|pmid=16336663|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219154746/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|archivedate=19 February 2015|via=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples in popular fiction include television characters Adam Demamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsrecord.org/arts_and_entertainment/workaholics-star-recounts-dangerous-situations-weird-gestures/article_43e5904c-6051-11e2-ae9c-0019bb30f31a.html|title=‘Workaholics’ Star Recounts Dangerous Situations, Weird Gestures|last=BieryGolick|first=Keith|date=16 January 2013|website=The News Record|publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025062329/http://www.newsrecord.org/arts_and_entertainment/workaholics-star-recounts-dangerous-situations-weird-gestures/article_43e5904c-6051-11e2-ae9c-0019bb30f31a.html|archive-date=25 October 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (portrayed by [[Adam DeVine]] in ''[[Workaholics]]'') and [[List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters#Dennis Reynolds|Dennis Reynolds]] (portrayed by [[Glenn Howerton]] in ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'').

==Criticism==
A Norwegian study concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs rather than as a distinct diagnostic category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karterud|first=Sigmund|last2=Øien|first2=Maria|last3=Pedersen|first3=Geir|date=|title=Validity aspects of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition'', narcissistic personality disorder construct|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=September–October 2011|volume=52|issue=5|pages=517–26|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.11.001|pmid=21193181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón and Sarabia, in examining past literature on the disorder, concluded that narcissistic personality disorder "shows [[nosological]] inconsistency and that its consideration as a trait domain with needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alarcón|first=Renato D.|last2=Sarabia|first2=Silvana|date=|title=Debates on the Narcissism Conundrum: Trait, Domain, Dimension, Type, or Disorder?|url=|journal=[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|publication-date=January 2012|volume=200|issue=1|pages=16–25|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e31823e6795|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Balloon Facility''', also known as the TIFR Balloon Facility, is a stratospheric-balloon launch base under the joint management of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR) and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO). This institute is located at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] near [[Electronics Corporation of India Limited]] (ECIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the only major balloon facility in the world close to the [[Magnetic dip#Explanation|geomagnetic equator]], this facility is extensively used by researchers from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|title=NBF History|publisher=TIFR|accessdate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031029142857/http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|archivedate=29 October 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ballooning activity in India was prompted by research into atmospheric exploration and cosmic ray studies. During the 1940s, Dr. [[Homi J. Bhabha]] of TIFR started sending balloons up to an altitude of 25&amp;nbsp;km to study secondary cosmic radiation. Due to unique geographic reasons [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was selected for stratospheric balloon launches. After various diplomatic meetings arrangements were made by US and Indian organisations to jointly launch balloons from Hyderabad. The first launch had support of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) and TIFR.

The launches were carried out from two locations. US balloons were launched from [[Begumpet Airport]] and Indian balloons from [[Osmania University]] Campus. The first balloon was launched on 2 February 1961. During the first stage of the facility's operation, forty balloons were launched.

After five years all the facilities were consolidated at Osmania University and under management of [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] &amp; TIFR and around 170 balloons were launched.

After a few years with increasing demands for balloon flights, a relatively low population density and proximity to the geomagnetic equator, a permanent site at Hyderabad near ECIL was selected. However, presently due to rapid development this facility is today surrounded by several population settlements: by the [[Cherlapally Central Jail]] in the east;  [[Kamala Nagar, Hyderabad|Kamala Nagar]] in the west; and [[Electronics Corporation of India]] Ltd. in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The campus contains a complete balloon manufacturing facility. The institute conducts balloon-based scientific experiments in X-ray and [[Infrared Astronomy]], and in [[Aeronomy]].
Balloons from this facility are launched twice in a year, i.e. in summer and winter. NBF also regularly monitors and analyses local weather at [[tropospheric]] and [[stratospheric]] altitudes, required for making decisions about balloon launches.

Under the High Altitude Balloon Development Project, a 61,000m³ indigenously developed balloon penetrated into the Mesosphere on 7 January 2014, for the first time in India. Until that time, only balloons from USA and Japan had accomplished this feat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/HAA_Record.html HAA Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8686">'''Obsessive relational intrusion''' (ORI) occurs when someone knowingly and repeatedly invades another person's privacy boundaries by using intrusive tactics to try to get closer to that person. It includes behaviors such as repeated calls and texts, malicious contact, spreading rumors, stalking, and violence (kidnapping and assault).

Drs. Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach, the creators of the term, define ORI as "repeated and unwanted pursuit and invasion of one's sense of physical or symbolic privacy by another person, either stranger or acquaintance, who desires and/or presumes an intimate relationship".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Side of Close Relationships|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbraum Assoc|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-4450-3|pages=233–264|author=Spitzberg, Brian|edition=3rd|author2=Cupach, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims of ORI have no preexisting relationship with or interest in their pursuers; others know their pursuers, but are less interested in making an existing relationship more intimate.&lt;ref name=Close&gt;{{cite book|title=Close Encounters-Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-4522-1710-9|pages=288–291|author=Guerrero, Laura |author2=Andersen, Peter |author3=Walid, Afifi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

There are several key components of ORI that distinguish it from other similar relational patterns.

First, ORI involves a lack of mutual agreement regarding the nature or even the existence of a relationship. While the person obsessed with the relationship is attempting to make a closer connection, the object of ORI desires freedom from continued forced contact. Spitzberg writes that "this dialectical tension is endemic to the formation and ongoing construction of all interpersonal relationships".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

Second, ORI is not associated with a singular event, but is repeated. Spitzberg and Cupach write, "Obsessiveness is reflected in the fact that the intruder is fixated on the target of attention; the intruder's thoughts and behaviors are persistent, preoccupying, and often morbid.  Pursuit is persistent despite the absence of reciprocity by the obsessional object and despite resistance by the object."&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt; The episodes of unwanted behavior tend to escalate over time, with the seriousness rising and the time between incidents shortening.&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

Third, the intrusion can be symbolic and psychological, not just physical.  The invasion of privacy as well as the imposition on the victim's feelings of freedom of choice are important aspects of ORI.&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

==Behaviors==

Studies have been done to explore certain factors that predispose individuals to ORI.  Some have found [[narcissism]] and low empathy as predictors for ORI, and hypothesized that people with high empathy would be more inclined to judge ORI behaviors as unacceptable.  But this pattern has been found inconclusive; one study found that empathy may not inhibit ORI, although there is a substantial positive relationship between narcissism and the acceptability of ORI.&lt;ref name=Narcissism&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asada|first=Kelly |author2=Eunsoon Lee |author3=Levine Timothy |author4=Ferrara, Merissa |title=Narcissism and Empathy as Predictors of Obsessive Relational Intrusion|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=204|volume=21|issue=4|pages=379–390|doi=10.1080/08824090409360002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many victims of ORI have also experienced sexual coercion, and the coping responses used for both tend to be similar.  Additionally, the more serious the intrusion (for example, violence), the more formal the coping response (for example, calling the police).&lt;ref name=Last&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spitzberg|first=Brian|title=Obsessive Relational Intrusion, Coping, and Sexual Coercion Victimization|journal=Communication Reports|year=2001|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1080/08934210109367733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ORI behavior, as well as non-ORI sexually coercive behavior, can involve types of coercion identified as deception coercion, mild force coercion, psychological coercion and severe force coercion.&lt;ref name=Last /&gt;

==Stalking==

[[Stalking]], a severe form of ORI, is typically defined as "the willful, malicious, and repeated following and harassing of another persons that threatens his or her safety".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

===Connection between ORI and stalking===

Spitzberg and Cupach state more research is needed to correctly capture the connection, but ORI and stalking are pervasive and impactful occurrences.  A clearer picture is needed to better understand the incidence, prevalence and consequences of ORI and stalking.  Better understanding will provide improvements in prevention, intervention and treatment of offenders and victims.&lt;ref name=Stalking3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sptizberg|first=Brian|author2=Nicastro, Alana|title=Exploring the Interactional Phenomenon of Stalking and Obsessive Relational Intrustion|journal=Communication Reports|year=1998|volume=11|series=|issue=1|pages=33–47|doi=10.1080/08934219809367683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==

The authors Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach developed ORI in 1998, and published their research in their book ''The Dark Side of Close Relationships.''

==Social theory use of ORI==

===Relational Goal Pursuit Theory===

According to the Relational Goal Pursuit Theory (RGPT),&lt;ref name="Relationship Pursuit"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Side of Relationship Pursuit: From Attraction to Obsession to Stalking|year=2008|publisher=Lawrence Eflbaum|location=New Jersey|pages=5–102|author=Spitzberg, Brian|author2=Cupach, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; people expend energy to develop or reinitiate relationships to the extent that they perceive a relationship desirable and attainable.  It becomes all about achieving the goal of a relationship.  ORI occurs when people continue to believe that a relationship is attainable even though it is not.   The pursuer begins to escalate when they meet challenges to their goal.  
RGPT identifies processes that conspire to transform otherwise normal relationships into ORI and stalking.   All relationships begin with a goal to pursuit.  The following are some rules:

# Obsessive pursuers link the relationship to higher order goals, such as happiness and self-worth
# This linking results in exaggerated positive attitudes regarding the success of the relational goal
# There is an exaggerated positive attitude regarding the success of the relational goal
# Linking also produces exaggerated negative attitudes towards failure of the relational goal
# This failure produces heightened negative emotions
# The linking renders goal abandonment as unlikely
# These exaggerated attitudes reinforce the importance of the relational goal
# The strength of the attitudes can predict persistence

==Other reasons for ORI use==

Cultural scripts – if people play hard to get enough, eventually win the affection of person trying to love – usually work against the realization that the relationship is unattainable.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

Ambiguous [[communication]] – initiation, reinitiating and rejection of relationships may keep hope alive. Using indirect signals to reject people because they are worried about hurting their feelings, pursuers usually interpret this incorrectly.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

[[rumination (psychology)|Rumination]] – when people can’t obtain a goal, they tend to fixate on the problem and pursuers redouble their efforts.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

Shift in motivation – when pursuer moves from desire to revenge from a feeling of being humiliated.  This shift usually marks the beginning of more aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

==ORI and Facebook==

With the increase of [[Facebook]] and other social media tools designed to make us more accessible to others while taking away pieces of our privacy, ORI has become easier in an online world.  There is relational intrusion from both offenders and targets in five different categories:&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaulk|first=Kasey|author2=Jones, Tim|title=Online Obsessive Relational Intrusion: Further Concerns About Facebook|journal=Springer Science and Business Media|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=245–254|doi=10.1007/s10896-011-9360-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Primary contact attempts
# Secondary contact attempts
# Monitoring or surveillance
# Expressions
# Invitations

Online social media helps to facilitate behaviors indicative of ORI and these behaviors have consequences for users on their privacy and security.

An '''organigraph''' is a graphical representation of a company's structure or processes. It is used as an alternative to a traditional [[organizational chart]] as it does not imply the same degree of linear hierarchy that an organizational chart does.

Organigraphs are used to expose critical associations and competitive opportunities as opposed to viewing all parties, departments, and business units as separate entities. They also can reveal relationships between departments, products, supply chains, and more within an organization that might not otherwise be apparent. Business strategists, consultants, and academics use organigraphs.

The organigraph was conceived by [[Henry Mintzberg]] and [[Ludo Van der Heyden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/898.html|title=Organigraphs: Drawing How Companies Really Work|date=2000-04-01|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organigraphs can be created as diagrams or as images which represent the nature of the firm. For example, a computer company's organigraph could be in the form of a computer. The hard drive could represent employees, the power supply could relate to its financing, and the web browser could indicate the firm's strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3158">The '''outcome bias''' is an error made in evaluating the quality of a decision when the outcome of that decision is already known. Specifically, the outcome effect occurs when the same "behavior produce[s] more ethical condemnation when it happen[s] to produce bad rather than good outcome, even if the outcome is determined by chance."&lt;ref name="GinoMoore2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gino|first1=Francesca|last2=Moore|first2=Don A.|last3=Bazerman|first3=Max H.|title=No Harm, No Foul: The Outcome Bias in Ethical Judgments|journal=|year=2009|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/08-080.pdf |SSRN=1099464}} [[Harvard Business School]] Working Paper, No. 08-080.&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar to the [[hindsight bias]], the two phenomena are markedly different. The [[hindsight bias]] focuses on memory distortion to favor the actor, while the outcome bias focuses exclusively on weighting the past outcome heavier than other pieces of information in deciding if a past decision was correct.

==Overview==
One will often judge a past decision by its ultimate outcome instead of based on the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time. This is an error because no decision maker ever knows whether or not a calculated risk will turn out for the best. The actual outcome of the decision will often be determined by chance, with some risks working out and others not. Individuals whose judgments are influenced by outcome bias are seemingly holding decision makers responsible for events beyond their control.

Baron and Hershey (1988) presented subjects with hypothetical situations in order to test this.&lt;ref name="BaronHershey1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=Jonathan|last2=Hershey|first2=John C.|title=Outcome bias in decision evaluation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=4|year=1988|pages=569–579|url=http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4660/21931_171009.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.4.569}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One such example involved a surgeon deciding whether or not to do a risky surgery on a patient. The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision. Those presented with bad outcomes rated the decision worse than those who had good outcomes. "[[Consequentialism|The ends justify the means]]" is an often used aphorism to express the Outcome effect when the outcome is desirable.

The reason why an individual makes this mistake is that he or she will incorporate presently available information when evaluating a past decision. To avoid the influence of outcome bias, one should evaluate a decision by ignoring information collected after the fact and focusing on what the right answer is, or was at the time the decision was made.

'''Paramanu''' is a technical term in [[Jainism]]. It is defined as the smallest and indivisible particle of matter. It is one of the two types of [[Pudgala]] (matter), the other being [[Skandha (Jainism)|Skandha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atmadharma.com/shastras/laghujainsiddhant_eng_txt/index.html#question020|title=Principles of Jainism (Laghu Jain Siddhant Praveshika) in a concise form|first=Pandit Gopaldasji Baraiya, Rajesh Shah|last=(WebMaster)|website=www.atmadharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{personal finance}}
A '''pawnbroker'''  is an individual or business ('''pawnshop''' or '''pawn shop''') that offers [[secured loan]]s to people, with items of [[personal property]] used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. The items having been ''pawned'' to the broker are themselves called [[pledge (law)|''pledges'' or ''pawns'']], or simply the collateral. While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, televisions, cameras, power tools, firearms, and other relatively valuable items as collateral.

[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Camden High Street, London.JPG|thumb|A [[London]] shop displays the traditional pawnbroker's sign.]]

If an item is pawned for a loan (colloquially "hocked" or "popped"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|pop}}&lt;/ref&gt;), within a certain contractual period of time the pawner may redeem it for the amount of the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for [[interest]]. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law and by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.

==Business model==

===Assessment of items===
The pawning process begins when a customer brings an item into a pawn shop. Common items pawned (or, in some instances, sold outright) by customers include [[jewelry]], [[electronics]], collectibles, [[musical instruments]], [[tools]], and (depending on local regulations) [[firearms]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], and [[platinum]] are popular items—which are often purchased, even if in the form of broken jewelry of little value. Metal can still be sold in bulk to a [[bullion]] dealer or [[smelter]] for the value by weight of the component metals. Similarly, jewelry that contains genuine [[gemstones]], even if broken or missing pieces, have value.

The pawnbroker assumes the risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from ''unknowingly'' [[handling stolen goods]] (also known as ''fencing''). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued [[identity document]]), as well as a holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, pawnshops must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local pawnshops to see if they can locate stolen items. Some pawnshops set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.

The pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the [[used good]]s market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.

To assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks ("blue books"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake [[Rolex]] watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it.  The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.

===Determining amount of loan===
To determine the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner needs to take into account several factors. A key factor is the predicted resale value of the item. This is often thought of in terms of a range, with the low point being the [[wholesale]] value of the used good, in the case that the pawnshop is unable to sell it to pawnshop customers, and they decide to sell it to a wholesale merchant of used goods. The higher point in the range is the retail sale price in the pawnshop. For example, a five-year-old laptop may have been bought by the customer for $1000. However, as a used item in a pawnshop, it might only fetch $250 as a purchase price in the pawnshop, because the customers will be wary that it might be a [[lemon market|"lemon"]] that the seller is getting rid of because it has some hard-to-detect problem, and because pawnshops do not typically offer a warranty with goods sold. Used electronics wholesalers will buy the laptop from the pawnshop owner for $100 to $150. The wholesaler pays a lower price than the retail value because they have the added cost of hiring electronics technicians who overhaul and repair the items so that they can be sold in used electronics stores.

The pawnshop owner also takes into account their knowledge of [[supply and demand]] for the item in question to determine if they think that they will end up selling the laptop for $100 to a wholesaler or $250 to a pawnshop customer. If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, insurance, alarm system, items lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.

In determining the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner also assesses the likelihood that the customer will pay the interest for several weeks or months and then return to repay the loan and reclaim the item. Since the key to the pawnshop business model is making interest off the loaned money, pawnshop owners want to accept items that the customer is likely to want to recover, after having paid interest for a period on the loan. If, in an extreme case, a pawnshop only accepted items that customers had no interest in ever reclaiming, it would not make any money from interest, and the store would in effect become a second hand dealer.  Determining if the customer is likely to return to reclaim an item is a subjective decision, and the pawnshop owner may take many factors into account. For example, if a young able-bodied man comes into the pawnshop to pawn an electric wheelchair (perhaps claiming it to be the possession of his late grandparent), the pawnshop owner may doubt that the item will be redeemed. On the other hand, if a middle aged man pawns a top quality set of golf clubs, the pawnshop owner may assess it as more credible that he will return for the items.  Some customers may attempt to persuade the pawnshop owner that the item in question is important to them ("that necklace belonged to my grandmother, so I will certainly return for it") as a means of obtaining a loan.  Other customers return to the same store, repeatedly pawn the same item(s) as a way of borrowing money, and return to pay the interest and recover the item(s) before the end of the loan period; thus, the pawnbroker knows that redemption is likely and will therefore make the loan.

The saleability of the item and the amount that the customer wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it even if it is unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer, because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.

In some countries e.g. Sweden there is legislation to prevent the pawn broker from making unfair profits ([[usury]] due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) at the expense of the customer by low evaluation on their collaterals. It is stated that the pawn broker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public [[auction]]. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawn broker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection, the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.

===Inventory management===
Pawnshops have to be careful to manage how many new items they accept as pawns: either too little inventory or too much is bad. A pawnshop might have too little inventory if, for example, it mostly buys jewels and gold that it resells or smelts—or perhaps the pawnshop owner quickly sells most items through specialty shops (e.g., musical instruments to music stores, stereos to used hi-fi audio stores, etc.). In this case, the pawnshop is less interesting to customers, because it is mostly empty.

On the other extreme, a pawnshop with a huge inventory has several disadvantages. If the store is crammed with used athletic gear, old stereos, and old tools, the store owner must spend time and money shelving and sorting items, displaying them on different stands or in glass cases, and monitoring customers to prevent [[shoplifting]]. If there are too many low-value, poor quality items, such as old toasters, scratched-up 20-year-old TVs, and worn-out sports gear piled into cardboard boxes, the store may begin to look more like a [[rummage sale]] or [[flea market]].  Small, high-value items such as iPod players or cell phones must be in locked glass display cases, which means the owner may need additional staff to unlock the cabinets for items customers want to examine. As a store fills with items, an owner must protect inventory theft by hiring staff to supervise the different areas or install security cameras and alarms. Too much unsold inventory means that the store has not been able to realize value from these items to provide cash to lend.

The better option lies in the middle: a store with a moderate amount of good quality, brand-name items arranged neatly in the display windows attracts passersby, who are more likely to enter and shop. If items are attractively laid out in display cases and shelves, the pawnshop looks more professional and reputable. Once passersby start shopping in the store, they may be more inclined to pawn or sell their own items to the pawnshop. Some pawnshop owners prevent cluttered look by storing overstocked items, or less attractive items such as snow tires, in a back room or basement. Some pawnshop companies operate a chain of stores in a state or province. This way, they can balance inventory between stores. For example, they can move some of a rural store's surfeit of fishing gear to an urban store.

Some stores also slim down inventory by selling items to specialty retailers. A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 may find the unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher end equipment. Some pawnshops sell specialty items online, on  [[eBay]] or other websites. A specialty item such as a high-end model railroad set may not sell in the store for its "blue book" value. On an online auction, it stands a good chance of bringing a good price.

Another growing trend in the industry is vehicle pawn or auto pawning. This form of Pawnbroking works like a traditional pawn loan, however these stores only accept vehicles as security. Many stores are also accepting "Title Loans", where you can pawn the ownership or "Title" documents of your vehicle. This essentially means that the pawnbroker owns your car while you drive it, and you regain ownership once you pay back your loan. 

===Auxiliary operations===
While the main business activities of a pawnshop are lending money for interest based on valuable items that customers bring in, some pawnshops also undertake other business activities, such as selling brand-new retail items that are in demand in the neighborhood of the store. Depending on where a pawnshop is located, these other retail items may range from musical instruments to firearms. Some pawnbrokers also sell brand-new self-defense items such as pepper spray or stun guns.

Many pawnshops will also trade used items, as long as the transaction turns a profit for pawn shop. In cases where the pawnshop buys items outright, the money is not a loan; it is a straight payment for the item.  On sales, the pawnshop may offer [[layaway]] plans, subject to conditions (down payment, regular payments, and forfeiture of previously paid amounts if the item is not paid off).

Some pawnshops may keep a few unusual, high value items on display to capture the interests of passersby, such as a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle; the owner is not typically expecting to sell these items. Other activities carried out by pawnshops are financial services including fee-based check cashing, [[payday loan]]s, vehicle title or house title loans, and currency exchange services.

===Upscale pawnshops===
Upscale pawnshops began to appear in the early 20th century, often referred to as "loan offices", since the term “pawn shop” had a very negative historical reputation at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D1uBNDvz4XsC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=upscale+pawnshops#v=onepage&amp;q=upscale%20pawnshops&amp;f=false |page=66 and 70–72 |title=In Hock: Pawning in America from Independence through the Great Depression |publisher=University of Chicago Press |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |year=2009 |author=Wendy A.

These objects can include wine collections, jewelry, large diamonds, fine art, cars, and unique memorabilia. Loans are often sought to deal with business revenue shortfalls and other expensive fiscal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-07-15/pawn-shops-going-upscale/56225816/1 |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |title=Pawn shops are going upscale for affluent clients |date=July 15, 2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |author=Russ Wiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upscale pawnshops have also been featured in reality television.

===Industry===
In the US, there are over 11,000 pawnbrokers and an industry revenue of $14.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Pawn Shops Industry Sails Through The Recession|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/5/prweb9529413.htm|website=prweb.com|publisher=[[Cision]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US industry serves 30 million customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pawn Industry Statistics|url=https://www.nationalpawnbrokers.org/about/pawn-industry-faqs/|website=nationalpawnbrokers.org|publisher=National Pawn Brokers Association|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of pawnbroking}}
In the west, pawnbroking existed in the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Most contemporary [[Western law]] on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. As the empire spread its culture, pawnbroking went with it. Likewise, in the East, the business model existed in China 1500 years ago in [[Buddhist_temple|Buddhist monasteries]] no different from today, through the ages strictly regulated by Imperial or other authorities.

In spite of early [[Roman Catholic Church]] prohibitions against charging [[interest]] on [[loan]]s, there is some evidence that the [[Franciscans]] were permitted to begin the practice as an aid to the poor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=Samuel|date=2016|title=How Medieval Monks Changed the Face of Banking|journal=American Banker|volume=1 no. 88|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pawn brokerage arrived in England with [[William the Conqueror]]. In 1338, Edward III pawned his jewels to raise money for his war with France. King Henry V did much the same in 1415. The Lombards were not a popular class, and [[Henry VII Tudor|Henry VII]] harried them a good deal. In 1603 an ''Act against Brokers'' was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at the many counterfeit brokers in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]].
[[File:Provident Loan Society Essex Houston jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Provident Loan Society]] of New York, a charitable pawnbroker]]

Crusaders, predominantly in France, brokered their land holdings to monasteries and diocese for funds to supply, outfit, and transport their armies to the Holy Land. Instead of outright repayment the Church reaped a certain amount of crop returns for a certain amount of seasons, which could additionally be re-exchanged in a type of equity.

A pawnbroker can also be a charity. In 1450, Barnaba Manassei, a [[Franciscan]] monk, began the Monte di Pietà movement in [[Perugia]], Italy. It provided financial assistance in the form of no-interest loans secured with pawned items.  Instead of interest, the Monte di Pietà urged borrowers to make donations to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].  It spread through Italy, then to other parts of Europe. The first Monte de Piedad organization in Spain was founded in [[Madrid]], and from there the idea was transferred to [[New Spain]] by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Santa Maria de Regla&lt;ref name="Ficachi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leon Teutli Ficachi |url=http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nacional Monte de Piedad |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219125044/http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Order of Calatrava|Knight of Calatrava]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; The [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] is a charitable institution and pawn shop whose main office is located just off the [[Zocalo]], or main plaza of [[Mexico City]].  It was established between 1774 and 1777 by [[Pedro Romero de Terreros]] as part of a movement to provide interest-free or low-interest loans to the poor. It was recognized as a national charity in 1927 by the Mexican government.&lt;ref name="EncMex"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alvarez |first=Jose Rogelio |author= |authorlink= |author2= |editor= |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico |title=Nacional Piedad de Monte |url= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=10 |location=Mexico City |id= |isbn=1-56409-034-5 |doi= |pages=5699–5701 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a fast-growing institution with over 152 branches all over Mexico and with plans to open a branch in every Mexican city.&lt;ref name="905mil"&gt;{{cite news |author=Notimex |title=Dispone Monte de Piedad de 905 mdp para préstamos |url= http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/321965.dispone-monte-de-piedad-de-905-mdp-para-prest.html|publisher=El siglo de Torreón |location=Torreón |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-10-01 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol==
[[File:Pawnbroker-traditional-symbol.svg|80px|framed|Symbol of pawnbrokers.]]
[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Queen Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Pawnbroker's sign in [[Edinburgh]] Scotland]]

The pawnbrokers' symbol is three spheres suspended from a bar. The three sphere symbol is attributed to the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence, Italy]], owing to its symbolic meaning of Lombard.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2017}} This refers to the [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Lombardy]], where pawn shop banking originated under the name of [[Lombard banking]]. The three golden spheres were originally a symbol medieval Lombard merchants hung in front of their houses, and not the arms of the Medici family. It has been conjectured that the golden spheres were originally three flat yellow effigies of [[bezant]]s, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] field, but that they were converted into spheres to better attract attention.

Most European towns called the pawn shop the "Lombard". The [[Lombards|House of Lombard]] was a banking community in medieval [[London, England]]. According to legend, a Medici employed by [[Charlemagne]] slew a giant using three bags of rocks. The three-ball symbol became the family crest. Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and moneylending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, [[heraldry|coats of arms]] bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success.

[[Saint Nicholas]] is the patron saint of pawnbrokers. The symbol has also been attributed to the story of Nicholas giving a poor man's three daughters each a [[bag of gold]] so they could get [[Marriage|married]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202075513/http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats |date=February 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hong Kong Pawn Shop Logo.jpg|float|thumb|A typical Hong Kong pawn shop sign: a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]].]]

In [[Hong Kong]] the practice follows the Chinese tradition, and the counter of the shop is typically higher than the average person for security. A customer can only hold up his hand to offer belongings and there is a wooden screen between the door and the counter for customers' privacy. The symbol of a pawn shop in Hong Kong is a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]] ({{zh|蝠鼠吊金錢}}, [[Cantonese]]: ''fūk syú diu gām chín''). The bat signifies fortune and the coin signifies benefits. In Japan, the usual symbol for a pawn shop is a circled number seven (7) because "shichi", the Japanese word for seven, sounds similar to the word for "pawn" ({{lang|ja|質}}).

The majority of pawnbrokers in Malaysia, a multi-race country wherein [[Malaysian Chinese]] consists 25% of the population, are managed by Malaysian Chinese. In Malay, pawn is called "pajak gadai". A valid and licensed pawnshop in Malaysia must always declare themselves as a "pajak gadai" or a pawn shop for their company registration. They must also fulfill the requirements of the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] which states the pawn counter must not be higher than 4 feet, is bullet-proof, has stainless-steel counters/doors, strong rooms with automatic locks, safes, equipped with fully computerized system, CCTV, alarm, and pawnbroker insurance.

In the [[Philippines]], the operation of pawnshops is managed by private businesses and is duly regulated by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]. Pawn shops usually accept gold jewelry, appliances, gadgets, etc. Many pawn shops in the Philippines have adapted other services into their nationwide branches like [[Tambunting Pawnshop]]. Services like international and domestic [[remittance]], [[insurance]], bills payment, [[Business-to-business|b2b]] money collection, e-loading for mobile phones, ticketing, and even banking are not unusual to see in a regular Filipino pawn shop.  [[Pawnhero]] is an online Filipino pawnshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/85763-pawnhero-philippines-launch|title=PawnHero's online pawnshop goes live in the Philippines|website=Rappler|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the Marwari [[Jain]] community pioneered the pawnbroking business, but today others are involved; the work is done by many agents called "saudagar". Instead of working from a shop, they go to needy people's homes and motivate them to become involved in the business. Pawn shops are often run as part of jewelry stores. Gold, silver, and diamonds are frequently accepted as collateral.

Pawnbroking is also a traditional trade in [[Thailand]], where pawn shops are run both privately and by local governments.

In [[Sri Lanka]], pawnbroking is a lucrative business engaged in by specialized pawnbrokers as well as commercial banks and other finance companies.

In [[Indonesia]], there is a state-owned company called [[Pegadaian]] which provides a range of conventional and Sharia-compliant pawnbroking services across the archipelago. The company accepts high-value items such as gold, motor vehicles, and other expensive items as collateral. In addition to pawnbroking activities, the company provides a range of other services, such as a safe deposit box and gold trading services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">A '''personalized video game''' is created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a luxury gift, similar to [[personalized book]]s. It features real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.

== History ==
Personalized video games were given as luxury gifts almost from the beginning of the game industry. A recent famous example includes a game given in 2002 by [[Kevin Smith]] to [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez|Jeniffer Lopez]]. In the game Lopez has to find and rescue Affleck, who has been kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/games/hollywood-couple-get-personalized-video-game-550068/|title=Hollywood couple get personalized video game - Geek.com|date=2002-12-03|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first professional personalized video games service was created by Abdel Bounane in 2011 and was called Amuze Me&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/arts/inspired-by-your-life-a-custom-designed-video-game.html|title=Inspired by Your Life, a Custom-Designed Video Game|last=Pfeiffer|first=Alice|date=2011-11-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The costs of one game could run up to $67,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/5861673/for-just-67000-these-guys-will-make-a-custom-video-game-about-your-life|title=For Just $67,000, These Guys Will Make a Custom Video Game About Your Life|last=Hamilton|first=Kirk|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. “Amuse Me makes personalized games in one’s image, like having your portrait made by a painter,” said Florent Deloison, one of the service's game artists.

In 2014, Netherlands-based developer TinglyGames launched its Greeting Games, an online program that lets users customize and send casual games within digital greeting cards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/22/5333982/this-will-let-you-say-happy-birthday-get-well-soon-with-a-video-game|title=This will let you say 'Happy Birthday,' 'Get Well Soon' with a video game|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike Amuse Me, TinglyGames worked as a self-service and the games were not hand-made.

In 2017, Australian game studio Amelus Digital launched the service [http://heart2game.com HEART2GAME], which initially created hand-made custom order video games as strictly romantic gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/08/best-present-ever-an-aussie-studio-is-making-custom-romantic-games/|title=Best Present Ever: An Aussie Studio Is Making Custom Romantic Games|work=Kotaku|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 HEART2GAME expanded their services and now create personalised video games for a variety of occasions, not strictly romantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goto.game/heart2game-custom-built-games-as-gifts/|title=Heart2Game: Custom Built Games as Gifts|work=goto.game|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a new service creating hand-made pixel-art RPG games called Bday Game was launched by Petr Hudecek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bdaygame.com/|title=Give your loved one a personalized video game {{!}} Bday Game|website=bdaygame.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheap personalized video games services are also offered by freelance game developers on marketplaces such as [[Fiverr]].

In [[psychology]] and [[ethology]], '''play''' is a range of [[free will|voluntary]], [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsically motivated]] activities done for [[recreational]] pleasure and enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, C. (1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably [[mammals]].

Many prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including [[Melanie Klein]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.

Play is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a [[game]]. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.&lt;ref name=Huizinga&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0 7100 0578 4|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.

== Definitions ==
The seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt;{{rp|13}}
{{quote|"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means."}}

This definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the "magic circle" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt; Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, "the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play can take the form of improvisation or pretence, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Nachmanovitch writes that:

{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}

Structured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a "[[game]]". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of [[happiness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Sports]] with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in [[Soccer]] for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.&lt;ref name=Huizinga/&gt;

Other designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.

The California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:&lt;ref name="nifplay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science – Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.
# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.
# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.
# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.
# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.
# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.
# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.

Separate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]]. Play that promotes [[learning]] and recreation often incorporates [[toys]], [[theatrical property|props]], [[tools]] or other [[wikt:playmate|playmate]]s. Play can consist of an amusing, pretend or imaginary activity alone or with another. Some forms of play are rehearsals or trials for later life events, such as "play fighting", pretend social encounters (such as parties with dolls), or flirting.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton-Smith, B. (1997). ''The Ambiguity of Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Modern findings in [[neuroscience]] suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff &amp; Phillips, 2000).{{full citation needed|date=February 2013}}

As children get older, they engage in board games, video games and computer play, and in this context the word [[gameplay]] is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design. In their book, ''Rules of Play'', researchers Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman outline 18 schemas for games, using them to define "play", "interaction" and "design" formally for behaviorists.&lt;ref&gt;Salen, Katie and Zimmerman, Eric (2003). ''Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his book ''Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds'', game researcher and theorist Jesper Juul explores the relationship between real rules and unreal scenarios in play, such as winning or losing a game in the real world when played together with real-world friends, but doing so by slaying a dragon in the fantasy world presented in the shared video game.&lt;ref&gt;Juul, Jesper (2011).

[[File:Our Community Place Sandbox.jpg|thumb|Children playing in a sandbox]]
[[Learning through play]] has been long recognized as a critical aspect of [[childhood]] and [[child development]]. Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1542/peds.2006-2697 | pmid=17200287 | volume=119 | issue=1 | title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds | year=2007 | journal=Pediatrics | pages=182–191 | last1 = Ginsburg | first1 = K. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jenkinson, Sally |title=The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood |publisher=Hawthorn Press |location=Melbourne |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-903458-04-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.

Studies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein &amp; Russ, 2000–2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Frankel, &amp; Camras, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.

Evolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.

Play is explicitly recognized in Article 31 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (adopted by the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]], November 29, 1989), which declares:
* Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.
* Parties shall respect and promote the right of the child to participate fully in cultural and artistic life and shall encourage the provision of appropriate and equal opportunities for cultural, artistic, recreational and leisure activities.

===History of childhood playtime===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Children’s Games - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Children's Games'', 1560, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]
American historian Howard Chudacoff has studied the interplay between parental control of [[toy]]s and games and children's drive for freedom to play. In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=WHAT PARK DID YOU HANG OUT AT?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child’s individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008). NYU Press, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural differences of play ==
The act of play time is a cross-cultural phenomenon that is universally accepted and encouraged by most communities however it can differ in the ways that is performed.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=orpc|title=Cultural Variations in Parental Support of Children's Play|last=Vandermaas-Peeler|first=Maureen|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures, such as Euro-American cultural heritages, encourage play time in order to stress cognitive benefits and the importance of learning how to care for one’s self. Other cultures, such as people of African American or Asian American heritages, stress more group oriented learning and play where kids can learn what they can do with and for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ehyun/10041/culture_and_development_in.htm|title=Culture and Development in Children's Play|website=ruby.fgcu.edu|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parent interactions when it comes to playtime also differs drastically within communities. Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities. In the Mayan community, children are supported in their playing but also encouraged to play while watching their parents do household work in order to become familiar with how to follow in their footsteps.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In addition, cultural communities also partake in similar games just with slight differences. Children in contemporary industrialized social cultural contexts will spend much of their free play time viewing television or other electronic activity such as video games. People from the Brazilian community use the tools and materials around them to create a form of play. For instance they use mud balls or cashews to play marbles, a game many communities play with small [[marbles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/play/according-experts/play-and-cultural-context|title=Play {{!}} Play and Cultural Context {{!}} Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|website=Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communities in the Sahara will use clay figures as their forms of playful toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossie|first=Jean-Pierre|title=Toys, Play, Culture and Society. An anthropological approach with reference to North Africa and the Sahara|url=https://www.academia.edu/5180690|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children from [[Australia]] and [[Nepal]] will engage in [[Mud pie|mud play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naeyc.org/our-work/families/mud-explore-and-learn|title=Mud: Explore and Learn {{!}} NAEYC|website=www.naeyc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play time can also be used as a way for children to learn the mature ways of their culture. Many communities use play as a way children can emulate work. For instance, children can be seen comforting their toy dolls or animals something that they have modeled from adults in their communities. Children from San Pedro and Efe can be seen making ‘food’ from dirt or pretending to shoot bows and arrows much like their elders. The way in which children mimic work through their play can differ with what opportunities they have access to but is something that tends to be promoted by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morelli|first=Gilda|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|last3=Angelillo|first3=Cathy|date=|title=Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialised child-focused activities|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=|pages=269|url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~brogoff/Psych247articles/Morelli%20et%20al%20Cultural%20Var%20in%20Young%20Children's%20Access.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Sportive activities are one of the most universal forms of play. Different continents have their own popular/dominant sports. For example, [[Europea]]n, [[South America]]n, and [[Africa]]n countries enjoy [[soccer]] (also known as ‘[[football]]’ in [[Europe]]), while [[North America]]n countries prefer [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], or [[American football]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Top 10|title=Top 10 Most Popular Sports in The World|url=http://www.sportyghost.com/top-10-most-popular-sports-in-the-world/|website=SPORTY GHOST! |accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Asia]], sports such as [[table tennis]] and [[badminton]] are played professionally; however [[soccer]] and [[basketball]] are played amongst common folks.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Events such as The [[Olympic Games]] and [[FIFA World Cup]] showcase countries competing with each other and are broadcast all over the world.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Germany-world-cup-winners.jpg|thumbnail|2014 FIFA World Cup winner (Germany)]] --&gt;
[[Sports]] can be played as a [[leisure]] activity or within a [[competition]]. According to sociologist [[Norbert Elias]]; it is an important part of "civilization process".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheed|first1=Wilson|title=Endangered pastimes: Why sports matter|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|date=1995|volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victory]] and [[Failure|defeat]] in sports can also influence one’s [[emotions]] to a point where everything else seems so irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sport fans can also imagine what it feels like to play for their preferred team.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The feelings people experience can be so surreal that it affects their emotions and behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Benefits in youth===
Youth sport can provide a positive outcome for youth development. Research shows adolescents are more motivated and engaged in sports than any other activity,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=R|last2=Kleiber|first2=D.

Dramatic play is common in younger children.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For the youth community to benefit from playtime, the following are recommended: 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Figure 6.png|thumbnail|Research findings on benefits of youth playing sports]] --&gt;
* Give children ample, unscheduled time to be creative to reflect and decompress&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Give children “true” toys, such as blocks or dolls for creativity&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Youth should have a group of supportive people around them (teammates, coaches, and parents) with positive relationships &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should possess skill development; such as physical, interpersonal, and knowledge about the sport &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should be able to make their own decisions about their sport participation &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Youth should have experiences that are on par with their certain needs and developmental level &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Research findings on benefits in youth===
With regular participation in a variety of sports, children can develop and become more proficient at various sports skills (including, but not limited to, [[jumping]], [[kicking]], [[running]], [[throwing]], etc.) if the focus is on skill mastery and development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Young people participating in sports also develop [[agility]], [[Motor coordination|coordination]], [[endurance]], [[flexibility]], [[speed]], and [[Physical strength|strength]]. More specifically, young [[athletes]] could develop the following &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beets|first1=M. W.|last2=Pitetti|first2=K.

Moreover, research shows that regular participation in sport and physical activity is highly associated with lowering the risk of [[diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[obesity]], and other related diseases.

==Adults==
[[File:Playing weiqi in Shanghai.jpg|thumbnail|left|Playing [[weiqi]] in Shanghai]]

Although adults who engage in excessive amounts of play may find themselves described as "childish" or "young at heart" by less playful adults, play is actually an important activity, regardless of age. Creativity and happiness can result from adult play, where the objective can be more than fun alone, as in adult expression of the arts, or curiosity-driven science.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_on_creativity_and_play.html "Tim Brown on Creativity and Play,"] [[TED (conference)|TED]] talks&lt;/ref&gt; Some adult "hobbies" are examples of such creative play. In creative professions, such as design, playfulness can remove more serious attitudes (such as shame or embarrassment) that impede brainstorming or artistic experimentation in design.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Imaginative play and role play may allow adult individuals to practice useful habits such as [[learned optimism]], which is helpful in managing fear or [[terror management theory|terrors]]. Play also offers adults the opportunity to practice concepts that may not have been explicitly or formally taught (e.g. how to manage misinformation or deceit). Thus, even though play is just one of many tools used by effective adults, it remains a necessary one.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17play.html?pagewanted=all|title=Taking Play Seriously|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Robin M Henig|date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace==
There has been extensive research when it comes to the benefits of play amongst [[child]]ren, [[youth]], and [[adolescence]]. Most commonly overlooked are the benefits of play for adults, more specifically, adults who spend a lot of time in the workplace. Many adults in North America are in the workforce and spend half of their waking hours in a workplace environment with little to no time for play.&lt;ref&gt;Prodaniuk, Plotnikoff, Spence, &amp; Wilson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Play in this context refers to leisure-type activities with colleagues during lunch breaks or short breaks throughout the working day. Leisure activities could include, but are not limited to, different forms of physical [[sport]] activities, [[card games]], [[board games]], [[video games]] and interaction-based type video [[games]], [[foosball]], [[ping-pong]], [[yoga]], and boot-camp sessions.

Research shows that playing games may promote a persistent and optimistic motivational style and [[positive affect]].&lt;ref name="Ventura et al., 2013"&gt;Ventura et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affect enhances people’s experiences, [[enjoyment]], and sense of [[Contentment|satisfaction]] derived from the activity, during their engagement with a certain task. While people are engaged in their work, positive affect increases the satisfaction they feel from the work, and this has also been shown to increase their [[creativity]] and improve their performance on [[problem-solving]] tasks as well as other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Erez &amp; Isen, 2002; Isen, Daubman, &amp; Nowicki, 1987; Staw &amp; Barsade, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive affect may lead to lasting work success.&lt;ref name="Ventura et al., 2013"/&gt;

Studies show that work and play are mutually supportive. Employees need to experience the sense of newness, [[flow (psychology)|flow]], [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] and liveliness that play provides. By doing this, it will provide the employee with the sense that they are integrated within the organization, and therefore they will feel and perform better.&lt;ref name="playaboutit.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://playaboutit.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/workplace-remedy/|title=Workplace Remedy|date=4 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By incorporating play at work, it will also result in more [[productivity]], [[creativity]] and innovation, higher job satisfaction, greater workplace [[morale]], stronger or new social bonds, improved job performance, a decrease in staff turnover, [[absenteeism]] &lt;ref name="helpguide.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/emotional-health/benefits-of-play-for-adults.htm|title=The Benefits of Play for Adults|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress. Decreased stress leads to less illness, which results in lower health care costs.&lt;ref name="playaboutit.wordpress.com"/&gt; Play at work may help employees function and cope when under stress, refresh body and mind, encourage teamwork, trigger creativity, and increase energy while preventing burnout.&lt;ref name="helpguide.org"/&gt;

Studies show that companies that encourage play at work, whether short breaks throughout the day or during lunch breaks experience more success because it leads to positive emotion amongst employees. Risk taking, confidence in presenting novel ideas, and embracing unusual and fresh perspectives are common characteristics associated with play at work.&lt;ref name="Better Way 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://playaboutit.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/all-work-and-no-play-theres-a-better-way/|title=“All Work and No Play?

Staff tries to down-key playfight invitations to “treatment” or “learning,” but playfighting also offers youth and staff identificatory respite from the institutional regime. Wästerfors (2016) has found that playfighting is a recurrent pattern in the social life of a youth care institution and sits at the core of what inmates and staff have to deal with &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0891241614554087|title=Playfights as Trouble and Respite|first=David|last=Wästerfors|date=1 April 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=45|issue=2|pages=168–197|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0891241614554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seniors ==
Older adults represent one of the fastest growing populations around the world.&lt;ref name="seniors:1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lockett|first1 = Donna|last2 = Willis|first2 = Alette|last3 = Edwards|first3 = Nancy|title = Through Seniors' Eyes: An Exploratory Qualitative Study to Identify Environmental Barriers to and Facilitators of Walking|journal = CJNR|date = 2005|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 48–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Chen|first1 = Tinghao|last2 = Sun|first2 = Kuo-Shun|title = Exploring the strategy to improve senior citizens' participations on recreational sports|journal = Knowledge-Based Systems|date = 2012|volume = 26|pages = 86–92|doi = 10.1016/j.knosys.2011.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Crocker|first1 = Peter R.E.|title = Sport and Exercise Psychology: A Canadian Perspective|date = 2011|publisher = Pearson|location = Toronto, Canada|edition = 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[United Nations]] predicted an increase of those aged 60 and above from 629 million in 2002 to approximately two billion in 2050&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=United Nations |title=State of world population 2002: People, poverty and possibilities |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/pdf/english/swp2002eng.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=978-0-89714-650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased life expectancy does not necessarily translate to a better [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this reason, research has begun to investigate methods to maintain and/or improve quality of life among older adults.

Similar to the data surrounding children and adults, play and activity are associated with improved health and quality of life among seniors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Fun Culture in Seniors' Online Communities|last = Nimrod|first = Galit|date = 2010|journal = The Gerontologist|doi = 10.1093/geront/gnq084|pmid = 21030471|access-date =|volume=51|issue = 2|pages=226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, play and activity tend to affect successful aging as well as boost well-being throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although children, adults, and seniors all tend to benefit from play, older adults often perform it in unique ways to account for possible issues, such as health restrictions, limited accessibility, and revised priorities.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For this reason, elderly people may partake in physical exercise groups, interactive [[video games]], and social forums specifically geared towards their needs and interests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aarhus|first1=Rikke|last2=Gronvall|first2=Erik|last3=Larsen|first3=Simon B.|last4=Wollsen|first4=Susanne|title=Turing Training into play: Emobodied gaming, seniors, physical training and motivation|journal=Gerontechnology|date=2011|volume=10|issue=2|pages=110–120|doi=10.4017/gt.2011.10.2.005.00}}&lt;/ref&gt; One qualitative research study found older adults often chose to engage in specific games such as [[dominoes]], [[checkers]], and [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppes|first1=S.|last2=Hally|first2=C.|last3=Sewell|first3=L.|title=An interest inventory of games for older adults|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Geriatrics|date=2000|volume=18|issue=2|pages=71–83|doi=10.1300/j148v18n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated a common pattern within game preferences among older adults; seniors often favor activities that encourage mental and physical fitness, incorporate past interests, have some level of competition, and foster a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppes|first1=S.|last2=Wilcox|first2=T.|last3=Graham|first3=G.|title=Meanings of play for older adults|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Geriatrics|date=2001|volume=18|issue=3|pages=57–68|doi=10.1300/j148v18n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers investigating play in older adults are also interested in the benefits of technology and video games as therapeutic tools. Studies show these outlets can lower the risk of developing particular diseases, reduce feelings of [[social isolation]] and stress, as well as promote creativity and the maintenance of cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; As a result, play as been integrated into physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions for seniors.&lt;ref name="seniors :5"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10220/18214 Jung, Y., Li, K. J., Ng, J. S., Wong, G. L. C.,&amp; Lee, K. (2009). Proceedings from the 6th Australasian Conference on Interactive Entertainment. Australia. retrieved from  hdl.handle.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to incorporate play into one's routine is important because these activities allow participants to express creativity,&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; improve verbal and non-verbal intelligence&lt;ref name="seniors :5" /&gt; as well as enhance balance.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These benefits may be especially crucial to seniors because evidence shows cognitive and physical functioning declines with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, other research argues it might not be aging that is associated with the decline in cognitive and physical capabilities. More specifically, some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;

With attention to these hypotheses, research shows play and activity tend to decline with age&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation, depression, and mobility issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; American studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; In comparison to other age groups, the elderly are more likely to experience a variety of barriers, such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues, that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costello|first1=Ellen|last2=Kafchinski|first2=Marcia|last3=Vrazel|first3=JoEllen|last4=Sullivan|first4=Patricia|title=Motivators, Barriers, and Beliefs Regarding Physical Activity in an Older Adult Population|journal=Geriatric Physical Therapy|date=2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=138–147|doi=10.1519/jpt.0b013e31820e0e71|pmid=21937904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although playing may benefit seniors, it also has the potential to negatively impact their health. For example, those who play may be more susceptible to injury.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt; Investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures, such as establishing safer recreational areas, that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life.&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;

A significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens.&lt;ref name="seniors :5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt; In order to support and promote play within the older population, studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment,&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:2" /&gt; improve conditions within recreational areas,&lt;ref name="seniors:1" /&gt; and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors.&lt;ref name="seniors:3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seniors:4" /&gt;

==Animals==

Evolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play, as there are so many reasons to avoid it. Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a [[polar bear]] and a [[dog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital.html "Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,"] TED talks&lt;/ref&gt; Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.&lt;ref name = "Berghänel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berghänel | first1 = A. | last2 = Schülke | first2 = O. | last3 = Ostner | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Locomotor play drives motor skill acquisition at the expense of growth: A life history trade-off | url = | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7| pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500451 | pmid = 26601237 | pmc = 4643810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the "attention-getting skill" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=20aea8a7-b668-4884-a5ff-d5902a45bbf3@sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4101&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=psyh&amp;AN=2009-00693-011|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observing play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?sid=9cb49118-94c7-47f6-bc46-c8a943726bc9@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=127&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=psyh&amp;AN=2011-16747-001|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory – "play as preparation" – was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.&lt;ref name="Berghänel" /&gt; While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

John Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&amp;nbsp;– part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Marc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a "flexibility" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid "false endpoints". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works "well enough", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; A study on two species of monkeys ''Presbytis entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.&lt;ref&gt;B. Ram Manohar and Reena Mathur (1992) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48732562 Interspecific Play Behaviour between Hanuman Langur ''Presbytis entellus'' and Rhesus Macaque ''Macaca mulatta''] Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 89(1):114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Play has varying effects and benefits to human development. There has been an abundance of research on the effects of different forms of play and how they influence various areas of a person’s life whether it is a child or an adult. These benefits of play can have cognitive, social and emotional or motivational effects on a person’s life or development.

=== Cognitive development===
'''Physical play'''

Various forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="cognitive:1" &gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2207676.2208323 | title=The acute cognitive benefits of casual exergame play | year=2012 | journal=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '12 | pages=1863 | last1 = Gao | first1 = Yue | last2 = Mandryk | first2 = Regan| isbn=9781450310154 | citeseerx=10.1.1.248.3183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers did a study and have developed an "exergame" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise. These games increase one’s heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties &lt;ref name="cognitive:1" /&gt; 
In this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions. The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.&lt;ref name="cognitive:1" /&gt;
  
'''Mental play'''

On the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),
"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities – when playing [[video game]] occurs in moderation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743598 Hollis, S. D. (2014). Cognitive effects and academic consequences of video game playing (Order No. 1566326).]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social development and play'''

Play can also influence one’s social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that "integral to positive development is the child’s social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.&lt;ref name="social:4"&gt;Sullivan, C. (2003). [https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/2271/1/MQ83828.pdf The benefits of parent-child play for the social development of preschoolers	with varying levels of anxiety problems]. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play&lt;ref name="social:4" /&gt; Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">In [[mathematics]], a '''polynomial sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of [[polynomial]]s indexed by the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., in which each [[indexed family|index]] is [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] to the degree of the corresponding polynomial.  Polynomial sequences are a topic of interest in [[enumerative combinatorics]] and [[algebraic combinatorics]], as well as [[applied mathematics]].

==Examples==

Some polynomial sequences arise in [[physics]] and [[approximation theory]] as the solutions of certain [[ordinary differential equation]]s:
* [[Laguerre polynomials]]
* [[Chebyshev polynomials]]
* [[Legendre polynomials]]
* [[Jacobi polynomials]]

Others come from [[statistics]]:
* [[Hermite polynomials]]

Many are studied in algebra and combinatorics:
* [[Monomial]]s
* [[Rising factorial]]s
* [[Falling factorial]]s

:''This article discusses the history of the principle of least action. For the application, please refer to [[action (physics)]].''
The '''principle of least action''' – or, more accurately, the '''principle of stationary action''' – is a [[variational principle]] that, when applied to the [[action (physics)|action]] of a [[mechanics|mechanical]] system, can be used to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for that system. In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] [[equations of motion]], and even [[general relativity]] (see [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]).

Schwinger, Selected Papers on Electrodynamics, Dover Publications Inc.(1958), pp. 312.{{ISBN|9780883076484}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.&lt;ref&gt;R.

It was historically called "least" because its solution requires finding the path that has the least value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chapter 19 of Volume II,  [[Richard Feynman|Feynman R]], [[Robert B.

The principle remains central in [[modern physics]] and [[mathematics]], being applied in [[thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2008.04.007 |title=Thermodynamics based on the principle of least abbreviated action: Entropy production in a network of coupled oscillators |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=323 |issue=8 |pages=1844–58 |year=2008 |last1=García-Morales |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pellicer |first2=Julio |last3=Manzanares |first3=José A. |bibcode=2008AnPhy.323.1844G |arxiv=cond-mat/0602186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1942PhDT.........5F |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |author1=Feynman |first1=Richard Phillips |year=1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[particle physics]], and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/LeastAction.pdf Principle of Least Action - damtp]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in [[Morse theory]]. [[Maupertuis' principle]] and [[Hamilton's principle]] exemplify the principle of stationary action.

The action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in [[optics]]. In [[ancient Greece]], [[Euclid]] wrote in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Scholars often credit [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744&lt;ref name="mau44"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Accord de différentes loix de la nature qui avoient jusqu’ici paru incompatibles|Accord de différentes lois de la nature qui avaient jusqu'ici paru incompatibles.]]'' (1744) Mém.

Ac.

In 1933, [[Paul Dirac]] discerned the [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|quantum mechanical underpinning]] of the principle in the [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|quantum interference]] of amplitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=Paul A. M. |authorlink=Paul Dirac |year=1933 |title=The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion |volume=3 |pages=64–72 |url=http://www.hep.anl.gov/czachos/soysoy/Dirac33.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General statement==
[[File:Least action principle.svg|250px|thumb|As the system evolves, '''q''' traces a path through [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (''δS'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (''δ'''''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The starting point is the ''[[action (physics)|action]]'', denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; (calligraphic S), of a physical system. It is defined as the [[integral (mathematics)|integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' between two instants of [[time in physics|time]] ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - technically a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') which define the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] 
= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and ''t'' is time.

Mathematically the principle is&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"&gt;Analytical Mechanics, L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57572-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' (lowercase Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]) means a ''small'' change. In words this reads:&lt;ref name=penrose/&gt;

:''The path taken by the system between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and configurations q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the one for which the '''action''' is '''stationary (no change)''' to '''first order'''.''

In applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}},t) dt = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

==Origins, statements, and controversy==

===Fermat===
{{main article|Fermat's principle}}
In the 1600s, [[Pierre de Fermat]] postulated that "''light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time''," which is known as the '''principle of least time''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"/&gt;

===Maupertuis===
{{main article|Maupertuis principle}}
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly:

{{quote|The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements.|Pierre Louis Maupertuis&lt;ref&gt;Chris Davis. [http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html ''Idle theory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043538/http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html |date=2006-06-15 }} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]",

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Maupertuis' principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta \int 2T(t)  dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

which is the integral of twice what we now call the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the system.

===Euler===

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes''. Beginning with the second paragraph:

{{cquote|Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its speed be ''v'' while being moved over an infinitesimal distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum ''Mv'' that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give {{nowrap|''Mv'' ''ds''}}, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;\int Mv\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
or, provided that ''M'' is constant along the path,
:&lt;math&gt;M\int v\,ds&lt;/math&gt;.|20px|20px|Leonhard Euler&lt;ref name="eul44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler, [[s:la:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|Additamentum II]] ([http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E065h external link]), ibid. ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Translation:Methodus_inveniendi/Additamentum_II&amp;oldid=6399338| English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Euler states, ∫''Mv''d''s'' is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or [[reduced action]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Euler's principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta\int p\,dq=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

===Disputed priority===

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; and even the [[Frederick the Great|King of Prussia]] entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while [[Voltaire]] defended König.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898&lt;ref name="ger98" /&gt; and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913&lt;ref name="kab13" /&gt; uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further development==

Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

===Lagrange and Hamilton===
{{main article|Hamilton's principle}}
Much of the calculus of variations was stated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. J. Struik|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200-1800|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=1969}} pp. 406-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501496-0}} pp. 582-589&lt;/ref&gt; and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In ''Méchanique Analytique'' (1788) Lagrange derived the general [[Lagrangian equations of motion|equations of motion]] of a mechanical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagrange|first=Joseph-Louis|title=Mécanique Analytique|year=1788}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Hamilton, "On a General Method in Dynamics", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/GenMeth.pdf Part I (1834) p.247-308]; [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/SecEssay.pdf Part II (1835) p. 95-144]. (''From the collection [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/ Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): Mathematical Papers] edited by David R. Wilkins, School of Mathematics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. (2000); also reviewed as [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ On a General Method in Dynamics]'')&lt;/ref&gt; applied the variational principle to the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in their present form.

===Jacobi and Morse===
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other [[stationary points]] (maxima or stationary [[saddle points]]); most of his work focused on [[geodesics]] on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Jacobi, ''Vorlesungen über Dynamik, gehalten an der Universität Königsberg im Wintersemester 1842-1843''. A. Clebsch (ed.) (1866); Reimer; Berlin. 290 pages, available online [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_JACOBI__8_1_0  Œuvres complètes volume '''8'''] at [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/OEUVRES/ Gallica-Math] from the [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica Bibliothèque nationale de France].&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Marston Morse (1934). "The Calculus of Variations in the Large", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publication'' '''18'''; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of [[conjugate points]] in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

===Gauss and Hertz===
Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Disputes about possible teleological aspects==

The  mathematical equivalence of the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]]
counterpart has important philosophical implications.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

states that the ''instantaneous'' force '''F''' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration '''a''' at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at position x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an [[extremum]] of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, ''the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they ''de facto'' do not possess''&lt;ref name="Stöltzner1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stöltzner|first=Michael|title=Inside Versus Outside: Action Principles and Teleology|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-48649-4|pages=33–62 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48647-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics maintain this apparent [[teleology]] occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this "backward" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] formalism of [[Path integral formulation|path integration]], in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by the speculative fiction writer [[Ted Chiang]] contains visual depictions of [[Fermat's Principle]] along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. [[Keith Devlin]]'s ''The Math Instinct'' contains a chapter, "Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus" that discusses the calculus "embedded" in some animals as they solve the "least time" problem in actual situations.

'''Public morality''' refers to [[morality|moral and ethical standards]] enforced in a society, by law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the content of the [[Mass media|media]], and to conduct in [[public place]]s.  A famous remark of [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], that she did not care what people did as long as they "didn't frighten the horses" shows that in some sense even high [[Toleration|tolerance]] expects a ''public'' limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite extreme a [[theocracy]] may equate public morality with religious instruction, and give both the equal force of law.

Public morality often means [[sex and the law|regulation of sexual matters]], including [[prostitution]] and [[homosexuality]], but also matters of dress and [[nudity]], [[pornography]], acceptability in social terms of [[cohabitation]] before [[marriage]], and the protection of children. It is a main justification for [[censorship]]; it can lead to campaigns against [[profanity]], and so be at odds with [[freedom of speech]]. [[Gambling]] is generally controlled: [[casino]]s have been considered much more of a threat than large-scale [[lotteries]] or [[football pools]]. [[Public drunkenness]] is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. [[Abortion]] is sometimes treated as an aspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. [[AIDS]] as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.

Views on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been proscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public.{{fact|date=December 2015}} These examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often move towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised by [[moral panic]]s, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after [[Shakespeare]]'s death by the English [[Puritan]]s.

It may also be applied to the ''morals of public life''. [[Political corruption]], or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is not a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the [[public interest]], while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.

The '''regression''' (or '''regressive''') '''fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]]. It assumes that something has returned to normal because of corrective actions taken while it was abnormal. This fails to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of the [[post hoc fallacy]].

==Explanation==
Things like golf scores, the earth's temperature, and chronic back pain fluctuate naturally and usually [[regression toward the mean|regress towards the mean]]. The logical flaw is to make predictions that expect exceptional results to continue as if they were average (see [[Representativeness heuristic]]). People are most likely to take action when variance is at its peak. Then after results become more normal they believe that their action was the cause of the change when in fact it was not causal.

This use of the word "regression" was coined by Sir [[Francis Galton]] in a study from 1885 called "Regression Toward Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature". He showed that the height of children from very short or very tall parents would move towards the average. In fact, in any situation where two variables are less than perfectly correlated, an exceptional score on one variable may not be matched by an equally exceptional score on the other variable. The imperfect correlation between parents and children (height is not entirely heritable) means that the distribution of heights of their children will be centered somewhere between the average of the parents and the average of the population as whole. Thus, any single child can be more extreme than the parents, but the odds are against it.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;When his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little.  Therefore, he benefited from the doctor's treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pain subsiding a little after it has gotten worse is more easily explained by regression towards the mean.  Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The student did exceptionally poorly last semester, so I punished him.  He did much better this semester.  Clearly, punishment is effective in improving students' grades.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often exceptional performances are followed by more normal performances, so the change in performance might better be explained by regression towards the mean.  Incidentally, some experiments have shown that people may develop a systematic bias for punishment and against reward because of reasoning analogous to this example of the regression fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner, 1985; Gilovich, 1991 pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The frequency of accidents on a road fell after a speed camera was installed.  Therefore, the speed camera has improved road safety.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speed cameras are often installed after a road incurs an exceptionally high number of accidents, and this value usually falls (regression to mean) immediately afterwards.  Many speed camera proponents attribute this fall in accidents to the speed camera, without observing the overall trend.

Some authors use the [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|''Sports Illustrated'' cover jinx]] as an example of a regression effect: extremely good performances are likely to be followed by less extreme ones, and athletes are chosen to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' only after extreme performances. Attributing this to a "[[jinx]]" rather than regression, as some athletes reportedly believe, is an example of committing the regression fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, 1991 pp. 26–27; Plous, 1993 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misapplication==
On the other hand, dismissing valid explanations can lead to a worse situation. For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the Western Allies invaded Normandy, creating a second major front, German control of Europe waned. Clearly, the combination of the Western Allies and the USSR drove the Germans back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Fallacious evaluation:'' "Given that the counterattacks against Germany occurred only after they had conquered the greatest amount of territory under their control, regression to the mean can explain the retreat of German forces from occupied territories as a purely random fluctuation that would have happened without any intervention on the part of the USSR or the Western Allies." However, this was not the case. The reason is that political power and occupation of territories is not primarily determined by random events, making the concept of regression to the mean inapplicable (on the large scale).

In essence, misapplication of regression to the mean can reduce all events to a [[just-so story|"just so" story]], without cause or effect. (Such misapplication takes as a premise that all events are random, as they must be for the concept of regression to the mean to be validly applied.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11333">A '''runoff model''' is  a mathematical model describing the [[rainfall]]'''&amp;ndash;'''[[Surface runoff|runoff]] relations of a rainfall ''catchment area'', [[drainage basin]] or ''watershed''. More precisely, it produces a surface runoff [[hydrograph]] in response to a rainfall event, represented by and input as a [[hyetograph]]. In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.&lt;br&gt;
A well known runoff model is the ''linear reservoir'', but in practice it has limited applicability.&lt;br&gt;
The runoff model with a ''non-linear reservoir'' is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region.  When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using [[Routing (hydrology)|flood routing]] techniques.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|300px]]
Rainfall-runoff models need to be [[calibration|calibrated]] before they can be used.

==Linear reservoir==
[[File:Drainage_basin.png|thumb|200px|A watershed or drainage basin]]
[[File:LinReserv.svg|thumb|150px|Figure 1. A linear reservoir]]
The hydrology of a linear reservoir (figure 1) is governed by two equations.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. de Zeeuw, 1973. ''Hydrograph analysis for areas with mainly groundwater runoff''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 321-358. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
#flow equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; Q = A.S, with units [L/T], where L is length (e.g. mm) and T is time (e.g. h, day)
#continuity or water balance equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; R = Q + dS/dT, with units [L/T]
where:&lt;br&gt;
Q is the ''runoff'' or'' discharge'' &lt;br&gt;
R is the ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'' or ''recharge'' &lt;br&gt;
A is the constant ''reaction factor'' or ''response factor'' with unit [1/T] &lt;br&gt;
S is the water storage with unit [L] &lt;br&gt;
dS is a differential or small increment of S&lt;br&gt; 
dT is a differential or small increment of T

'''Runoff equation'''&lt;br&gt;
A combination of the two previous equations results in a [[differential equation]], whose solution is:
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) } + R [ 1 &amp;minus; exp '''{''' &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) '''}''' ]
This is the ''runoff equation'' or ''discharge equation'', where Q1 and Q2 are the values of Q at time T1 and T2 respectively while T2&amp;minus;T1 is a small time step during which the recharge can be assumed constant.

'''Computing the total hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
Provided the value of A is known, the ''total hydrograph'' can be obtained using a successive number of time steps and computing, with the ''runoff equation'', the runoff at the end of each time step from the runoff at the end of the previous time step.

'''Unit hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
The discharge may also be expressed as: Q = &amp;minus; dS/dT . Substituting herein the expression of Q in equation (1) gives the differential equation dS/dT = A.S, of which the solution is: S = exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . Replacing herein S by Q/A according to equation (1), it is obtained that: Q = A exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . This is called the [[hydrograph|instantaneous unit hydrograph]] (IUH) because the Q herein equals Q2 of the foregoing runoff equation using ''R'' = 0, and taking S as ''unity'' which makes Q1 equal to A according to equation (1).&lt;br&gt;
The availability of the foregoing ''runoff equation'' eliminates the necessity of calculating the ''total hydrograph'' by the summation of partial hydrographs using the ''IUH'' as is done with the more complicated [[convolution]] method.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Kraijenhoff van de Leur, 1973. ''Rainfall-runoff relations and computational models''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 245-320. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Determining the response factor A'''&lt;br&gt;
When the ''response factor'' A can be determined from the characteristics of the watershed (catchment area), the reservoir can be used as a ''deterministic model'' or ''analytical model'', see [[hydrological modelling]].&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, the factor A can be determined from a data record of rainfall and runoff using the method explained below under ''non-linear reservoir''. With this method  the reservoir can be used as a [[black box]] model.

'''Conversions'''&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;mm/day corresponds to 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha of the watershed&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;l/s per ha corresponds to 8.64&amp;nbsp;mm/day or 86.4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha

==Non-linear reservoir==
[[File:NonLinRes.svg|left|thumb|200px|Figure 2. A non-linear reservoir]]

}}

Contrary to the linear reservoir, the non linear reservoir has a reaction factor A that is not a constant,&lt;ref&gt;''Land drainage and soil salinity: some Mexican experiences''. In: ILRI Annual Report 1995, p. 44-53. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen (ILRI), The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/mexican.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is a function of S or Q (figure 2, 3).

Normally A increases with Q and S because the higher the water level is the higher the discharge capacity becomes. The factor is therefore called Aq instead of A.&lt;br&gt;
The non-linear reservoir has ''no'' usable [[unit hydrograph]].

During periods without rainfall or recharge, i.e. when ''R'' = 0, the runoff equation reduces to
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus; Aq (T2 &amp;minus; T1) }, or:
or, using a ''unit time step'' (T2 &amp;minus; T1 = 1) and solving for Aq:
* Aq = &amp;minus; ln (Q2/Q1)
Hence, the reaction or response factor Aq can be determined from runoff or discharge measurements using ''unit time steps'' during dry spells, employing a [[numerical method]].

Figure 3 shows the relation between Aq (Alpha) and Q for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone.&lt;br&gt;
Figure 4 shows observed and ''simulated'' or ''reconstructed'' discharge [[hydrograph]] of the watercourse at the downstream end of the same valley.&lt;ref&gt;A.Huizing, 1988. ''Rainfall-Runoff relations in a small cultivated valley in Sierra Leone''. Wetland Utilization Research Project. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recharge==
[[File:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|200px|left|Figure 7. Runoff from the water balance]]
The recharge, also called ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'', can be modeled by a ''pre-reservoir'' (figure 6) giving the recharge as ''overflow''. The pre-reservoir knows the following elements:
*a maximum storage (Sm) with unit length [L]
*an actual storage (Sa) with unit [L]
*a relative storage: Sr = Sa/Sm
*a maximum escape rate (Em) with units length/time [L/T]. It corresponds to the maximum rate of [[evapotranspiration|evaporation]] plus ''percolation'' and [[groundwater recharge]], which will not take part in the runoff process (figure 5, 6)
*an actual escape rate: Ea = Sr.Em
*a  storage deficiency: Sd = Sm + Ea &amp;minus; Sa

The recharge during a unit time step (T2&amp;minus;T1=1) can be found from ''R'' = Rain &amp;minus; Sd&lt;br&gt;
The actual storage at the end of a ''unit time step'' is found as Sa2 = Sa1 + Rain &amp;minus; ''R'' &amp;minus; Ea, where Sa1 is the actual storage at the start of the time step.

The [[runoff curve number|Curve Number method]] (CN method) gives another way to calculate the recharge. The ''initial abstraction'' herein compares with Sm &amp;minus; Si, where Si is the initial value of Sa.

==Nash model==
[[File:Tank Model.jpg|thumb|The Nash Model uses a cascade of linear reservoirs to predict streamflow. Software for this model exists.&lt;ref&gt;Software description for the Nash cascade hydrological model. On line: [https://www.waterlog.info/nashmod.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Nash model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental and Hydrological Systems Modelling|last=Jayawardena|first=A. W.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-46532-8|location=US|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a series (cascade) of linear reservoirs in which each reservoir empties into the next until the runoff is obtained. For [[calibration]], the model requires considerable research.

==Software==
Figures 3 and 4 were made with the RainOff program,&lt;ref&gt;''RainOff'', a computer model for rainfall-runoff relations using the concept of a non-linear reservoir. Download from : [http://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [https://www.waterlog.info/rainoff.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; designed to analyse rainfall and runoff using the non-linear reservoir model with a pre-reservoir. The program also contains an example of the hydrograph of an agricultural subsurface drainage system for which the value of A can be obtained from the system's characteristics.&lt;ref&gt; Theory of the non-linear reservoir [https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/reservoir.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SMART hydrological model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=O’Loughlin|first2=Fiachra E.|last3=Bruen|first3=Michael|date=2016-05-01|title=Understanding hydrological flow paths in conceptual catchment models using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009830041530039X|journal=Computers &amp; Geosciences|series=Uncertainty and Sensitivity in Surface Dynamics Modeling|volume=90, Part B|pages=66–77|doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2015.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes agricultural subsurface drainage flow, in addition to soil and groundwater reservoirs, to simulate the flow path contributions to streamflow.

[[Vflo|V''flo'']] is another software program for modeling runoff.  [[Vflo|V''flo'']] uses [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] and [[GIS]] data to generate physics-based, distributed runoff simulation.

The [[WEAP|WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning)]] software platform models runoff and percolation from climate and land use data, using a choice of linear and non-linear reservoir models.

The [http://rsminerve.hydro10.org/ RS MINERVE] software platform simulates the formation of free surface run-off flow and its propagation in rivers or channels. The software is based on object-oriented programming and allows hydrologic and hydraulic modeling according to a semi-distributed conceptual scheme with different rainfall-runoff model such as HBV, GR4J, SAC-SMA or SOCONT.

{{Western dress codes}}

In Western clothing '''semi-formal''' is a grouping of [[Western dress code|dress codes]] indicating the sort of clothes worn to events with a level of [[Etiquette|protocol]] between [[informal attire|informal]] (e.g., [[lounge suit]]) and [[formal wear|formal]].  In the modern era,  an [[Evening gown|evening dress]] or [[cocktail dress]] is customary for women.&lt;ref name="Boswell2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=Sandra|title=Protocol Matters|year=2007|publisher=[[Canon Press]]|language=English|isbn=9781591280255|page=181|quote=After-five clothing is a subcategory of semiformal eveningwear. Often called the "cocktail dress," this type of dress if often made of shiny fabric and can be short, from being shorter than knee up to mid-calf, but seldom reaches to the ankle as does stricter semiformal evening wear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/attire-guide-dress-codes-from-casual-to-white-tie/|title=Attire Guide: Dress Codes from Casual to White Tie - The Emily Post Institute|year=2016|publisher=[[The Emily Post Institute]]|language=English|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.
{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=150

In addition, equivalent versions may be permitted of semi-formally applicable [[ceremonial dress]]es (including [[court dress]]es, [[diplomatic uniform]]s and [[academic dress]]es), [[full dress uniform]]s, [[religious clothing]], and [[national costume]]s, and military [[mess dress]]es.

==Day wear: black lounge suit==
{{main|Black lounge suit}}
In the daytime (before 6 p.m.), the semi-formal code requires for men a black tail-less lounge coat with vertical black and grey stripes or checked [[formal trousers]], with a black waistcoat.  This combination is a less formal version of [[morning dress]], which features a longer, cutaway [[morning coat]].  This semi-formal ensemble is sometimes referred to as a "[[stroller (style)|stroller]]" in [[North America]], or a Marlborough suit in the United Kingdom. Because black was then reserved for formalwear, it was unknown as a color for [[lounge suit]]s, so the term was unambiguous. In the U.K. this mode of dress is now extremely unusual, though some [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodges which meet during the day rather than (as is more common) in the evening do continue to specify it as their dress code. It also still is worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped trousers are in some circles referred to as "barrister trousers".  In [[German language|German]], a stroller is called a ''Stresemann'', after the [[Weimar Republic|German]] foreign secretary [[Gustav Stresemann]]. Stresemann, like other German politicians of his age, wore morning dress or a [[frock coat]] in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] or when making public appearances. However, Stresemann found the long coat impractical for daily work in the Chancellery. To avoid having to change completely, he began to wear the prototype of this jacket at his office, while switching to a morning coat when engaged on more formal business. The style quickly caught on as a more practical variation on morning dress. In [[Japan]], it is known as a "director's suit", from the term ''[[inside director]]''.

==Evening wear: "black tie" dinner suit==
{{main|Black tie|Dinner suit}}
For evening wear (after 6 p.m.), the corresponding code is [[black tie]].&lt;ref name="Flusser02"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In formal evening dress, or [[white tie]] dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal.

The origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, [[Prince of Wales]] (subsequently [[Edward VII]]), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the [[Dress coat|swallowtail coat]].&lt;ref name=Flusser01&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife [[Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter|Cora]] to [[Sandringham House]], the Prince's hunting estate in [[Norfolk]]. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, [[Henry Poole &amp; Co.]], in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket.&lt;ref name=Flusser03&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]]|pages=240, 241, 303 |isbn=0-06-019144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to [[Tuxedo Park, New York]], in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the [[Tuxedo Club|Tuxedo Park Club]]. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York City]], other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the "tuxedo".&lt;ref name=Flusser03/&gt;

From its creation into the 1920s, this [[dinner jacket]] was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance.&lt;ref name= Flusser01/&gt;

Etiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage wearing of black tie as too informal for [[wedding]]s, or indeed any event before 6 p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Charlotte |last2=DeMontravel |first2=Jacqueline |date=2001 |title=21st century etiquette: a guide to manners for the modern age |location= |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |page=210 |isbn=978-1-56731-629-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as by [[Emily Post]] (1872-1960) and [[Amy Vanderbilt]] (1908-1974). The latter arguing that "no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14638">'''Sensory overload''' occurs when one or more of the body's [[senses]] experiences [[over-stimulation]] from the environment.  There are many environmental elements that affect an individual. Examples of these elements are [[urbanization]], crowding, [[noise]], [[mass media]], [[technology]], and the explosive growth of [[information]].&lt;ref name="North Shore Pediatric Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nspt4kids.com/health-topics-conditions/sensory-overload/ |title=What is Sensory Overload |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FX&gt;[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/EffectsofPsychologicalTorturepaper%28Final%2911June10.pdf Effects of Psychological Torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APA&gt;[http://progressivehistorians.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/my-apa-paper-on-isolation-sensory-deprivation-sensory-overload/ Isolation, Sensory Deprivation &amp; Sensory Overload]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
There are a wide variety of symptoms that have been found to be associated with sensory overload. These symptoms can occur in both children and adults. Some of these symptoms are:
*[[Irritability]]
*"Shutting down", or refusing to participate in activities and interact with others
*Avoiding touching or being touched
*Getting overexcited 
*Covering [[eyes]] around bright lights
*Making poor [[eye contact]]
*Covering [[ears]] to close out [[sound]]s or [[voice]]s
*Complaining about noises that do not affect others
*Having difficulty focusing on an activity
*Constantly changing activities without any completing tasks
*Irritation caused by shoes, socks, tags, or different textures
*Over-sensitivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds
*Having trouble with social interactions
*Extremely high or extremely low activity levels&lt;ref name="North Shore Pediatric Therapy"/&gt;
*Muscle tension
*Fidgeting and [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]]
*Angry outbursts
*[[Sleeplessness]] and [[fatigue]]
*Difficulty concentrating&lt;ref name="Sharon Heller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sharonheller.net/psychopathology.php |title=SPD &amp; Psychopathology in Adults |format= |work=Sharon Heller |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sensory overload can result from the overstimulation of any of the senses.
*'''Hearing''': loud noise, or sound from multiple sources, such as several people talking at once.
*'''Sight''': crowded or cluttered spaces, bright lights, strobing lights, or environments with lots of movement such as crowds or frequent scene changes on television.
*'''Smell and taste''': strong aromas or spicy foods.
*'''Touch''': tactile sensations such as being touched by another person or the feel of cloth on skin.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/sensory-overload-sources-and-strategies |title=Sensory Overload: Sources and Strategies|format= |work= CFIDS &amp; Fibromyalgia Self-Help |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Vestibular''': such as dizziness or [[motion sickness]].

==As component of other disorders and conditions==
Sensory overload has been found to be associated with other disorders and conditions such as:
*[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)
*[[Fibromyalgia]] (FM)
*[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]] (ME/CFS)
*[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)
*[[Autism spectrum disorders]]&lt;ref name="O'Neill 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Neill M |author2=Jones RS |title=Sensory-perceptual abnormalities in autism: a case for more research? |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=283–93 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9229259 |doi= 10.1023/A:1025850431170|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marco 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marco EJ |author2=Hinkley LB |author3=Hill SS |author4=Nagarajan SS |title=Sensory processing in autism: a review of neurophysiologic findings |journal=Pediatr.

*[[Generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD)
* [[Schizophrenia]] (see also [[Sensory gating#Schizophrenia|sensory gating]])
* [[Synesthesia]]
* [[Sensory processing disorder]]
* [[Tourette Syndrome|Tourette syndrome]]

==Treatments==
There are many different ways to treat sensory overload.  One way to reduce this tension is to participate in [[occupational therapy]]; however, there are many ways for people with symptoms to reduce it themselves.  Being able to identify one's own triggers of sensory overload can help reduce, eliminate, or avoid them.&lt;ref name="Help for Adult SPD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spdsupport.org/articles/21-help-adult-spd.shtml |title=Help for Adult SPD |work=SPD Support |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often the quickest way to ease sensory overload symptoms is to remove oneself from the situation.  Deep pressure against the skin combined with proprioceptive input that stimulates the receptors in the joints and ligaments often calms the nervous system. Reducing sensory input such as eliminating distressing sounds and lowering the lights can help. Calming, focusing music works for some. If a quick break does not relieve the problem, an extended rest is advised. People with [[sensory processing disorder|sensory processing issues]] may benefit from a sensory diet of activities and accommodations designed to prevent sensory overload and retrain the brain to process sensory input more typically. It is important in situations of sensory overload to calm oneself and return to a normal level.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"/&gt;

==Prevention==
There are two different methods to prevent sensory overload:  avoidance and setting limits.  The process of avoidance involves creating a more quiet and orderly environment.  This includes keeping the noise to a minimum and reducing the sense of clutter.  To prevent sensory overload, it is important to rest before big events and focus your attention and energy on one thing at a time.  Setting limits involves restricting the amount of time spent on various activities and selecting settings to carefully avoid crowds and noise.  One may also limit interactions with specific people to help prevent sensory overload.&lt;ref name="CFIDS"/&gt;

== Marketing ==
It can be difficult to distinguish and understand information when experiencing sensory overload. Even such meaningless stimuli such as white noise or flickering lights may induce sensory overload.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malhotra|first1=Naresh K.|title=Information and sensory overload. Information and sensory overload in psychology and marketing|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=September 5, 2006|volume=1|issue=3-4|pages=9–21|doi=10.1002/mar.4220010304|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.4220010304/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory overload is common among consumers as many corporations compete with each other especially when advertising.  Advertisers will use the best colours, words, sounds, textures, designs and much more to get the attention of a customer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The influence of selected senses on consumer experience: A brandy case|last = Pentz|first = Chris|date = May 14, 2013|journal = Acta Commercii|doi = 10.4102/ac.v13i1.183|pmid = |access-date = |first2 = Charlene|last2 = Gerber}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can influence the consumer, as they will be drawn to a product that is more attention grabbing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, policy makers and advertisers must be aware
that too much information or attention-grabbing products can cause sensory overload.

=== Implications of public policy ===

Implications of a public policy in regards to information overload have two main assumptions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The assumptions the policymakers have are, first, to assume that consumers have a great deal of processing capacity and a great deal of time to process information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Secondly, consumers can always absorb the information without serious concern about how much information has been presented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As researchers have pointed out, policymakers should better understand the difference between the process and availability of information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will help decrease the possibility of information overload.  In some cases, the time to process such information in a commercial can be 6 out of 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can lead consumers confused and overloaded with such fast paced information thrown at them. To understand how consumers process information three factors must be analyzed. Factors such as the amount of information given, the source of corrective information and the way in which it is all presented to the consumer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different types of media have different processing demands. An optimal outcome for policy makers to influence advertisers to try is to present information through a TV commercial stating simple facts about a product and then encourage the audience to check out their website for more details. Therefore, their quick processing time of a commercial was not overloaded with information thus saving the consumer from sensory overload.

=== Implications for the consumers ===

Consumers today are forced to learn to cope with overloading and an abundance of information,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; through the radio, billboards, television, newspapers and much more. Information is everywhere and being thrown at consumers from every angle and direction.  Therefore, Naresh K. Malhotra, the author of Information and Sensory Overload presents the following guidelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First, consumers must try to limit the intake of external information and sensory inputs to avoid sensory overload.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be done by tuning out irrelevant information presented by the media and marketers to get the attention of the consumer. Second, record important information externally rather than mentally. Information can be easily forgotten mentally once the individual becomes overloaded by their sense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus it is recommended for a consumer to write down important information rather than store it mentally. Third, when examining a product, do not overload their senses by examining more than five products at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will lead to confusion and frustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fourth, process information where there is less irrelevant information around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will eliminate external information and sensory distractions such as white noise and other information presented in an environment. Finally, it is important to make consuming a pleasant and relaxed experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will help diminish the stress, overwhelming feeling, and experience of sensory overload.

=== Human senses and marketing ===

Using the senses in marketing can be a useful sales tactic. Most commonly, marketers will take advantage of the humans four out of five senses to increase the amount of information being presented to the customer. 
* The sense of smell can affect a person's evaluation of products. Researchers have suggested that good or bad feelings can be generated by smells and usually associated with upbringing, emotion, learning and even culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the sense of smell is a tool to attract an individual’s attention to a certain product.
* The sense of hearing is a powerful sense. The ears are capable of picking up all sorts of information and can contribute to people's feelings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Marketers will play music to help create and control feelings within a consumer. This music can help great a positive and comfortable association with the brand.
* The sense of touch helps determine the quality of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus companies of certain products will make the sense of touch available to their consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "Touch here" or "feel me" signs encourage customers to interact with the product. Allowing a company's customers to touch a product will help add information from their senses. 
* The sense of sight is the most focused-on sense by marketers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have found that when consumers see warm colours such as orange or red their blood pressure and heart rate increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The opposite effect occurs when customers see cool colours such as green or blue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, fast-food corporations will more than often use the colours red to symbolize fast and speedy for advertising and marketing purposes.

Not many studies have been done on sensory overload, but one example of a sensory overload study was reported by Lipowski (1975)&lt;ref name="Lipowski1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipowski| first1=Z.J.| title=Sensory and information inputs overload: Behavioral effects|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=16|issue=3|year=1975| pages=199–221| issn=0010-440X| doi=10.1016/0010-440X(75)90047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his research review on the topic that discussed the work done by Japanese researchers at [[Tohoku University]]. The Tohoku researchers exposed their subjects to intense visual and auditory stimuli presented randomly in a condition of confinement ranging in duration from three to five hours. Subjects showed heightened and sustained arousal as well as mood changes such as aggression, anxiety, and sadness. These results have helped open the door to further research on sensory overload.

==History==
Sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] contributed to the description of sensory overload in his 1903 essay "[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]." Simmel describes an urban landscape of constant sensory stimuli against which the city-dweller must create a barrier in order to remain sane. For Simmel, the sensory overload of modern urban life depletes the body’s reservoirs of energy, leading, among other things, to a jaded or blasé [blasiert] mentality and an calculating, instrumentalizing approach to others.&lt;ref name="Modernism Lab Essays"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Metropolis_and_Mental_Life |title=The Metropolis and Mental Life |format= |work=Modernism Lab Essays |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel's approach can be compared to [[Freud]]'s writings on [[Shell shock]] as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s analysis of "shock" and urban life in his 1939 essay "On Some Motifs in [[Baudelaire]]."

The '''distinction between sex and gender''' differentiates a person's [[biological sex]] (the anatomy of an individual's [[reproductive system]], and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s) from that person's [[gender]], which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person ([[gender role]]) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness ([[gender identity]]).&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;Prince, Virginia. 2005. "Sex vs. Gender." ''International Journal of Transgenderism''. 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil R., Carlson|title=Psychology: The science of behavior.

In some circumstances, an individual's [[assigned sex]] and gender do not align, and the person may be [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; In other cases, an individual may have biological [[sex characteristics]] that complicate sex assignment, and the person may be [[intersex]].

Among scientists, the term ''sex differences'' (as compared to ''gender differences'') is typically applied to [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] traits that are hypothesized to be evolved consequences of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.

== Sex ==
[[Anisogamy]], or the size differences of [[gamete]]s (sex cells), is the defining feature of the two sexes. By definition, males have small, mobile gametes ([[sperm]]); females have large and generally immobile gametes ([[Egg cell|ova]] or eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Daly, M. &amp; Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution and behavior. Monterey: Brooks Cole&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, typical male or female [[sexual differentiation]] includes the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s ([[ovary]] or [[testes]]), the balance of [[sex hormone]]s ([[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]), the [[Human reproductive system|internal reproductive anatomy]] (e.g. [[uterus]] or [[prostate gland]]), and the external genitalia (e.g. [[penis]] or [[vulva]]).&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

People whose internal psychological experience differs from their [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]] are [[transgender]], [[transsexual]], or [[Genderqueer|non-binary]].

The consensus among scientists is that all behaviors are [[phenotype]]s—complex interactions of both biology and environment—and thus [[nature vs. nurture]] is a misleading categorization.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp; Kaufer, D.

''Sex'' is annotated as different from ''gender'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where it says ''sex'' "tends now to refer to biological differences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50221203?query_type=word&amp;queryword=sex&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-RwfyiP-2884&amp;hilite=50221203 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (draft revision (online) Jun., 2010)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''sex'', noun 1, sense 2a.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) similarly states that "'sex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women" and that "'male' and 'female' are sex categories".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ ''What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"?''

The ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'' (5th ed.), however, lists ''sex'' as both "Either of the two divisions, designated female and male, by which most organisms are classified on the basis of their reproductive organs and functions" and "One's identity as either female or male," among other definitions.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=sex |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018005502/http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=sex |archivedate=2013-10-18 |df= }}''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 5th ed. 2011, ''sex'', senses 2a and 4, accessed Jun 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Historian [[Thomas W. Laqueur]] suggests that from the Renaissance to the 18th century, there was a prevailing inclination among doctors towards the existence of only one biological sex (the [[one-sex and two-sex theories|one-sex theory]], that women and men had the same fundamental reproductive structure).&lt;ref&gt;Lacqueur, Thomas Walter, ''Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Univ. Press, 1st Harvard Univ. Press pbk. ed. [5th printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-674-54355-6}}), © 1990), p.&amp;nbsp;134 (author prof. history Univ. Calif., Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[discourse]]s, this view persisted into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;[149] (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur asserts that even at its peak, the one-sex model was supported among highly educated Europeans but is not known to have been a popular view nor one entirely agreed upon by doctors who treated the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Thomas, ''Making Sex'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;68 &amp; 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex and gender took center stage in America in the time of wars, when women had to work and men were at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last = Lindsey|first = Linda.

== Gender ==
In the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', ''gender'' is defined as, "[i]n mod[ern] (esp[escially] feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.", with the earliest example cited being from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50093521?query_type=word&amp;queryword=gender&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=a4MJ-mHKT13-2771&amp;hilite=50093521 ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2d ed. (online) 1989)], as accessed Aug. 22, 2010, ''gender'', noun, sense 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (5th edition), in addition to defining gender the same way that it defines biological sex, also states that ''gender'' may be defined by identity as "neither entirely female nor entirely male"; its ''Usage Note'' adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people maintain that the word ''sex'' should be reserved for reference to the biological aspects of being male or female or to sexual activity, and that the word ''gender'' should be used only to refer to sociocultural roles. ... In some situations this distinction avoids ambiguity, as in ''gender research'', which is clear in a way that ''sex research'' is not. The distinction can be problematic, however. Linguistically, there isn't any real difference between ''gender bias'' and ''sex bias'', and it may seem contrived to insist that ''sex'' is incorrect in this instance.&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com, 5th ed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A working definition in use by the World Health Organization for its work is that "'[g]ender' refers to the [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women" and that "'masculine' and 'feminine' are gender categories."&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) used to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex'' when referring to physiological differences between male and female organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|author=|date=|website=hhs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170913082514/https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they reversed their position on this and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = December 19, 2011|accessdate = August 3, 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140809152800/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm283453.htm|archivedate = August 9, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender'' is also now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name="haig"/&gt;

[[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) makes a distinction between sex and gender in their most recent Media Reference Guide: Sex is "the classification of people as male or female" at birth, based on bodily characteristics such as chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. Gender identity is "one's internal, personal sense of being a man or woman (or a boy or a girl)".&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition.

Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]] maintain that gender is totally undetermined by sex. See, for example, ''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'', a widely influential feminist text.&lt;ref&gt;Benewick, Robert and Green, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWYbQkVyGMcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Shulamith+Firestone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Shulamith%20Firestone&amp;f=false Shulamith Firestone 1945–], ''The Routledge dictionary of twentieth-century political thinkers'' (2nd Edition), Routledge, 1998, pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|0-415-09623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[David Reimer]], who was, according to studies published by [[John Money]], raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, was described in the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl''. Reimer was in fact not comfortable as a girl and later changed gender identity back to male when discovered the truth of his surgery. He eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosario, Vernon. 2009.

=== History ===
Gender in the sense of social and behavioral distinctions, according to archaeological evidence, arose "at least by some 30,000 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., Olga Soffer, &amp; Jake Page, ''The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory'' (Smithsonian Books &amp; Collins (HarperCollinsPublishers), 1st Smithsonian Books ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-06-117091-1}})), p. [277].&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence was found as of  "26,000 years ago",&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. 170 &amp; see pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the archeological site [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Dolní Věstonice I]] and others, in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adovasio, J. M., ''et al.'', ''The Invisible Sex'', ''op. cit.'', p. [169].&lt;/ref&gt; This is during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, power and privilege in modern Europe|author1=Richard, penny  |author2=Jessica Munna |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Pearson/ Longman|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic meaning of ''gender'', ultimately derived from Latin ''genus'', was of "kind" or "variety". By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of ''gender'' [[Grammatical gender|was in grammar]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook ''Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl'', was embraced by [[feminist theory]]. This meaning of ''gender'' is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name=haig /&gt; Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mikkola|first=Mari|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Jemima Repo has in her doctoral thesis ''The biopolitics of gender'' (2011) criticized the use of the term gender among feminists, because it has been used to justify [[biopolitics|biopolitical]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-biopolitics-of-gender-9780190256913?cc=fi&amp;lang=en&amp; |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090149/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-biopolitics-of-gender-9780190256913?cc=fi&amp;lang=en&amp; |archivedate=2018-05-08 |df= }} (accessed 2016-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/28267 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215957/https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/28267 |archivedate=2016-11-03 |df= }} (accessed 2016-11-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction in linguistics ==

Since the social sciences now distinguish between biologically defined ''sex'' and socially constructed ''gender'', the term ''gender'' is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between ''sex'' and ''gender'', where ''sex'' refers primarily to the attributes of  real-world entities – the relevant extralinguistic attributes being, for instance,  male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex – and [[grammatical gender]] refers to a category, such as  masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=484–486|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fowler|first1= Henry Watson | editor1-link=Jeremy Butterfield|editor1-last=Butterfield|editor1-first=Jeremy|edition=4th|date=2015|title=[[Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language]]'', for instance, states {{Quote|text=By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to the sex of the referent.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"&gt;{{Cite book|pages=314–316|last1=Quirk|first1=Randolph|authorlink1=Randolph Quirk|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Sidney

Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are ''generally''  referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus ''Mann'' (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give ''der Mann'', while ''Frau'' (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give ''die Frau''. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. ''der Tisch'', the table) or feminine (''die Armbanduhr'', the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun ''[die] Person'' refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun ''[das] Mädchen'' means "the girl".

In modern English, there is no true grammatical gender in this sense,&lt;ref name="Huddleston on grammatical gender"/&gt; though the differentiation, for instance, between the pronouns "he" and "she", which in English refers to a difference in sex (or social gender), is sometimes referred to as a gender distinction. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', for instance, refers to the semantically based "covert" gender (e.g. male and female, not masculine and feminine) of English nouns, as opposed to the "overt" gender of some English pronouns; this yields ''nine'' gender classes: male, female, dual, common, collective, higher male animal, higher female animal, lower animal, and inanimate, and these semantic gender classes affect the possible choices of pronoun for coreference to the real-life entity, e.g. ''who'' and ''he'' for ''brother'' but ''which'' and ''it'' or ''she'' for ''cow''.&lt;ref name="Quirk on grammatical gender"/&gt;

==West and Zimmerman's "Doing gender"==
{{Main|Doing gender}}
Used primarily in sociology and gender studies, "''[[doing gender]]"'' is the socially constructed performance which takes place during routine human interactions, rather than as a set of essentialized qualities based on one's biological sex.&lt;ref name=west1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225165833/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf |date=2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in Candace West and Don Zimmerman’s article “Doing Gender”, published in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Gender &amp; Society|Gender and Society]]''.&lt;ref name=jurik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jurik | first1 = Nancy C. | last2 = Siemsen | first2 =  Cynthia | title = Doing gender as canon or agenda: A symposium on West and Zimmerman | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 72&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326677 | jstor = 20676750 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326677 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987,&lt;ref name=wz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Accounting for doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243208326529 | jstor = 20676758 | date = February 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243208326529 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doing Gender'' is the most cited article published in ''Gender and Society''.&lt;ref name=jurik/&gt;

West and Zimmerman state that to understand gender as activity, it is important to differentiate between sex, sex category, and gender.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} They say that sex refers to the socially agreed upon specifications that establish one as male or female; sex is most often based on an individual's genitalia, or even their chromosomal typing before birth.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They consider sex categories to be dichotomous, and that the person is placed in a sex category by exhibiting qualities exclusive to one category or the other. During most interactions, others situate a person's sex by identifying their sex category; however, they believe that a person's sex need not align with their sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; West and Zimmerman maintain that the sex category is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one’s membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}} Gender is the performance of attitudes and actions that are considered socially acceptable for one's sex category.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;{{rp|127}}

West and Zimmerman suggested that the interactional process of ''doing gender'', combined with socially agreed upon gender expectations, holds individuals accountable for their gender performances.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; They also believe that while "doing gender" appropriately strengthens and promotes social structures based on the gender dichotomy, it inappropriately does not call into question these same social structures; only the individual actor is questioned.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt; The concept of "doing gender" recognizes that gender both structures human interactions and is created through them.&lt;ref name=west1/&gt;

== Criticism of the "sex difference" versus "gender difference" distinction ==

The current distinction between the terms ''sex difference'' versus ''gender difference'' has been criticized as misleading and counterproductive. These terms suggest that the behavior ''of an individual'' can be partitioned into separate biological and cultural factors. (However, behavioral differences between individuals can be statistically partitioned, as studied by [[behavioral genetics]].) Instead, all behaviors are phenotypes—a complex interweaving of both nature and nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D., &amp;  Kaufer, D. (2011).  [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31233/title/Beyond-Nature-vs--Nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104094323/http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view%2FarticleNo%2F31233%2Ftitle%2FBeyond-Nature-vs--Nurture%2F |date=2014-01-04 }}.  The Scientist.  October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane F. Halpern|Diane Halpern]], in her book ''[[Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities]],'' argued problems with ''sex'' vs. ''gender'' terminology:  "I cannot argue (in this book) that nature and nurture are inseparable and then... use different terms to refer to each class of variables.  The  ...biological manifestations of sex are confounded with psychosocial variables.... The use of different terms to label these two types of contributions to human existence seemed inappropriate in light of the biopsychosocial position I have taken."  She quotes [[Steven Pinker]]'s summary of the problems with the terms sex and gender: "Part of it is a new prissiness -- many people today are as squeamish about sexual dimorphism as the Victorians were about sex. But part of it is a limitation of the English language. The word 'sex' refers ambiguously to copulation and to sexual dimorphism..."&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D. (2012). Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities (4th Ed.). NY: Psychology Press. p. 35 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lippa writes in ''Gender, Nature and Nurture'' that "Some researchers have argued that the word ''sex'' should be used to refer to (biological differences), whereas the word ''gender'' should be used to refer to (cultural differences). However, it is not at all clear the degree to which the differences between males and females are due to biological factors versus learned and cultural factors. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of the word ''gender'' tends to obscure the distinction between two different topics: (a) differences between males and females, and (b) individual differences in maleness and femaleness that occur within each sex."&lt;ref&gt;Lippa, R. (2005). Gender, Nature and Nurture. NJ: LEA, p 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that more useful distinctions to make would be whether a behavioral difference between the sexes is first due to an evolved [[adaptation]], then, if so, whether the adaptation is sexually dimorphic (different) or sexually monomorphic (the same in both sexes). The term ''sex difference'' could then be re-defined as between-sex differences that are manifestations of a sexually dimorphic adaptation (which is how many scientists use the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|title=Standards of evidence for designed sex differences|author=|date=|website=ucsb.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2009)%20Standards%20of%20evidence%20for%20designed%20sex%20differences.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourke CH |author2=Harrell CS |author3=Neigh GN |title=Stress-induced sex differences: adaptations mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22426413 |pmc=3384757 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term ''gender difference'' could be re-defined as due to differential socialization between the sexes of a monomorphic adaptation or byproduct. For example, greater male propensity toward physical aggression and risk taking would be termed a "sex difference;" the generally longer head hair length of females would be termed a "gender difference."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M.E.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminism}}
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

===General===
Many feminists consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For example, Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, states that "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the sex/gender distinction, also known as the Standard Model of Sex/Gender, is criticized by feminists who believe that there is undue emphasis placed on sex being a biological aspect, something that is fixed, natural, unchanging, and consisting of a male/female dichotomy. They believe the distinction fails to recognize anything outside the strictly male/female dichotomy and that it creates a barrier between those that fit as 'usual' and those that are 'unusual'. In order to prove that sex is not only limited to two categories [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s ''Sexing the Body'' addresses the birth of children who are intersex. In this case, the standard model (sex/gender distinction) is seen as incorrect with regard to its notion that there are only two sexes, male and female. This is because "complete maleness and complete femaleness represent the extreme ends of a spectrum of possible body types."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne "Of Gender and Genitals" from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, [Chapter 3, pp. 44-77].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Fausto-Sterling argues that there are multitudes of sexes in between the two extremes of male and female.

Rather than viewing sex as a biological construct, there are feminists who accept both sex and gender as a social construct. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex."&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993-2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519013103/http://www.isna.org/ |archivedate=2016-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling believes that sex is socially constructed because nature does not decide on who is seen as a male or female physically. Rather, doctors decide what seems to be a "natural" sex for the inhabitants of society. In addition, the gender, behavior, actions, and appearance of males/females is also seen as socially constructed because codes of femininity and masculinity are chosen and deemed fit by society for societal usage.

=== Limitations ===

Some feminists go further and argue that neither sex nor gender are strictly binary concepts. [[Judith Lorber]], for instance, has stated that many conventional indicators of sex are not sufficient to demarcate male from female. For example, not all women lactate, while some men do.&lt;ref name="lorber"&gt;Lorber, Judith (1993). [http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124221303/http://www.unm.edu/~edickins/Lorber_Seeing_is_Believing.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }}. Retrieved on 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Suzanne Kessler, in a 1990 survey of medical specialists in pediatric intersexuality, found out that when a child was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia, its sex was often determined according to the size of its penis.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Suzanne (1990). "The Medical Construction of Gender: Case Management of Intersexed Infants". ''Signs'', Vol. 16, No. 1: 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the sex/gender distinction holds, Lorber and Kessler suggest that the dichotomies of female/male and masculine/feminine are not themselves exhaustive. Lorber writes, "My perspective goes beyond accepted feminist views that gender is a cultural overlay that modifies physiological sex differences [...] I am arguing that bodies differ in many ways physiologically, but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are 'female' and 'male' and 'women' and 'men.'"&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt;

Moreover, Lorber has alleged that there exists more diversity within the individual categories of sex and gender—female/male and feminine/masculine, respectively—than between them.&lt;ref name="lorber" /&gt; Hence, her fundamental claim is that both sex and gender are social constructions, rather than [[natural kind]]s.

A comparable view has been advanced by Linda Zerilli, who writes regarding [[Monique Wittig]], that she is "critical of the sex/gender dichotomy in much feminist theory because such a dichotomy leaves unquestioned the belief that there is a 'core of nature which resists examination, a relationship excluded from the social in the analysis—a relationship whose characteristic is ineluctability in culture, as well as in nature, and which is the heterosexual relationship.'"&lt;ref&gt;Zerilli, Linda M. G., ''The Trojan Horse of Universalism: Language As a 'War Machine' in the Writings of Monique Wittig'', in Robbins, Bruce, ed., ''The Phantom Public Sphere'' (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-8166-2124-1}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154 (n.&amp;nbsp;35 (citing Wittig, Monique, ''The Straight Mind'', in ''Feminist Issues'', vol. 1, no. 1, Summer, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;107) omitted) (author asst. prof., poli. sci. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; ed. teaches, Eng. dep't, Rutgers Univ., &amp; coeditor, ''Social Text'') (em-dash surrounded by half-spaces in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler also criticizes the sex/gender distinction. Discussing sex as biological fact causes sex to appear natural and politically neutral. However, she argues that "the ostensibly natural facts of sex [are] discursively produced in the service of other political and social interests." Butler concludes, "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=9–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government in Andhra Pradesh is working to increase the number of English medium schools state schools, with some proposals calling for English to be the only medium of instruction in state schools, claiming that this policy reflects the growing desire of parents and that the state sector is losing pupils due to its inability to meet the increased demand for English medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/010517/english-medium-must-in-state-schools-says-andhra-pradesh.html|title=English medium must in state schools, says Andhra Pradesh government|date=2017-05-01|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Andhra-Pradesh/2017-09-27/AP-mulls-over-English-medium-in-government-schools-/329362|title=AP mulls over English medium in government schools|website=The Hans India|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Telangana, the government has issued plans to mandate English-medium education in all the private schools in the state.

Many educated Telugu people began travelling around the world in search of knowledge-based jobs, and have observed that many countries are prospering faster than India by imparting education in their native languages without depending on English.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Throughout India, native-language advocates are demanding less reliance on English.

==Telugu promotion==
In 2012 the Andhra Pradesh official-language commission resumed its activities, and was tasked with organizing the fourth [[World Telugu Conference]] (WTC) after a 22-year hiatus. The conference was a success, with 5,000 Telugu delegates from all over the world meeting in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newswala.com/Hyderabad-News/PM-Manmohan-Singh-lauds-Telugu-people-26582.html|title= PM Manmohan Singh lauds Telugu people|date=29 December 2012|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19408">The '''unmoved mover''' ({{lang-grc|ὃ οὐ κινούμενον κινεῖ|ho ou kinoúmenon kineî|that which moves without being moved}})&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1072a.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''prime mover''' ({{lang-la|primum movens}}) is a concept advanced by [[Aristotle]] as a primary [[Causality (physics)|cause]] (or '''first uncaused cause''')&lt;ref&gt;Kai Nielsen, ''Reason and Practice: A Modern Introduction to Philosophy'', Harper &amp; Row, 1971, pp. 170–2.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Motion (physics)|mover]]" of all the motion in the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-natphil/#5|title=Aristotle's Natural Philosophy: Movers and Unmoved Mover|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is implicit in the name, the "unmoved mover" moves other things, but is not itself moved by any prior action. In Book 12 ({{lang-grc-gre|Λ}}) of his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle describes the unmoved mover as being perfectly beautiful, indivisible, and contemplating only the perfect [[contemplation]]: itself contemplating. He equates this concept also with the [[active intellect]]. This Aristotelian concept had its roots in [[cosmology|cosmological]] speculations of the earliest Greek [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s and became highly influential and widely drawn upon in [[medieval philosophy]] and [[theology]]. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], for example, elaborated on the unmoved mover in the {{lang|la|[[Quinque viae]]}}.

== First philosophy ==
Aristotle argues, in Book 8 of the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and Book 12 of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', "that there must be an immortal, unchanging being, ultimately responsible for all wholeness and orderliness in the sensible world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Sachs |title=Aristotle: Metaphysics|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-met/#H9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Physics'' (VIII 4–6) Aristotle finds "surprising difficulties" explaining even commonplace change, and in support of his approach of explanation by [[four causes]], he required "a fair bit of technical machinery".&lt;ref name="Shields2007-187"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-28331-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;pg=PA187 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "machinery" includes [[potentiality and actuality]], [[hylomorphism]], the theory of categories, and "an audacious and intriguing argument, that the bare existence of change requires the postulation of a '''first cause''', an unmoved mover whose necessary existence underpins the ceaseless activity of the world of motion".&lt;ref name="Shields2007-196-226"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;pg=PA196 |pages=196, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's "first philosophy", or [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] ("''after'' the [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]"), develops his peculiar theology of the prime mover, as {{lang|grc|πρῶτον κινοῦν ἀκίνητον}}: an independent divine eternal unchanging immaterial substance.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-109"/&gt;

===Celestial spheres===
Aristotle adopted the geometrical model of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], to provide a general explanation of the apparent wandering of the [[classical planets]] arising from uniform circular motions of [[celestial spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last=Mendell |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Eudoxus/Astronomy/EudoxusHomocentricSpheres.htm |title=Eudoxus of Cnidus: Astronomy and Homocentric Spheres |series=Vignettes of Ancient Mathematics |date=16 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516145329/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Eudoxus/Astronomy/EudoxusHomocentricSpheres.htm |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of spheres in the model itself was subject to change (47 or 55), Aristotle's account of [[aether (classical element)|aether]], and of [[potentiality and actuality]], required an individual unmoved mover for each sphere.&lt;ref name="sep-aristotle-natphil"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bodnar |first=Istvan |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-natphil/notes.html#31 |title=Aristotle's Natural Philosophy|editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Spring 2010 |year=2010 |quote=In Metaphysics 12.8, Aristotle opts for both the uniqueness and the plurality of the unmoved celestial movers. Each celestial sphere possesses the unmoved mover of its own—presumably as the object of its striving, see Metaphysics 12.6—whereas the mover of the outermost celestial sphere, which carries with its diurnal rotation the fixed stars, being the first of the series of unmoved movers also guarantees the unity and uniqueness of the universe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final cause and efficient cause===
{{quotation|Simplicius argues that the first unmoved mover is a cause not only in the sense of being a final cause—which everyone in his day, as in ours, would accept—but also in the sense of being an efficient cause (1360. 24ff.), and his master Ammonius wrote a whole book defending the thesis (ibid. 1363. 8–10). Simplicius's arguments include citations of Plato's views in the ''Timaeus''—evidence not relevant to the debate unless one happens to believe in the essential harmony of Plato and Aristotle—and inferences from approving remarks which Aristotle makes about the role of ''Nous'' in Anaxagoras, which require a good deal of reading between the lines. But he does point out rightly that the unmoved mover fits the definition of an efficient cause—"whence the first source of change or rest" (''Phys''. II. 3, 194b29–30; Simpl. 1361. 12ff.). The examples which Aristotle adduces do not obviously suggest an application to the first unmoved mover, and it is at least possible that Aristotle originated his fourfold distinction without reference to such an entity. But the real question is whether, given his definition of the efficient cause, it includes the unmoved mover willy-nilly. One curious fact remains: that Aristotle never acknowledges the alleged fact that the unmoved mover is an efficient cause (a problem of which Simplicius is well aware: 1363. 12–14)...&lt;ref name="Graham1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

===Aristotle's theology===
The unmoved movers, if they were anywhere, were said to fill the outer void, beyond the sphere of fixed stars:
{{quotation|It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified, living the best and most self sufficient of lives… From [the fulfilment of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.1.i.html#802 |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive |title=''De Caelo'' |trans-title=On the Heavens |volume=I |author=Aristotle (J. L. Stocks trans.) |date=7 January 2009 |at=I.9, 279 a17–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''De Caelo''|I.9, 279 a17–30}}
 
The unmoved movers are, themselves, immaterial substance, (separate and individual beings), having neither parts nor magnitude. As such, it would be physically impossible for them to move material objects of any size by pushing, pulling or collision. Because matter is, for Aristotle, a substratum in which a potential to change can be actualized, any and all potentiality must be actualized in a being that is eternal but it must not be still, because continuous activity is essential for all forms of life. This immaterial form of activity must be intellectual in nature and it cannot be contingent upon sensory perception if it is to remain uniform; therefore eternal substance must think only of thinking itself and exist outside the starry sphere, where even the notion of place is undefined for Aristotle. Their influence on lesser beings is purely the result of an "aspiration or desire",&lt;ref&gt;"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p. 233ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and each aetheric celestial sphere emulates one of the unmoved movers, as best it can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The first heaven, the outmost sphere of fixed stars, is moved by a desire to emulate the prime mover (first cause),&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII 6, 258 b26-259 a9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Now understood as the [[Earth's rotation]].&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to whom, the subordinate movers suffer an accidental dependency.

Many of Aristotle's contemporaries complained that oblivious, powerless gods are unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-109"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first1=Sir David |last1=Ross |first2=John Lloyd |last2=Ackrill |edition=6th ed., revised |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32857-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;pg=PA190 |pages=188, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it was a life which Aristotle enthusiastically endorsed as one most enviable and perfect, the unembellished basis of theology. As the whole of nature depends on the inspiration of the eternal unmoved movers, Aristotle was concerned to establish the metaphysical necessity of the perpetual motions of the heavens. It is through the seasonal action of the Sun upon the terrestrial spheres, that the cycles of generation and corruption give rise to all ''natural'' motion as efficient cause.&lt;ref name="Shields2007-121"/&gt; The intellect, ''[[nous]]'', "or whatever else it be that is thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine" is the highest activity, according to Aristotle (contemplation or speculative thinking, ''theōrētikē''). It is also the most sustainable, pleasant, self-sufficient activity;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1177a.20 Nicomachean Ethics]'' X 1177 a20&lt;/ref&gt; something which is aimed at for its own sake. (In contrast to politics and warfare, it does not involve doing things we'd rather not do, but rather something we do at our leisure.) This aim is not strictly human, to achieve it means to live in accordance not with mortal thoughts, but something immortal and divine which is within humans. According to Aristotle, contemplation is the only type of happy activity which it would not be ridiculous to imagine the gods having. In Aristotle's psychology and biology, the intellect is the [[soul]], (see also ''[[eudaimonia]]'').

===First cause===
In book VIII of his ''Physics,''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle examines the notions of change or motion, and attempts to show by a challenging argument, that the mere supposition of a 'before' and an 'after', requires a ''first principle''. He argues that in the beginning, if the cosmos had come to be, its first motion would lack an antecedent state, and as [[Parmenides]] said, "[[nothing comes from nothing]]". The [[cosmological argument]], later attributed to Aristotle, thereby draws the conclusion that God exists. However, if the cosmos had a beginning, Aristotle argued, it would require an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause, a notion that Aristotle took to demonstrate a critical flaw.&lt;ref name="Brentano1978"&gt;{{cite book |first=F.C. |last=Brentano |first2=R. |last2=George |first3=R.M. |last3=Chisholm |year=1978 |title=Aristotle and His World View |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520033900 |lccn=lc76050245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frwLUNC_3soC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Caelo'' Book I Chapter 10 280a6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' Book VIII 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;But it is a wrong assumption to suppose universally that we have an adequate first principle in virtue of the fact that something always is so … Thus [[Democritus]] reduces the causes that explain nature to the fact that things happened in the past in the same way as they happen now: but he does not think fit to seek for a first principle to explain this 'always' … Let this conclude what we have to say in support of our contention that there never was a time when there was not motion, and never will be a time when there will not be motion.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of Aristotle's [[cosmological argument]], that at least one eternal unmoved mover must exist, is to support everyday change.&lt;ref name="Shields2007-222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first=Christopher John |last=Shields |edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-28331-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOqiNUj9n-sC&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;pg=PA222 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of things that exist, substances are the first. But if substances can, then all things can perish... and yet, time and change cannot. Now, the only continuous change is that of place, and the only continuous change of place is circular motion. Therefore, there must be an eternal circular motion and this confirmed by the fixed stars which are moved by the eternal actual substance substance that's purely actual.&lt;ref name="RossAckrill2004-186"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aristotle |first1=Sir David |last1=Ross |first2=John Lloyd |last2=Ackrill |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Aristotle's estimation, an explanation without the temporal [[actuality and potentiality]] of an infinite locomotive chain is required for an eternal cosmos with neither beginning nor end: an unmoved eternal substance for whom the [[Primum Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;The outermost celestial sphere, for Aristotle, the [[sphere of fixed stars]].&lt;/ref&gt; turns diurnally and whereby all terrestrial cycles are driven: day and night, the seasons of the year, the transformation of the elements, and the nature of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="sep-aristotle-natphil" /&gt;

== Substance and change ==

Aristotle begins by describing substance, of which he says there are three types: the sensible, which is subdivided into the perishable, which belongs to physics, and the eternal, which belongs to "another science". He notes that sensible substance is changeable and that there are several types of change, including quality and quantity, generation and destruction, increase and diminution, alteration, and motion. Change occurs when one given state becomes something contrary to it: that is to say, what exists potentially comes to exist actually. (See [[Potentiality and actuality]].) Therefore, "a thing [can come to be], incidentally, out of that which is not, [and] also all things come to be out of that which is, but is [[potential]]ly, and is not actually." That by which something is changed is the mover, that which is changed is the matter, and that into which it is changed is the form.

Substance is necessarily composed of different elements. The proof for this is that there are things which are different from each other and that all things are composed of elements. Since elements combine to form composite substances, and because these substances differ from each other, there must be different elements: in other words, "b or a cannot be the same as ba".

== Number of movers ==

Near the end of ''Metaphysics'', Book {{lang|grc|Λ}}, Aristotle introduces a surprising question, asking "whether we have to suppose one such [mover] or more than one, and if the latter, how many".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' 1073a14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle concludes that the number of all the movers equals the number of separate movements, and we can determine these by considering the mathematical science most akin to philosophy, i.e., astronomy.  Although the mathematicians differ on the number of movements, Aristotle considers that the number of [[celestial spheres]] would be 47 or 55.  Nonetheless, he concludes his ''Metaphysics'', Book {{lang|grc|Λ}}, with a quotation from the ''[[Iliad]]'': "The rule of many is not good; one ruler let there be."&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad,'' ii, 204; quoted in Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' 1076a5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry A. Wolfson, "The Plurality of Immovable Movers in Aristotle and Averroës," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', 63 (1958): 233–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whataboutism''' (also known as '''whataboutery''') is a variant of the ''[[tu quoque]]'' [[logical fallacy]] that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with [[hypocrisy]] without directly refuting or disproving their argument,&lt;ref name=OLD /&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmer-def&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=22 July 2017 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-roots-of-the-what-about-ploy-1497019827 |first=Ben |last=Zimmer |author-link=Ben Zimmer |title=The Roots of the 'What About?'

''[[The Guardian]]'' deemed whataboutism, as used in Russia, "practically a national ideology".&lt;ref name=lukeharding /&gt; Journalist [[Julia Ioffe]] wrote that "Anyone who has ever studied the Soviet Union" was aware of the technique, citing the Soviet rejoinder to criticism, ''[[And you are lynching Negroes]]'', as a "classic" example of the tactic.&lt;ref name=juliaioffe /&gt; Writing for ''[[Bloomberg News]]'',
[[Leonid Bershidsky]] called whataboutism a "Russian tradition",&lt;ref name=leonid /&gt; while ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described the technique as "a strategy of false moral equivalences".&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; [[Jill Dougherty]] called whataboutism a "sacred Russian tactic",&lt;ref name=robertmackey /&gt;&lt;ref name=doughertyferguson /&gt; and compared it to ''[[the pot calling the kettle black]]''.&lt;ref name=doughertykettle /&gt;

==Etymology and history of the term==
The term ''Whataboutism'' stems from the conjunction of the two words ''what + about'' to twist criticism back on the critic himself.&lt;ref name=Econ080131 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EV081211 /&gt;&lt;ref name=powermoney /&gt;

According to Russian journalist Konstantin von Eggert, the term originated in the 1960s as an ironic description of "the Soviet Union's efforts at countering Western criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=von Eggert|first1=Konstantin|title=Due West: 'Whataboutism' Is Back – and Thriving|url=https://sputniknews.com/analysis/20120725174777687/|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=Sputnik International|date=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary dates the term back to the Cold War.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whataboutism-origin-meaning|title=What About 'Whataboutism?'|publisher=Merriam Webster|quote=The association of whataboutism with the Soviet Union began during the Cold War.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It references journalist Michael Bernard from ''[[The Age]]'', who in 1978 wrote "the weaknesses of whataboutism—which dictates that no one must get away with an attack on the Kremlin's abuses without tossing a few bricks at South Africa, no one must indict the Cuban police State without castigating President Park, no one must mention Irak, Libya or the PLO without having a bash at Israel".&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

Also called ''whataboutery''}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]], the term ''whataboutism'' appeared "as early as 1993".&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt; In contrast, [[Andreas Umland]], a political scientist and historian of Russia and Ukraine, said the term was used during the Soviet Union period, writing: "what was known during Soviet times, as 'whataboutism{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=umland /&gt; Neil Buckley wrote for ''[[Financial Times]]'', "Soviet-watchers called it 'whataboutism'. This was the Communist-era tactic of deflecting foreign criticism of, say, human rights abuses, by pointing, often disingenuously, at something allegedly similar in the critic's own country: 'Ah, but what about…?{{'"}}&lt;ref name=buckley /&gt;

According to ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', in British English ''whataboutism'' is synonymous with ''whataboutery'',&lt;ref name=ODE/&gt; which according to Zimmer has been used with a similar meaning since the period of [[The Troubles]] conflict in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt; In 1974, a letter published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' referred to "the Whatabouts ... who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the 'enemy{{'"}} and an opinion column in the same paper picked up the theme using the term "whataboutery", which gained wide currency in commentary about the conflict.&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt; Zimmer noted that the variant ''whataboutism'' was used in the same context in a 1993 book by [[Tony Parker (author)|Tony Parker]].&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt;

British journalist [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] used the word ''whataboutism'' in a blog post of 29 October 2007,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardlucas.com/2007/10/29/diary-day-one/|title=In Russia's shadow – The Kremlin's useful idiots|last=Lucas|first=Edward|date=29 October 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 July 2017|quote=It is not a bad tactic.

The philosopher Merold Westphal said that only people who know themselves to be guilty of something "can find comfort in finding others to be just as bad or worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westphal|first1=Merold|title=God, Guilt, and Death: An Existential Phenomenology of Religion|date=1987|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind|isbn=0-253-20417-8|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whataboutery, as practiced by both parties in [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland to highlight what the other side had done to them, was "one of the commonest forms of evasion of personal moral responsibility," according to Bishop (later Cardinal) [[Cahal Daly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/roddy_evans/evans_02_breath.pdf#page=49|author=The Right Reverend John Austin Baker|date=January 1982|title=Ireland and Northern Ireland|journal=[[The Furrow]]|volume=33|issue=1|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[2017 Congressional baseball shooting|political shooting at a baseball game in 2017]], journalist [[Chuck Todd]] criticized the tenor of political debate, commenting, "What-about-ism is among the worst instincts of partisans on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|access-date=5 July 2017|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-todd-gop-congressmen-shooting_us_5941e58ae4b0d3185486f3a6|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=14 June 2017|title=MSNBC's Chuck Todd Calls Out Partisan 'Toxic Stew' After Shooter Targets Congressmen|first=Ed|last=Mazza}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|access-date=5 July 2017|first=Chuck|last=Todd|authorlink=Chuck Todd|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zQhH72bW_A|title=Chuck Todd: The Media Has 'A Role To Play' In Calling Out Caustic Rhetoric |work=[[Meet the Press]] |agency=[[MSNBC]]|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentionally discrediting oneself===
Whataboutism usually points the finger at a rival's offenses to discredit them, but, in a reversal of this usual direction, it can also be used to discredit oneself while one refuses to critique an ally. During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], when ''[[The New York Times]]'' asked candidate Donald Trump about Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s treatment of journalists, teachers, and dissidents, Trump replied with a criticism of U.S. history on civil liberties.&lt;ref name=catherineputz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Putz|first1=Catherine|title=Donald Trump's Whataboutism|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/donald-trumps-whataboutism/|accessdate=20 May 2017|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Diplomat]]'', Catherine Putz pointed out: "The core problem is that this rhetorical device precludes discussion of issues (ex: civil rights) by one country (ex: the United States) if that state lacks a perfect record."&lt;ref name=catherineputz /&gt; [[Masha Gessen]] wrote for ''The New York Times'' that usage of the tactic by Trump was shocking to Americans, commenting, "No American politician in living memory has advanced the idea that the entire world, including the United States, was rotten to the core."&lt;ref name=mashagessen&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Masha Gessen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/opinion/sunday/in-praise-of-hypocrisy.html|first=Masha|last=Gessen|access-date=5 July 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=In Praise of Hypocrisy|date=18 February 2017|quote=This stance has breathed new life into the old Soviet propaganda tool of 'whataboutism', the trick of turning any argument against the opponent.

This month, Mr. Trump employed the technique of whataboutism when he was asked about his admiration for Mr. Putin, whom the host Bill O'Reilly called 'a killer'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about effects===
Joe Austin was critical of the practice of whataboutism in Northern Ireland in a 1994 piece, ''The Obdurate and the Obstinate'', writing: "And I'd no time at all for 'What aboutism' ... if you got into it you were defending the indefensible."&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|first=Joe|last=Austin|chapter=The Obdurate and the Obstinate|editor1-first=Tony|editor1-last= Parker|editor1link=Tony Parker (author)|title=May the Lord in His Mercy be Kind to Belfast|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]]|isbn=978-0805030532|page=136|quote=And I'd no time at all for 'What aboutism' – you know, people who said 'Yes, but what about what's been done to us? ...

== Criticism ==
Some commentators have defended the usage of whataboutism and ''tu quoque'' in certain contexts. Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair. For instance, in international relations, behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be quite good for a given geopolitical neighborhood, and deserves to be recognized as such.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christian Christensen, Professor of Journalism in Stockholm, argues that the accusation of whataboutism is itself a form of ''tu quoque'' fallacy, as it dismisses criticisms of one's own behavior to focus instead on the actions of another, thus creating a double standard. Those who use whataboutism are not necessarily engaging in an empty or cynical deflection of responsibility: whataboutism can be a useful tool to expose contradictions, double standards, and hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/1/whataboutism-charlie-hebdo-king-abdullah.html|title=We need ‘whataboutism’ now more than ever|last=Christensen|first=Christian|date=January 26, 2015|website=Al-Jazeera English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/one-cheer-for-whataboutism.html|title=One Cheer for Whataboutism|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|date=July 19, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2018|quote=Tu quoque is a subset of the so-called ad hominem argument: a strike against the character, not the position, of one’s opponent. Ad hominem gets a bad press, but it isn’t without merit, when used in good faith. It’s useful in an argument to show that the stance being taken against you is inconsistent or hypocritical. It doesn’t win the day, but it chips away at your opponent’s moral standing and raises doubt about the entirety of his or her position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized the usage of accusations of whataboutism by American news outlets, arguing that the accusation whataboutism has been used to simply deflect any and all criticism of human rights abuses perpetrated by the United States or its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.1news.az/news/ritorika-holodnoy-voyny-na-fone-narusheniya-prav-cheloveka-v-ssha|title=Риторика холодной войны на фоне нарушения прав человека в США|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2014|work=1News Azerbaijan|access-date=August 16, 2018|language=Russian|trans-title=Cold War rhetoric against a backdrop of human rights violations in the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the usage of the term almost exclusively by American outlets is a double standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/03/06/saudi-arabia-russia-the-magnitsky-act-and-whataboutism/|title=Saudi Arabia, Russia, The Magnitsky Act, And 'Whataboutism'|last=Mark|first=Adomanis|date=March 6, 2013|work=Forbes|access-date=16 August 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829051034/https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/03/06/saudi-arabia-russia-the-magnitsky-act-and-whataboutism/|archivedate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that moral accusations made by powerful countries are merely a pretext to punish their geopolitical rivals in the face of their own wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1news.az/news/ritorika-holodnoy-voyny-na-fone-narusheniya-prav-cheloveka-v-ssha|title=Риторика холодной войны на фоне нарушения прав человека в США|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2014|website=1 News Azerbaijan|language=Russian|trans-title=Cold War rhetoric against a backdrop of human rights abuses in the USA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 16, 2018|quote=«Права человека – это дубинка в руках сильных мира сего, которую они используют, когда кто-то вокруг проявляет непослушание», - убежден азербайджанский политический деятель Араз Ализаде, возглавляющий Социал-демократическую партию Азербайджана.

The scholars [[Kristen R. Ghodsee]] and [[Scott Sehon]] posit that mentioning the possible existence of victims of capitalism in popular discourse is often dismissed as 'whataboutism', which they describe as "a term implying that only atrocities perpetrated by communists merit attention." They also argue that such accusations of 'whataboutism' are invalid as the same arguments used against communism can also be used against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aeon.co/essays/the-merits-of-taking-an-anti-anti-communism-stance|title=Anti-anti-communism|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|last2= Sehon|first2=Scott|date= March 22, 2018|website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|publisher= |access-date=October 1, 2018|quote="But the problem for the anti-communists is that their general premise can be used as the basis for an equally good argument against capitalism, an argument that the so-called losers of economic transition in eastern Europe would be quick to affirm. The US, a country based on a free-market capitalist ideology, has done many horrible things: the enslavement of millions of Africans, the genocidal eradication of the Native Americans, the brutal military actions taken to support pro-Western dictatorships, just to name a few. The British Empire likewise had a great deal of blood on its hands: we might merely mention the internment camps during the second Boer War and the Bengal famine. This is not mere ‘whataboutism’, because the same intermediate premise necessary to make their anti-communist argument now works against capitalism: Historical point: the US and the UK were based on a capitalist ideology, and did many horrible things. General premise: if any country based on a particular ideology did many horrible things, then that ideology should be rejected. Political conclusion: capitalism should be rejected."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's International League for Peace and Freedom''' ('''WILPF''') is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization]] working "to bring together women of different political views and philosophical and religious backgrounds determined to study and make known the causes of [[war]] and work for a [[perpetual peace|permanent peace]]" and to unite women worldwide who oppose [[oppression]] and [[Sexism|exploitation]]. WILPF has national sections in 37 countries.

The WILPF is headquartered in [[Geneva]] and maintains a [[United Nations]] office in [[New York City]].

==Organizational history==
WILPF developed out of [[Women at the Hague|the International Women's Congress]] against [[World War I]] that took place in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1915;&lt;ref name=1915Hague&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36546779/The_Women_Who_Tried_to_Stop_the_Great_War_The_International_Congress_of_Women_at_The_Hague_1915 The Women Who Tried to Stop the Great War: The International Congress of Women at The Hague 1915], In A.

Furthermore, Women’s international league for peace and freedom opposed to wars and international conflicts. Since it is an undeniable fact that wars will violate individual’s peace and freedom, the league organised and took formal actions to end the war. The major movements of the league are open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, International day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and statement on weapons, [[gender-based violence]] and women [[human rights defender]]s. As the league is consisted of women, concentrated professionals are allowed to improve the current issues related to women and people. 

===Woman's Peace Party (USA)===
{{Main article|Woman's Peace Party}}
A forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in [[Washington, D.C.]] at a meeting called by [[Jane Addams]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] to offer continuous [[mediation]] as a way of ending war.

WPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915.

===International Congress of Women, The Hague, 1915===
The [[Women at the Hague|1915 International Congress of Women]] was organized by the [[German people|German]] [[feminism|feminist]] [[Anita Augspurg]], Germany's first female [[jurist]], and [[Lida Gustava Heymann]] (1868–1943) at the invitation of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[pacifist]], feminist and [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] [[Aletta Jacobs]] to protest the [[World War I|war]] then raging in [[Europe]], and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Congress of Women opens at The Hague|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/international-congress-of-women-opens-at-the-hague|website=History.Doc|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wound up on May 1,&lt;ref name=1915Hague&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36546779/The_Women_Who_Tried_to_Stop_the_Great_War_The_International_Congress_of_Women_at_The_Hague_1915 The Women Who Tried to Stop the Great War: The International Congress of Women at The Hague 1915], In A. H. Campbell (Ed.), Global Leadership Initiatives for Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding (pp. 249-266). (Ch.12) Hershey, PA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and [[non-belligerent|belligerent]] [[nation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Veen|first1=Sietske|title=Hirschmann, Susanna Theodora Cornelia (1871-1957)|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|website=Huygens ING|publisher=Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830163944/http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Hirschmann|archivedate=30 August 2017|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an '''International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace''' (ICWPP) with [[Jane Addams]] as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP.

===Second International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, Zürich, 1919===
[[Jane Addams]] met with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in [[Zürich]] in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|peace treaty]] ending World War I as a scheme of [[revenge]] of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another [[world war]]. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the '''Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.'''&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; WILPF moved its headquarters to [[Geneva]] to be near the proposed site of the [[League of Nations]], although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food [[blockade]]s or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as "unpatriotic" during the [[First Red Scare]].&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt; The WILPF supported treaties such as the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt;

During the 1930s, [[Vera Brittain]] was the WILPF's Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Deane |title=History in our hands: a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s |location=London |publisher=Leicester University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7185-0143-3 |pages=63–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's [[Jews|Jewish]] community.&lt;ref name="writus" /&gt;

Although WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including [[Bart de Ligt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=de Ligt |title=The Intellectual Class and Modern Warfare |magazine=Reconciliation |date=July 1929 }} (Speech originally given at WIPLF conference in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. D. Bernal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brenda |last1=Swann |first2=Francis |last2=Aprahamian |title=J.D. Bernal: a life in science and politics |location=London |publisher=Verso |year=1999 |isbn=1-85984-854-0 |page=234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two WILPF leaders have received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: [[Jane Addams]], in 1931 and [[Emily Greene Balch]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/female-activists-hague-new-peace-agenda-1915-congress-of-women|title = Centenary Stand: Female Activists Head for The Hague to Set a New Peace Agenda|last = Ford|first = Liz|date = 27 April 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 8 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WILPF and the United Nations===
WILPF has had [[Consultative Status]] (category B) with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the [[democratization]] of the UN, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the [[privatisation]] and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council [[veto#United Nations|veto]].

==WILPF today==

WILPF envisions a world free of [[violence]], [[poverty]], [[pollution]] and dominance. WILPF stands for [[Social equality|equality]] of all people in a world free of [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]]; the building of a constructive peace through world [[arms control|disarmament]]; and the changing of government priorities to meet human needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilpfinternational.org/AboutUs/index.htm#aims]&lt;/ref&gt;

YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW).&lt;ref name=XPe/&gt;&lt;ref name=OOC/&gt; It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous [[refactoring]], continuous automated [[unit testing]], and [[continuous integration]]. Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework, known as [[technical debt]]. YAGNI's dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of [[Extreme programming|XP]].
