      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">'''Abortion in Guyana''' is legal during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, but it is illegal after eight weeks except in cases of endangering the maternal or fetal health. Throughout much of the 20th century, it was officially illegal but rarely were laws against abortion ever enforced. In 1995, legislation was passed which made abortion legal as long as it was done within the first 8 weeks of pregnancy and done with the consent of the pregnant woman and by a licensed medical practitioner.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/guyana.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 8 and 12 weeks from conception, abortion is only legal if the pending childbirth would result in health risks for the woman or the fetus, or if the pregnancy occurred despite the use of contraceptives. Between 12 and 16 weeks, an abortion can still be legally performed, but only if the health of the woman or fetus is in danger. After 16 weeks, it is only possible to perform an abortion in the case of severe health-related circumstances.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In 2006, the Guyanese government theoretically cleared the way for public hospitals to "perform abortions." In actuality, the public hospitals only complete abortions which have already been partially undertaken by pregnant women.&lt;ref name="propagandapress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://propagandapress.org/2008/01/02/abortions-available-at-public-hospitals-across-guyana/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203184722/http://propagandapress.org/2008/01/02/abortions-available-at-public-hospitals-across-guyana/ |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began doing so in 2008.

The Guyanese government continues to look for ways to lower the number of abortions in Guyana.&lt;ref name="propagandapress.org"/&gt;

'''Lake Achen''' ({{lang-de|Achensee}}) is a [[lake]] north of [[Jenbach]] in [[Tyrol, Austria]]. It is the largest lake within the federal state, and has a maximal depth of 133 metres. Together with the Achen Valley it parts the [[Karwendel]] mountain range in the west from the [[Brandenberg Alps]] in the east.

Water quality is near drinking water, with sight up to 10 m below the surface. An alpine lake, water temperature is accordingly low, rarely above 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Its size and wind conditions make it suitable for [[windsurfing]].

[[Eben am Achensee]], [[Achenkirch]], and [[Pertisau]] are municipalities on the lake.

==History==
The city of [[Innsbruck]] bought the lake in 1919 from the [[St. Georgenberg-Fiecht Abbey]], who had received it from the rulers of [[Schlitters]] around 1120.

==Powerplant==
Since 1924, the lake is managed by the [[TIWAG|Tiroler Wasserkraft AG (TIWAG)]], which was founded for this purpose.

Originally, its only outflow was the ''Achenbach'', feeding the [[Isar]]. Since 1927, when a power plant in [[Jenbach]] was finished, it primarily feeds the [[Inn (river)|Inn]], at a level difference of 380 m below. Eight [[pelton wheel]]s at 500 RPM produce a total of 96 MW.

In winter, the level of the lake is lowered by up to 6 meters; accordingly the size of the lake keeps changing. At maximum level, the reservoir can store 66 million m³ of water.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Achensee, steamship St. Joseph (1887).jpg|thumb|left|''St. Joseph'' (1887)]]
[[Image:Achensee, steamship St. Benedikt.jpg|thumb|left|''St. Benedikt'', about&amp;nbsp;1900]]

When the [[Unterinntalbahn]] railway was finished in 1859, tourism started to flourish. In order to make the abbey profit, the first [[steamboat]] ''St. Josef'' was acquired in 1887.&lt;ref name="Schiffe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Flotte der Achenseeschiffahrt |publisher=Tirol-Schiffahrt |url=http://www.tirol-schiffahrt.at/start.php?t=0&amp;m=2 |accessdate=2008-08-06 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221035922/http://www.tirol-schiffahrt.at/start.php?t=0&amp;m=2 |archivedate=2006-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore the construction of the 7&amp;nbsp;km long [[Achenseebahn]] [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[rack railway]] was initiated, which went into service in 1889 between [[Jenbach]] and ''Seespitz''. On 21 July that year a second steamboat, the ''St. Benedikt'', went into service. In 1890 the two boats with a capacity of 320 seats transported about 30,000 persons.

In 1911 a third scheduled boat, the ''Stella Maris'' went into service. It was the first passenger boat on a lake in the [[Austria-Hungary|Danubian monarchy]] originally equipped with a [[diesel engine]]. The boat was designed for 400 passengers, and featured a particularly silent engine at low rpm, similar to those that later were used in the submarines of World War I.

However, the ''Stella Maris'' was difficult to manoeuvre. When the lake was bought by the city of Innsbruck in 1919, the boat was renamed into ''Stadt Innsbruck''. In 1925 a motorboat named ''Tirol'' was acquired, and in 1927 for the first time more than 100,000 persons were transported.

In 1959 the ''St. Benedikt'' was replaced with a modern ship of the same name with a diesel engine. In 1971 the ''Tirol'' was replaced with a larger ''Tirol II'' for 40 passengers. In 1994 the ''MS Tirol'' went into service, replacing the ''Stadt Innsbruck'', and in August 2007 the ''MS Stadt Innsbruck''&lt;ref name="Schiffe" /&gt; replaced the ''St. Benedikt''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19628">The '''agricultural value chain''' concept has been used since the beginning of the millennium, primarily by those working in agricultural development in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Although there is no universally accepted definition of the term, it normally refers to the whole range of goods and services necessary for an agricultural product to move from the farm to the final customer or consumer.

==Background==

[[Image:Typical-value-Chain.png|thumb|340px|right|Value chain representation]]

The term [[value chain]] was first popularized in a book published in 1985 by [[Michael Porter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Michael E.|title=Competitive advantage: creating and sustaining superior performance; with a new introduction|year=1998|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0684841465|edition=1st Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who used it to illustrate how companies could achieve what he called “competitive advantage” by adding value within their organization. Subsequently, the term was adopted for agricultural development purposes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kaplinsky, R. |author2=Morris, M.|title=A Handbook for Value Chain Analysis|url=http://www.value-chains.org/dyn/bds/docs/395/Handbook%20for%20Value%20Chain%20Analysis.pdf|publisher=IDRC|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has now become very much in vogue among those working in this field, with an increasing number of bilateral and multilateral aid organisations using it to guide their development interventions.

At the heart of the agricultural value chain concept is the idea of actors connected along a chain producing and delivering goods to consumers through a sequence of activities.&lt;ref name="Riisgaard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Henriksen, L. |author2=L. Riisgaard |author3=S. Ponte |author4=F. Hartwich |author5=P. Kormawa|title=Agro-Food Value Chain Interventions in Asia: A review and analysis of case studies. Working Paper|url=   http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Publications/Pub_free/WorkingPaper_VC_AsiaFinal.pdf|publisher=UNIDO|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this “vertical” chain cannot function in isolation and an important aspect of the value chain approach is that it also considers “horizontal” impacts on the chain, such as input and finance provision, extension support and the general enabling environment. The approach has been found useful, particularly by donors, in that it has resulted in a consideration of all those factors impacting on the ability of farmers to access markets profitably, leading to a broader range of chain interventions. It is used both for upgrading existing chains and for donors to identify market opportunities for small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spore.cta.int/en/component/content/article?id=3173:2020  Editorial: Adding Value, by Michael Hailu, ‘’Spore’’ No 157]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

There is no commonly agreed definition of what is actually meant by agricultural value chains. Indeed, some agencies are using the term without having a workable definition or definitions and simply redefined ongoing activities as “value chain” work when the term came into vogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---ifp_seed/documents/publication/wcms_170848.pdf Andreas Stamm and Christian von Drachenfels “Value Chain Development: Approaches and activities by seven UN agencies and opportunities for interagency cooperation” ILO]&lt;/ref&gt; Published definitions include the [[World Bank]]’s “the term ‘’value chain’’ describes the full range of value adding activities required to bring a product or service through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Webber, C. M. |author2=P. Labaste|title=Building competitiveness in Africa’s agriculture: A guide to value chain concepts and applications.|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/Building_Competitiveness_in_Africa_Ag.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]]’s “actors connected along a chain producing, transforming and bringing goods and services to end-consumers through a sequenced set of activities”,&lt;ref name="Riisgaard, L and S. Ponte"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Riisgaard, L  |author2=S. Ponte|title=Pro-poor value chain development: 25 guiding questions for designing and implementing agroindustry projects.|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Services/Agro-Industries/Pro-poor_value_chain_development_2011.pdf|publisher=UNIDO|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture|CIAT]]’s “a strategic network among a number of business organizations”.&lt;ref name="Lundy, M., M. V. Gottret, C. Ostertag, R. Best, and S. Ferris"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lundy, M. |author2=M. V. Gottret |author3=C. Ostertag |author4=R. Best |author5=S. Ferris |title=Participatory market chain analysis for smallholder producers |url=http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/agroempresas/ingles/good_practice_guide_4.htm |publisher=CIAT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225234337/http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/agroempresas/ingles/good_practice_guide_4.htm |archivedate=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without a universal definition the term “value chain” is now being used to refer to a range of types of chain, including:

*	An international, or regional commodity market. Examples could include “the global cotton value chain”, “the southern African maize value chain” or “the Brazilian coffee value chain”;
*	A national or local commodity market or [[agricultural marketing|marketing system]] such as “the Ghanaian tomato value chain” or “”the Accra tomato value chain”;
*	A [[supply chain]], which can cover both of the above;
*	An extended supply chain or marketing channel, which embraces all activities needed to produce the product, including information/extension, planning, input supply and finance. It is probably the most common usage of the value chain term; 
*	A dedicated chain designed to meet the needs of one or a limited number of buyers. This usage, which is arguably most faithful to Porter’s concept, stresses that a value chain is designed to capture value for all actors by carrying out activities to meet the demand of consumers or of a particular retailer, processor or food service company supplying those consumers. Emphasis is firmly placed on demand as the source of the value.

==Value chain methodologies==

Donors and others supporting agricultural development, such as [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]], [[Department for International Development|DFID]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Institute for Environment and Development|IIED]] and [[UNIDO]], have produced a range of documents designed to assist their staff and others to evaluate value chains in order to decide on the most appropriate interventions to either update existing chains or promote new ones.&lt;ref name="Riisgaard, L and S. Ponte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lundy, M., M. V. Gottret, C. Ostertag, R. Best, and S. Ferris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Springer-Heinze |first=A. |title=Valuelinks: The methodology of value chain promotion. |url=http://www2.gtz.de/wbf/lred/library/detail.asp?number=3721 |publisher=GIZ |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301193637/http://www2.gtz.de/wbf/lred/library/detail.asp?number=3721 |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DFID|title=The operational guide for the making markets work for the poor (M4P)|url=http://www.setoolbelt.org/resources/1836|publisher=DFID}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vermeulen, S. |author2=J. Woodhill |author3=F. Proctor |author4=R. Delnoye |title=Chain-wide learning for inclusive agrifood market development |url=http://www.regoverningmarkets.org/en/articles/global/chain_wide_learning_guide_for_inclusive_agrifood_market_development_a_guide.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006002859/http://www.regoverningmarkets.org/en/articles/global/chain_wide_learning_guide_for_inclusive_agrifood_market_development_a_guide.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 October 2008 |publisher=IIED |accessdate=25 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Herr, M. L. |author2=T. J.

The proliferation of guides has taken place in an environment where key conceptual and methodological elements of value chain analysis and development are still evolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=J. Donovan |author2=M. Cunha |author3=S. Franzel |author4=A. Gyau |author5=D. Mithöfer |title=Guides for value chain development: A comparative review|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1746_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA and ICRAF|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these guides include not only detailed procedures that require experts to carry out the analysis but also use detailed quasi-academic methodologies.&lt;ref name="Riisgaard" /&gt; One such methodology is to compare the same value chain over time (a comparative or panel study) to assess changes in rents, governance, systemic efficiency and the institutional framework.&lt;ref&gt;Prowse, M. and J. Moyer-Lee (2014) ‘A Comparative Value Chain Analysis of Smallholder Burley Tobacco Production in Malawi, 2003/4 and 2009/10’ Journal of Agrarian Change 14:3 https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/files/2140085/5218863.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linking farmers to markets==

A major subset of value chain development work is concerned with ways of linking producers to companies, and hence into the value chains.&lt;ref name = "Shepherd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd, Andrew |title= Approaches to linking producers to markets|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a1123e/a1123e00.pdf |publisher=FAO|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are examples of fully integrated value chains that do not involve smallholders (e.g. [[Unilever]] operates tea estates and tea processing facilities in Kenya and then blends and packs the tea in Europe before selling it as [[Lipton]], [[Brooke Bond]] or [[PG Tips]] brands), the great bulk of agricultural value chains involve sales to companies from independent farmers. Such arrangements frequently involve [[contract farming]] in which the farmer undertakes to supply agreed quantities of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser, often at a price that is established in advance. Companies often also agree to support the farmer through input supply, land preparation, extension advice and transporting produce to their premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Eaton, C  |author2=Shepherd, A|title=Contract farming: Partnerships for Growth|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/y0937e/y0937e00.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusive value chains==
Work to promote market linkages in developing countries is often based on the concept of “inclusive value chains”, which usually places emphasis on identifying possible ways in which small-scale farmers can be incorporated into existing or new value chains or can extract greater value from the chain, either by increasing efficiency or by also carrying out activities further along the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Haggblade, S. |author2=Theriault, V. |author3=Staatz,J. |author4=Dembele, N. |author5=Diallo, B.|title=A conceptual framework for promoting inclusive agricultural value chains|url=http://fsg.afre.msu.edu/IFAD-WA/conceptual_framework.pdf|publisher=Michigan State University and IFAD|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the various publications on the topic the definition of “inclusion” is often imprecise as it is often unclear whether the development aim is to include all farmers or only those best able to take advantage of the opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shepherd, A. | title= Including small-scale farmers in profitable value chains |url= https://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1942_PDF.pdf? |publisher=CTA Publishing|location= Wageningen, The Netherlands |isbn= 978-92-9081-607-2  |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural value chain finance==

Agricultural value chain finance is concerned with the flows of funds to and within a value chain to meet the needs of chain actors for finance, to secure sales, to buy inputs or produce, or to improve efficiency. Examining the potential for value chain finance involves a holistic approach to analyze the chain, those working in it, and their inter-linkages. These linkages allow financing to flow through the chain. For example, inputs can be provided to farmers and the cost can be repaid directly when the product is delivered, without need for farmers taking a loan from a bank or similar institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FAO|title=Value chain finance|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/ags/agricultural-finance-and-investment/value-chain-finance/en/|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is common under contract farming arrangements. Types of value chain finance include product financing through trader and input supplier credit or credit supplied by a marketing company or a lead firm. Other trade finance instruments include receivables financing where the bank advances funds against an assignment of future receivables from the buyer, and factoring in which a business sells its accounts receivable at a discount. Also falling under value chain finance are asset collateralization, such as on the basis of warehouse receipts, and risk mitigation, such as forward contracting, futures and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miller, C.  |author2=Jones, L.|title=Agricultural Value Chain Finance: Tools and Lessons|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i0846e/i0846e.pdf|publisher=FAO and Practical Action|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The use of ICTs in value chains==

[[Information and communication technologies for development|Information and Communication Technologies]], or ICTs, have become an important tool in promoting agricultural value chain efficiency. There has been a rapid expansion in the use of mobile technologies, in particular. The price of ICT services is falling and the technologies are becoming more affordable to many in developing countries. [[Application software|Applications]] can support farmers directly through SMS messages. Examples include iCow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is iCOW?|url=http://icow.co.ke/|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed in Kenya, which provides information on the gestation period, on artificial insemination of the cows, and on how to look after them. Applications such as [[M-Pesa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M-PESA: Kenya's Mobile Wallet Revolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11793290|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; can support access to mobile payment services for a large percentage of those without banks, thereby facilitating transactions in the value chain. Other applications have been developed to promote provision of crop insurance through input dealers, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovative insurance by mobile|url=http://www.new-ag.info/en/developments/devItem.php?a=1956|publisher=New Internationalist|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTs are also being used to strengthen the capacity of extension officers and NGO field staff to reach farmers with timely and accurate information and, at the same time, help capture data from the field. The [[Grameen Foundation]]’s Community Knowledge Worker (CKW) programme is an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community knowledge worker|url=http://www.grameenfoundation.org/what-we-do/agriculture/community-knowledge-worker|publisher=Grameen Foundation|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer representatives are trained to use ICT applications on a smartphone to provide agricultural information and extension support. Most [[Market information systems|market price information]] is now delivered to farmers via SMS. Further along the chain, technologies offer considerable possibilities to enhance [[traceability]], which is particularly relevant as certification grows in importance. Where necessary many exporters can now trace consignments back to individual farmers and take necessary measures to address problems.&lt;ref&gt;Moyer-Lee, J. and M. Prowse (2015) ‘How Traceability is Restructuring Malawi’s Tobacco Industry’ Development Policy Review 33:2 http://web.unitn.it/files/download/34693/moyer-leeandprowse2012iobworkingpaper-traceabilityandtobaccoinmalawi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, systems such as FARA’s eRails are also supporting agricultural researchers through data collection and analysis and access to up-to-date research publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Portal on Agriculture|url=http://www.erails.net/|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enabling environments==
As with all agricultural growth, two things appear essential for successful value chain development: creating the right environment for agriculture and investing in rural public goods. An enabling environment implies peace and public order, macro-economic stability, inflation under control, exchange rates based on market fundamentals rather than government allocation of foreign currency, predictable taxation that is reinvested in public goods and property rights. There is a positive correlation of agricultural growth with investment in irrigation, transport infrastructure and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiggins|first=Steve|title=African agriculture in a changing global context: lessons learned|url=http://brusselsbriefings.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/br33_steve_wiggins.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments have a responsibility to provide essential goods and services, infrastructure, such as rural roads, and agricultural research and extension. Value chain development is  often constrained by corruption, both at a high level and at the ubiquitous road blocks found in many countries, particularly in Africa. Many measures to improve value chains require collaboration between a wide range of different ministries, and this can be difficult to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pye-Smith|first=Charlie|title=Policy Pointer: Value Chains for transforming smallholder agriculture|publisher=CTA|location=Wageningen, Netherlands|pages=15–19|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1755_PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcohol Concern''' is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] and [[Advocacy group|campaign group]] founded in 1984 whose aim is to reduce the harm caused by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. It is best known for its flagship awareness programs Alcohol Awareness Week and [[Dry January]].

==History and organisation==
Alcohol Concern was founded in 1984. In 2007 it became one of the 24 founding member organisations of [[Alcohol Health Alliance UK]], a coalition of medical, charity and campaign organisations related to alcohol.&lt;ref name="Eurocare" /&gt; In April 2017, Alcohol Concern merged with Alcohol Research UK.&lt;ref name="Civil Society" /&gt; It is now recognised as a national agency on [[alcohol abuse|alcohol misuse]] for England and Wales.&lt;ref name="Drinkaware" /&gt;

Since September 2017, the charity has been led by Chief Executive Officer Dr Richard Piper, previously of Roald Dahl's Marvellous Medicine Children's Charity.&lt;ref name="CEO announcement" /&gt; Richard Sumray is chair of the trustees.&lt;ref name="Charity Commission" /&gt;

==Activities==
===Annual campaigns===
{{main article|Dry January}}
In May 2012, Alcohol Concern began promoting [[Dry January]], a national campaign in the UK for people to give up drinking alcohol for the month of January each year. The first Dry January was in 2013.&lt;ref name="Third Sector" /&gt; The idea came from Emily Robinson, who gave up alcohol for January 2011 in preparation for a [[half marathon]] and joined Alcohol Concern in January 2012 while [[Abstinence#Alcohol|abstaining]] again.&lt;ref name="Dry January" /&gt; [[Public Health England]] began promoting the campaign in December 2014.&lt;ref name="Gov.UK press release" /&gt; In January 2018, a [[YouGov]] survey estimated that 3.1 million people in Britain were attempting Dry January.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph Dry January" /&gt;

The Charity also organises Alcohol Awareness Week each year. Alcohol Awareness Week 2017 was 13–19 November and had the theme "Alcohol and Families". It was arranged in partnership with [[substance abuse]] charity Adfam.&lt;ref name="Alcohol Policy UK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Awareness Days" /&gt;

===Services===
Alcohol Concern runs Drinkline (0300 123 1110), a drink [[helpline]].&lt;ref name="NHS Choices" /&gt; It also provides training and education for businesses about alcohol use.&lt;ref name="workplace services" /&gt;

Its three-year project Communities Together, from 2014 to 2017, was a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]-funded project encouraging healthy alcohol use in [[Fishguard]] and [[Goodwick]] in Wales, intended to develop harm-reduction approaches that can be expanded to other communities.&lt;ref name="community work" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western Telegraph" /&gt; Initiatives forming part of the project included an "alcohol-free" [[beer festival]], held on [[Saint David's Day]] at Fishguard and Goodwick Rugby Club.&lt;ref name="Wales Online" /&gt;

The Blue Light Project, supported by Public Health England, aims to reduce the financial burden caused by alcohol on public services, focusing on users of alcohol who have been resistant to the usual methods of treatment provision.&lt;ref name="NICE" /&gt;

===Advocacy===
Alcohol Concern campaigns for the prohibition of or tight restriction of [[alcohol advertising]] and co-ordinates the Youth Alcohol Advertising Council which advocates enforcement of existing regulations.&lt;ref name="Guardian advertising" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky advertising" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent YAAC" /&gt; It also campaigns for a legal minimum price of alcohol per [[unit of alcohol|unit]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph gin" /&gt; and other restrictions on alcohol promotion within stores,&lt;ref name="BBC supermarket restrictions" /&gt; as well as a reduction of the legal [[drink driving limit]].&lt;ref name="BBC driving limit" /&gt;

Alcohol Concern acts as the [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] and public enquiry point for the All-Party [[Parliamentary Group]] on Alcohol Harm, which exists to discuss alcohol-related issues and make related recommendations to government. As of July 2015 the chair of the group was [[Fiona Bruce (politician)|Fiona Bruce MP]].&lt;ref name="Parliament" /&gt;

==Funding==
Alcohol Concern receives funding from donations and from funding bodies including the [[Big Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref name="Big Lottery Fund" /&gt; In the financial year to 31 March 2016 it had a combined income of £953,100 and spending of £1,000,000. It had £417,300 total assets and £213,000 total liabilities.&lt;ref name="Charity Commission" /&gt;

'''Alto Rabagão Dam''' ({{lang-pt|Barragem do Alto Rabagão|links=no}}) is a [[concrete]] dam on the [[Rabagão River]], a left tributary of the [[Cávado River]]. It is located in [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]], in the municipality [[Montalegre]], in [[Vila Real District]], [[Portugal]].

Construction of the dam began in 1957. The dam was completed in 1964. It is owned by ''Companhia Portuguesa de Produção de Electricidade'' (CPPE). The dam is used for power production.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

==Dam==
Alto Rabagão Dam is a 94 m tall (height above foundation) and 1,970 m long [[concrete]] dam, which is composed of a [[arch dam]] in the center and [[gravity dam]]s on both sides. Its crest altitude is 880 m. The volume of the dam is 1,117,000 m³. The dam contains a crest [[spillway]] with 2 gates (maximum discharge 500 m³/s) and a bottom outlet (maximum discharge 360 m³/s).&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

==Reservoir==
At full reservoir level of 880 m (maximum flood level of 880.1 m) the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 22.12&amp;nbsp;km² and its total capacity is 568.69 mio. m³. Its active capacity is 557.92 (550&lt;ref name="da"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; or 550.1&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt;) mio. m³. Minimum operating level is 829 m.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; With the 550.1 mio. m³ water 973.1 [[GWh]] can be produced.&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt;

==Power plant ==
The [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plant went operational in 1964. It is owned by CPPE, but operated by [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]].&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; The plant has a [[nameplate capacity]] of 68&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; (72)&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; [[Megawatt|MW]]. Its average annual generation is 85.2&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt; (83&lt;ref name="da"/&gt; 95&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; or 97&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;) [[GWh]].

The power station is located downstream and contains 2 reversible [[Francis turbine]]-generators with 36.75 MW (45 [[Volt-ampere|MVA]]), each in an [[underground powerhouse]]. The turbine rotation is 428 rpm. The minimum [[hydraulic head]] is 129 m, the maximum 185 m. Maximum flow per turbine is 25.7 m³/s. When pumping, each of the pumps has a maximum energy consumption of 31.7 MW and can pump 18 m³/s.&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt; The pumps are operated independently of the Francis turbines.&lt;ref name="da"/&gt;

As lower reservoir for Alto Rabagão the reservoir of [[Venda Nova Dam]] is used.&lt;ref name="da"/&gt;

'''Ballygowan''' is an Irish brand of [[mineral water]]. It is bottled at [[Newcastle West]] in [[County Limerick]], near its [[Inflow (hydrology)|source]] at the site of a reputed [[holy well]] used by the [[Knights Templar]]. Ballygowan is the leading water brand in the Irish market, its name often used as a [[generic trademark]]. 

The company was founded by Geoff Read in 1981, who launched a marketing and distribution [[joint venture]] in 1984 with [[Nash (drinks)|Nash]], a [[soft drink]] manufacturer. [[Anheuser-Busch]] took a stake in 1987, which was bought back in 1989. In 1993, Ballygowan was bought by [[Cantrell and Cochrane]] (now C&amp;C), which sold its non-alcoholic brands to [[Britvic]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/14/6|title=Britvic buys Ballygowan bottled water brand|last=Walsh|first=Fiona|date=14 May 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 deal involved Nash selling the source but retaining part of the source area, which it later used for its own rival spring water brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/nash-continues-to-sparkle-1.1116367|title=Nash continues to sparkle|date=17 November 2000|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Britvic discontinued its Drench and [[Pennine Spring]] water brands in Britain in favour of Ballygowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/will-ballygowan-water-brand-be-a-splash-hit-for-britvic/354297.article|title=Will Ballygowan water brand be a splash hit for Britvic?|last=Bamford|first=Vince|date=9 February 2014|journal=[[The Grocer]]|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-22626993|title=Britvic to close Chelmsford factory and put hundreds out of work|date=22 May 2013|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3999">'''Climber's finger''' is one of the most common [[climbing injuries]] within the sport of [[rock climbing]]. It is an [[Sports injuries|overuse injury]] that usually manifests in a swollen middle or ring finger due to a damaged [[flexor tendon pulley]], normally the A2 or A4 pulley. It is caused by a climber trying to support his or her body weight with one or two fingers, and is particularly common after a repeated utilization of small holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/hha/a.climb.htm |title=Rock Climbing Reaching New Heights |last1=Preston |first1=Dayton |date= |work= |publisher=Hughston health alert|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued climbing on an injured finger may result in increased downtime in order to recover.&lt;ref name=nicros&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicros.com/training/articles/finger-tendon-pulley-injury/ |title=Finger Tendon Pulley Injury |last1=Hörst |first1=Eric J |year=2008 |work= |publisher=Nicros |accessdate=12 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151110/http://www.nicros.com/training/articles/finger-tendon-pulley-injury/ |archivedate=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Management of tendon injuries in the fingers is to follow the [[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] method.&lt;ref name=nicros /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climbinginjuries.com/page/fingers |title=Fingers and Pulleys |last1=Roseborrough |first1=Aimee |last2=Roseborrough |first2=Kyle  |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schöffl |first1=Volker |last2=Schöffl |first2=I. |year=2007 |title=Finger pain in rock climbers: reaching the right differential diagnosis and therapy |journal=J Sports Med Phys Fitness |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages=70–8 |publisher= |doi= |pmid=17369801}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 January 2011 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* Immediately cease climbing and any other activity that puts stress on the injured finger. Consult a doctor if there is noticeable "bowstringing" on the [[flexor tendon pulley|flexor tendon]] or if you are the least unsure about the nature of the injury.
* There are different theories out there for the preferred line of approach. Some argue for the use of [[NSAIDs]] and ice for visible swelling only, others argue [[diclofenac sodium]] should be applied and carefully rubbed in on the injury until the swelling starts to give. 
* When the pain and swelling is gone (depending of the [[Climbing injuries#Pulleys|grade]] of the injury, 1–4 weeks), begin with an active healing process – containing squeezing putty clay or a stress ball. Combine this with light massage and mild stretching to ensure your finger will heal properly and better prepared for future stress. The use of heating pads and cold water baths are also mentioned in several sources in order to increase blood flow. Use this therapy for about twice as long as the previous resting period (2–8 weeks) before gradually returning, with the utmost care, to climbing. 
* Gradually return to climbing while using prophylactic taping every time you climb, and spend the first weeks climbing relatively easy routes with big holds, good footholds and keep your sessions short and stay away from overhangs and campus areas/boards.
* Return to full-force climbing if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it will also serve as a mental note of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months, since complete tendon healing can take 100 days or more.

'''Coarse bubble diffusers''' are a [[pollution control]] technology used to aerate and or mix wastewater for [[sewage treatment]].

==Description==
Coarse bubble diffusers produce 1/4 to 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch (6.4 to 13 mm) bubbles which rise rapidly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or sewage treatment plant tank. They are typically used in grit chambers, equalization basins, chlorine contact tanks, and [[aerobic digester]]s, and sometimes also in [[aeration]] tanks. Generally they are better at vertically "pumping" water than at mass transfer of oxygen. Coarse bubble diffusers typically provide half the mass transfer of oxygen as compared to [[fine bubble diffusers]], given the same air volume.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

== Application ==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
Often in [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]] or pseudoplastic fluids, such as a [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] with high solids concentration, it does make sense to use coarse bubble diffusers rather than fine bubble diffusers, due to the larger bubbles' ability to shear through more viscous wastewater.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

However, over the past two decades, coarse bubble diffusers have been used less frequently, primarily due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable, highly efficient [[fine bubble diffusers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095623/http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/101.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/105.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095643/http://www.wastewater.com/pdf/105.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in aeration tanks, a system that utilizes coarse bubble diffusers requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Fine Bubble Aeration |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/fine.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 832-F-99-065}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception would be in secondary treatment (or side processing) phases. In these processing tanks, floc particles, sediment and carbonate buildup tend to plug or clog the small air release openings on the fine bubble diffusers. Because of their small air openings, fine bubble diffusers cease to have an advantage. Currently, coarse bubble diffusers are the mainstay solution.

These diffusers are typically made in the shape of a perforated rectangular pipe called a wide band, or a cap of {{convert|3|in|mm}} in diameter with an [[elastomer]]ic membrane. Other varieties of coarse bubble diffusers exist, though it is generally accepted that all of them perform similarly with respect to mass oxygen transfer. When comparing disc-shaped diffusers, the majority fail to withstand specific challenges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coarsebubblediffuser.com/compare-diffuser-differences.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318140607/http://www.coarsebubblediffuser.com/compare-diffuser-differences.html |archivedate=2011-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; beyond 1 or 2 years, which include: clogging, blowing off and cracking. Any coarse bubble diffuser that eliminates these problems would deliver a huge cost-savings, not only in product replacement, but in system downtime to facilitate their exchange. This is a motivating factor considered by budget-sensitive operators at municipal waste water treatment processing plants.

'''Dean Burk''' (March 21, 1904 – October 6, 1988) was an American biochemist, medical researcher, and a cancer researcher at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]].&lt;ref name=AP1988&gt;Associated Press. (1988). [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/10/obituaries/dean-burk-84-chemist-for-cancer-institute.html Dean Burk, 84, Chemist for Cancer Institute]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1934, he developed the [[Lineweaver–Burk plot]] together with [[Hans Lineweaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lineweaver, H  |author2=Burk, D. | year = 1934 | title = The Determination of Enzyme Dissociation Constants | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 658–666 | doi = 10.1021/ja01318a036}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean was the second of four sons born to Frederic Burk, the founder of the San Francisco Normal School, a preparatory school for teachers which eventually became [[San Francisco State University]].  He entered the University of California at Davis at the age of 15. A year later, he transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his B.S. in [[Entomology]] in 1923. Four years later he earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry.

==Professional career==
Burk joined the Department of Agriculture in 1929 working in the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory.&lt;ref name=AP1988&gt;Associated Press. (1988). [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/10/obituaries/dean-burk-84-chemist-for-cancer-institute.html Dean Burk, 84, Chemist for Cancer Institute]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he joined the Cancer Institute as a senior chemist. He was head of the cytochemistry laboratory when he retired in 1974. He also taught biochemistry at the [[Cornell University]] medical school from 1939 to 1941. He was a research master at George Washington University.  Burk was a close friend and co-author with [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]].&lt;ref name="Weiterentwicklung"&gt;Weiterentwicklung der zellphysiologischen Methoden: angewandt auf Krebs, Photosynthese und Wirkungsweise der Röntgenstrahlung: Arbeiten aus den Jahren 1945–1961, (Thieme, Stuttgart 1962) (Trans: Further Developments of Methods in Cellular Physiology applied to Cancer, Photosynthesis and the Effects of X-ray Radiation) Texts in German and English.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a co-developer of the prototype of the [[MRI|Magnetic Resonance Scanner]] and a co-discoverer of biotin.&lt;ref name=AP1988/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I Weisman, L. Bennett, L. Maxwell Sr., M. Woods, and D. Burk (1972)"''Recognition of Cancer in vivo by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance''", '''Science''' 178, 1288 – 1290.&lt;/ref&gt; Burk published more than 250 scientific articles in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Burk D, Schade AL. ''On respiratory impairment in cancer cells''. '''Science'''. 1956 Aug 10;124(3215):270-2.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became head of the National Cancer Institute's Cytochemistry Sector in 1938, although he is often mistaken as leading the entire facility.

==Retirement==
After retiring from the NCI in 1974, Dean Burk remained active. He devoted himself to his [[Water fluoridation controversy|opposition to water fluoridation]].&lt;ref&gt;J Yiamouyiannis, D Burk [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=dean+burk+fluoride&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search "''Fluoridation and cancer, age-dependence of cancer mortality related to artificial fluoridation'']" Fluoride 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerhealth.org/articles/display.cfm?ID=19990817225011 Consummer Health Articles: FLUORIDATION]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burk "fluoridation is a form of public mass murder."&lt;ref name=open&gt;[http://openjurist.org/619/f2d/932/yiamouyiannis-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc#fn3 619 F. 2d 932 – Yiamouyiannis v. Consumers Union of United States Inc]&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Burk argued on Dutch television against a water fluoridation proposal which was before the Dutch Parliament in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; He also was an avid supporter of [[laetrile]]; a cancer treatment now regarded by the medical establishment as ineffective and potentially dangerous.&lt;ref name=Burk1970&gt;Burk, D. (1970). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3955623 Laetrile and Cancer]. ''Science News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
For his work on [[photosynthesis]], Dean Burk received the Hillebrand Prize in 1952. Dean Burk and [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] discovered the photosynthesis I-quantum reaction that splits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activated by respiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1931/warburg.html Otto Warburg - Biography] - Nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;
For his techniques to distinguish between normal cells and those damaged by cancer, Dean Burk was awarded the Gerhard Domagk Prize in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/10/obituaries/dean-burk-84-chemist-for-cancer-institute.html | work=The New York Times | title=Dean Burk, 84, Chemist for Cancer Institute | date=October 10, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11943">'''Dick Anthony''' is a [[forensics|forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] noted for his writings on the validity of [[brainwashing]] as a determiner of behavior, a prolific researcher of the social and psychological aspects of involvement in [[new religious movements]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorne L. Dawson|Dawson, Lorne L.]]. ''Cults in context: readings in the study of new religious movements'', Transaction Publishers 1998, p. 340, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0478-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]]. ''In Gods we trust: new patterns of religious pluralism in America'', Transaction Publishers 1996, p. 537, {{ISBN|978-0-88738-800-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Anthony holds a [[PhD]] from the [[Graduate Theological Union]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California.&lt;ref name=misunderstanding&gt;[[Benjamin Zablocki|Zablocki, Benjamin]]; [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]]. ''[[Misunderstanding Cults]]'', University of Toronto Press 2001, p. 522, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supervised research at the Department of Psychiatry of the [[University of North Carolina]] at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] and at the Graduate Theological Union, and is a former director of the Graduate Theological Union's [[UC Berkeley]]-affiliated Center for the Study of New Religions.&lt;ref name=misunderstanding /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael.

Lewis (scholar)|Lewis, James R.]] (ed.). ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements''. Oxford University Press 2004, p. xi, {{ISBN|0-19-514986-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony has authored or co-authored a large number of scholarly articles on the topic and has co-edited several books.&lt;ref name=misunderstanding /&gt;

==Involvement in the brainwashing debate==
Anthony has characterized brainwashing as "a pseudo-scientific myth", and spearheaded efforts which from 1990 onward led to the general rejection of brainwashing testimony as unscientific in United States courts.&lt;ref name=Oldenburg /&gt; Anthony asserted in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony."&lt;ref name=Oldenburg&gt;Oldenburg, Don (2003-11-21). [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-304309.html "Stressed to Kill: The Defense of Brainwashing; Sniper Suspect's Claim Triggers More Debate"], ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissing the idea of [[mind control]], he has defended [[new religious movements]], and argued that involvement in such movements may often have beneficial, rather than harmful effects.&lt;ref name=Sipchen /&gt;

Anthony was a key consultant for the government in the [[Fishman case]] and acted as a consultant in many subsequent cases of a similar nature, "frequently getting pseudoscientific mind control testimony excluded from evidentiary hearings".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Phillip Charles; Tobbins, Thomas (eds.). ''New religious movements in the twenty-first century: legal, political, and social challenges in global perspective'', Routledge 2004, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-0-415-96577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;[[James T. Richardson|Richardson, James T.]] "Sociology and the New Religions: 'Brainwashing', the Courts, and Religious Freedom", in: Jenkins, Pamela J.; [[Steve Kroll-Smith|Kroll-Smith, Steve]] (eds.). ''Witnessing for Sociology: Sociologists in Court'', Praeger Publishers 1996, pp. 128–130, {{ISBN|978-0-275-94852-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist [[James T. Richardson]], he was the "intellectual driving force" behind an [[amicus curiae]] brief on brainwashing endorsed by the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name=Richardson145 /&gt; In the Fishman case, the court accepted Anthony's argument that [[Margaret Singer]]'s brainwashing theory lacked scientific support, a decision that set a [[legal precedent]] and led to the exclusion of Margaret Singer and her colleague [[Richard Ofshe]] as expert witnesses in this and subsequent trials.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson228&gt;[[Bryan R. Wilson|Wilson, Bryan R.]]; Cresswell, Jamie (eds.). ''New religious movements: challenge and response'', Routledge 1999, pp. 227–228, {{ISBN|978-0-415-20050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson134-5 /&gt; Afterwards, Singer and Ofshe twice sued Anthony, as well as the American Psychological Association, the [[American Sociological Association]] and several other scholars, for [[defamation]] and conspiracy to deprive them of their livelihoods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson134-5 /&gt; Both suits were dismissed; in the second the judge granted the defendants a [[SLAPP]] motion, requiring Singer and Ofshe to pay Anthony's and the other defendants' legal costs.&lt;ref name=Wilson228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson134-5&gt;Richardson, James T. ''Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers 2004, pp. 134–135, {{ISBN|978-0-306-47887-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony contributed a 100-page chapter on the brainwashing hypothesis to the book ''[[Misunderstanding Cults]]'', edited by sociologists [[Benjamin Zablocki]] and [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]], in which he criticized the "tactical ambiguity" of brainwashing theorists like Zablocki.&lt;ref name=misunderstanding21 /&gt; In Anthony's view, brainwashing proponents have, in their efforts to resurrect a discredited hypothesis, continually modified key assumptions underlying the concept in order to avoid any possibility of its empirical verification.&lt;ref name=misunderstanding21&gt;[[Benjamin Zablocki|Zablocki, Benjamin]]; [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]]. ''[[Misunderstanding Cults]]'', University of Toronto Press 2001, p. 21, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter argues that "the term brainwashing has such sensationalist connotations that its use prejudices any scientific discussion of patterns of commitment in religious movements."&lt;ref name=misunderstanding21 /&gt;

==Reception==
[[David G. Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]], writing in the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'' (1998), have credited Anthony and his co-author, sociologist [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]], with having written "the most articulate critique" of the [[anti-cult movement]]'s perspective on brainwashing.&lt;ref name=Swatos&gt;Swatos, William H.; Kivisto, Peter. ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Rowman Altamira 1998, p. 62, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-8956-1}}. Retrieved 2010-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[James T. Richardson]] has referred to Anthony's scholarly work on brainwashing as "without peer".&lt;ref name=Richardson145&gt;Richardson, James T. ''Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers 2004, p. 145, {{ISBN|978-0-306-47887-1}}; the APA later withdrew its endorsement for "procedural and not substantial reasons".&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Downtown Eastside''' ('''DTES''') is a neighbourhood in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. The area, one of the city's oldest, is notable for its levels of [[Substance abuse|drug use]], [[Poverty in Canada|poverty]], [[mental illness]], [[Prostitution|sex work]], [[homelessness]], and [[crime]]. It is also known for its strong community resilience and history of social activism.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, the DTES was the political, cultural, and retail centre of the city. Over several decades, the city centre gradually shifted westwards and the DTES became a poor, although relatively stable, neighbourhood. In the 1980s, the area began a rapid decline due to several factors including an influx of hard drugs, the [[de-institutionalization]] of mentally ill individuals, policies that pushed prostitution and drug-related activity out of nearby areas, and the cessation of federal funding for [[social housing]]. By 1997, an epidemic of [[HIV]] infection and [[drug overdoses]] in the DTES led to the declaration of a public health emergency. As of 2018, critical issues include [[opioid]] overdoses, especially those involving the drug [[fentanyl]]; decrepit and squalid housing; a shortage of low-cost rental housing; and a high prevalence of severe mental illness, which often [[Dual diagnosis|co-occurs with addiction]].

The population of the DTES is estimated to be around 6,000 to 8,000. Compared to the city as a whole, the DTES has a higher proportion of males and adults who live alone. It also has significantly more [[Aboriginal Canadian|First Nation]] Canadians, who are disproportionately affected by the neighbourhood's social problems. The neighbourhood has a history of attracting individuals with mental health and addiction issues, many of whom being drawn to its drug market and low-barrier services. Law enforcement policies are among the most progressive in Canada; however, many vulnerable members of the community have low trust in the police.

Since the real estate boom began in the early 21st century, the area has been increasingly experiencing [[gentrifying|gentrification]]. Some see gentrification as a force for [[urban renewal|revitalization]], while others believe it has led to higher displacement and homelessness. Numerous efforts have been made to improve the DTES at an estimated cost of over $1.4 billion as of 2009. Services in the greater DTES area are estimated to cost $360 million per year. Commentators from across the political spectrum have said that little progress has been made in resolving the issues of the neighbourhood as a whole, although there are individual success stories. Proposals for addressing the issues of the area include increasing investment in social housing, increasing capacity for treating people with addictions and mental illness, making services more distributed across the city and region instead of concentrated in the DTES, and improving co-ordination of services. However, little agreement exists between the municipal, provincial, and federal governments regarding long-term plans for the area.

* By some definitions, the DTES extends along Main Street to beyond Terminal Avenue, and the DTES also includes a strip of land adjacent to the Vancouver's port.&lt;ref name=V6A/&gt;

For some community planning and statistical purposes, the City of Vancouver uses the term "Downtown Eastside" to refer to a much larger area with considerable social and economic diversity, including [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]], [[Gastown]], [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]], the [[Victory Square, Vancouver|Victory Square]] area, and the light industrial area to the north. This area, referred to in this article as the '''greater DTES area''', is bordered by Richards Street to the west, Clark Drive to the east, Waterfront Road and Water Street to the north and various streets to the south including Malkin Avenue and Prior Street.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=18}}
The greater DTES area includes some popular tourist areas and nearly 20% of [[List of heritage buildings in Vancouver|Vancouver's heritage buildings]].{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=80}}

Strathcona in the 1890s included the entire DTES. By 1994 Strathcona's northern boundary was generally considered to be the alley between East Pender and East Hastings streets,&lt;ref&gt;

The DTES forms part of the traditional territories of the [[Squamish people|Squamish]], [[Tsleil-Waututh]], and [[Musqueam]] First Nations.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=58}}  European settlement of the area began in the mid-19th century, and most early buildings were destroyed in the [[Great Vancouver Fire]] of 1886.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt; Residents rebuilt their town at the edge of [[Burrard Inlet]], between [[Cambie Street|Cambie]] and Carrall streets, a townsite that now forms [[Gastown]] and part of the DTES.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century, the DTES was the heart of the city, containing [[Vancouver City Hall#History|city hall]], the courthouse, banks, the main shopping district, and the [[Carnegie Community Centre|Carnegie Library]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt;  Travellers connecting between Pacific steamships and the western terminus of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] used its hundreds of hotels and rooming houses.&lt;ref name="Paulsen2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulsen|first1=Monte|title=Vancouver's SROs: 'Zero Vacancy'|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2007/05/29/SROHistory/|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=The Tyee|place=Vancouver|date=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large Japanese and Chinese immigrant communities settled in [[Japantown, Vancouver|Japantown]], which lies within the DTES, and in nearby [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]], respectively.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=17}}

During the [[Great Depression in Canada|Depression]], hundreds of men arrived in Vancouver in search of work. Most of them later returned to their hometowns, except workers who had been injured or those who were sick or elderly.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt; These men remained in the DTES area – at the time known as [[Skid Road]] – which became a non-judgemental, affordable place to live as the main downtown area of Vancouver began to shift westward. Among them, drinking was a common pastime.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demolish City's Skid Road, Murder Protest Demands". ''Vancouver Sun,'' 6 April 1962.  p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to being a major cultural and entertainment district, [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]] was also a centre for [[public house|beer parlour]]s and brothels.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2002, chapter 1"&gt;Douglas 2002, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the neighbourhood lost its entire ethnic Japanese population, estimated at 8,000 to 10,000, due to the [[Japanese-Canadian internment|Canadian government's internment of these people]]. Most did not return to the once-thriving Japantown community after the war.&lt;ref name="Mackie2014-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackie|first1=John|title=Japantown: Vancouver’s lost neighbourhood|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Japantown+Vancouver+lost+neighbourhood+with+video/9483788/story.html|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=Vancouver Sun|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the city centre continued its shift westward after the [[British Columbia Electric Railway|interurban rail line]] closed; its main depot was at Carrall and Hastings.&lt;ref name="Mackie2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackie|first1=John|title=Carrall Street: Home to some of Vancouver's coolest bars, a stone's throw away from crackheads|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/related/Carrall+Street+Home+some+Vancouver+coolest+bars+stone+throw+away+from/2207786/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The National Post| place=Toronto|date=18 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatres and shops moved towards [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Robson Street|Robson]] streets.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2002, Introduction"&gt;Douglas 2002, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; As tourist traffic declined, the neighbourhood's hotels became run-down and were gradually converted to [[Single room occupancy]] (or SRO) housing, a use which persists to this day.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt; By 1965, the area was known for prostitution and for having a relatively high proportion of poor, single men, many of whom were alcoholic, disabled, or pensioners.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 1"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, the DTES was an edgy but still relatively calm place to live. The neighbourhood began a marked shift before [[Expo 86]], when an estimated 800 to 1,000 tenants were evicted from DTES residential hotels to make room for tourists.&lt;ref name="Baker2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Rafferty|title=Expo 86 evictions: remembering the fair's dark side|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/expo-86-evictions-remembered-1.3566844|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=CBC News|place=Toronto |date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased tourist traffic of Expo 86, dealers introduced an influx of high-purity [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 3"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to clean up other areas of the city, police cracked down on the cocaine market and street prostitution, but these activities resurfaced in the DTES.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; Within the DTES, police officers gave up on arresting the huge numbers of individual drug users, and chose to focus their efforts on dealers instead.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 13"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the provincial government adopted a policy of [[de-institutionalization]] of the mentally ill, leading to the mass discharge of [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]]'s patients, with the promise that they would be integrated into the community.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 6"/&gt; Between 1985 and 1999, the number of patient-days of care provided by B.C. psychiatric hospitals declined by nearly 65%.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 6"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the de-institutionalized mentally ill moved to the DTES, attracted by the accepting culture and low-cost housing, but they floundered without adequate treatment and support and soon became addicted to the neighbourhood's readily available drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2009, page 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = Michelle  | title = The Faces of Homelessness Across BC | journal = Visions | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–8 | publisher = BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information | location = Vancouver | date = Summer 2007  | url = http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_housing_homelessness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 2002, more than 60 women went missing from the DTES, most of them sex workers.

In the 1990s, the situation in the DTES deteriorated further on several fronts. [[Woodward's]], an [[anchor store]] in the 100-block of West Hastings street, closed in 1993 with devastating effect on the formerly bustling retail district.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 5"&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, a crisis in housing and homelessness was emerging.

Between 1970 and the late 1990s, the supply of low-income housing shrank in both the DTES and in other parts of the city, partly because of conversion of buildings into more expensive condominiums or hotels.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 6"/&gt; In 1993, the federal government [[Homelessness in Canada|stopped funding social housing]], and the rate of building social housing in B.C. dropped by two-thirds despite rising demand for it.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 6"/&gt; By 1995, reports had begun to emerge of homeless people sleeping in parks, alleyways, and abandoned buildings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 6"/&gt; Cuts to the provincial welfare program in 2002 caused further hardship for the poor and homeless.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 16"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; Citywide, the number of homeless people climbed from 630 in 2002 to 1,300 in 2005.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 16"/&gt;

Official figures are available for the greater DTES area, which was home to an estimated 18,477 people in 2011.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=6}} In comparison to the city of Vancouver overall, the greater DTES had a higher proportion of males (60% vs. 50%), more seniors (22% vs 13%), fewer children and youth (10% vs 18%), slightly fewer immigrants, and more [[Aboriginal Canadian|Aboriginals]] (10% vs. 2%).{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=10}}

A 2009 demographic profile by ''The Globe and Mail'' focused on an area of just over 30 city blocks in and around the DTES: It indicated that 14% of the residents were of Aboriginal descent.&lt;ref name = "Globe and Mail"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/exclusive-demographic-picture/article4277604/|title= Exclusive demographic picture: A comparison of key statistics in the DTES, Vancouver, B.C. and Canada|accessdate=3 September 2015 |author= Patrick Brethour|date= 13 February 2009|work= Globe and Mail |place=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average household size was 1.3 residents; 82% of the population lived alone.

The DTES population suffers from very high rates of [[mental illness]] and [[addiction]]. In 2007, [[Vancouver Coastal Health]] estimated that 2,100 DTES residents "exhibit behaviour that is outside the norm" and require more support in the areas of health and addiction services.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=36}} According to the [[Vancouver Police Department]] (VPD) in 2008, up to 500 of these individuals were "chronically mentally ill with disabling addictions, extreme behaviours, no permanent housing and regular police contact."{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=54}} As of 2009, the DTES was home to an estimated 1,800 to 3,600 individuals who were considered to be at "extremely high health risk" due to severe addiction and/or mental illness, equivalent to 60% of the population in this category for the 1 million people in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.&lt;ref name="VCH2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Regional Mental Health &amp; Addiction Program|title=Improving health outcomes, housing and safety: Addressing the needs of individuals with severe addiction and mental illness|url=http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2013/improving-severe-addiction-and-mental-illness-services.pdf|publisher=Vancouver Coastal Health|accessdate=16 April 2016|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study of SRO tenants in the greater DTES found that 95.2% had some form of substance dependence and 74.4% had a mental illness, including 47.4% with psychosis.&lt;ref name="Vila-Rodriguez2013"/&gt; Only one third of individuals with psychosis were receiving treatment, and among those with concurrent addiction, the proportion receiving treatment was even lower.&lt;ref name="Vila-Rodriguez2013"/&gt; A 2016 study of the 323 most chronic offenders in the DTES found that 99% had at least one mental disorder, and more than 80% also had substance abuse issues.&lt;ref name="Woo2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woo|first1=Andrea|title=Vancouver subset struggling to escape corrections system's ‘revolving door,’ study says|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouver-subset-struggling-to-escape-corrections-systems-revolving-door-study-says/article28046243/|work=The Globe and Mail| place=Toronto|date=6 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 60% and 70% of mentally ill patients treated at [[St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver)|St. Paul's Hospital]], the hospital closest to the DTES, are estimated to have multiple addictions.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=22}} Possible explanations for the high level of [[dual diagnosis|co-occurrence]] between addiction and mental illness in the DTES include the vulnerability of the mentally ill to drug dealers, and a recent rise in [[crystal methamphetamine]] use, which can cause permanent [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luk2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luk|first1=Vivian|title=How drugs, lack of safe housing fuel Vancouver's mental-health crisis|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/how-drugs-lack-of-safe-housing-fuel-vancouvers-mental-health-crisis/article14853847/|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=The Globe and Mail| place=Toronto|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substance use====
[[File:April, With Intriguing Books and Suffering Withdrawal.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a woman with facial lesions, sitting on the sidewalk|A person who uses drugs, seen on Hastings Street]]
A 2010 [[BBC]] article described the DTES as "home to one of the worst drug problems in North America."&lt;ref name="BBC2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mirchandani|first1=Rajesh|title=Vancouver: 'Drug Central' of North America|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8505061.stm|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=BBC|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[crack cocaine]] was the most commonly used illicit [[Drug harmfulness|hard drug]] in Vancouver, followed by injected prescription opioids (such as [[fentanyl]] and [[OxyContin]]), [[heroin]], [[crystal methamphetamine]] (usually injected rather than smoked), and [[cocaine]] (also usually injected).&lt;ref name=UHRI2013/&gt; Alcoholism, especially when it involves the use of highly toxic isopropyl alcohol, is a significant source of harm to residents of the DTES.&lt;ref name=VCH2015/&gt;

In 2016, a board member of the [[Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users]] said that in the previous year, Vancouver's supply of heroin had virtually disappeared and been replaced by fentanyl, which is cheaper and more potent.&lt;ref name="Geordon2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geordon|first1=Omand|title=Little if any heroin left in Vancouver, all fentanyl: drug advocates|url=http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/little-if-any-heroin-left-in-vancouver-all-fentanyl-drug-advocates|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Vancouver Sun|date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2014, the DTES saw a dramatic rise in fentanyl overdoses.

====Mental illness====
The VPD reported in 2008 that in its district that includes the Downtown Eastside, mental health was a factor in 42% of all incidents in which police were involved.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=12}} The police department says its officers are often forced to act as front-line mental health workers, due to the lack of more appropriate supports for this population.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=2}}

In 2013, the city and police department reported that in the previous three years, there had been a 43% increase in people with severe mental illness and/or addiction in the emergency department of St. Paul's Hospital. In Vancouver, apprehensions under the ''Mental Health Act'' rose by 16% between 2010 and 2012, and there was also an increase in the number of violent incidents involving mentally ill people.&lt;ref name=Cole2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Yolande|title=Vancouver police and mayor issue recommendations to address mental health "crisis"|url=https://www.straight.com/news/424456/vancouver-police-and-mayor-issue-recommendations-address-mental-health-crisis|accessdate=5 April 2016|work= Georgia Straight| place=Vancouver|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]] described the mental health crisis as "on par with, if not more serious than" the DTES HIV/AIDS epidemic that had led to a declaration of a public health emergency in 1997.&lt;ref name=Cole2013/&gt;

These figures may be an underestimate, as marginalized populations such as DTES residents tend to be less likely to report crime.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=43}} The figures do not indicate how many of the reported crimes were committed by DTES residents; some residents and business owners believe that visitors from other neighbourhoods are responsible for a significant proportion of serious crimes.&lt;ref name="Lupick2016-2"/&gt;   According to police, DTES women say that what they fear most are "predatory drug dealers who conduct their business with violence, torture and terror."&lt;ref name="CTV2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police bust drug ring that used torture, terror|url=http://bc.ctvnews.ca/police-bust-drug-ring-that-used-torture-terror-1.600969|accessdate=6 June 2016|work=CTV News|place=Toronto |agency=The Canadian Press|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some DTES residents supplement their incomes through the [[informal sector|informal economy]], through volunteer work which can yield stipends,{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=13}} or through criminal activity or sex work.{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|p=21-26}} A 2008 survey of SRO residents found that the average tenant income from all sources, including the informal economy, was $1,109 per month.&lt;ref name=Lewis2008/&gt;

In addition to issues with addiction and mental illness, DTES residents often have difficulty finding employment due to mental and physical disabilities and lack of education and skills.{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|pp=18}} According to a 2009 survey of the 30 blocks in and around the DTES, 62% of the residents over the age of 15 were not considered participants in the labour force, compared to 33% in Vancouver as a whole.&lt;ref name = "Globe and Mail"/&gt;

===Housing===
{{See also|Homelessness in Vancouver}}
Both homelessness and substandard housing are major issues in the DTES, that confound the neighbourhood's problems with addiction and mental illness. In 2012, there were 846 homeless people in the greater DTES area, including 171 who were not in some form of shelter.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|p=24}} The DTES homeless made up approximately half of the city's total homeless population,&lt;ref name="Lupick2016"/&gt; over a third of whom are Aboriginal.&lt;ref name="Thompson2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Matt|title=Vancouver Homeless Count 2016|url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/homeless-count-2016-report.pdf|publisher=City of Vancouver|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of DTES residents live in SROs, which provide low-cost rooms without private kitchens or bathrooms,&lt;ref name="Lupick2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lupick|first1=Travis|title=Study finds steep drug and mental health challenges for Downtown Eastside single-occupancy tenants|url=https://www.straight.com/news/408591/study-finds-steep-drug-and-mental-health-challenges-downtown-eastside-single-occupancy-tenants|accessdate=5 April 2016|work= Georgia Straight|place=Vancouver|date=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although conditions in SROs vary considerably, they have become notorious for their squalor and chaos. Many are more than 100 years old and in extreme disrepair, with shortages of basic necessities such as heat and functioning plumbing. In 2007, it was reported that four out of five rooms had bed bugs, cockroaches, and fire code violations.&lt;ref name=Paulsen2007/&gt; Even at their best, the SROS have a lack of living space that results in tenants spending more time in the public spaces of the DTES, including its street-based drug scene.&lt;ref name=UHRI2013/&gt;

Although many outsiders fear the DTES,{{sfn|Cran|2008|p=31}} its residents take pride in their neighbourhood and describe it as having multiple positive assets.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=17}} DTES residents say the area has a strong [[sense of community]] and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=BCS2010/&gt; They describe their neighbours as being accepting and having empathy for people with addictions and health issues.&lt;ref name=BCS2010/&gt; According to the City, [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]] is valued by SRO residents as "a place to meet friends, get support, access services and feel like they belong."{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=50}}

The area has had a robust tradition of advocacy for its marginalized residents since at least the 1970s, when the [[Downtown Eastside Residents Association]] (DERA) was formed.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 2"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the DTES community has consistently resisted many attempts to "clean up" the neighbourhood by dispersing its close-knit residents.{{sfn|Cran|2008|p=11}} Successful resident-led initiatives to improve conditions in the DTES include the transformation of the then-closed Carnegie Library into a community centre in 1980,&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 2"/&gt; the opening of an unlicensed supervised injection site in 2003, which led to the founding of [[Insite]];{{sfn|Cran|2008|p=27}} improvements to [[Oppenheimer Park]],{{sfn|Cran|2008|p=10}} and the creation of CRAB Park.

In 2010, the V6A postal area, which includes most of the DTES, had the second-highest concentration of artists in the city.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|pp=47-48}} Artists made up 4.4% of the labour force, compared to 2.3% in the city as a whole.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2013|pp=47-48}} The greater DTES area is the location of several art galleries, artist-run centres and studios.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|pp=143-147}} Notable annual events include the ''Downtown Eastside Heart of the City Festival'', which showcases the art, culture, and history of the neighbourhood, and the ''Powell Street Festival'' in [[Oppenheimer Park]], which celebrates Japanese-Canadian arts and culture. [[City Opera of Vancouver]], the [[Dancing on the Edge Festival]], and other artists regularly perform in DTES venues such as the Carnegie Centre, the [[Firehall Arts Centre]], and the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts at the Woodward's site. In 2010, [[Sam Sullivan]], former mayor of Vancouver, said that in the DTES, "Behind the visible people who clearly have a lot of troubles, there's a community.

==Law enforcement==
{{Reduced pull quote |right | For the police, success is measured in how well the drugs are kept corralled on Hastings between Cambie and Main, where they can expect the fewest complaints.

In comparison to other Canadian cities, the [[Vancouver Police Department|VPD]] is generally [[Progressivism|progressive]] in dealing with drugs and sex work, emphasizing harm reduction over law enforcement.&lt;ref name=Li2014/&gt; Since the 1980s, the VPD has generally ignored drug use in the DTES, as the sheer volume of users makes it unfeasible to arrest all of them.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 13"/&gt; A large-scale police crackdown on DTES drug users in 2003 made no difference except to displace drug use to adjacent neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Wood E, Spittal PM, Small W, et al.

In 2008, the VPD implemented a crackdown on minor offences, such as illegal vending on sidewalks and jaywalking.

==Housing availability and affordability==
{{Reduced pull quote|right |Any discussion of improving the continuum of care for addiction must include housing as a basic component, particularly for the most vulnerable individuals coping with homelessness, addiction, and mental illness.| B.C. Medical Association|&lt;ref name = BCMA2009/&gt;}}
The City refers to the housing and homelessness situation in the DTES as a "crisis".{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=28}} There is wide support amongst governments, experts, and community groups on a [[Housing First]] model, which prioritizes stable, quality housing as a precursor to other interventions for the homeless, those who use drugs, or those with mental illness.&lt;ref name = BCMA2009/&gt; Many people with severe addiction and/or mental illness require [[supportive housing]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 17"/&gt;

As the DTES has many low-income adults who live alone and are at risk of homelessness, trends in housing options for low-income adults are of central importance to the neighbourhood. Although SROs have well-known problems, each SRO resident who loses their room and ends up on the street is estimated to cost the provincial government approximately $30,000 to $40,000 per year in additional services.&lt;ref name="PBC2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Report: SRO Renewal Initiative|url=http://www.partnershipsbc.ca/files-4/documents/PBC_SRO.pdf|publisher=Partnerships British Columbia|accessdate=11 May 2016|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration patterns==
The DTES has a history of attracting migrants with mental health and addiction issues from across B.C. and Canada, with many drawn by its drug market, affordable housing, and services.{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|pp=28-29}}&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCH2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mate2016/&gt; Between 1991 and 2007, the DTES population increased by 140%.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 16"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that 52% of those DTES residents who experience chronic homelessness and serious mental-health issues, had migrated from outside Vancouver in the previous 10 years. This proportion of the population has tripled in the last decade.&lt;ref name="Woo2016-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woo|first1=Andrea|title=Half of Downtown Eastside's homeless residents came from other areas: study|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/half-of-downtown-eastside-homeless-residents-are-from-out-of-town-study/article28069065/|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=CBC News|place=Toronto |date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found that once migrants had settled in the DTES, their conditions worsened.&lt;ref name="Woo2016-2"/&gt; A 2013 study of tenants of DTES SROs found that while 93% of those surveyed were born in Canada, only 13% were born in Vancouver.&lt;ref name = Lupick2013/&gt; Vancouver Coastal Health estimates that half of the population that uses its health services in the DTES are long-term residents, and that there is a population turnover of 15 to 20% each year.&lt;ref name="Woo2016-2"/&gt;

==Concentration of services controversy==

The DTES is the site of many service offerings including social housing, health care, free meals and clothing, [[harm reduction]] for drug users, housing assistance, employment preparation, adult education, children's programs, emergency housing, arts and recreation, and legal advocacy.&lt;ref name="Culbert2014"/&gt;  In 2014, the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' reported that there were 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, spending $360 million per year.&lt;ref name="Culbert2014"/&gt; No other Canadian city has concentrated services to this degree in one small area.&lt;ref name="Culbert2014"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Culbert, Lori  |author2=Peter McMartin,|title=Downtown Eastside: 260 agencies, housing sites crowd Downtown Eastside|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Downtown+Eastside+agencies+housing+sites+crowd+Downtown+Eastside+with+video/9983274/story.html|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Vancouver Sun|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the high level of services say that it is necessary to meet the complex needs of the DTES population.&lt;ref name=Culbert2014/&gt; For some residents, the sense of community and acceptance that they find in the DTES makes it a unique place of healing for them.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 17"/&gt;

The practice of locating a large number of services in the DTES has also been criticized for attracting vulnerable people to an area where drugs, crime, and disorder are entrenched. Some advocates for vulnerable populations believe that many DTES residents would have a better quality of life and improved chances of health if they could separate from the neighbourhood's predatory drug pushers and pimps.&lt;ref name=Hopper2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turpel-Lafond2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 17"&gt;Campbell 2009, chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benoit2001"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Benoit, Ceclia  |author2=Dena Carroll|title=Marginalized Voices From The Downtown Eastside: Aboriginal Women Speak About Their Health Experiences|url=http://sheway.vcn.bc.ca/files/2012/07/Marginalized-voices-from-the-downtown-eastside-Aboriginal-women-speak-about-their-healt-experiences.pdf|publisher=The National Network on Environments and Women's Health, York University|accessdate=3 May 2016|format=PDF|date=1 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the City's 2014 planning process for the greater DTES, two-thirds of those who participated said they wanted to stay in the area.&lt;ref name=Culbert2014/&gt; But a 2008 survey of SRO tenants had indicated that 70% wanted to leave the DTES.&lt;ref name=Lewis2008/&gt; The City's 30-year plan is for two-thirds of the city's future social housing to be located in the greater DTES area.&lt;ref name=Culbert2014/&gt;

=== Views on services in other neighbourhoods ===

Vancouver Coastal Health says that the lack of appropriate care for complex social and health issues outside of the DTES often does not allow people "the choice to remain in their home community where their natural support systems exist... A common barrier that prevents mentally ill and addicted people from living outside of the DTES is a lack of appropriate services and supports, and too often clients who do secure housing outside the neighbourhood return to the DTES regularly because of the lack of supports found in other communities."&lt;ref name="VCH2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown Eastside Second Generation Health System Strategy|url=https://www.vch.ca/media/VCH-Downtown-Eastside-DTES-Second-Generation-Strategy-2017_2.pdf|publisher=[[Vancouver Coastal Health]]|accessdate=8 April 2016|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to add social housing and services for those with addiction and/or mental health issues to other Metro Vancouver neighborhoods are often met with [[Nimbyism]], even when residents selected for such projects would be low-risk individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ludvigsen | first1 = Mykle  | title = Not in My Backyard: Nimby alive and well in Vancouver | journal = Visions | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 15–16 | publisher = BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information | location = Vancouver | date = Summer 2005  | url = http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_stigma_discrim.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 poll of [[Metro Vancouver]] residents found that although nine out of 10 of those surveyed wanted the homeless to have access to services they need, 54% believed that "housing in their community should be there for the people who can afford it."&lt;ref name="Woo2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woo|first1=Andrea|title=NIMBYism based on ‘fear of the unknown’|work=The Globe and Mail| place=Toronto|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have suggested that Vancouver residents tacitly agree to have the DTES act as a de facto [[ghetto]] for the most troubled individuals in the city.&lt;ref name="McMartin2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMartin|first1=Pete|title=Pete McMartin: Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is a ghetto made by outsider|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Pete+McMartin+Vancouver+Downtown+Eastside+ghetto+made+outsiders+with+video/9983272/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTES lies a few blocks east of the most expensive commercial real estate in the city.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2002, Introduction"/&gt; Since the mid-2000s, new development in the DTES has brought a mixture of market-rate housing (primarily [[condominium]]s), [[social housing]], office spaces, restaurants, and shops.&lt;ref name="AP2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vancouver's Downtown Eastside feeling gentrification squeeze|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-s-downtown-eastside-feeling-gentrification-squeeze-1.1190127|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=CBC News|place=Toronto |agency=The Canadian Press|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property values in the DTES area increased by 303% between 2001 and 2013.&lt;ref name="SIA2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown Eastside Social Impact Assessment - Draft Report|url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/social-impact-assessment-2014-feb-26.pdf|publisher=City of Vancouver|accessdate=8 April 2016|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices at the newer retail establishments are often far higher than low-income residents can afford.&lt;ref name=AP2012/&gt;

The city promotes [[mixed-income housing]], and requires new large housing developments in the DTES to set aside 20% of their units for social housing.&lt;ref name=AP2012/&gt; As of 2014, in a section of Hastings Street from Carrall Street to Heatley Avenue, at least 60% of units must be dedicated to social housing and the rest must be rental units.&lt;ref name="Robinson2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Matthew|title=Vancouver's $1-billion Downtown Eastside plan approved by council|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Vancouver+billion+Downtown+Eastside+plan+approved+council/9624358/story.html|accessdate=18 April 2016|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rents in at least one-third of new social housing units are not permitted to exceed the shelter component of welfare rates.&lt;ref name="Robinson2014"/&gt;

==Costs==
[[File:Potters_Place_Mission.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|250px|The crowded sidewalk of Hastings Street, near Main Street]]
Several overlapping sets of data exist on costs related to the DTES:

* '''DTES-specific costs:''' Of the estimated $360 million per year to operate 260 social services and housing sites in the greater DTES area, three quarters of the spending is funded by governments, and the rest by private donors.&lt;ref name="Culbert2014"/&gt; This figure includes [[operating costs]] of a range of organizations including neighbourhood health care services, but does not include standard city operations, the [[capital costs]] of building social housing or other infrastructure, or hospital costs.&lt;ref name="Culbert2014"/&gt;
* '''Wider-area costs related to issues that are concentrated in the DTES:''' In the closest hospital to the DTES, [[St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver)|Saint Paul's]], injection drug use leads to approximately 15% of admissions.&lt;ref name=Wood2003&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wood|first=Evan |last2=Kerr |first2=Thomas | first3=  Patricia M. | last3= Spittal | first4= Mark W. | last4= Tyndall | first5= Michael V. | last5= O'shaughnessy | first6= Martin T. | last6= Schechter  |title=The health care and fiscal costs of the illicit drug use epidemic: The impact of conventional drug control strategies |url=http://bcmj.org/article/health-care-and-fiscal-costs-illicit-drug-use-epidemic-impact-conventional-drug-control-stra |journal= BC Medical Journal | date=April 2003 |publisher= |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=128–134 |doi= |access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual cost of ambulances responding to overdoses in Vancouver is $500,000,&lt;ref name= Wood2003/&gt; and the cost of police response to calls involving mental health problems is estimated to be $9 million per year.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=2}}

==Housing strategies==
[[File:Ovaltine Cafe and Afton Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|alt=refer to caption|The Ovaltine Cafe at 251 E.

Although housing and homelessness are often perceived as being municipal issues, social housing is traditionally funded primarily by senior levels of government, which receive 92% of tax revenue in Canada.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 16"/&gt; [[Libby Davies]], a former DTES activist and Member of Parliament, called for a National Housing Strategy in 2009, saying that Canada is the world's only industrialized country with no national housing plan.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2009, chapter 17"/&gt;

In 2014, the City of Vancouver approved a 30-year plan for the greater DTES area. It sets out a goal of having 4,400 units of social housing added to the greater DTES area, 3,350 units of social housing added elsewhere in the city, and 1,900 units of new supportive housing scattered throughout the city.{{sfn|City of Vancouver|2014|p=97}}&lt;ref name="Dhillon2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dhillon|first1=Sunny|title=Vancouver reveals $1-billion plan for Downtown Eastside revival|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouver-reveals-1-billion-plan-for-downtown-eastside-revival/article17155956/?ts=160418134141&amp;ord=1|accessdate=18 April 2016|work=The Globe and Mail| place=Toronto|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of implementing the plan is estimated at $1 billion, of which  $220-million would be paid by the city, $300-million by developers, and more than $500-million from the provincial and/or national governments.&lt;ref name="Dhillon2014"/&gt;  The provincial government, which recently invested $300 million in social housing in Vancouver, said that it will not be funding the proposed housing expansion, and that its housing strategy had shifted towards other models such as rent assistance rather than construction.&lt;ref name="Mackie2014-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackie|first1=John|title=City unveils $1-billion plan for Vancouver's Downtown Eastside|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/City+unveils+billion+plan+Vancouver+Downtown+Eastside/9561041/story.html|accessdate=18 April 2016|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addiction and mental illness strategies==
In 2001, the city adopted a [[Four Pillars drug strategy]] consisting of four equally important "pillars": [[Substance abuse prevention|prevention]], [[Drug rehabilitation|treatment]], enforcement, and [[harm reduction]]. Advocates of the Four Pillars strategy say that the 36 recommendations associated with the policy have only been partly implemented, with prevention, treatment, and harm reduction all being underfunded.&lt;ref name=Katic2014/&gt; Across Canada, 94% of drug strategy dollars are spent on enforcement.&lt;ref name=Wood2003/&gt; The city's 2014 Local Area Plan for the DTES does not propose solutions to the neighbourhood's drug problems; an article in the ''[[National Post]]'' described it as a "221-page document that expertly skirted around any mention of the Downtown Eastside as a failed community in need of a drastic turnaround."&lt;ref name=Hopper2014/&gt;

The VPD, B.C. Medical Association, and City of Vancouver have asked the province to urgently increase capacity for treating addiction and mental illness.{{sfn|Wilson-Bates|2008|p=22}}&lt;ref name = BCMA2009/&gt;  In 2009, the BCMA asked that detoxification be available on demand, with no waiting period, by 2012.&lt;ref name=BCMA2009/&gt;  A 2016 study of youth who used illicit drugs in Vancouver indicated that 28% had tried unsuccessfully to access [[addiction treatment]] in the previous 6 months, with the lack of success mostly due to being placed on waiting lists.&lt;ref name=DeBeck2016&gt;{{cite journal | last1= DeBeck | first1=Kora | first2= Thomas | last2=Kerr | first3= Seonaid | last3=Nolan | first4= Huiru | last4=Dong | first5=Julio | last5=Montaner | first6=Evan | last6=Wood|title=Inability to access addiction treatment predicts injection initiation among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting|journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy|date=6 January 2016|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13011-015-0046-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13011-015-0046-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the city and police department described an emerging mental health crisis in Vancouver in 2013, the province implemented three of their five recommendations within a year, including new [[Assertive Community Treatment]] teams and a nine-bed urgent care facility at St. Paul's Hospital.&lt;ref name="Woo2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woo|first1=Andrea|title=A year after Vancouver declares mental health crisis, cases continue to climb|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouvers-act-teams-need-more-action-to-battle-mental-health-issue/article21154660/|accessdate=26 May 2016|work=The Globe and Mail| place=Toronto|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a recommendation that the province add 300 new long-term health care beds for the most severely mentally ill, provincial Health Minister [[Terry Lake]] said that more research was needed to determine whether these beds were urgently needed.&lt;ref name=Woo2014/&gt; As of 2015, the province had opened or committed to only 50 new beds.&lt;ref name="Lupick2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lupick|first1=Travis|title=Vancouver hospitals predict 2015 will see emergency mental-health visits surpass 10,000|url=https://www.straight.com/life/510721/vancouver-hospitals-predict-2015-will-see-emergency-mental-health-visits-surpass-10000|accessdate=26 May 2016|work=Georgia Straight| place=Vancouver|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-ordination of services==
Although DTES residents often have a complex combination of needs, services are typically delivered from the perspective of a single discipline (such as police or medical), or a particular agency's mandate, with little communication between the service providers who are working with a given individual.{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|p=2}} Despite widespread agreement in principle that a co-ordinated approach is necessary to improve conditions for DTES residents, the three levels of government have not agreed on any overall long-term plan for the DTES, and there is no overall co-ordination of services for the area.&lt;ref name=Hopper2014/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Vancouver Police Department|VPD]] proposed the creation of a steering committee made up of senior city and provincial stakeholders, which would be mandated to improve collaboration between service providers to enable a client-centric rather than discipline-centric model.{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|pp=2-3}} The report recommends prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable individuals in the neighbourhood, saying that having them get the assistance they require is "a necessary condition for other neighbourhood improvement initiatives to succeed."{{sfn|Vancouver Police Department|2009|p=2}}

The '''Estonian Medical Association''' (EMA) ({{lang-et|Eesti Arstide Liit}}) is a professional association of [[medical doctor]]s operating in [[Estonia]].  The association was established on 28 February 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legeforeningen.no/efma-who/members/national-medical-associations-representing-both-member-organisations-and-observers/estonia-estonian-medical-association/ | title=Estonia - Estonian Medical Association | work=legeforeningen | date=2008 | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMA also has an established Ethics committee consisting of 4 members. The ethics committee is responsible for producing guidelines on bioethics dealing with problems of medical ethics within the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eetikakeskus.ut.ee/en/ethics-committee-estonian-medical-association | title=Ethics Committee of Estonian Medical Association | publisher=University of Tartu, Centre for Ethics | work=Eetikaveeb | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===As Discovery Health===
[[File:Discovery Health Canada.png|150px|thumb|left|Logo as Discovery Health used from 2001 to 2007.]]
In January 2000, [[Alliance Atlantis]] brokered a deal with [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] and several Canadian television providers, including both national satellite companies [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]] and [[Shaw Direct|Star Choice]], to distribute News Corporation's cable channel, [[The Health Network]], in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4940930-1.html Diagnosis Good For Canada / Health Net Lands On Sat Services Prior To...]; AllBusiness.com; 2000-01-11&lt;/ref&gt; The deal would mark the first time The Health Network would be available in Canada.

The deal struck to sponsor The Health Network's distribution in Canada was a prelude to the fact that Alliance Atlantis and News Corporation would eventually launch a Canadian version of the channel for the domestic market and remove the American channel from the Canadian market. On November 24, 2000, Alliance Atlantis (which would hold 80% majority interest in the channel) and News Corporation (which would hold the remaining 20% interest) were granted a broadcasting licence for The Health Network Canada by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-461.htm Decision CRTC 2000-461]; CRTC; 2000-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the launch of the network, in September 2001, [[Discovery Communications]] (owners of [[Discovery Health Channel]] in the U.S.) bought The Health Network from News Corporation for US$255 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/50872-Discovery_Finds_That_FitTV_Was_Best_Fit_After_All.php Discovery Finds That FitTV Was Best Fit After All]; MultiChannel.com; 2003-11-13&lt;/ref&gt; Through that transaction, Discovery Communications would also acquire News Corporation's 20% interest in The Health Network Canada.

[[File:Discovery Health.svg|140px|thumb|left|Logo as Discovery Health used from 2007 to 2010.]]
As a result of Discovery Communications' newly acquired interest in the service, the network was launched that same month on September 7, 2001 as the '''Discovery Health Channel'''. On the same day as the Canadian channel's launch, the American service, The Health Network, was removed from all Canadian television providers. In February 2002, The Health Network was removed from the CRTC's list of foreign satellite services eligible for carriage on Canadian pay television providers, by request of The Health Network's owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2002/pb2002-9.htm Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2002-9]; CRTC; 2002-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2008, a [[joint venture]] between [[Canwest]] and [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]], known as CW Media, bought [[Alliance Atlantis]] and through that transaction, acquired Alliance Atlantis' interest in Discovery Health. In 2009, CW Media purchased the remaining interest in the channel from Discovery Communications, bringing its ownership to 100%.&lt;ref name="twisttv"&gt;[http://www.channelcanada.com/Article5084.html Discovery Health Rebrands As Twist TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923094101/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article5084.html |date=September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Twist TV===
[[File:TwistTV.svg|150px|thumb|right|Logo as Twist TV used from 2010 to 2014.]]
Two deals were announced in late 2009 and early 2010 that affected the future of the Canadian channel. First, Discovery Communications announced that the flagship Discovery Health channel in the U.S. would be replaced by the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. OWN later reached an agreement with [[Corus Entertainment]] to launch a Canadian version of that channel shortly after the U.S. version's debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/29/c6210.html|title=OWN: THE OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK COMES TO CANADA|author=[[Corus Entertainment]] (news release)|publisher=[[CNW Group]]|date=2010-09-29|accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in April 2010, Discovery Communications announced an expanded long-term agreement with [[Bell Media]] (then [[CTVglobemedia]], Discovery's Canadian partner for most of its other channels) under which Bell holds Canadian broadcast rights to most of the Discovery Communications programming library, including Discovery Health programs, and the right to launch new Discovery-branded channels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081226/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/discovery/releases/release.asp?id=12437&amp;yyyy=2010 CTV and Discovery Communications Inc. Extend Discovery Canada Joint Venture], CTV press release, 2010-04-10&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, Canwest announced Discovery Health Canada would rebrand as '''Twist TV''' on November 1. The rebranded channel would focus on reality shows about "people facing extraordinary situations" aimed at a female demographic including such shows as [[Nanny 911]], [[Raising Sextuplets]], [[Dad Camp]], and [[Little Miss Perfect]].&lt;ref name="twisttv"/&gt; On October 27, 2010, the channel's ownership changed again as [[Shaw Communications]] gained control of Discovery Health as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/headline_news/article.jsp?content=b4951353 Shaw Communications closes purchase of Canwest TV assets, rebrands as Shaw Media] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/com100/2010/r101022.htm CRTC approves Shaw’s purchase of the Canwest Global television properties] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220233335/http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/com100/2010/r101022.htm |date=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel officially rebranded five days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/150031 |title=When life throws curves... there's Twist TV |author=Newswire |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebrand as FYI===
In June 2014, it was reported that Twist TV, along with sister network [[Mystery TV]], would be rebranded as Canadian versions of [[The Biography Channel|FYI]] and the [[Crime &amp; Investigation Network]] under a licensing agreement with [[A+E Networks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/globals-fall-line-up-heavy-on-drama/article18982458/ Shaw Media announces fall lineup, pushes new dramas on Global]&lt;/ref&gt; A+E Networks and Shaw Media had previously partnered to rebrand [[History (Canada)|History Television]], [[Lifetime (Canada)|Showcase Diva]] and [[H2 (Canada)|The Cave]] as Canadian versions of [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]] and [[H2 (TV channel)|H2]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw Media and A&amp;E to Launch Two New Specialty Channels|url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/shaw-media-and-a-e-to-launch-two-new-specialty-channels/1001418951/|accessdate=30 May 2012|newspaper=Broadcaster Magazine|date=30 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210161801/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/shaw-media-and-a-e-to-launch-two-new-specialty-channels/1001418951/|archive-date=2012-12-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of FYI (as well as CI) was intended to draw in more female viewers, the primary audience of Shaw Media's lifestyle networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw Media and A&amp;E to Launch Two New Specialty Channels|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1487354/new-fyi-channel-debuts-in-canada-on-sept-1/|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to programming from the U.S. service, as well as other Shaw Media-owned channels, the new channel will air shows from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FYI™: SHAW MEDIA LAUNCHES NEW SPECIALTY NETWORK SEPTEMBER 1|url=http://www.shawmedia.ca/Media/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?pressReleaseId=6442459058|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was relauched on the morning of September 1, 2014 with a free preview to last the rest of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New FYI channel debuts in Canada on Sept. 1|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1487354/new-fyi-channel-debuts-in-canada-on-sept-1/|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month prior, a Canadian version of the FYI website went online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fyitv.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the website was updated to include information pertaining to the channel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fyitv.ca/schedule&lt;/ref&gt;

A YouTube channel went online August 28, 2014; on that day, sneak peeks of FYI programming aired on [[Lifetime (Canada)|Lifetime]] and [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fyitv.ca/on-fyi/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903102643/http://www.fyitv.ca/on-fyi/ |archive-date=2014-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to [[Corus Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corusent.com/news/corus-entertainment-completes-acquisition-shaw-media/|title=Corus Entertainment Completes Acquisition of Shaw Media |accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fyi HD==
In late 2016, Corus launched Fyi HD, a [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcast of the [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed.  The HD feed is currently available on [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Bell MTS]] and [[Telus TV|Optik TV]].

'''Health Care for America Now''' ('''HCAN''') is a progressive political coalition of more than 1,000 organizations that joined together in 2008 in a successful effort to promote legislation to reform the United States health care system and extend medical benefits to most of the population that is currently uninsured. The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA or ACA) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation |title=Focus on Health Reform: Summary of New Health Reform Law |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HCAN was credited with being a "major contributor" to its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramer|first=Dan|last2=Novick|first2=Tom |publisher=The Atlantic Philanthropies |title=Evaluation: Executive Summary of Findings and Lessons from the HCAN Campaign |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/learning/hcan-evaluation-executive-summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; After enactment of the law, HCAN shifted its activities to defending the law from opposition attacks and advocating for the law before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and federal and state regulatory agencies.

==Organization==
HCAN is directed by a steering committee that consists of a wide range of tax-exempt public charities, [[advocacy organizations]], [[labor unions]] and civil rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=Who We Are |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/who_we_are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721160315/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/who_we_are/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCAN is a [[501(c)(4)]] [[issue advocacy]] organization that runs national and state-based legislative and regulatory campaigns through grassroots action, public education, aggressive media outreach, research and policy analysis. It works in cooperation with its [[501(c)(3)]] partner, Health Care for America Education Fund, a project of the [[Tides Center]], a public charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=More About HCAN |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/more_about_hcan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907085855/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/more_about_hcan |archivedate=September 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and activities==
Funding for HCAN's operations has come from its member organizations, individual contributions and progressive foundations, including the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=Who We Are |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/who_we_are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721160315/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/who_we_are/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCAN also received $5 million from billionaire George Soros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/health-care/george-soros-pledges-5-million-to-bankroll-health-care-reform-push-group-says/]&lt;/ref&gt; In its $50 million campaign for passage of the ACA, Health Care for America Now mounted a multi-faceted field program that included television advertising and thousands of actions, events, demonstrations, and advocacy meetings with government officials across the country.

HCAN assembled a network of state-based advocacy groups to carry the message from the ground up to [[members of Congress]]—an effort widely credited with strengthening progressive organizations. HCAN published numerous research reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=Reports |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/reports/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted extensive media outreach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Health Care for America Now |title=Media |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/media/}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the legislative campaign. An outside evaluation praised HCAN's "effective and disciplined strategic planning, decision-making and implementation; well-thought-out benchmarks; strong and effective internal leadership, efficient allocation of resources to staff and to fund a wide-ranging field program; resilience to buffeting external events; and its creation of opportunities for supporters to meaningfully engage with the movement for reform through multiple points of entry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramer|first=Dan|last2=Novick|first2=Tom |publisher=The Atlantic Philanthropies |title=Evaluation: Executive Summary of Findings and Lessons from the HCAN Campaign |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/learning/hcan-evaluation-executive-summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HCAN's two largest public demonstrations occurred on June 25, 2009, when thousands of people from around the nation converged on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for a rally in support of health reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=Health Care for America Now |publisher=YouTube |title=Health Care Can't Wait-June 25th 2009 |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elf4-JtZv8I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 9, 2010, when more than 5,000 people rallied on the street outside a health insurance industry conference at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] Hotel in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=CNN The Situation Room |publisher=MoxNewsDotCom |title=Howard Dean Joins Pro Health Care Reform Protesters Who Surround Ritz Carlton  |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scgw-WtyLlA&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLEEC5F763FFE7984D}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCAN led grassroots online activists, conducted news conferences and published reports on health insurance industry profits, executive compensation, concentration of market power, and mistreatment of consumers and health care providers.

==Affordable Care Act==
HCAN did not achieve one of its central goals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/sites/default/files/uploads/HCAN_Executive_Summary.pdf Executive summary]&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a so-called public option, a government-run health plan that would introduce greater competition into local health insurance markets, nearly all of which are dominated by one or two large companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Health Care for America Now |title=Premiums Soaring in Consolidated Health Insurance Market: Lack of Competition Hurts Rural States, Small Businesses |date=May 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://hcfan.3cdn.net/1b741c44183247e6ac_20m6i6nzc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] joined with [[conservative Democrat]]s to block the public option and a proposal to allow Americans over 55 years old to pay unsubsidized premiums to the government to purchase [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits, which now are provided to the elderly and disabled through a single-payer system that picks up the vast majority of patients' costs.  Despite those losses, HCAN supports the Affordable Care Act and frequently declares that the ACA's impact will be extensive in the policy and political arenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation |title=Focus on Health Reform: Summary of New Health Reform Law |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2011 |url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities since enactment of Affordable Care Act==
In 2010, as a result of political and [[Constitutional challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|legal challenges]] to the ACA, in 2010 HCAN transitioned from campaigning for passage of the law to a broad campaign to fully implement health care reform at the state and federal level. HCAN's executive director, Ethan Rome, has repeatedly declared in media statements and in frequent writings on Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Huffington Post |title=Ethan Rome |accessdate=September 6, 2011 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ethan-rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Congress and the Obama administration should carry out all implementation activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=HCAN Shifts To Second Phase Of Health Reform |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/second_phase |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907145849/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/second_phase |archivedate=September 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCAN has said it intends to do this by identifying significant public policy issues as they arise and taking responsibility to lead campaigns to address them in collaboration with the diverse membership of its coalition. These efforts include pushing for strong accountability measures for insurance companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=Health Care Advocates Disinfect Big Insurance Meeting, Clean Up Lobbyistsí Dirty Tricks |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/clean_up_lobbyists_dirty_tricks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823232736/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/clean_up_lobbyists_dirty_tricks |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and countering what HCAN says is false information that has been systematically disseminated by opponents of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Health Care for America Now |title=HCAN Asks Broadcasters to Stop Airing Misleading Ads About Health Care Law |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |url=http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/stop_airing_misleading_ads |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709014137/http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/stop_airing_misleading_ads |archivedate=July 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCAN continues to prepare reports highlighting insurance industry excesses and abuses and to educate the public about developments related to implementation of the law by state and federal agencies. 

In the fall of 2010, HCAN co-produced a short, two-part satirical comedy video starring [[Jack Black]] and [[America Ferrera]] about professional "Mis-informant" Nathan Spewman, who spreads lies about the Affordable Care Act as part of an industry propaganda campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/12/jack-black-the-mis-inf_n_759873.html | accessdate=5 December 2013 | work=Huffington Post | first=Katla | last=McGlynn | title=Jack Black Is Nathan Spewman: 'The Mis-informant' (VIDEO) | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In the field of medicine, a '''healthcare proxy''' (commonly referred to as HCP) is a document (legal instrument) with which a patient (primary individual) appoints an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to legally make healthcare decisions on behalf of the patient, when the patient is incapable of making and executing the healthcare decisions stipulated in the proxy.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[New York State Department of Health]]|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/forms/doh-1430.pdf|title=Health Care Proxy - New York State Department of Health|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611045033/http://www.health.ny.gov/forms/doh-1430.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the health care proxy is effective, the primary individual continues making healthcare decisions as long as the primary individual is legally [[competence (law)|competent]] to decide. Moreover, in legal-administrative functions, the healthcare proxy is a legal instrument akin to a "springing" [[power of attorney#Health care power of attorney|health care power of attorney]]. The proxy must declare the healthcare agent who will gain durable power attorney. This document also notifies of the authority given from the principal to the agent and states the limitations of this authority. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201D/Section4|title=General Law - Part II, Title II, Chapter 201D, Section 4|website=malegislature.gov|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those over the age of 18 are allowed to have a healthcare proxy, and these documents are useful in situations that render a person unable to communicate their wishes such as being in a persistent vegetative state, having a form of dementia of an illness that takes away one's ability to effectively communicate, or being under anesthesia when a decision needs to be made. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/patients/health_care_proxy/|title=Healthcare Proxy - Who Will Speak for You?|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Healthcare proxies are one of three ways that surrogate decision makers are enacted, the other two being court orders and laws for the automatic succession of decision makers. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moye J, Sabatino CP, Weintraub Brendel R | title = Evaluation of the capacity to appoint a healthcare proxy | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–36 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23498379 | pmc = 4859336 | doi = 10.1016/j.jagp.2012.09.001 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1064748112000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a living will, healthcare proxies do not set out possible outcomes with predetermined reactions, rather they appoint someone to carry out the wishes of an individual. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/patientcare/livingwill#decisions|title=Health Care Proxy/Living Will {{!}} Stony Brook Medicine|website=www.stonybrookmedicine.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The methods of healthcare planning and tools of advanced preparation have changed dramatically over the years. The concept of durable power of attorney arose in Virginia in 1954 for the purpose of setting property matters. This allowed for a continued existence of power of attorney following the original person losing capacity to carry out the necessary actions. This concept evolved over the years and in 1983, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research addressed this idea as one of great potential in the healthcare industry. This commission also stated the possibility of abuse as a noted concern going forward. In response to this commission, there was an evolution of this concept throughout the 1980's and the 1990's that eventually led to all states in America having a healthcare power of attorney statute by 1997. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sabatino CP | title = The evolution of health care advance planning law and policy | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–39 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20579283 | pmc = 2980344 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00596.x | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00596.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

Some jurisdictions place limitations on the persons who can act as agents. (Some forbid the appointment of treating physicians as the healthcare proxy.)&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00099OZLC/|title=The Physician as a Healthcare Proxy|last=Rai|first=Arti | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 1999|work=The Hastings Center Report|publisher=Hastings Center|access-date=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event the agent should be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual.&lt;ref name = "amazon"/&gt; According to the state of Massachusetts, no person who is an employee or administrator of a facility can be an agent unless it is for someone who is of familial relation to them.  In any event the agent is recommended to be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual. In the absence of a power of attorney, a legal guardian must be appointed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hack J, Buecking B, Lopez CL, Ruchholtz S, Kühne CA | title = [Living will, durable power of attorney and legal guardianship in the trauma surgery routine : Data from a geriatric trauma center] | language = de | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Gerontologie Und Geriatrie | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 721–726 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 26608036 | doi = 10.1007/s00391-015-0981-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Legal guidelines ===
Healthcare proxies are permitted in forty-nine states as well as the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130608064700/http://www.lawserver.com/maps/health-care-powers-of-attorney-witness-and-notary-requirments Health Care Powers of Attorney: Interactive Map], LawServer. Retrieved on August 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Healthcare forms may differ in structure from state to state and pre-made forms are not compulsory as long as certain guidelines are met. The common guidelines include:&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

*Name and address of the agent.
*Name and address of an alternate agent.
*Duration of the proxy – not indicating a duration means it is valid unless stated otherwise.
*Special instructions – these can broaden or limit the powers of the agent. If the patient doesn't want to be on feeding tubes no matter what, this can be stated here. If there are certain treatments that the patient does not want to receive like [[dialysis]] or [[blood transfusion]], then they must be indicated. However, if the patient wants to give the agent more flexibility with some or no restriction, this must be written.
*Name, date and signature of the primary individual.
*Instructions on tissue or [[organ donation]].
*Two adult witnesses must sign the document stating that they have witnessed this agreement and that both parties appear to be [[Sanity|sane]]. The witnesses must be 18 years or older. The agent and primary individual do not qualify as witnesses.
*Presence of a lawyer - such a person may help in drafting a document tailored to the needs of the primary individual.
*Once signed, copies of the form must be given to health care providers, the agent, spouse, and close friends. A copy should also be carried by the primary individual (in wallet or purse).

=== Powers and limitations ===

The agent is empowered when a qualified [[physician]] determines that the primary individual is unable to make decisions regarding [[healthcare]]. The agent may be granted the power to remove or sustain [[feeding tube]]s from the primary individual if these tubes are the only things that are keeping the primary individual alive. The agent's decision should draw upon  knowledge of the patient's desire in this matter. If the primary individual made his or her wishes clear on the proxy form, then they must be followed despite any possible objections from the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron| name-list-format = vanc |title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual may have identified end-of-life decisions in a separate document, such as a living will or advanced health care directive, in which case it is necessary to examine all of the documents to determine if any supersede the agent's authority as granted in the healthcare proxy, based on the language of the interrelated documents and governing state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Majette|first1=Shawn| name-list-format = vanc |title=Avoid Disagreements Between Your Power of Attorney Holder and Health Care Proxy|url=http://www.t-mlaw.com/blog/post/avoid-disagreements-between-your-power-of-attorney-holder-and-health-care-proxy/|website=Thompson McMullen, PC|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent will not be legally or financially liable for decisions made on behalf of the primary individual as long as they follow the terms of the healthcare proxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and Facts About   Health Care Advance Directives|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/Commissions/myths_fact_hc_ad.authcheckdam.pdf|website=ABA Commission on Law and Aging|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity to appoint ==
There are limited legal foundation to determine the ability of someone to appoint a healthcare proxy. Although physicians are allowed to deliver life-saving treatment in emergent situations, in non-emergencies, the it is determined if the patient has the ability to then appoint a healthcare proxy. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moye J, Sabatino CP, Weintraub Brendel R | title = Evaluation of the capacity to appoint a healthcare proxy | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–36 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23498379 | pmc = 4859336 | doi = 10.1016/j.jagp.2012.09.001 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1064748112000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a patient lacking the ability to make healthcare decisions, to still have the capacity to appoint an agent and have a proxy.

=== United Kingdom ===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], an independent mental health capacity advocate may be appointed under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]; the provisions made in the same Act for a [[lasting power of attorney]] may also provide a satisfactory basis for providing care via an [[Lawyer|attorney]], who does not require to be professionally qualified. Different arrangements apply elsewhere in the [[UK]].

The '''International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development''' ('''IAASTD''') was a three-year international collaborative effort (2005–2007) initiated by the [[World Bank]] in 2002,  which evaluated the relevance, quality and effectiveness of agricultural knowledge, science, and technology, and the effectiveness of public and private sector policies and institutional arrangements.  
 
The project involved 900 participants{{Citation needed|reason=seen also More than 400 scientists|date=June 2017}} and 110 countries with co-sponsorship of the [[FAO]], [[Global Environment Facility]], [[UNDP]], [[UNEP]], [[UNESCO]], the [[World Bank]] and [[WHO]]. 
It assessed agricultural knowledge, science, and technology with respect to development and sustainability goals of reducing hunger and poverty, improving nutrition, health, rural livelihoods, and facilitating social and environmental sustainability.

The results of the project were reviewed and ratified during the intergovernmental plenary meeting held 7–12 April 2008, in Johannesburg, South Africa.

== Governance ==

The geographically based multi-stakeholder Bureau was composed of 30 government representatives from different regions,  22 representatives from non-governmental organizations, consumer groups and producer groups, representatives from 8 institutions, and 2 co-chairs. The sponsoring agencies served as ''ex officio'' members of the Bureau.

The IAASTD had a distributed secretariat for management and oversight in Washington DC and others in [[FAO]] (Rome), [[UNEP]] (Nairobi), and [[UNESCO]] (Paris). The Director was [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert T. Watson]].

== Structure ==

The IAASTD was composed of one Global Assessment and five Sub-global Assessments, which used the same framework: the impacts of agricultural knowledge, science, and technology on hunger, poverty, nutrition, human health, and environmental and social sustainability in the past and the future.  The Global and Sub-global assessments were peer-reviewed by governments and experts, and approved by the panel of participating governments.

The five Sub-global Assessments complemented the Global Assessment by examining geographic area-specific aspects: &lt;br /&gt;
- Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) - Regional Institute: ICARDA (International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas)&lt;br /&gt;
- East and South Asia and the Pacific (ESAP) - Regional Institute: World Fish Center&lt;br /&gt;
- Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) - Regional Institute: IICA (Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture)&lt;br /&gt;
- North America and Europe (NAE)&lt;br /&gt;
- Sub-Saharan Africa - Regional Institute: ACTS (African Centre for Technology Studies)

The assessments were accompanied by a synthesis report which covered challenges faced by [[agriculture]] today: pros and cons of [[bioenergy]], potential role of [[biotechnology]], effects of [[climate change]], effects on [[health]], use of [[natural resources]], small farmers &amp; [[global trade]], future role for traditional farming, women in agriculture, and options for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Facts on Agriculture &amp; Development| publisher=GreenFacts | accessdate=2008-04-15 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/agriculture-iaastd/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final report ==

On 15 April 2008, IAASTD report findings were released. The report incorporated a global assessment as well as five sub-global assessments. By taking a 'bottom-up' approach, the report aimed to understand the needs of those most vulnerable to threats to the security of their food and livelihood. Prior plenary sessions in Johannesburg aimed to come to agreement on the key priorities for each region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IAASTD press material| publisher=IAASTD | accessdate=2013-07-31 | url= http://www.unep.org/dewa/agassessment/index8138.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of published (printed and web-based) critical, in-depth Global and Sub-global Assessments of local and institutional knowledge and experiences was produced. The assessment reports have been translated into the six official UN languages, presented, and discussed in multiple forums.

The reports created 'plausible scenarios', based on past events and existing trends such as population growth, rural/urban food and poverty dynamics, loss of agricultural land, water availability and climate change effects.  Based around these issues, 'What if?' questions were formulated that allowed the implications of different technological options to be explored.

The '''International Student Congress Of (bio)Medical Sciences''', also known as '''ISCOMS''', is an annually held [[student congress]] on [[biomedical sciences]]. The primary aim of ISCOMS is getting medical students acquainted with research and its many elements.&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com/iscoms/
&lt;/ref&gt;
750 participants from 60 countries attended the 25th edition of ISCOMS in 2018. The 26th edition of ISCOMS will take place from 3-7 June 2019 and the abstract submission is open from October 29th 2018 till February 7th 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ISCOMS started as a congress for medical students in Groningen, named "Studenten Congres Geneeskunde". In 2003, the Student Congres Geneeskunde changed to an international congress with the name International Student Congress of Medicine. In 2004 the name was changed to ISCOMS. In 2010, the name was changed to the International Student Congress Of (bio)Medical Sciences, to show that it is a congress for students in all biomedical fields.

== Location ==
ISCOMS takes place at the [[University Medical Center Groningen]] (UMCG) in the Netherlands. It is one of the largest hospitals in the world, offering supraregional tertiary care to the northern part of the Netherlands. The medical center employs almost 17,000 people, numbers almost 1400 beds and is affiliated with the University of Groningen.

== Congress structure ==
The congress is for (bio)medical students who are interested in research. Students may be either presenting or non-presenting participants. If a participant wants to present their research, they are required to submit their [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] beforehand. A strict selection procedure takes place and only the best students are invited to present their research at ISCOMS.

When accepted, participants are divided into different session in which they present their research. This may be either through a poster presentation, or an oral presentation where students can present their research by means of a slideshow presentation. In both sessions other students and professionals from the UMCG listen and discuss the research. Thirdly, there is a plenary session: the eight best abstracts will be presented in the primary lecture hall of the UMCG.

The congress also holds pre-course masterclasses about research skills, and a great variety of workshops during the congress days on practical skills. Besides that ISCOMS offers keynote lectures from renowned scientist presenting their research to the participants.

Moreover, ISCOMS offers an extensive social programme, where all the participants have the opportunity to get to know each other and the ISCOMS organising committees. Finally, there is a post-congress tour visiting parts of the Netherlands.

== Healthy Ageing ==
‘Healthy Ageing’ is the primary focus of research, patient care, and education &amp; training within the University of Groningen and the University Medical Center Groningen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umcg.nl/EN/corporate/HealthyAgeing/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that ageing of the population poses an increasing burden on society, and that associated disabilities and diseases incur increasing economic, healthcare, infrastructural and personal costs that tax national societies heavily, stimulation of a healthy lifestyle is a key in order to deal with this societal challenge. Therefore, ISCOMS continues to emphasize the importance of ‘Healthy Ageing’. It is well known that lifestyles, nutritional patterns, the amount of exercise, and the use of medication are all factors that affect the development of health. However, the influences of these factors and the way they relate to each other is still unclear. As such, ISCOMS is proud to contribute to the gaining of new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com/iscoms/focus/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisational structure ==
The organisation of ISCOMS consists of (bio)medical students from the [[University of Groningen]]. There are nine Executive Board members and 21 committee members. Committees include the Scientific Programme, Hosting and Logistics, International Contacts, Sponsors and Fundraising, Public Relations, and Research and Development.

== ISCOMS Research Fellowships (IRF) ==
ISCOMS is more than just a congress; it also incorporates several different projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com/research/&lt;/ref&gt; The ISCOMS Research Fellowships (IRF) is such a project and is unique in Europe and has become an integral part of the experience. It provides a starting point for students to pursue a career in medical sciences, broaden their scientific network, increase the range of their knowledge and amplify their experience with research by giving 25 enthusiastic and talented students the opportunity to join a research group in the University Medical Center Groningen. During a challenging two-week period, chosen students will work on their own individual project and for some this may transcend into a chance to conduct a long-term PhD project in Groningen.&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com/research/iscoms-research-fellowship/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==
The official partners of the ISCOMS are:&lt;ref&gt;http://iscoms.com/supporters/partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intiö Water Tower''' ({{lang-fi|Intiön vesitorni}}) is an unused [[water tower]] in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]]. The water tower of the Oulu Waterworks is located in the [[Intiö]] district.

Intiö Water Tower has been designed by architect [[J. S. Sirén]] and it was completed in 1927. It is the first water tower of the Oulu Waterworks. A water tower in [[Myllytulli]] had been built in 1921, but it was only used by the Veljekset Åström leather factory. The water tower is {{convert|39|m}} tall and capable of holding {{convert|600|m3}} of water.&lt;ref name="Manninen"/&gt;

The water tower was closed in 1969 when a new water tower was opened in the Puolivälinkangas neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Manninen"/&gt; The city of Oulu sold the water tower to a private person in 2015.&lt;ref name="yle_20150812" /&gt;

'''Kennel cough''' (also known as '''canine infectious tracheobronchitis''') is an [[upper respiratory infection]] affecting [[dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crawford |first=Cynda |title=Media Briefing on Canine Influenza |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/t050926.htm |publisher=Media Relations, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |date=September 26, 2005 |accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple causative agents, the most common being the bacterium ''[[Bordetella bronchiseptica]]'' (found in 78.7% of cases in Southern Germany), followed by canine [[parainfluenza virus]] (37.7% of cases), and to a lesser extent [[canine coronavirus]] (9.8% of cases).&lt;ref name=Schulz_1997&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=BS |last2=Kurz |first2=S |last3=Weber |first3=K |last4=Balzer |first4=HJ |last5=Hartmann |first5=K |title=Detection of respiratory viruses and Bordetella bronchiseptica in dogs with acute respiratory tract infections |journal=Veterinary journal |date=September 2014 |volume=201 |issue=3 |pages=365–369 |pmid=24980809 |doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly contagious;&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine |edition=4th |publisher=W.B. Saunders Company |year=1995 |isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however adult dogs may display immunity to reinfection even under constant exposure.&lt;ref name=Bemis_1977&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bemis |first1=DA |last2=Carmichael |first2=LE |last3=Appel |first3=MJ |title=Naturally occurring respiratory disease in a kennel caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica |journal=The Cornell Veterinarian |date=April 1977 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=282–293 |pmid=870289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennel cough is so named because the infection can spread quickly among dogs in the close quarters of a [[kennel]] or [[animal shelter]].

Viral and bacterial causes of canine cough are [[droplet-borne infection|spread through airborne droplets]] produced by sneezing and coughing. These agents also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces.  Symptoms begin after a several day incubation period post-exposure,&lt;ref name=Ettinger_1995/&gt; and in most cases will clear up on their own. However, in young puppies or immunocompromised animals, mixed or secondary infections can progress to lower respiratory infections such as [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="Sherding G. 2006" /&gt;

==Symptoms==
The [[incubation period]] is 5–7 days (with a range of 3–10).&lt;ref name="Sherding G. 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherding G.|first1=Robert|title=Saunders Manual of Small Animal Practice|year=2006|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Saint Louis|isbn=9780721604220|pages=151–153|edition=Third|doi=10.1016/B0-72-160422-6/50014-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can include a harsh, dry cough, retching, sneezing, snorting, gagging or vomiting in response to light pressing of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or after excitement or exercise. The presence of a [[fever]] varies from case to case.

===Types===
Although kennel cough is considered to be a multifactorial infection, there are two main forms. The first is more mild and is caused by B. bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus infections, without complications from [[canine distemper]] virus (CDV) or canine [[adenovirus]] (CAV). This form occurs most regularly in autumn, and can be distinguished by symptoms such as a retching cough and vomiting. The second form has a more complex combination of causative organisms including CDV and CAV. It typically occurs in dogs that have not been vaccinated and it is not seasonal. Symptoms are more severe than the first form, and may include [[rhinitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and fever in addition to a hacking cough.&lt;ref name= Thrusfield_1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrusfield|first1= M|last2=Aitken|first2=C|last3=Muirhead|first3=R|title= A Field Investigation of Kennel Cough: Incubation Period and Clinical Signs|journal= Journal of Small Animal Practice|date= 1991|doi=10.1111/j.1748-5827.1991.tb00550.x|volume=32|pages=215–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
Viral infections such as canine [[parainfluenza]] or [[canine coronavirus]] are only spread for roughly 1 week following recovery;&lt;ref name="Sherding G. 2006" /&gt; however, respiratory infections involving ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'' can be transmissible for several weeks longer.&lt;ref name=Bemis_1977/&gt; While there was early evidence to suggest that ''B. bronchiseptica'' could be shed for many months post-infection,&lt;ref name=Bemis_1977/&gt; a more recent report places detectable nasal and pharyngeal levels of ''B. bronchiseptica'' in 45.6% of all clinically healthy dogs.&lt;ref name=Schulz_1997/&gt; This has potentially expanded the vector from currently or recently infected dogs to half the dog population as carriers.  To put the relative levels of shedding bacteria into perspective, a study analyzing the shedding kinetics of ''B. bronchiseptica'' presents the highest levels of bacterial shedding one week post-exposure, with an order of magnitude decrease in shedding observed every week.&lt;ref name=Iemura_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iemura|first1=R|last2=Tsukatani|first2=R|last3=Micallef|first3=MJ|last4=Taneno|first4=A|title=Simultaneous analysis of the nasal shedding kinetics of field and vaccine strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica|journal=The Veterinary Record|date=26 December 2009|volume=165|issue=25|pages=747–751|pmid=20023279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This projection places negligible levels of shedding to be expected 6 weeks post-exposure (or ~5 weeks post-onset of symptoms). Dogs which had been administered intranasal vaccine 4 weeks prior to virulent ''B. bronchiseptica'' challenge displayed little to no bacterial shedding within 3 weeks of exposure to the virulent strain.&lt;ref name=Iemura_2009/&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==
{{See also|DA2PPC Vaccine}}
[[Antibiotic]]s are given to treat any [[bacteria]]l infection present. [[Cough medicine|Cough suppressants]] are used if the cough is not productive. [[NSAID]]s are often given to reduce fever and upper respiratory inflammation. Prevention is by [[vaccination|vaccinating]] for canine [[Adenoviridae#Animals|adenovirus]], [[Canine distemper|distemper]], parainfluenza, and ''[[Bordetella]]''.  In kennels, the best prevention is to keep all the cages disinfected. In some cases, such as "doggie daycares" or nontraditional playcare-type boarding environments, it is usually not a cleaning or disinfecting issue, but rather an airborne issue, as the dogs are in contact with each other's saliva and breath. Although most kennels require proof of vaccination, the vaccination is not a fail-safe preventative. Just like human [[influenza]], even after receiving the vaccination, a dog can still contract mutated strains or less severe cases.

==Vaccines==
To increase their effectiveness, vaccines should be administered as soon as possible after a dog enters a high-risk area, such as a shelter. 10 to 14 days are required for partial immunity to develop.&lt;ref name=edinboro_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edinboro|first1=C|last2=Ward|first2=M|last3=Glickman|first3=L|title=A Placebo-controlled Trial of Two Intranasal Vaccines to Prevent Tracheobronchitis (kennel Cough) in Dogs Entering a Humane Shelter|journal= Preventive Veterinary Medicine|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration of B. bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza vaccines may then be continued routinely, especially during outbreaks of kennel cough. There are several methods of administration, including [[parenteral]] and [[intranasal]].&lt;ref name=thrusfield_1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrusfield|first1=M|last2=Aitken|first2=C|last3=Muirhead|first3=R|title= A Field Investigation of Kennel Cough: Efficacy of Vaccination|journal= Journal of Small Animal Practice|year= 1989|doi=10.1111/j.1748-5827.1989.tb01471.x|volume=30|pages=550–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intranasal method has been recommended when exposure is imminent, due to a more rapid and localized protection. Several intranasal vaccines have been developed that contain canine [[adenovirus]] in addition to B bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza virus antigens. Studies have thus far not been able to determine which formula of vaccination is the most efficient. Adverse effects of vaccinations are mild, but the most common effect observed up to 30 days after administration is nasal discharge.&lt;ref name=edinboro_2004/&gt; Vaccinations are not always effective. In one study it was found that 43.3% of all dogs in the study population with respiratory disease had in fact been vaccinated.&lt;ref name=Shulz_2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulz|first1=B|last2=Kurz|first2=S|last3=Balzer|first3=H|last4=Hartmann|first4=K|title= Detection of Respiratory Viruses and Bordetella Bronchiseptica in Dogs with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections|journal= The Veterinary Journal|date= September 2014|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.04.019|volume=201|pages=365–369|pmid=24980809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
Dogs will typically recover from kennel cough within a few weeks. However, secondary infections could lead to complications that could do more harm than the disease itself.&lt;ref name= Shulz_2014/&gt; Several opportunistic invaders have been recovered from the respiratory tracts of dogs with kennel cough, including [[Streptococcus]], [[Pasteurella]], [[Pseudomonas]], and various [[coliforms]]. These bacteria have the potential to cause pneumonia or [[sepsis]], which drastically increase the severity of the disease. These complications are evident in [[thoracic]] [[radiographic]] examinations. Findings will be mild in animals affected only by kennel cough, while those with complications may have evidence of segmental [[atelectasis]] and other severe side effects.&lt;ref name=Greene_2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greene|first1=Craig E|title=Infectious Diseases in Dogs and Cats|year=2006|location=St Louis|chapter= 6|edition= third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Ouiachic''' (also referred to as the '''Álvaro Obregón Reservoir''') is located in the foothills of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and is created by the [[Álvaro Obregón Dam]]. Lake Ouiachic is fed by and drained by the [[Yaqui River]]. The dam was completed in 1952 with the purpose to regulate water flow of the Yaqui River, prevent floods, and generate electricity. Lake Ouiachic is also an expanding tourist and resort area specializing in [[fishing]], [[boating]], and [[water skiing]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ludwig's angina''' is a type of severe [[cellulitis]] involving the floor of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candamourty R, Venkatachalam S, Babu MR, Kumar GS | title = Ludwig's Angina - An emergency: A case report with literature review | journal = Journal of Natural Science, Biology, and Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 206–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 23225990 | doi = 10.4103/0976-9668.101932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on the floor of the mouth is raised and there is difficulty swallowing saliva, which may run from the person's mouth.&lt;ref name="Coulthard_2013" /&gt; As the condition worsens, the airway may be compromised with hardening of the spaces on both sides of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kremer MJ, Blair T | title = Ludwig angina: forewarned is forearmed | journal = AANA Journal | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 445–51 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17236391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition has a rapid onset over hours.

&lt;!-- Causes --&gt;
The majority of cases follow a [[dental infection]].&lt;ref name="Coulthard_2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/786161764|title=Master dentistry.|last=|first=|date=2013-05-17|publisher=Elsevier |  first1 = Paul | last1 = Coulthard | first2 = Keith | last2 = Horner | first3 = Philip | last3 = Sloan | first4 = Elizabeth D. | last4 = Theaker | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-7020-4600-1 | edition = 3rd | location = Edinburgh | pages = | oclc = 786161764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes include a [[parapharyngeal abscess]], [[mandibular fracture]], cut or piercing inside the mouth, or [[submandibular]] [[sialolithiasis|salivary stones]].&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saifeldeen K, Evans R | title = Ludwig's angina | journal = Emergency Medicine Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–3 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14988363 | doi = 10.1136/emj.2003.012336 | pmc = 1726306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spreading infection of connective tissue through tissue spaces, normally with virulent and invasive organisms. It specifically involves the [[Submandibular space|submandibular]], [[Submental space|submental]], and [[sublingual space]]s.&lt;ref name=Got2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gottlieb |first1=M |last2=Long |first2=B |last3=Koyfman |first3=A |title=Clinical Mimics: An Emergency Medicine-Focused Review of Streptococcal Pharyngitis Mimics. |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=May 2018 |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=619–629 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.01.031 |pmid=29523424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is by appropriate dental care including management of dental infections. Initial treatment is generally with [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] and [[corticosteroids]].&lt;ref name=Got2018/&gt; In more advanced cases [[endotracheal intubation]] or [[tracheostomy]] may be required.&lt;ref name=Got2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
With the advent of antibiotics in 1940s, improved oral and dental hygiene, and more aggressive surgical approach, the rates and risk of death among those infected has significantly reduced.  It is named after a German physician, [[Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig]], who first described this condition in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murphy SC | title = The person behind the eponym: Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig (1790-1865) | journal = Journal of Oral Pathology &amp; Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 513–5 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8959561 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0714.1996.tb00307.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Ludwig's angina is a form of severe diffuse [[cellulitis]] with bilateral involvement, primarily of the submandibular space with the sublingual and submental spaces also being involved. It presents with an acute onset and spreads very rapidly meaning early diagnosis and immediate treatment planning is key to saving lives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Candamourty|first=Ramesh|last2=Venkatachalam|first2=Suresh|last3=Babu|first3=M. R. Ramesh|last4=Kumar|first4=G.

Signs inside the mouth may include elevation of the floor of mouth due to sublingual space involvement and posterior displacement of the tongue, creating the potential for a compromised airway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additional symptoms may include painful neck swelling, tooth pain, [[dysphagia]], shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saifeldeen|first=K.|last2=Evans|first2=R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Ludwig’s angina|url=http://emj.bmj.com/content/21/2/242|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=242–243|doi=10.1136/emj.2003.012336|issn=1472-0205|pmid=14988363|pmc=1726306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stridor, [[trismus]], and [[cyanosis]] may also be seen when an impending airway crisis is nearing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Cause ==
The most prevalent cause of Ludwig's angina is odontogenic,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757994410|title=Current therapy in oral and maxillofacial surgery|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|others=Bagheri, Shahrokh C., Bell, R.

In fact, the same microorganisms responsible for less morbid head and neck infections are found in causing extensive infection throughout the floor of mouth and neck&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when Ludwig's angina is critically reviewed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patient with systemic illness, such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, compromised immune system, and organ transplantation are also commonly predisposed to Ludwig's angina.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is found that one third of the cases of Ludwig's angina are associated with systemic illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A review reporting the incidence of illnesses associated with Ludwig angina found that 18% of cases involved diabetes mellitus, 9% involved acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another 5% were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=Larry W.|date=1988-02-01|title=Ludwig's Angina|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/609468?redirect=true|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=148|issue=2|doi=10.1001/archinte.1988.00380020205027|issn=0003-9926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Infections originating in the roots of teeth can be identified with a [[dental radiography|dental X-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spitalnic SJ, Sucov A | title = Ludwig's angina: case report and review | journal = The Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 499–503 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7594369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2014"&gt;{{cite book | title = Clinical Review of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: A Case-Based Approach | last = Bagheri | first = Shahrokh C | name-list-format = vanc | publisher=Mosby Elsevier | edition = Second | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-323-17127-4 | location = St. Louis | pages = 95–118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A CT scan of the neck with contrast material is used to identify deep neck space infections.&lt;ref name="Crespo_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crespo AN, Chone CT, Fonseca AS, Montenegro MC, Pereira R, Milani JA | title = Clinical versus computed tomography evaluation in the diagnosis and management of deep neck infection | journal = Sao Paulo Medical Journal = Revista Paulista De Medicina | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 259–63 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15692720 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-31802004000600006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is suspicion of the [[mediastinitis|infection of the chest cavity]], a [[Chest radiograph|chest scan]] is sometimes done.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2014" /&gt;

Angioneurotic oedema, [[Carcinoma|lingual carcinoma]] and [[Hematoma|sublingual haematoma]] formation following anticoagulation should be ruled out as possible diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Crespo_2004" /&gt;

=== Microbiology ===
There are a few methods that can be used for determining the microbiology of Ludwig's angina. One of the traditionally used methods is taking [[Microbiological culture|culture samples]] although it has some limitations.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011"&gt;{{cite book | title = Current Therapy in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | vauthors = Bagheri SC, Bell RB, Khan HA | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4160-2527-6 | location = Philadelphia | pages = 1092–1098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siqueira JF, Rôças IN | title = Microbiology and treatment of acute apical abscesses | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 255–73 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23554416 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00082-12 | pmc = 3623375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking pus samples from a patient with Ludwig's angina, the microbiology were found to be commonly polymicrobial and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="Candamourty_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candamourty R, Venkatachalam S, Babu MR, Kumar GS | title = Ludwig's Angina - An emergency: A case report with literature review | journal = Journal of Natural Science, Biology, and Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 206–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 23225990 | pmc = 3510922 | doi = 10.4103/0976-9668.101932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Costain_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costain N, Marrie TJ | title = Ludwig's Angina | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–7 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20961522 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.08.004 | url = http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002934310007424/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the commonly found microbes are [[Viridans streptococci|Viridans Streptococci]], [[Staphylococcus|Staphylococci]], [[Peptostreptococcus|Peptostreptococci]], [[Prevotella]], [[Porphyromonas]] and [[Fusobacterium]].&lt;ref name="Candamourty_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Costain_2011" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
For each patient, the treatment plan should be done with consideration of each of the individual patient's differing factors. They are namely the stage of the disease and co-morbid conditions at the time of presentation, physician experience, available resources, and personnel are critical factors in formulation of a treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shockley WW | title = Ludwig angina: a review of current airway management | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology--Head &amp; Neck Surgery | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 600 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10326825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four principles that guide the treatment of Ludwig's Angina:&lt;ref name = "Chou_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou YK, Lee CY, Chao HH | title = An upper airway obstruction emergency: Ludwig angina | journal = Pediatric Emergency Care | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 892–6 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18091599 | doi = 10.1097/pec.0b013e31815c9d4a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient airway management, early and aggressive antibiotic therapy, incision and drainage for any who fail medical management or form localized abscesses, and adequate nutrition and hydration support. Each will be explained in detail below.

=== Airway management ===
[[File:Endotracheal Tube.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Placement of an endotracheal tube to aid breathing.]]

Airway management has been found to be the most important factor in treating patients with Ludwig's Angina,&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; i.e. it is the “primary therapeutic concern”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreland LW, Corey J, McKenzie R | title = Ludwig's angina. Report of a case and review of the literature | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 148 | issue = 2 | pages = 461–6 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 3277567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Airway compromise is known to be the leading cause of death from Ludwig's Angina.&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004" /&gt;
* The basic method to achieve this is to allow the patient to sit in an upright position, with supplemental oxygen provided by masks or nasal prongs.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; Patients should never be left unattended, particularly if there is an absence of intubation or a surgical airway in place.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* Methods of airway management range from conservative airway management – consisting of close observation and intravenous [[antibiotics]], to airway intervention with [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal]] intubation or [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]].&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* If the oxygen saturation levels are adequate and [[antimicrobial]]s have been given, simple airway observation can be done.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; This is a suitable method to adopt in the management of children, as a retrospective study described that only 10% of children required airway control. However, a tracheostomy was performed on 52% of those affected with Ludwig's Angina over 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurien M, Mathew J, Job A, Zachariah N | title = Ludwig's angina | journal = Clinical Otolaryngology and Allied Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–5 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9222634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Airway control is compulsory if a surgical procedure is required.&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004" /&gt;
** Flexible nasotracheal intubation require skills and experience.&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004" /&gt;
** If nasotracheal intubation is not possible, [[cricothyrotomy]] and [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] under local anaesthetic can be done. This procedure is carried out on patients with advanced stage of Ludwig's Angina.&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004" /&gt;
** Endotracheal intubation has been found to be in association with high failure rate with acute deterioration in respiratory status.&lt;ref name="Saifeldeen_2004" /&gt;
** Elective [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] is described as a safer and more logical method of airway management in patients with fully developed Ludwig's Angina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parhiscar A, Har-El G | title = Deep neck abscess: a retrospective review of 210 cases | journal = The Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology | volume = 110 | issue = 11 | pages = 1051–4 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11713917 | doi = 10.1177/000348940111001111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Fibre-optic nasoendoscopy can also be used, especially for patients with [[Human mouth|floor of mouth]] swellings.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* It is important that incision and drainage are preceded by consulting the [[Anesthesiologist|anaesthesiologist]] about possible airway problems at intubation.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; A tracheostomy set should always be present in the operating room in case there is requirement for local tracheostomy or an emergency [[cricothyrotomy]].&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
* Antibiotic therapy is [[Empirical evidence|empirical]], it is given until [[Antibiotic sensitivity|culture and sensitivity]] results are obtained.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; The empirical therapy should be effective against both [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] species commonly involved in Ludwig's Angina.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; Only when culture and sensitivity results return should therapy be tailored to the specific requirements of the patient.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
** Empirical coverage should consist of either a [[penicillin]] with a [[Β-Lactamase inhibitor|B-lactamase inhibitor]] such as [[amoxicillin]]/[[ticarcillin]] with [[clavulanic acid]] or a [[Beta-lactamase]] resistant antibiotic such as [[cefoxitin]], [[cefuroxime]], imipenem or [[meropenem]].&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; This should be given in combination with a drug effective against anaerobes such as [[clindamycin]] or [[metronidazole]].&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* Parenteral antibiotics are suggested until the patient is no longer [[Fever|febrile]] for at least 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt; Oral therapy can then commence to last for 2 weeks, with [[amoxicillin]] with [[clavulanic acid]], [[clindamycin]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], or [[metronidazole]].&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;

=== Incision and drainage ===
* Surgical [[incision and drainage]] are the main methods in managing severe and complicated deep neck infections that fail to respond to medical management within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* It is indicated in cases of:&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
** Airway compromise
** [[Sepsis|Septicaemia]]
** Deteriorating condition
** Descending infection
** [[Diabetes mellitus]]
** Palpable or radiographic evidence of [[abscess]] formation
* Bilateral [[Submandibular space|submandibular]] incisions should be carried out in addition to a midline [[Submental space|submental]] incision. Access to the supramylohyoid spaces can be gained by [[blunt dissection]] through the [[Mylohyoid muscle|mylohyoid]] muscle from below.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* [[Penrose drain]]s are recommended in both supramylohyoid and inframylohyoid spaces bilaterally. In addition, through and through drains from the [[Submandibular space|submandibular]] space to the [[Submental space|submental]] space on both sides should be placed as well.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* The [[incision and drainage]] process is completed with the [[debridement]] of [[Necrosis|necrotic tissue]] and thorough irrigation.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* It is necessary to mark drains in order to identify their location. They should be [[Surgical suture|sutured]] with loops as well so it will be possible to advance them without re-anaesthetizing the patient while drains are re-sutured to the skin.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;
* An absorbent [[Dressing (medical)|dressing]] is then applied. A bandnet dressing retainer can be constructed so as to prevent the use of tape.&lt;ref name="Bagheri_2011" /&gt;

=== Nutritional support ===
Adequate nutrition and hydration support is essential in deciding the outcomes in any patient following surgery, particularly young children.&lt;ref name = "Chou_2007" /&gt; In this case, pain and swelling in the neck region would usually cause difficulties in eating or swallowing, hence reducing patient's food and fluid intake. As a result, patients suffer from weight loss due to loss of fat, muscle and skin initially, followed by bone and internal organs in the late phase. Meanwhile, at the cellular level, the cells would be less able to maintain homeostasis in the presence of stressors such as infection and surgery. Patients must therefore be well-nourished and hydrated to promote wound healing and to fight off infection.&lt;ref name = "Bagheri_2012"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Shahrokh C. | last1 = Bagheri | first2 = R. Bryan | last2 = Bell | first3 = Husain Ali | last3 = Khan | name-list-format = vanc | title = Current Therapy in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | date = 2012 | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | isbn = 978-1-4160-2527-6 | location = Philadelphia | oclc = 757994410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-operative care ===
[[Extubation]], which is the removal of endotracheal tube to liberate the patient from mechanical ventilation, should only be done when the patient's airway is proved to be patent, allowing adequate breathing. This is indicated by a decrease in swelling and patient's capability of breathing adequately around an uncuffed [[endotracheal tube]] with the lumen blocked.&lt;ref name = "Bagheri_2012" /&gt;

During the hospital stay, patient's condition will be closely monitored by:
* carrying out cultures and sensitivity tests to decide if any changes need to be made to patient's antibiotic course
* observing patient's body temperature - a rise implies further infection
* monitoring patient's [[white blood cell]] count - a decrease implies effective and sufficient drainage
* repeating [[CT scan]]s to prove patient's restored health status or if infection extends, the anatomical areas that are affected.&lt;ref name = "Bagheri_2012" /&gt;
Moreover, it is advised to never leave young children with significant neck swelling unattended and they should always be seated to prevent suffocation.&lt;ref name = "Chou_2007" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term “angina”, is derived from the Latin word “''angere''”, which means “choke”; and the Greek word “''ankhone''”, which means “strangle”. Placing it into context, Ludwig's angina refers to the feeling of strangling and choking, secondary to obstruction of the airway, which is the most serious potential complication of this condition.&lt;ref name="Costain_2011"/&gt;

'''Macroorchidism''' is a disorder found in males where a subject has abnormally large [[testes]]. The condition is commonly [[genetics|inherited]] in connection with [[fragile X syndrome]], which is also the second most common genetic cause of [[mental disabilities]]. The opposite side of the spectrum is called [[microorchidism]], which is the condition of abnormally small testes.

Other possible causes of macroorchidism are long-standing primary [[hypothyroidism]], [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] remnants in [[congenital]] [[adrenal hyperplasia]], [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH)-secreting [[pituitary]] [[macroadenoma]]s, local [[tumor]]s, [[lymphomas]], or [[aromatase]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1695-4033(06)70015-7 |title=Macroorquidismo: A propósito de un caso |trans-title=Macroorchidism: a case report |language=Spanish |year=2006 |last1=Álvarez-Acevedo García |first1=M. |last2=Molina Rodríguez |first2=M.aA. |last3=González Casado |first3=I. |last4=Nistal Martín De Serrano |first4=M. |last5=Gracia Bouthelier |first5=R. |journal=Anales de Pediatría |volume=64 |pages=89–92 |pmid=16539923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{masculism sidebar}}
'''Masculism''' or '''masculinism''' may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of [[Man|men]] and [[boy]]s; and the adherence to or promotion of attributes (opinions, values, attitudes, habits) regarded as typical of men and boys.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ferrell|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''|title=Man Troubles: Making Sense of the Men's Movement|author=[[Cathy Young]]|date=July 1994|url=http://reason.com/archives/1994/07/01/man-troubles|quote=Masculism (mas'kye liz*'em), n. 1. the belief that equality between the sexes requires the recognition and redress of prejudice and discrimination against men as well as women. 2. the movement organized around this belief. References Warren Farrell, Jack Kammer, and others activists in the men's movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition and scope==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) defines ''masculism'', or synonymously ''masculinism'', as the "advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=masculism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculism, n. †1. The possession of masculine physical traits by a woman. Obs. rare. 2. = masculinism n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oedMasculinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculinism, n. Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates "masculism" from "masculinism", defining the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; 
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes the two terms, with masculism expressing the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme ": une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = “Masculinism”: a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |url =https://doi.org/10.7202/039213ar |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures reducing sexism against women have increased it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in his book ''The Failure of Feminism'', describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism": "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;Christensen, Ferrell (2005), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WbkSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA562 Masculism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Honderich | editor-first = Ted | title = The Oxford companion to philosophy |pages=562&amp;ndash;563 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9780199264797 }}

[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, have come to examine oppression in a masculist society also from the perspectives of men, many of whom are also subjected by that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;Hoogensen, Gunhild; Solheim, Bruce Olav (2006), "[https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21 Women in theory and practice]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Hoogensen | editor-first1 = Gunhild | editor-last2 = Solheim | editor-first2 = Bruce Olav |title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|year=2006|page=21|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275981907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

==Topic areas of interest==
{{main|Men's rights movement}}

===Education and employment===
Many masculists oppose co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools better promote the well-being of boys.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"&gt;
{{cite journal | last1 = Blais | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Dupuis-Déri | first2 = Francis | title = Masculinism and the antifeminist countermovement | journal = [[Social Movement Studies|Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 21&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | date = 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.640532 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other masculists and [[Equity feminism|equity feminists]] say that boys lag behind girls in educational achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sommers |first1=Christina | author-link = Christina Hoff Sommers|title=The war against boys|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/|work= [[The Atlantic]] | date = May 2000 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Masculist [[Warren Farrell]] has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===
{{Violence against men}}
{{See also|Violence against men}}

Masculists cite higher rates of suicide in men than women.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Masculists express concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrell | first = Warren | author-link = Warren Farrell | title = [[The Myth of Male Power|The myth of male power: why men are the disposable sex]] | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780425181447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also express concern about violence against men being ignored or minimized in comparison to violence against women,&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mvulane | first = Zama | title = Do men suffer spousal abuse? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221033948/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | archive-date = February 21, 2009 | url = http://www.iol.co.za:80/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | work = [[Cape Times]] | via = [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] | location = South Africa | page = 12 | date = November 25, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; some asserting gender symmetry in [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Another of their concerns is that traditional assumptions of female innocence or sympathy for women, termed [[benevolent sexism]], may lead to unequal penalties for women and men who commit similar crimes,&lt;ref name="MYTH" /&gt; to lack of sympathy for male victims in [[domestic violence]] cases, and to dismissal of female-on-male [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual harassment]] cases.

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
According to [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], "Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more likely in most parts of the world for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. He argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title = Just who are men's rights activists? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 | work = [[BBC News Online#Features|BBC News Magazine]] | date = May 2, 2012 | access-date = May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South African masculist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has seen a resurgence of masculist Christian evangelical groups, led by two complementary men's and women's movements, the Mighty Men movement and the Worthy Women movement.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 141&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Project MUSE]] | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of Muscular Christianity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Muscular Christianity in contemporary South Africa: The case of the Mighty Men Conference | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;9 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = July 2015 | url = https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/2945/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement does not lead discussions about institutionalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Race, whiteness and transformation in the Promise Keepers America and the Mighty Men Conference: A comparative analysis | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2016 | url = http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/3476/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars argue that the movement's lack of attention to women's rights and their historical struggle with racial equality makes it a threat to women and to the stability of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholar Miranda Pillay argues that the Mighty Men movement appeal lies in its resistance to gender equality as incompatible with Christian values, and in raising patriarchy to a "hyper-normative status," beyond challenge by other claims to power.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, Miranda (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is a women's auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader is Gretha Wiid. She blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to their men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 A movement seeking to embody support of patriarchal structures and patterns in church and society: Gertha Wiid's Worthy Women movement]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 86&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her success is attributed to her balancing claims that God created the gender hierarchy, but that women are no less valuable than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nortjé-Meyer | first = Lilly | title = A critical analysis of Gretha Wiid’s sex ideology and her biblical hermeneutics | journal = Verbum et Ecclesia | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2011 | url = http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/472/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoration of traditional gender roles relieves existential anxiety in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"/&gt;

Some masculinists have been described as explicitly antifeminist by feminist activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, "the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Some masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father's rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in "tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women's shelters and women's centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Janet M. | last2 = Borrelli | first2 = Maryanne | title = The other elites: Women, politics, and power in the Executive Branch | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781555879716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

The '''National University Health System (NUHS)''' (Chinese: 国立大学医学组织 ; pinyin: guŏ lì dà xue yī xue zǔ zhī; Malay: Sistem Kesihatan Universiti Kebangsaan) is an [[academic health science center]] located in [[Singapore]]. It was established in January 2008 as a joint venture between the [[National University of Singapore]] and Singapore's MOH Holdings Pte Ltd. NUHS groups the [[National University Hospital]] (NUH) with the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health under a common governance structure in order to develop and promote academic medicine.

The NUHS focuses on combining medical education and training with extensive research to deliver research-proven clinical care to patients. In line with the collaborative focus of the NUHS, students from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health work alongside senior healthcare professionals from the NUH to develop their skills under close supervision and mentorship. Academic research carried out in the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health also directly drives healthcare practices in the NUH.

The NUHS also has oversight over 3 national specialty centres, which are the National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS), the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) and the National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore (in 2019).

In 2017, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reorganised the public healthcare system into three integrated clusters to better meet Singaporeans’ future healthcare needs, with National University Health System (NUHS) and Jurong Health Services merged.  The [[Ng Teng Fong General Hospital]] (NTFGH), [[Jurong Community Hospital]] (JCH) and Jurong Medical Centre (JCM) were integrated under NUHS. The polyclinics were reorganised, in line with the three new clusters. A new polyclinic group called the National University Polyclinics group is formed and managed by NUHS.

==History==
The idea of a common governance structure first came about when Health Minister [[Khaw Boon Wan]] headed the National University Hospital. However, the idea was only revived some 20 years later after the Biomedical Sciences International Advisory Panel recommended that Singapore develop one or two strong academic medical centres to advance translational and clinical research. On 23 January 2008, the NUHS was incorporated.

==Location==
The corporate office of the NUHS is currently located at 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Singapore 119228.

==Components==
The NUHS consists of four main components:
*The National University of Singapore (NUS) [[Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine]] was the first academic body in Singapore's history dedicated to tertiary education. It was first established on 3 July 1905 (Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicine.nus.edu.sg/corporate/aboutus/abtus-history.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415134126/http://medicine.nus.edu.sg/corporate/aboutus/abtus-history.aspx |date=April 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is the oldest medical school in Singapore. In 2007, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for Life Sciences and Biomedicine placed NUS in 12th place.  It was named the top university in Asia for medicine and was placed 18th globally in a new set of university rankings for medicine released on 4 May 2011 by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).
*The NUS [[National University of Singapore#Dentistry|Faculty of Dentistry]] focuses on teaching, research, and practice of dentistry. The Faculty has three main departments: Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Preventive Dentistry and Restorative Dentistry. The faculty began as Department of Dentistry within the King Edward VII College of Medicine in 1929. It was the first dental school to be established in a British colony in the east. In October 1949, King Edward VII College of Medicine amalgamated with Raffles College to form the University of Malaya. King Edward VII College of Medicine then became the Faculty of Medicine. On 31 August 1966, the Department of Dentistry attained Faculty status.
*The NUS [[National University of Singapore#Public Health|Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health]] was established in October 2011.  It builds upon 60 years of experience in research, teaching and practice as a Department of Epidemiology and Public Health.  Moving beyond the traditional domains of chronic disease aetiology and risk factors, the School emphasizes new technologies and methods to measure and monitor exposure and disease, as well as new approaches to develop and implement public health programmes and policies.  With a distinctly Asian focus, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health's existing strengths include chronic disease epidemiology, statistical genomics and workplace health as well as a well-developed Master of Public Health programme.
*The [[National University Hospital]] (NUH) is a specialist hospital and the principal teaching hospital of the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.

In 2004, NUH became the first Singapore hospital to receive Joint Commission International (JCI) Accreditation, an international stamp for excellent clinical practices in patient care and safety. It was also the first hospital in Singapore to receive a triple ISO certification concurrently for Quality, Environmental, and Occupational Health &amp; Safety Management Systems in 2002

==Other institutions==
In addition to the National University Hospital and the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, the NUHS also has oversight of a few specialized medical institutions.  The National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS), is a key centre for the treatment and management of complex cardiovascular diseases with focus areas on [[heart failure]], congenital heart disease, acute coronary syndrome and vascular disease.  The National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, (NCIS) offers a broad spectrum of cancer care and management that ranges from public education, screening and early diagnosis, to treatment and long-term health maintenance.  The Khoo Teck Puat Advanced Surgery Training Centre (ASTC) is the first one-stop training centre in Southeast Asia to equip surgeons from the region, the Middle East, and Europe, with the latest skills.

In 2017, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reorganised the public healthcare system into three integrated clusters to better meet Singaporeans’ future healthcare needs, with National University Health System (NUHS) and Jurong Health Services (JurongHealth) merged.  The Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH), Jurong Community Hospital (JCH) and Jurong Medical Centre (JCM). The polyclinics were reorganised, in line with the three new clusters.  The National University Polyclinics group is formed under NUHS.


 The NUHS provides more than 25 medical specialties, including 6 dental specialties. They include:

* [[Anaesthesia]]
* [[Cardiology]]
* [[Cardiac Surgery]], [[Thoracic Surgery]] &amp; [[Vascular Surgery]]
* [[Diagnostic Imaging]]
* [[Emergency Medicine]]

'''Research''': The NUHS' research focus includes [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]], [[neurocognition]] and [[infectious diseases]]. In 2008, an NUHS research team discovered RUNX3, a gatekeeper gene which prevents the uncontrolled growth of cells leading to colorectal cancers.&lt;ref name="hs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/120907.php |title=Early Stage Colon Cancer Characterized By Inactivation Of Gatekeeper Gene, Singapore Scientists Report In Journal Cancer Cell |work=Medical News Today |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorectal cancer is ranked as the No. 1 killer in Singapore.

'''Education''': One of the main aims of the NUHS is to provide education for Singapore's medical students. The NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine currently offers two full-time undergraduate programmes, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B., B.S) and Bachelor of Science (Nursing), which is conducted by the Alice Lee School of Nursing Studies.

In line with its mission to combine education with research, NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine students are able to conduct undergraduate research under the supervision of the School's staff. This is done through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme.

The NUHS depends heavily on external funding for most of its research projects. To date, the NUHS has won several major research grants, including the S$25m Translational and Clinical Research Flagship programmes on the study of gastric cancer as well as metabolic diseases (diabetes and obesity). The grants are funded by the National Research Foundation.

==Corporate management==
Since its incorporation, the NUHS was headed by Professor Tan Chorh Chuan as Chief Executive. In December 2008, neurologist and academic Associate Professor Benjamin Ong took the helm and succeeded Professor Tan in view of the latter's appointment as President of the National University of Singapore. Internationally renowned medical oncologist and academic Professor John Wong Eu Li took on the appointment of Deputy Chief Executive of the NUHS.[4]

After five years at the helm, Associate Professor Benjamin Ong stepped down as Chief Executive in January 2014 and was appointed Director of Medical Services at the Ministry of Health.Taking over from him as the new Chief Executive of the NUHS was its current Deputy Chief Executive, Professor John Wong Eu Li.

With the integration of public healthcare cluster in 2017, Professor John Wong Eu Li is the Group CEO, NUHS.

[[File:Northern Spotted Owl.USFWS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Owl]]s are well known for being nocturnal, but some owls are active during the day.]]
'''Nocturnality''' is an [[ethology|animal behavior]] characterized by being active during the night and sleeping during the day. The common adjective is "'''nocturnal'''", versus [[diurnality|diurnal]] meaning the opposite.

Nocturnal creatures generally have highly developed senses of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[olfaction|smell]], and specially adapted [[eyesight]]. Such traits can help animals such as the ''[[Helicoverpa zea]]'' moths avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agee | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Orona | first2 = E. | year = 1988 | title = Studies of the neural basis of evasive flight behavior in response to acoustic stimulation in Heliothis zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae): organization of the tympanic nerves | url = | journal = Annals of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 977–985 | doi=10.1093/aesa/81.6.977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animals, such as [[cat]]s and [[ferret]]s, have eyes that can adapt to both low-level and bright day levels of illumination (see [[metaturnal]]). Others, such as [[bushbaby|bushbabies]] and (some) [[bat]]s, can function only at night. Many nocturnal creatures including [[tarsiers]] and some [[owls]] have large eyes in comparison with their body size to compensate for the lower light levels at night. More specifically, they have been found to have a larger [[cornea]] relative to their eye size than diurnal creatures to increase their {{Noredirect|Contrast (vision)|visual sensitivity}}: in the low-light conditions.&lt;ref name=HallEtAl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall |first=M. I. |last2=Kamilar |first2=J. M. |last3=Kirk |first3=E. C. |year=2012 |title=Eye shape and the nocturnal bottleneck of mammals |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=279 |number=1749 |pages=4962–4968 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2258 |pmid=23097513 |pmc=3497252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality helps [[wasps]], such as ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'', avoid hunting in intense sunlight.

[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] animals, including [[squirrel]]s and songbirds, are active during the daytime. [[Crepuscular]] species, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[hyena]]s, are often erroneously referred to as nocturnal. [[Cathemeral]] species, such as [[Eupleridae|fossa]]s and [[lion]]s, are active both in the day and at night.

While most [[human]]s are diurnal, for various personal and social/cultural reasons some people are temporarily or habitually [[night owl (person)|nocturnal]].

The most known creatures to be nocturnal include [[cat]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[owl]]s, which all have heightened senses (including their sense of sight).

==Origins==
[[File:Kiwi bird in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2002-01-01.jpg|thumb|The Kiwi is a family of nocturnal birds endemic to New Zealand.]]
While it is difficult to say which came first, nocturnality or diurnality, there is a leading hypothesis out in the evolutionary biology community. Known as the "bottleneck theory", it postulates that millions of years ago in the Mesozoic era, many ancestors of modern-day mammals evolved nocturnal characteristics in order to avoid contact with the numerous diurnal predators. A recent study attempts to answer the question as to why so many modern day mammals retain these nocturnal characteristics even though they are not active at night. The leading answer is that the high visual acuity that comes with diurnal characteristics isn't needed anymore due to the evolution of compensatory sensory systems, such as a heightened sense of smell and more astute auditory systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Christopher R.|last2=Clarke|first2=Julia A.|date=2018-11-07|title=Nocturnal giants: evolution of the sensory ecology in elephant birds and other palaeognaths inferred from digital brain reconstructions|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1890/20181540|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=285|issue=1890|pages=20181540|doi=10.1098/rspb.2018.1540|issn=0962-8452|pmid=30381378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a recent study, recently extinct [[Elephant bird|elephant birds]] and modern day nocturnal kiwi bird skulls were examined to recreate their likely brain and skull formation. They indicated that olfactory bulbs were much larger in comparison to their optic lobes, indicating they both have a common ancestor who evolved to function as a nocturnal species, decreasing their eyesight in favor of a better sense of smell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The anomaly to this theory were [[Simian|anthropoids]], who appeared to have the most divergence from nocturnality than all organisms examined. While most mammals didn't exhibit the morphological characteristics expected of a nocturnal creature, reptiles and birds fit in perfectly. A larger cornea and pupil correlated well with whether these two classes of organisms were nocturnal or not.&lt;ref name="HallEtAl" /&gt;

==Survival Adaptations==

===Resource competition===
Being active at night is a form of [[niche differentiation]], where a species' niche is partitioned not by the amount of resources but by the amount of time (i.e. temporal division of the [[ecological niche]]). [[Hawk]]s and [[owl]]s can hunt the same field or meadow for the same rodents without conflict because hawks are diurnal and owls are nocturnal. This means they are not in competition for each other's prey.

===Predation===
[[File:Bat flying at night.png|thumb|Echolocating bats adjust their vocalizations to catch insects against a changing environmental background.]]
Nocturnality is a form of [[crypsis]], an adaptation to avoid or enhance [[predation]]. One of the reasons that (cathemeral) [[lion]]s prefer to hunt at night is that many of their prey species ([[zebra]], [[antelope]], impala, [[wildebeest]], etc.) have poor night vision. Many species of small rodents, such as the [[Large Japanese field mouse|Large Japanese Field Mouse]], are active at night because most of the dozen or so [[birds of prey]] that hunt them are diurnal. There are many diurnal species that exhibit some nocturnal behaviors. For example, many [[seabird]]s and [[sea turtle]]s only gather at breeding sites or colonies at night to reduce the risk of predation to themselves and/or their offspring.Nocturnal species take advantage of the night time to prey on species that are used to avoiding diurnal predators. Some nocturnal fish species will use the moonlight to prey on zooplankton species that come to the surface at night.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longcore|first=Travis|last2=Rich|first2=Catherine|date=May 2004|title=Ecological light pollution|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002%5B0191:ELP%5D2.0.CO;2|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=191–198|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0191:elp]2.0.co;2|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species have developed unique adaptations that allow them to hunt in the dark. Bats are famous for using [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to hunt down their prey, using sonar sounds to capture them in the dark.  

===Water conservation===

Another reason for nocturnality is avoiding the heat of the day. This is especially true in [[arid]] [[biome]]s like [[desert]]s, where nocturnal behavior prevents creatures from losing precious water during the hot, dry daytime. This is an [[adaptation]] that enhances [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;N.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Campbell (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings New York. {{ISBN|0-8053-1957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons that ([[cathemeral]]) lions prefer to hunt at night is to conserve water.

Many plant species native to arid biomes have adapted so that their flowers only open at night when the sun's intense heat cannot wither and destroy their moist, delicate blossoms. These flowers are [[pollinate]]d by bats, another creature of the night.

Climate-change and the change in global temperatures has led to an increasing amount of diurnal species to push their activity patterns closer towards crepuscular or fully nocturnal behavior. This adaptive measure allows species to avoid the heat of the day, without having to leave that particular habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Ofir|last2=Dayan|first2=Tamar|last3=Porter|first3=Warren P.|last4=Kronfeld-Schor|first4=Noga|date=2018-11-12|title=Time and ecological resilience: can diurnal animals compensate for climate change by shifting to nocturnal activity?|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecm.1334|journal=Ecological Monographs|language=en|doi=10.1002/ecm.1334|issn=0012-9615}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Human Disturbances ==
The exponential increase in human expansion and technological advances in the last few centuries has had a major effect on nocturnal animals, as well as diurnal species. The causes of these can be traced to distinct, sometimes overlapping areas: [[light pollution]] and spatial disturbance.

=== Light Pollution ===
[[File:Light Pollution (5346483205).jpg|thumb|Light pollution on a ski slope in Finland gives the area a hazy, brightened sky.]]
Light pollution is a major issue for nocturnal species, and the impact continues to increase as electricity reaches parts of the world that previously had no access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaston|first=Kevin J.|last2=Davies|first2=Thomas W.|last3=Bennie|first3=Jonathan|last4=Hopkins|first4=John|date=2012-11-02|title=REVIEW: Reducing the ecological consequences of night-time light pollution: options and developments|url=https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02212.x|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1256–1266|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02212.x|issn=0021-8901|pmc=3546378|pmid=23335816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species in the tropics are generally more affected by this due to the change in their relatively constant light patterns, but temperate species relying on day-night triggers for behavioral patterns are also affected as well. Many diurnal species see the benefit of a "longer day", allowing for a longer hunting period, which in turn negatively their nocturnal prey trying to avoid them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Orientation ====
Light pollution can disorient species that are used to darkness, as their adaptive eyes are not as used to the artificial lighting. Insects are the most obvious example, who are attracted by the lighting and are usually killed by either the heat or electrical current.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild|last=Witherington|first=B.E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=|editor-last=Clemmons, J.R. and Buchholz, R.|location=Cambridge|pages=303-328|chapter=The problem of photopollution for sea turtles and other nocturnal animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of frogs are blinded by the quick changes in light, while nocturnal migratory birds may be disoriented, causing them to lose direction, tire out, or be captured by predators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sea turtles are particularly affected by this, adding to a number of threats to the different endangered species. Adults are likely to stay away from artificially lit beaches that they might prefer to lay eggs on, as there is less cover against predators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, baby sea turtles that hatch from eggs on artificially lit beaches often get lost, heading towards the light sources as opposed to the ocean.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Rhythmic Behaviors ====
Rhythmic behaviors are affected by light pollution both seasonally and daily patterns. Migrating birds or mammals might have issues with the timing of their movement for example.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On a day-to-day basis, species can see significant changes in their internal temperatures, their general movement, feeding, and body mass.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaynor|first=Kaitlyn M.|last2=Hojnowski|first2=Cheryl E.|last3=Carter|first3=Neil H.|last4=Brashares|first4=Justin S.|date=2018-06-15|title=The influence of human disturbance on wildlife nocturnality|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6394/1232|journal=Science|language=en|volume=360|issue=6394|pages=1232–1235|doi=10.1126/science.aar7121|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29903973}}&lt;/ref&gt; These small scale changes can eventually lead to a population decline, as well as hurting local trophic levels and interconnecting species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some typically diurnal species have even become crepuscular or nocturnal as a result of light pollution and general human disturbance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Reproduction ====
There have been documented effects of light pollution on reproductive cycles and factors in different species. It can affect mate choice, migration to breeding grounds, and nest site selection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In male [[Northern green frog|green frogs]], artificial light causes a decrease in mate calls, and continued to move around instead of waiting for a potential mate to arrive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=B.J.|last2=Richardson|first2=J.M.L.|date=October 2006|title=The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, Rana clamitans melanota|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/z06-142|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=84|issue=10|pages=1528–1532|doi=10.1139/z06-142|issn=0008-4301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hurts the overall [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the species, which is concerning considering the overall decrease in [[amphibian]] populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Predation'''

Some nocturnal predator-prey relationships are interrupted by artificial lighting. Bats that that are fast-moving are often at an advantage with insects being drawn to light; they are fast enough to escape any predators also attracted to the light, leaving slow-moving bats at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another example is [[Harbor seal|harbor seals]] eating juvenile [[salmon]] that moved down a river lit by nearby artificial lighting. Once the lights were turned off, predation levels decreased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many diurnal prey species forced into being nocturnal are susceptible to nocturnal predators, and those species with poor nocturnal eyesight often bear the brunt of the cost.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Spatial Disturbance ===
The increasing amount of habitat destruction worldwide as a result of human expansion has given both advantages and disadvantages to different nocturnal animals. As a result of peak human activity in the daytime, more species are likely to be active at night in order to avoid the new disturbance in their habitat.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Yonghua|last2=Wang|first2=Haifeng|last3=Wang|first3=Haitao|last4=Feng|first4=Jiang|date=2018-01-29|title=Arms race of temporal partitioning between carnivorous and herbivorous mammals|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20098-6|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-20098-6|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnivorous predators however are less timid of the disturbance, feeding on human waste and keeping a relatively similar spatial habitat as the did before.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In comparison, herbivorous prey tend to stay in areas where human disturbance is low, limiting both resources and their spatial habitat. This leads to an imbalance in favor of predators, who increase in population and come out more often at night.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==In Captivity==

===Zoos===
In [[zoo]]s, nocturnal animals are usually kept in special night-illumination enclosures to invert their normal [[sleep-wake cycle]] and to keep them active during the hours when visitors will be there to see them.

===Pets===
[[Image:European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus).jpg|thumb|Hedgehogs are mostly nocturnal.]]
[[Hedgehog]]s and [[sugar glider]]s are just two of the many nocturnal species kept as ([[exotic pets|exotic]]) pets. Cats have adapted to domestication so that each individual, whether stray alley cat or pampered housecat, can change their activity level at will, becoming nocturnal or [[diurnality|diurnal]] in response to their environment or the routine of their owners. Cats normally demonstrate [[crepuscular]] behavior, bordering nocturnal, being most active in hunting and exploration at dusk and dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nocturnal Activity in Cats|url=http://www.vcahospitals.com/main/pet-health-information/article/animal-health/nocturnal-activity-in-cats/212|publisher=VCA Antech|accessdate=7 October 2012|author=Debra Horwitz |author2=Gary Landsberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6785">[[Image:Plant Disease Triangle.png|thumb|200 px|The plant disease triangle represents the factors necessary for disease to occur]]
'''Plant disease forecasting''' is a management system used to predict the occurrence or change in severity of [[phytopathology|plant diseases]].  At the field scale, these systems are used by growers to make economic decisions about disease treatments for control.  Often the systems ask the grower a series of questions about the susceptibility of the [[host (biology)|host crop]], and incorporate current and forecast [[weather]] conditions to make a recommendation.  Typically a recommendation is made about whether disease treatment is necessary or not.  Usually treatment is a [[pesticide]] application.

Forecasting systems are based on assumptions about the pathogen's interactions with the host and environment, the [[Plant disease epidemiology|disease triangle]].&lt;ref name="Agrios"&gt;{{cite book| last =Agrios | first =George | authorlink = | title =Plant Pathology | publisher =Academic Press | date =2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-12-044565-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to accurately predict when the three factors – host, environment, and pathogen – all interact in such a fashion that disease can occur and cause economic losses.

In most cases the host can be suitably defined as [[Gene-for-gene relationship|resistant]] or susceptible, and the presence of the pathogen may often be reasonably ascertained based on previous cropping history or perhaps survey data.  The environment is usually the factor that controls whether disease develops or not.  Environmental conditions may determine the presence of the pathogen in a particular season through their effects on processes such as [[overwintering]].  Environmental conditions also affect the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, e.g. a minimum [[leaf wetness]] duration is required for [[grey leaf spot]] of corn to occur.  In these cases a disease forecasting system attempts to define when the environment will be conducive to disease development.  

Good disease forecasting systems must be reliable, simple, cost-effective and applicable to many diseases. As such they are normally only designed for diseases that are irregular enough to warrant a prediction system, rather than diseases that occur every year for which regular treatment should be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Campbell | first =C.

Polycyclic epidemics such as [[Phytophthora infestans|potato late blight]] are usually best modelled by using the logistic model, whereas monocyclic epidemics may be best modelled using the monomolecular model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Madden | first =Laurence | authorlink = |author2=Gareth Hughes |author3=Frank Van Den Bosch  | title =Study of Plant Disease Epidemics | publisher =American Phytopathological Society | date =2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-89054-354-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correct choice of a model is essential for a disease forecasting system to be useful.

Plant disease forecasting models must be thoroughly tested and validated after being developed.  Interest has arisen lately in [[model validation]] through the quantification of the economic costs of [[false positives]] and [[false negatives]], where disease prevention measures may be used when unnecessary or not applied when needed respectively.&lt;ref name="Esker" /&gt;  The costs of these two types of errors need to be weighed carefully before deciding to use a disease forecasting system.

== Future developments ==

In the future, disease forecasting systems may become more useful as computing power increases and the amount of data that is available to plant pathologists to construct models increases. Good forecasting systems also may become increasingly important with [[climate change]].  It will be important to be able to accurately predict where disease outbreaks may occur, since they may not be in the historically known areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13355">'''Precision medicine''' ('''PM''') is a [[medical]] model that proposes the customization of [[healthcare]], with medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products being tailored to the individual patient. In this model, diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the context of a patient’s genetic content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Y.-F.|last2=Goldstein|first2=D. B.|last3=Angrist|first3=M.|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G.|title=Personalized Medicine and Human Genetic Diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581–a008581|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmid=25059740|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other molecular or cellular analysis. Tools employed in precision medicine can include [[molecular diagnostics]], imaging, and analytics.&lt;ref name="timmerman2013" /&gt;

==Relationship to personalized medicine==
In explaining the distinction from a similar common term of [[personalized medicine]], the National Research Council explains: {{quote|Precision Medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. It does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not. Although the term 'personalized medicine' is also used to convey this meaning, that term is sometimes misinterpreted as implying that unique treatments can be designed for each individual.&lt;ref name="timmerman2013" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, use of the term "precision medicine" as well can extend beyond treatment selection to also cover creating unique medical products for particular individuals—for example, "...patient-specific tissue or organs to tailor treatments for different people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/brandpublishing/localplus/ucsandiego/la-ss-ucsd2015-3dbioprinting-dto-story.html|title=Changing medicine with 3-D bioprinting, where organs can be synthesized by technology|author=LAT Brand Publishing|date=23 February 2015|work=LATimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the term in practice has so much overlap with "personalized medicine" that they are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-of-one.com/about/what-is-precision-medicine.php|title=N-of-One: Tailored Clinical Molecular Test Interpretation|work=n-of-one.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==
Precision medicine often involves the application of [[Panomics|panomic analysis]] and [[systems biology]] to analyze the cause of an individual patient's disease at the molecular level and then to utilize [[Targeted therapy|targeted treatments]] (possibly in combination) to address that individual patient's disease process. The patient's response is then tracked as closely as possible, often using surrogate measures such as tumor load (v. true outcomes, such as 5 year survival rate), and the treatment finely adapted to the patient's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blau, CA, Liakopoulou, E |title=Can we deconstruct cancer, one patient at a time? |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=6–10 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2012.09.004 |pmid=23102584 |pmc=4221262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of precision medicine that addresses cancer is referred to as "precision oncology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Levi A. |last1=Garraway |first2=Jaap |last2=Verweij |first3=Karla V. |last3=Ballman |title=Precision Oncology: An Overview |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=31 |issue=15 |pages=1803–1805 |year=2013 |doi=10.1200/jco.2013.49.4799}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeff |last1=Shrager |first2=Marty |last2=Tenenbaum |author2link=Marty Tenenbaum|title=Rapid Learning for Precision Oncology | year=2014 |journal=Nat Rev Clin Oncol |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=109–118 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-personal difference of [[molecular pathology]] is diverse, so as inter-personal difference in the [[exposome]], which influence disease processes through the [[interactome]] within the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]], differentially from person to person. As the theoretical basis of precision medicine, the "unique disease principle"&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged to embrace the ubiquitous [[phenomenon]] of [[heterogeneity]] of [[disease]] [[etiology]] and [[pathogenesis]]. The unique disease principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as the unique tumor principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. How many molecular subtypes? Implications of the unique tumor principle in personalized medicine. Expert Rev Mol Diagn 2012; 12: 621-628.&lt;/ref&gt; As the exposome is a common [[concept]] of [[epidemiology]], precision medicine is intertwined with [[molecular pathological epidemiology]], which is capable of identifying potential [[biomarkers]] for precision medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Giovannucci E, Meyerhardt JA, Fuchs CS, Chan AT. Discovery of colorectal cancer PIK3CA mutation as potential predictive biomarker: power and promise of molecular pathological epidemiology. Oncogene advance online publication 24 June 2013; {{DOI|10.1038/onc.2013.244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
The ability to provide precision medicine to patients in routine clinical settings depends on the availability of molecular profiling tests, e.g. individual [[germline]] [[DNA]] sequencing. While precision medicine currently individualizes treatment mainly on the basis of genomic tests (e.g. Oncotype DX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/oncotype_dx|title=Oncotype DX: Genomic Test to Inform Breast Cancer Treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), several promising technology modalities are being developed, from techniques combining spectrometry and computational power to real-time imaging of drug effects in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Precision Medicine: Harnessing the Extraordinary Growth in Medical Data for Personalized Diagnosis and Treatment  http://claudiacopeland.com/uploads/3/6/1/4/3614974/hjno_novdec_2016_precision_medicine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many different aspects of precision medicine are tested in research settings (e.g., proteome, microbiome), but in routine practice not all available inputs are used. The ability to practice precision medicine is also dependent on the knowledge bases available to assist clinicians in taking action based on test results.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25276091| pmc = 4175027 | year = 2014| author1 = Huser| first1 = V.| title = Developing genomic knowledge bases and databases to support clinical management: Current perspectives| journal = Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine| volume = 7| pages = 275–83| last2 = Sincan | first2 = M.| last3 = Cimino| first3 = J.

On the treatment side, PM can involve the use of customized medical products such drug cocktails produced by pharmacy [[compounding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/divining_your_future_in_healthcare_511068|title=Divining your future in healthcare|work=pmlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or customized devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/39339-how-fda-regulates-3d-printed-devices.html|title=3D-Printed Medical Devices Spark FDA Evaluation|work=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also prevent harmful drug interactions, increase overall efficiency when prescribing medications, and reduce costs associated with healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genetichealth.jax.org/personalized-medicine/what-is/benefits.html|title=Personalized Medicine Benefits - The Jackson Laboratory|work=jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence in Precision Medicine===

In his 2015 [[State of the Union]] address, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] stated his intention to fund an amount of $215 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weillcornell.org/news/the-impact-of-precision-medicine-on-cancer|title=The Impact of Precision Medicine on Cancer|work=weillcornell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the "Precision Medicine Initiative" of United States national.&lt;ref name="Neergard2015"&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | last=Neergard | first=Lauran | date=30 January 2015 | title=Obama Proposes 'Precision Medicine' to End One-Size-Fits-All | url=http://www.dddmag.com/news/2015/01/obama-proposes-precision-medicine-end-one-size-fits-all | work=[[Drug Discov. Dev.|Drug Discovery &amp; Development]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A short-term goal of the Precision Medicine Initiative was to expand cancer genomics to develop better prevention and treatment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine/goals.htm|title=Near-term Goals|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, the Precision Medicine Initiative aimed to build a comprehensive scientific knowledge base by creating a national network of scientists and embarking on a national cohort study of one million Americans to expand our understanding of health and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine/future.htm|title=Longer-term Goals|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">[[Grave goods]] are utilitarian and ornamental objects buried with the deceased. ''"Pabaon"'', as present day Filipinos know, is the tradition of including the priced possessions or items of the dead to its grave because of the belief that these things might be helpful to the deceased as it travels to the life after death. This has been a practice since the neolithic times.

Grave goods are symbol of social activities, and in a way reflects the urge of the people who buried the dead to show his or her social status. Grave goods provide substantial background on the technology, degree of complexity of the society, level of integration with other communities, social or group identities, individual identities, and concepts of wealth and power of the existing community.

The types and prestige values of the grave goods differ among groups, because of cultural differences. In studying grave goods, it is important to know the period of existence and to substantiate its prestige value.

== Grave goods through time ==

===Early [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]===
This period was centered on the population's needs. Thus, utilitarian objects, such as [[adze]]s, were most common among grave goods. Ornamental objects were shell pendants, ear ornaments among others. During this period, death was conceived as the transformation of physical form into something inanimate. Goods buried along with the body were mostly composed of their personal belongings.

===Late Neolithic Age===
Local trade can already be observed in this period. This created a diversity of material possessions of individuals, leading to a diversity of grave goods. Among these were jade and agate, and [[earthenware]] pottery. Other materials were shell and some foreign trade objects.

===[[Chalcolithic]] (Metal Age)===
During this period, inter-island trade was already prominent. Grave goods were jars, metal implements, alkali glass beads, imported porcelain and local imitations, tradeware, coins, metal accessories, gold, and shell. Sex differentiation was also evident during this period wherein it is one of the basic determinants of social stratification. This was a time when social roles started to have variations therefore allowed an individual to be identified in the society based on the goods included in its grave. Iron implements were most of the finds together with male bodies while glass beads were among women.

==Prestige value==
The prestige value of grave goods are dependent on four factors:

===Sources===
The acquisition of the material is a factor on its prestige value. Materials that are harder to acquire, such as when the source is a remote area, the prestige value is higher.

===Raw material===
The abundance or rarity of the source of the raw material relates to its prestige value. The rarer the material is, the higher its prestige value.

===Time and energy in acquisition and manufacture===
Here, grave goods are evaluated on whether they are traded and reworked, traded, or locally produced. Traded items take more time to acquire, especially if these have to be reprocessed once acquired. Therefore, these items have higher values than locally produced items which are abundant and easier to acquire.

===Cultural function===
This categorizes grave goods as either utilitarian or non-utilitarian. Non-utilitarian or ornamental items have higher prestige value because these generally take more time to make, are harder to acquire and are not as abundant as utilitarian good which are seen and used in everyday living.

==Sites==

===Duyong cave, [[Palawan]]===
A male adult was excavated in an open pit with stone and shell adzes. Ornamentations were shell disks with perforations near the ears and chest. Shells were of local material. Other materials were shell containers that are part of the areca nut chewing paraphernalia.
This site was dated back to the early neolithic age, 4630 +/- 250 BP.

===Manunggul cave, Palawan===
This is a jar burial site where jade beads, jade bracelets, stone beads, agate bracelets, shell bracelets, shell beads, and highly decorated jars.
This site was dated back to the late neolithic age, 2660 +/- 80 BP and 2840 +/- 80 BP.

===Tigkiw na saday, [[Sorsogon]]===
This is a primary burial inland site where eight burial jars were recovered, some with impressive design and some undecorated. Materials recovered were glass beads interred with females and metal implements interred with males.
The site is of metal age, 200 BC – AD 200.

===Maitum jar burials, [[South Cotabato]]===
A lot of detailed anthropomorphic pottery in different types were found in this site. Materials found were shell bracelets, shell spoons, and metal implements such as daggers and bolos.
This site is of metal age, dating 70- 370 AD and 5 BC to AD 225.

===Panhutongan, [[Surigao del Nort]]e===
This site consisted of sixteen dug-out wooden coffins in varying designs and woods used. Materials found were different varieties of metal implements such as bolos, metal spearheads and beads.
This site is of early Iron Age, AD 140 +/- 340.

===Balingsagay, Bolinao===
This site is a huge burial site where a total of 51 burials were found. Materials were same with the other sites, with the inclusion of a large amount of trade goods from china, especially porcelain. Local imitations of porcelain were also found.
This site is of late 15th to early 14th century.

===Puling bakaw, [[Calatagan, Batangas|Calatagan]]===
The grave goods found along with the bodies could be interpreted as a form of respect to the family of the dead (Barretto 2002). The family's grief was another probable explanation for high-valued goods.(Macdonald 2001) 

This site best exhibited the extensive trade with other south east Asian countries. From the 207 graves excavated, a large amount of South East Asian wares were found, along with materials existent in the other sites, but understandably with greater detail and variety. Extensive use of gold by all population was also exhibited.
This site precedes the Spanish era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3006">In the United States, the term '''principal investigator''' ('''PI''') refers to the holder of an independent grant administered by a university and the lead researcher for the grant project, usually in the sciences, such as a laboratory study or a [[clinical trial]]. The phrase is also often used as a synonym for "head of the laboratory" or "research group leader." While the expression is common in the sciences, it is used widely for the person or persons who make final decisions and supervise funding and expenditures on a given research project.

A co-investigator (Co-I) assists the principal investigator in the management and leadership of the research project. There may be a number of co-investigators supporting a PI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/Handbook/pages/GuidanceonCompletingaStandardG/Co_Investigators.htm|title=Co-Investigators|author=|date=|website=je-s.rcuk.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal funding==
In the context of United States [[federal funding]] from agencies such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) or the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), the PI is the person who takes direct responsibility for completion of a funded project, directing the research and reporting directly to the funding agency.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. NSF Grant Policy Manual 210f 'Definitions: Principal Investigator', available: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02151/gpm2.jsp#210; NIAID (NIH) 'Glossary of Funding and Policy Terms and Acronyms', available: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/glossary/default5.htm#pi&lt;/ref&gt;  For small projects (which might involve 1-5 people) the PI is typically the person who conceived of the investigation, but for larger projects the PI may be selected by a team to obtain the best strategic advantage for the project.

In the context of a clinical trial a PI may be an academic working with grants from [[NIH]] or other funding agencies, or may be effectively a contractor for a [[pharmaceutical company]] working on testing the safety and efficacy of new medicines.

There were 20,458 PIs on [[NIH grant#R01|NIH R01 grants]] in US biomedical research in 2000. In 2013, this number has grown to 21,511. At the same time the success rate for an applicant to receive an R01 grant has gone down from 32% in 2000 to 17% in 2013.&lt;ref name="Couzin-Frankel"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Laproscopic Surgery Robot.jpg|thumb|A robotically assisted surgical system used for prostatectomies, cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures]]
'''Robotic surgery''', [[computer-assisted surgery]], and robotically-assisted surgery are terms for technological developments that use robotic systems to aid in [[surgery|surgical procedures]]. Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing [[minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive surgical procedures]] and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.

In the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments; either a direct [[Remote manipulator|telemanipulator]] or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the [[robotic arm]]s carry out those movements using [[robot end effector|end-effector]]s and [[manipulator (device)|manipulators]] to perform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility for [[remote surgery]].

In the case of enhanced open surgery, autonomous instruments (in familiar configurations) replace traditional steel tools, performing certain actions (such as rib spreading) with much smoother, feedback-controlled motions than could be achieved by a human hand. The main object of such smart instruments is to reduce or eliminate the tissue trauma traditionally associated with open surgery without requiring more than a few minutes' training on the part of surgeons. This approach seeks to improve open surgeries, particularly cardio-thoracic, that have so far not benefited from minimally-invasive techniques.

Robotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, by one estimate costing $1,500 to $2000 more per patient.&lt;ref name=kolata&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/health/14robot.html| title=Results Unproven, Robotic Surgery Wins Converts |first=Gina |last=Kolata |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 February 2010 | accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to traditional methods==
Major advances aided by surgical robots have been [[remote surgery]], [[minimally invasive surgery]] and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification helps resulting in improved ergonomics. Due to these techniques there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication.&lt;ref name=Estey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estey|first=EP|date=2009|title=Robotic prostatectomy: The new standard of care or a marketing success?|journal=Canadian Urological Association Journal|volume=3|issue=6|pages=488–90|pmc=2792423|pmid=20019980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The existing open surgery technique has many flaws like limited access to surgical area, long recovery time, long hours of operation, blood loss, surgical scars and marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The robot normally costs $1,390,000 and while its disposable supply cost is normally $1,500 per procedure, the cost of the procedure is higher.&lt;ref name=kolata/&gt; Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system.&lt;ref name=ORPvsRALRP/&gt; Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such systems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate on twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie ups and surgical staffs keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain.&lt;ref name=Estey/&gt; Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret.&lt;ref name=ORPvsRALRP/&gt;

Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer have to stand throughout the surgery and do not tire as quickly. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardus|first1=D|date=July–August 2003|title=Robot-assisted surgery: the future is here|journal=Journal of Healthcare Management|volume=48|issue=4|pages=242–251|pmid=12908224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the system, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,&lt;ref&gt;Breeden, James T., MD, President of ACOG, [http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2013/Statement-on-Robotic-Surgery] Statement on Robotic Surgery, 14 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; say there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system and that there's a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following traditional [[laparoscopic surgery]].&lt;ref name="kolata"/&gt; Articles in the newly created ''[[Journal of Robotic Surgery]]'' tend to report on one surgeon's experience.&lt;ref name=kolata/&gt;

A Medicare study found that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the [[Da Vinci Surgical System]], shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used.&lt;ref name=kolata/&gt;

Robot-assisted [[pancreatectomy|pancreatectomies]] have been found to be associated with "longer operating time, lower estimated blood loss, a higher spleen-preservation rate, and shorter hospital stay[s]" than laparoscopic pancreatectomies; there was "no significant difference in transfusion, conversion to open surgery, overall complications, severe complications, pancreatic fistula, severe pancreatic fistula, ICU stay, total cost, and 30-day mortality between the two groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=JY|last2=Xin|first2=C|last3=Mou|first3=YP|last4=Xu|first4=XW|last5=Zhang|first5=MZ|last6=Zhou|first6=YC|last7=Lu|first7=C|last8=Chen|first8=RG|title=Robotic versus Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy: A Meta-Analysis of Short-Term Outcomes|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0151189|pmid=26974961|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151189|pmc=4790929|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1151189Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; For surgical removal of the uterus and cervix for early [[cervical cancer]] robotic and laparoscopic surgery resulted in similar outcomes with respect to the cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zanagnolo|first1=V|last2=Garbi|first2=A|last3=Achilarre|first3=MT|last4=Minig|first4=L|title=Robot-assisted surgery in Gynecologic cancers.|journal=Journal of minimally invasive gynecology|date=16 January 2017|pmid=28104497|doi=10.1016/j.jmig.2017.01.006|volume=24|pages=379–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Cardiology and electrophysiology===
As of 2004, three types of heart surgery are being performed on a routine basis using robotic surgery systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kypson|first1=Alan P|last2=Chitwood Jr.|first2=W. Randolph|date=2004|title=Robotic Applications in Cardiac Surgery|journal=International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems|volume=1|issue=2|pages=87–92|arxiv=cs/0412055|bibcode=2004cs.......12055K}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three surgery types were:

*Atrial septal defect repair – the repair of a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart,
*Mitral valve repair – the repair of the valve that prevents blood from regurgitating back into the upper heart chambers during contractions of the heart,
*Coronary artery bypass – rerouting of blood supply by bypassing blocked arteries that provide blood to the heart.

===Colon and rectal surgery===
Many studies have been undertaken in order to examine the role of robotic procedures in the field of [[colorectal surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Annibale, A et al. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. December 2004. Volume 47, issue 12, pp. 2162–2168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spinoglio, G. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. November 2008. Volume 51, issue 11, pp. 1627–1632&lt;/ref&gt;

Results to date indicate that robotic-assisted colorectal procedures outcomes are "no worse" than the results in the now "traditional" laparoscopic colorectal operations. Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery appears to be safe as well.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, C. et al. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. December 2003. Volume 46, pp. 1633–1639&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the procedures have been performed for malignant colon and rectal lesions. However, surgeons are now moving into resections for diverticulitis and non-resective rectopexies (attaching the colon to the sacrum in order to treat rectal prolapse.)

When evaluated for several variables, robotic-assisted procedures fare equally well when compared with laparoscopic, or open abdominal operations. Study parameters have looked at intraoperative patient preparation time, length of time to perform the operation, adequacy of the removed surgical specimen with respect to clear surgical margins and number of lymph nodes removed, blood loss, operative or postoperative complications and long-term results.

More difficult to evaluate are issues related to the view of the operative field, the types of procedures that should be performed using robotic assistance and the potential added cost for a robotic operation.

Many surgeons feel that the optics of the 3-dimensional, two camera stereo optic robotic system are superior to the optical system used in laparoscopic procedures. The pelvic nerves are clearly visualized during robotic-assisted procedures. Less clear however is whether or not these supposedly improved optics and visualization improve patient outcomes with respect to postoperative impotence or incontinence, and whether long-term patient survival is improved by using the 3-dimensional optic system. Additionally, there is often a need for a wider, or "larger" view of the operative field than is routinely provided during robotic operations.,&lt;ref&gt;Braumann, C. et al. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. December 2005. Volume 48, Number 9, pp1820-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; The close-up view of the area under dissection may hamper visualization of the "bigger view", especially with respect to ureteral protection.

Questions remain unanswered, even after many years of experience with robotic-assisted colorectal operations. Ongoing studies may help clarify many of the issues of confusion associated with this novel surgical approach.

===Gastrointestinal surgery===
Multiple types of procedures have been performed with either the 'Zeus' or [[Da Vinci Surgical System|da Vinci]] robot systems, including [[bariatric surgery]] and [[gastrectomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myung-Han |first1=Hyun |author2=Chung-Ho Lee |author3=Hyun-Jung Kim |author4=YiXin Tong|author5=Sung-Soo Park|title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic and open resection for gastric carcinoma|journal=British Journal of Surgery|date=November 2013|volume=100|issue=12|pages=1566–78|doi=10.1002/bjs.9242|pmid=24264778}}&lt;/ref&gt; for cancer.

Other gastrointestinal procedures including colon resection, pancreatectomy, esophagectomy and robotic approaches to pelvic disease have also been reported.

===Gynecology===
Robotic surgery in [[gynecology]] is of uncertain benefit with it being unclear if it affects rates of complications. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery but may be associated with a shorter hospital stay following hysterectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=H|last2=Lawrie|first2=TA|last3=Lu|first3=D|last4=Song|first4=H|last5=Wang|first5=L|last6=Shi|first6=G|title=Robot-assisted surgery in gynaecology|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 December 2014|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD011422|pmid=25493418|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions has been shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy, with no difference in overall rates of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Committee Opinion: Robotic Surgery in Gynecolgy|date = March 2015|journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology]]|doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000461761.47981.07|volume=125|issue = 3|pages=760–767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic [[oncology]]. Robotic surgery can be used to treat [[fibroma|fibroids]], abnormal periods, [[endometriosis]], [[ovarian tumor]]s, [[uterine prolapse]], and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies.

===Orthopedics===
Robots are used in orthopedic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Computer and robotic assisted hip and knee surgery|editor1-first = Anthony M.|editor1-last = DiGioia|editor2-first = Branislav|editor2-last = Jaramaz|editor3-first = Frederic|editor3-last = Picard|editor4-first = Lutz-Peter|editor4-last = Nolte  |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|date = 30 December 2004|isbn = 0-19-850943-X|pages = 127–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Surgical robotics has been used in many types of pediatric surgical procedures including: [[tracheoesophageal fistula]] repair, [[cholecystectomy]], [[nissen fundoplication]], [[morgagni's hernia]] repair, [[kasai portoenterostomy]], [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] repair, and others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Spine surgery===
Robotic devices started to be used in [[minimally Invasive Spine Surgery|minimally invasive spine surgery]] starting in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Shweikeh2014rev&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shweikeh|first=Faris|last2=Amadio|first2=Jordan P.|last3=Arnell|first3=Monica|last4=Barnard|first4=Zachary R.|last5=Kim|first5=Terrence T.|last6=Johnson|first6=J.

===Transplant surgery===
Transplant surgery ([[organ transplantation]]) has been considered as highly technically demanding and virtually unobtainable by means of conventional laparoscopy. For many years, transplant patients were unable to benefit from the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. The development of robotic technology and its associated high resolution capabilities, three dimensional visual system, wrist type motion and fine instruments, gave opportunity for highly complex procedures to be completed in a minimally invasive fashion. Subsequently, the first fully robotic kidney transplantations were performed in the late 2000s. After the procedure was proven to be feasible and safe, the main emerging challenge was to determine which patients would benefit most from this robotic technique. As a result, recognition of the increasing prevalence of obesity amongst patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis posed a significant problem. Due to the abundantly higher risk of complications after traditional open kidney transplantation, obese patients were frequently denied access to transplantation, which is the premium treatment for end stage kidney disease. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Urology===
Robotic surgery in the field of urology has become very popular, especially in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = DI | title = Robotic prostatectomy: what we have learned and where we are going | journal = Yonsei Med J | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–81 |date=April 2009 | doi = 10.3349/ymj.2009.50.2.177 | pmid = 19430547 | pmc=2678689}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been most extensively applied for excision of prostate cancer because of difficult anatomical access. It is also utilized for [[kidney]] cancer surgeries and to lesser extent surgeries of the [[bladder]].

As of 2014, there is little evidence of increased benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SB|last2=Prado|first2=K|last3=Hu|first3=JC|title=Economics of robotic surgery: does it make sense and for whom?|journal=The Urologic clinics of North America|date=November 2014|volume=41|issue=4|pages=591–6|pmid=25306170|doi=10.1016/j.ucl.2014.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found tentative evidence of more complete removal of cancer and less side effects from surgery for prostatectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramsay|first1=C|last2=Pickard|first2=R|last3=Robertson|first3=C|last4=Close|first4=A|last5=Vale|first5=L|last6=Armstrong|first6=N|last7=Barocas|first7=DA|last8=Eden|first8=CG|last9=Fraser|first9=C|last10=Gurung|first10=T|last11=Jenkinson|first11=D|last12=Jia|first12=X|last13=Lam|first13=TB|last14=Mowatt|first14=G|last15=Neal|first15=DE|last16=Robinson|first16=MC|last17=Royle|first17=J|last18=Rushton|first18=SP|last19=Sharma|first19=P|last20=Shirley|first20=MD|last21=Soomro|first21=N|title=Systematic review and economic modelling of the relative clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery for removal of the prostate in men with localised prostate cancer.|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=2012|volume=16|issue=41|pages=1–313|pmid=23127367|doi=10.3310/hta16410|pmc=4780976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breast Surgery'''

Robotic breast surgery involves using the robot to assist in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy and breast reconstruction.  In 2015, a group of surgeons led by Dr. Antonio Toesca, in Milan, Italy demonstrated the feasibility and safety of robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy and robotic breast reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toesca|first=Antonio|last2=Peradze|first2=Nickolas|last3=Galimberti|first3=Viviana|last4=Manconi|first4=Andrea|last5=Intra|first5=Mattia|last6=Gentilini|first6=Oreste|last7=Sances|first7=Daniele|last8=Negri|first8=Debora|last9=Veronesi|first9=Giulia|date=August 2017|title=Robotic Nipple-sparing Mastectomy and Immediate Breast Reconstruction With Implant: First Report of Surgical Technique|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=266|issue=2|pages=e28–e30|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000001397|issn=1528-1140|pmid=28692558}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Italian surgeons published their results in their first 29 consecutive patients. In this report, all patients had robotic mastectomy and reconstruction done through a 3&amp;nbsp;cm extra-mammary incision, hidden by the arm. Thereafter, a surgeon, Dr. Benjamin Sarfati, in Paris began performing robotic mastectomy and breast reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarfati|first=Benjamin|last2=Honart|first2=Jean-Francois|last3=Leymarie|first3=Nicolas|last4=Rimareix|first4=Francoise|last5=Al Khashnam|first5=Heba|last6=Kolb|first6=Frederic|date=2017-12-18|title=Robotic da Vinci Xi-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy: First clinical report|journal=The Breast Journal|doi=10.1111/tbj.12937|issn=1524-4741|pmid=29251382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 4, 2018, Dr. Neil Tanna and colleagues performed the first robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy and robotic breast reconstruction in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc7ny.com/health/li-doctors-perform-1st-robotic-mastectomy-breast-reconstruction/3182483/|title=LI doctors perform 1st robotic mastectomy, breast reconstruction in US|last=city|first=joe torres, eyewitness news, wabc-tv, channel 7, abc 7, 7online, new york|date=2018-03-06|work=ABC7 New York|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/3822781-double-mastectomy-and-breast-reduction-performed-using-a-robot/|title=Double Mastectomy And Breast Reconstruction Performed Using A Robot|date=2018-03-06|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' '''

Traditional (open) nipple-sparing mastectomy and breast reconstruction require incisions on the breast. Robotic nipple sparing mastectomy with robotic breast reconstruction is an innovative form of breast surgery that utilizes robotic technology to perform the surgery.  By using the robot, the incisions can be much smaller and be placed off the breasts, far away near the armpit or the bra line.

==History==
The first robot to assist in surgery was the ''Arthrobot'', which was developed and used for the first time in [[Vancouver]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brianday.ca/imagez/1051_28738.pdf |title=Medical Post 23:1985 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimately involved were [[Biomedical engineering|biomedical engineer]] [[James McEwen (engineer)|Dr. James McEwen]], Geof Auchinleck, a UBC [[engineering physics]] grad, and [[Brian Day|Dr. Brian Day]] as well as a team of engineering students. The robot was used in an [[Orthopaedy|orthopaedic]] surgical procedure on 12 March 1984, at the [[UBC Hospital]] in Vancouver. Over 60 [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic]] surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] video on industrial robots, ''The Robotics Revolution'', featured the device. Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical [[scrub nurse]] robot, which handed operative instruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. A YouTube video entitled ''Arthrobot'' illustrates some of these in operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1985 a robot, the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly|Unimation Puma 200]], was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kwoh, Y.

The latter was the first surgical robot that was approved by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Robotic Surgery|url = http://doi.org/10.1097/01.sla.0000103020.19595.7d|journal = Annals of Surgery|pmc = 1356187|pmid = 14685095|pages = 14–21|volume = 239|issue = 1|doi = 10.1097/01.sla.0000103020.19595.7d|first = Anthony R.|last = Lanfranco|first2 = Andres E.|last2 = Castellanos|first3 = Jaydev P.|last3 = Desai|first4 = William C.|last4 = Meyers|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROBODOC from Integrated Surgical Systems (working closely with [[IBM]]) was introduced in 1992 to mill out precise fittings in the [[femur]] for hip replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robot.md/publications/robodoc-surgical-robot-sucess-story.pdf |title=ROBODOC: Surgical Robot Success Story |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the ROBODOC was to replace the previous method of carving out a femur for an implant, the use of a mallet and broach/rasp.

Further development of robotic systems was carried out by [[SRI International]] and [[Intuitive Surgical]] with the introduction of the [[da Vinci Surgical System]] and [[Computer Motion]] with the ''AESOP'' and the [[ZEUS robotic surgical system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/405_computer.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301135726/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/405_computer.html|archivedate=1 March 2009|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|work=FDA Consumer magazine|title=Computer-Assisted Surgery: An Update|first=Michelle|last=Meadows}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first robotic surgery took place at [[The Ohio State University Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio under the direction of [[Robert E. Michler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=PI|last2=Schneeberger|first2=EW|last3=Michler|first3=RE|date=2003|title=History and development of robotic cardiac surgery|journal=Problems in General Surgery|volume=20|issue=2|pages=20–30|doi=10.1097/01.sgs.0000081182.03671.6e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of using ZEUS include a fallopian tube reconnection in July 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoise.com/vmw/99/articles/vmw/LV-VM-11-99-1.html|title=ZEUS robot system reverses sterilization to enable birth of baby boy|author=Leslie Versweyveld|date=29 September 1999|publisher=Virtual Medical Worlds Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ''beating heart'' coronary artery bypass graft in October 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 October 1999 |url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2000_Groups/Heart_Surgery/Robotics.html|title=Robotics: the Future of Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery|publisher=Biomed.brown.edu|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lindbergh Operation]], which was a [[cholecystectomy]] performed remotely in September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ircad.fr/event/lindbergh/index.php?lng=en|title=Linbergh Operation – IRCAD/EITS Laparoscopic Center|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original telesurgery robotic system that the da Vinci was based on was developed at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/work/timeline-innovation/timeline.php?timeline=health#!&amp;innovation=telerobotic-surgery|title=Telerobotic Surgery|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to facilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote environments, it turned out to be more useful for minimally invasive on-site surgery. The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical in Mountain View, California. The da Vinci senses the surgeon's hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated robotically. The camera used in the system provides a true stereoscopic picture transmitted to a surgeon's console. Examples of using the da Vinci system include the first robotically assisted [[heart bypass]] (performed in Germany) in May 1998, and the first performed in the United States in September 1999;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and the first all-robotic-assisted [[kidney transplant]], performed in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wcbstv.com/health/da.vinci.robot.2.1055154.html |title=New Robot Technology Eases Kidney Transplants|work=CBS News|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The da Vinci Si was released in April 2009, and initially sold for $1.75&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/products/davinci_surgical_system/davinci_surgical_system_si/|title=da Vinci Si Surgical System|publisher=[[Intuitive Surgical]]|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006 the first [[artificial intelligence]] doctor-conducted unassisted robotic surgery was on a 34-year-old male to correct [[heart arrythmia]]. The results were rated as better than an above-average human surgeon. The machine had a [[database]] of 10,000 similar operations, and so, in the words of its designers, was "more than qualified to operate on any patient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/05/19/robot-surgeon-performs-worlds-first-unassisted-operation|title=Autonomous Robotic Surgeon performs surgery on first live human|date=19 May 2006|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news67222790.html |title=Robot surgeon carries out 9-hour operation by itself|publisher=[[Phys.Org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Dr. Sijo Parekattil of the Robotics Institute and Center for Urology (Winter Haven Hospital and University of Florida) performed the first robotic assisted microsurgery procedure denervation of the spermatic cord for chronic testicular pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parekattil |first=Sijo |title=Robotic Infertility|url=http://www.roboticinfertility.com|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Dr. Mohan S.

==History==
Until the 1930s, Australian and New Zealand Physicians had to seek membership of one of the United Kingdom Colleges in London, Glasgow, Ireland or Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="theroyalaustralasiancollegeofphysicians"/&gt;

In November 1930, a group of physicians met in [[Melbourne]] to establish the Association of Physicians of Australasia "for friendship and scientific stimulus", which solely consisted of its members; no building or permanent base existed.

In 1934, the Association of Physicians of Australasia Council decided that an examining and executive body College should be formed to enhance the prestige of the profession, stimulate interest in medical education and research, and set a standard of professional ethical conduct. The constitution was to be modelled on that of the London College.

In 1937, the Association purchased premises at 145 Macquarie Street, Sydney, which had originally been the home of the Fairfax family. Funds were raised by the NSW Government and public donation.

In 1938, the College was incorporated and the first meeting of the Council was held in April.&lt;ref name="theroyalaustralasiancollegeofphysicians"/&gt;

The motto of "hominum servire saluti" ("to serve the health of our people") was adopted for the College coat of arms.

In September that year 47 candidates took the first examinations and 41 members were admitted.

==Structure==
The RACP is divided into two Divisions and three Faculties. Each Division has a number of Chapters.

===Divisions===
*Adult Medicine Division
*Paediatrics &amp; Child Health Division

===Faculties===
*Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine
*Australasian Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine
*Australasian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine

===Chapters===
*Chapter of Community Child Health
*Australasian Chapter of Palliative Medicine
*Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine
*Australasian Chapter of Sexual Health Medicine (formerly Australasian College of Sexual Health Physicians)

==Facilities==
The History of Medicine Library at the RACP has a leading collection of medical history items from Australia and around the world. The RACP established the History of Medicine Library in 1938 as a clinical library. The focus of the library changed to medical history in the mid 1950s. The History of Medicine Library continues to grow through the contributions of College Members.

==Qualifications==

==History==

===Cholesterol and cardiovascular disease===
The initial connection between [[arteriosclerosis]] and dietary [[cholesterol]] is attributed to the Russian pathologist [[Nikolay Anichkov]], prior to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Daniel|date=|title=Thematic review series: The Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis.  An interpretive history of the cholesterol controversy: Part I|url=|journal=[[Journal of Lipid Research]]|publication-date=21 April 2004|volume=45|issue=9|pages=1583–1593|doi=10.1194/jlr.R400003-JLR200|pmid=15102877|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dutch physician [[Cornelis de Langen]] noted the correlation between nutritional cholesterol intake and incidence of [[gallstones]] in  [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people in 1916.&lt;ref name="Blackburn2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Blackburn|first1=Henry|date=|year=2012|title=20th-Century "Medical Marco Polos" in the Origins of Preventive Cardiology and Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology|url=https://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(11)03212-7/pdf|journal=[[The American Journal of Cardiology]]|volume=109|issue=5|pages=756–767|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.10.038|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Langen|first1=Cornelis|title=Cholesterine-stofwisseling en rassenpathologie|journal=Geneeskundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie|date=1916|volume=56|pages=1–34|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Langen showed that the traditional Javanese diet, poor in cholesterol and other lipids, was associated with a low level of blood cholesterol and low incidence of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD), while the prevalence of CVD in Europeans living in Java on a Western diet was higher.&lt;ref name="Blackburn2012" /&gt; Since de Langen published his results only in Dutch, his work remained unknown to most of the international scientific community until the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="Blackburn2012" /&gt;

===Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease===
The hypothesis that saturated fat has a detrimental effect on human health gained prominence in the 1950s as a result of the work of [[Ancel Keys]], a US [[Nutritional science|nutritional scientist]].&lt;ref name="Teicholz2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486|title=The Questionable Link Between Saturated Fat and Heart Disease|last1=Teicholz|first1=Nina|date=6 May 2014|website=|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time in the USA, the incidence of heart disease was rapidly increasing, for reasons that were not clear.&lt;ref name="Teicholz2014"/&gt; Keys postulated a correlation between [[Lipoproteins|circulating cholesterol]] levels and [[cardiovascular disease]], and initiated a study of Minnesota businessmen (the first [[prospective study]] of CVD).&lt;ref name="Keys1963"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keys|first=Ancel|last2=Taylor|first2=Henry Longstreet|last3=Blackburn|first3=Henry|last4=Brozek|first4=Josef|last5=Anderson|first5=Joseph T.|last6=Simonson|first6=Ernst|date=1 September 1963|title=Coronary Heart Disease among Minnesota Business and Professional Men Followed Fifteen Years|url=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/circ.28.3.381|journal=[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]|publisher=|volume=28|issue=3|pages=381–95|doi=10.1161/01.cir.28.3.381|pmid=14059458|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials.

===Review details===

A 2017 systematic review focusing on adequately controlled randomized controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce [[Coronary Heart Disease|coronary heart disease]] (CHD) events, CHD mortality or total mortality. The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials (e.g., failing to control for other lifestyle factors) that were included in earlier meta-analyses explain the prior results.&lt;ref name="Hamley2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamley|first1=Steven|date=May 2017|title=The effect of replacing saturated fat with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fat on coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437600/pdf/12937_2017_Article_254.pdf|journal=[[Nutrition Journal]]|volume=16|issue=1|page=30|pages=|doi=10.1186/s12937-017-0254-5|pmc=5437600|pmid=28526025|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 [[systematic review]] by the American Heart Association recommended that decreasing saturated fat intake and increasing consumption of [[monounsaturated fat]]s and [[polyunsaturated fat]]s could lower risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30%.&lt;ref name="aha2017"/&gt;

A 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or death.&lt;ref name="De Souza" /&gt;

A 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the [[Cochrane Library]] found that reducing saturated fat intake resulted in a 17% reduction in cardiovascular events, and that replacing saturated fats with ''cis'' unsaturated fats in particular is beneficial. It concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."&lt;ref name="Hooper2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hooper2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Lee|last2=Martin|first2=Nicole|last3=Abdelhamid|first3=Asmaa|last4=Smith|first4=George Davey|date=|title=Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease|url=|journal=[[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|publication-date=10 June 2015|volume=|issue=6|page=CD011737|pages=|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011737|pmid=26068959|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 72 published studies totaling 530,525 participants, looked at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation. The authors of the review concluded: ″Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.″&lt;ref name=Chowdhury2014/&gt;

A 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings ″do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chowdhury R, Warnakula S, Kunutsor S, Crowe F, Ward HA, Johnson L, Franco OH, Butterworth AS, Forouhi NG, Thompson SG, Khaw KT, Mozaffarian D, Danesh J, Di Angelantonio E | title = Association of dietary, circulating, and supplement fatty acids with coronary risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Ann.

"While that research is going on I don't think we should just go changing everything. It's too premature to give the public the impression that they have a licence, based on this preliminary research, which is exciting but not yet definitive, to say butter is back."&lt;ref name="Gallagher2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34846832|title=Diet debate: Is butter back and is sat fat good?|last1=Gallagher|first1=James|date=6 January 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, [[Walter Willett]] warned that the conclusions of the meta-analysis are seriously misleading, contains major errors and omissions, and should be retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2014/03/19/dietary-fat-and-heart-disease-study-is-seriously-misleading/|title=Dietary fat and heart disease study is seriously misleading|last=Willett|first=Walter|last2=Sacks|first2=Frank|date=19 March 2014|website=|publisher=[[Harvard School of Public Health]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Stampfer|first3=Meir}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the Chowdhury review, Willett ''et al''. commented:

::″The meta-analysis of dietary fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease by Chowdhury et al. contains multiple errors and omissions, and the conclusions are seriously misleading, particularly the lack of association with N-6 polyunsaturated fat. For example, two of the six studies included in the analysis of N-6 polyunsaturated fat were wrong. The relative risks for Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study (KIHD) were retrieved incorrectly and said to be above 1.0. However, in the 20-year follow-up of the NHS the relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile was 0.77 (95 percent CI: 0.62, 0.95); ptrend = 0.01 (the authors seem to have used the RR for N-3 alpha-linolenic acid from a paper on sudden cardiac death), and in the KIHD the relative risk was 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.71) (the origin of the number used in the meta-analysis is unclear). Also, relevant data from other studies were not included.

::Further, the authors did not mention a pooled analysis of the primary data from prospective studies, in which a significant inverse association between intake of polyunsaturated fat (the large majority being the N-6 linoleic acid) and risk of CHD was found. Also, in this analysis, substitution of polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat was associated with lower risk of CHD. Chowdhury et al. also failed to point out that most of the monounsaturated fat consumed in their studies was from red meat and dairy sources, and the findings do not necessarily apply to consumption in the form of nuts, olive oil, and other plant sources. Thus, the conclusions of Chowdhury et al. regarding the type of fat being unimportant are seriously misleading and should be disregarded.″

===Mainstream opinion===

====Specialist/professional textbooks====

The 2009 ''[[European Society of Cardiology]] Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine'' states that, in cohort studies, the positive relationship between fat intake and CVDs was linked to their saturated fatty acid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 257 | title = The European Society of Cardiology Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine | last1 = Camm | first1 = John | last2 = Luscher | first2 = Thomas | last3 = Serruys | first3 = Patrick | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-19-957285-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007's ''Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation'' states that large epidemiological studies have shown consistent associations between the intake of saturated fatty acids and CHD mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation | author = Perk, J | publisher = Springer-Verlag London Limited | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-84628-462-5 | page = 184 | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2007 ''Critical Pathways in Cardiovascular Medicine'', substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat may lower LDL cholesterol without simultaneously lowering HDL cholesterol. This dietary principle partly underlies the [[Mediterranean diet|Mediterranean]] style of diet, which has been associated with reduced cardiovascular event rates in two randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Critical Pathways in Cardiovascular Medicine, 2nd Edition | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | last1 = Cannon | first1 = Christopher | last2 = O'Gara | first2 = Patrick | year = 2007 | page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 second edition of ''Evidence-based Cardiology'' in 'PartII: Prevention of cardiovascular diseases' recommends a low intake of SFA, less than 7% of daily calories, and intake of foods rich in [[myristic acid|myristic]] and [[palmitic acid]]s should be especially reduced. The recommendation was evaluated to be supported by the best grade of available evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence-Based Cardiology|author=Yusuf|first=Salim|last2=Cairns|first2=John A.|last3=Camm|first3=A. John|last4=Fallen|first4=Ernest L.|last5=Gersh|first5=Bernard J.|publisher=BMJ Books|year=2002|isbn=0-7279-1699-8|edition=Second|location=|page=320|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Position statements and guidelines of major health organizations====

=====Medical establishments=====

In 2003 a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded: "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk. The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10%, of daily energy intake and less
than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than
10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits,
intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by
fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing
countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups
may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are
low (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be
considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.
Specific sources of saturated fat, such as [[Coconut oil|coconut]] and [[palm oil]], provide
low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

In its 2007 guidelines, the [[European Society of Cardiology]] states that there are strong, consistent, and graded relationships between saturated fat intake, blood cholesterol levels, and the mass occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The relationships are accepted as causal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=European Society of Cardiology|first=|last2=Atar|last3=Borch-Johnsen|last4=Boysen|last5=Burell|last6=Cifkova|last7=Dallongeville|last8=De Backer|last9=Ebrahim|date=|year=2007|title=European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice: executive summary|url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2007/08/28/eurheartj.ehm316.full.pdf|journal=[[European Heart Journal]]|volume=28|issue=19|pages=2375–2414|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehm316|pmid=17726041|via=|last10=Gjelsvik|last11=Herrmann-Lingen|last12=Hoes|last13=Humphries|last14=Knapton|last15=Perk|last16=Priori|last17=Pyorala|last18=Reiner|last19=Ruilope|last20=Sans-Menendez|last21=Scholte Op Reimer|last22=Weissberg|last23=Wood|last24=Yarnell|last25=Zamorano|last26=Walma|last27=Fitzgerald|last28=Cooney|last29=Dudina|author30=European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mayo Clinic]] considers saturated fats potentially harmful and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats potentially helpful. It references the ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'' and recommends reducing foods rich in saturated fat and emphasizing options with more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550|title=Dietary fats: Know which types to choose|last=|first=|date=2 February 2016|website=[[Mayo Clinic]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Dietetic Association]] guidelines found good evidence in systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that reducing saturated fat reduces morbidity in patients with CVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mead|first=A.|displayauthors=etal|date=December 2006|title=Dietetic guidelines on food and nutrition in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease – evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (second update, January 2006)|url=|journal=[[Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics]]|publication-date=10 November 2016|volume=19|issue=6|pages=401–419|doi=10.1111/j.1365-277X.2006.00726.x|pmid=17105538|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 position statement of the American Dietetic Association and the Dieticians of Canada holds that epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between the intake of saturated fatty acid and the incidence of coronary heart disease.&lt;ref name="ADA/DOC"/&gt;

The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] holds that saturated fats should be replaced with ''cis'' monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, but that they should not be replaced with refined carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/|title=Fats and Cholesterol|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Harvard T.H.

=====Governmental guidelines=====

''The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'' produced by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], says the human body makes more than enough saturated fats to meet its needs and does not require more from dietary sources. It says higher levels of saturated fats are associated with higher levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein "bad" cholesterol and recommends reduced saturated fat intake.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (December 2010). ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'' (7th Edition). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines are based on the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report that incorporated the results of the review of 12 studies from 2004 to 2009 conducted by the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), part of the Evidence Analysis Library Division of the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. The NEL concluded that there was "strong" evidence that dietary saturated fats increased serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Nutrition Evidence Library. (2010). [http://www.nutritionevidencelibrary.com/evidence.cfm?evidence_summary_id=250189 What is the effect of saturated fat intake on increased risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes?].

===&lt;small&gt;Editorial, commentary and conference findings&lt;/small&gt;===

A 2010 debate at the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]'s 93rd conference stated: "Regarding saturated fat, the key point agreed upon by the panel and scientific community at large was that researchers agree that replacing saturated fat with healthy polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health and cardiovascular disease." Recommendations for dieticians emphasized using mono- and polyunsaturated fats whenever possible, avoiding trans fats. Further, "The evidence against saturated fat may not be as strong as dietary guidelines have interpreted [it is clear] that PUFAs (especially) and MUFAs are healthy fats", and that while there is room for saturated fats within the diet, but "[they] should not be viewed as good for you".&lt;ref name = Zelman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zelman | first1 = K. | title = The Great Fat Debate: A Closer Look at the Controversy—Questioning the Validity of Age-Old Dietary Guidance | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.026 | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 111 | issue = 5 | pages = 655–658 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21515106 | url = http://myweb.dal.ca/susanhal/temporary/GFD2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 review found that the risk of coronary heart disease is reduced when saturated fatty acids are replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there was no clear benefit in replacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates or monounsaturated fatty acids.&lt;ref name=Astrup2011&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: where does the evidence stand in 2010? |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume= 93|issue= 4|pages=684–688|date=January 2011 |pmid=21270379 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.004622  |url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/93/4/684.full |last2=Dyerberg |first2=J. |last3=Elwood |first3=P. |last4=Hermansen |first4=K. |last5=Hu |first5=F.

C. |pmc=3138219|display-authors=9 |author1=Astrup |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review found that the best evidence showed reduced intake of saturated fat decreased the risk for coronary heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Importancia da gordura alimentar na prevencao e no controle de disturbios metabolicos e da doenca cardiovascular |language=Portuguese |trans-title =Importance of the dietary fat on the prevention and control of metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease | journal = Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia | author = Lottenberg AMP | volume=53 |  issue=5 |  pages=595–607 |date=July 2009 | issn = 0004-2730 |doi=10.1590/S0004-27302009000500012 | pmid=19768250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2009 review found that epidemiological evidence suggested a negative influence on vascular function from saturated fat, but that the experimental evidence did not support this convincingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Dietary saturated and unsaturated fats as determinants of blood pressure and vascular function  | journal = Nutrition Research Reviews | doi=10.1017/S095442240925846X |date=June 2009 | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages=18–38 | author = Hall WL | pmid = 19243668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion contradictory to the mainstream ====

A 2009 scientific conference reported that despite the contribution of dairy products to the saturated fatty acid intake of the diet, there was no clear evidence that dairy food consumption is consistently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=German|first=J. Bruce|displayauthors=etal|date=June 2009|title=A reappraisal of the impact of dairy foods and milk fat on cardiovascular disease risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695872/pdf/394_2009_Article_2.pdf|journal=[[European Journal of Nutrition]]|volume=48|issue=4|pages=191–203|doi=10.1007/s00394-009-0002-5|pmc=2695872|pmid=19259609|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report was criticized for the "use of an incomplete body of relevant science; inaccurately representing, interpreting, or summarizing the literature; and drawing conclusions and/or making recommendations that do not reflect the limitations or controversies in the science", stating that the evidence associating dietary saturated fat with increased risk of cardiovascular disease is inconclusive.&lt;ref name=FeinmanFaceDGAC/&gt;

A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that no evidence exists that dietary saturated fat is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases,&lt;ref name=Siri-Tarino2010 /&gt; but this conclusion was disputed,&lt;ref name="Stamler2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stamler|first=Jeremiah|date=3 February 2010|title=Diet-heart: a problematic revisit|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/497.full|journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|volume=91|issue=3|pages=497–99|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2010.29216|pmid=20130097|quote=The authors are inaccurate in concluding that 'there are few epidemiologic or clinical trial data to support a benefit of replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors of the meta-analysis themselves later noted: "A critical question is what macronutrient should be used to replace saturated fat. ...

'''Scarlet fever''' is a disease which can occur as a result of a [[group A streptococcal infection|group A ''streptococcus'' (group A strep) infection]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlet Fever: A Group A Streptococcal Infection|url=https://www.cdc.gov/Features/ScarletFever/|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=12 March 2016|date=January 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312083805/http://www.cdc.gov/Features/ScarletFever/|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signs and symptoms include a [[sore throat]], [[fever]], headaches, [[lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]], and a characteristic rash.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The rash is red and feels like [[sandpaper]] and the tongue may be red and bumpy.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; It most commonly affects children between five and 15 years of age.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Scarlet fever affects a small number of people who have [[strep throat]] or [[streptococcal skin infection]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The bacteria are usually spread by people coughing or sneezing.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; It can also be spread when a person touches an object that has the bacteria on it and then touches their mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The characteristic rash is due to the [[erythrogenic toxin]], a substance produced by some types of the bacterium.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=AP|last2=Carapetis|first2=JR|title=Group a streptococcal diseases and their global burden.|journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology|date=2013|volume=368|pages=1–27|pmid=23242849|doi=10.1007/82_2012_280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis is typically confirmed by [[throat culture|culturing the throat]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention, treatment, and epidemiology --&gt;
There is no [[vaccine]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; Prevention is by frequent [[handwashing]], not sharing personal items, and staying away from other people when sick.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; The disease is treatable with [[antibiotics]], which prevent most complications.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; Outcomes with scarlet fever are typically good if treated.&lt;ref name=Quin1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=RW|title=Comprehensive review of morbidity and mortality trends for rheumatic fever, streptococcal disease, and scarlet fever: the decline of rheumatic fever.|journal=Reviews of infectious diseases|date=1989|volume=11|issue=6|pages=928–53|pmid=2690288|doi=10.1093/clinids/11.6.928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term complications as a result of scarlet fever include [[glomerulonephritis|kidney disease]], [[rheumatic heart disease]], and arthritis.&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt; It was a leading cause of death in children in the early [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smallman-Raynor|first1=Matthew|title=Atlas of epidemic Britain : a twentieth century picture|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199572922|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMnN4fZrj70C&amp;pg=PA48|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214073450/https://books.google.com/books?id=iMnN4fZrj70C&amp;pg=PA48|archivedate=2017-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smallman-Raynor|first1=Andrew Cliff, Peter Haggett, Matthew|title=World Atlas of Epidemic Diseases|date=2004|publisher=Hodder Education|location=London|isbn=9781444114195|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WrNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214055650/https://books.google.com/books?id=7WrNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|archivedate=2017-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scarlet Fever.jpg|thumb|right|Characteristic red cheeks and rash of scarlet fever]]

Rash which has a characteristic appearance, spreading pattern, and [[Desquamation|desquamating]] process 
"Strawberry tongue"
* The tongue starts out by having a white coating on it while the [[Lingual papillae|papillae]] of the tongue are swollen and reddened. The protrusion of the red papillae through the white coating gives the tongue a "white strawberry" appearance.
* Then a few days later (following the desquamating process, or the shedding of the tissue which created the white coating) the whiteness disappears while the red and enlarged papillae give it the "red strawberry" appearance.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zitelli and Davis' Atlas of Pediatric Physical Diagnosis|last=Zitelli|first=Basil|last2=McIntire|first2=Sara|last3=Nowalk|first3=Andrew|publisher=Elsevier, Inc|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lines of [[petechia]]e which appear as pink/red areas located in arm pits and elbow pits
Vomiting and abdominal pain&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

===Strep throat===

Typical symptoms of [[streptococcal pharyngitis]] (also known as strep throat):&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333418/|title=Streptococcus pyogenes : Basic Biology to Clinical Manifestations|last=Wessels|first=Michael R.|date=2016|publisher=University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center|editor-last=Ferretti|editor-first=Joseph J.|location=Oklahoma City (OK)|pmid=26866221|editor-last2=Stevens|editor-first2=Dennis L.|editor-last3=Fischetti|editor-first3=Vincent A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sore throat, painful swallowing
* Fever - typically over 39&amp;nbsp;°C (102.2&amp;nbsp;°F)
* Fatigue
* Enlarged and reddened tonsils with yellow or white exudates present (this is typically an exudative pharyngitis)&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine|last=Goldsmith|first=Lowell|last2=Katz|first2=Stephen|last3=Gilchrist|first3=Barbara|last4=Paller|first4=Amy|last5=Leffell|first5=David|last6=Wolff|first6=Klaus|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enlarged and tender [[lymph node]]s usually located on the front of the neck&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Atlas of Family Medicine, Second Edition|last=Usatine|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill Companies|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following symptoms will usually be absent: cough, hoarseness, runny nose, diarrhea, and [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Their presence indicates it is more likely a viral infection.

=== Rash ===

The rash begins 1{{ndash}}2 days following the onset of symptoms caused by the strep pharyngitis (sore throat, fever, fatigue).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics|last=Kliegman|first=Robert|last2=Stanton|first2=Bonita|last3=St Geme|first3=Joseph|last4=Schor|first4=Nina|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1327–1337}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic rash has been denoted as "scarlatiniform" and it appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small papules, or bumps, which resemble goose pimples.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th edition|last=Kaspar|first=Dennis|last2=Fauci|first2=Anthony|last3=Hauser|first3=Stephen|last4=Longo|first4=Dan|last5=Jameson|first5=J. Larry|last6=Loscalzo|first6=Joseph|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bumps are what give the characteristic [[sandpaper]] texture to the rash. The reddened skin will blanch when you apply pressure to it. It is possible for the skin to be itchy however it will not be painful.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;  It usually first appears on the trunk and then gradually spreads out to the arms and legs.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt; The palms, soles and face are usually left uninvolved by the rash. The face, however, is usually flushed, most prominently in the cheeks, with a ring of paleness around the mouth.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mandell, Douglas and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Eighth Edition|last=Bennett|first=John|last2=Dolin|first2=Raphael|last3=Blaser|first3=Martin|publisher=Saunders|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=2285–2299}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rash spreads, it becomes more pronounced in creases in the skin, such as the skin folds in the inguinal and axillary regions of the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Also in those areas it is possible for there to be Pastia’s Lines which are petechiae arranged in a linear pattern.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within 1 week of onset the rash begins to fade followed by a longer process of desquamation, or shedding of the outer layer of skin, which lasts several weeks.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The desquamation process usually begins on the face and progresses downward on the body.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; After the desquamation the skin will be left with a sunburned appearance.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

=== Mouth ===

[[File:Pos_strep.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pos_strep.JPG|thumb|Throat of a child with a positive throat culture for streptococcal pharyngitis]]

The streptococcal pharyngitis which is the usual presentation of scarlet fever in combination with the characteristic rash commonly involves the tonsils. The tonsils will appear swollen and reddened. The palate and uvula are also commonly affected by the infection. The involvement of the soft palate can be seen as tiny red and round spots known as [[Forchheimer spots|Forscheimer]] spots.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

=== Variable presentations ===
The features of scarlet fever can differ depending on the age and race of the person. Children less than 5 years old can have atypical presentations. Children less than 3 years old can present with nasal congestion and a lower grade fever.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langlois|first=Debra|last2=Andreae|first2=Margie|date=October 2011|title=Group A Streptococcal Infections|url=|journal=Pediatrics in Review|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants can potentially only present with increased irritability and decreased appetite.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

Children who have darker skin can have a different presentation in that the redness of the skin involved in the rash and the ring of paleness around the mouth can be less obvious.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Suspicion based on accompanying symptoms and diagnostic studies are important in these cases.

=== Course ===
Following exposure to streptococcus, it takes 12 hours to 7 days for the onset of the symptoms. This may include fever, fatigue, and sore throat. The characteristic scarlatiniform rash then comes 12–48 hours later. During the first few days of the rash development and rapid generalization, the Pastia's Lines and strawberry tongue will also present.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The rash starts fading within 3–4 days followed by the desquamation of the rash which will last several weeks to a month.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; If the case of scarlet fever is uncomplicated, recovery from the fever and clinical symptoms other than the process of desquamation occurs in 5–10 days.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lookingbill and Marks' Principles and Dermatology, Fifth Edition|last=Marks|first=James|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=183–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications===

The complications which can arise from scarlet fever when left untreated or inadequately treated can be divided into two categories: suppurative and nonsuppurative.

[[Suppuration|Suppurative]] complications: These are rare complications which either arise from direct spread to structures which are close to the primary site of infection, which in most cases of Scarlet Fever is the pharynx. Possible problems from this method of spread include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, [[cellulitis]], [[mastoiditis]] or [[sinusitis]]. It is also possible for the streptococcal infection to spread through the [[lymphatic system]] or the blood to areas of the body further away from the pharynx. A few examples of the many complications which can arise from those methods of spread include [[endocarditis]], [[pneumonia]], or [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Nonsuppurative complications: These complications arise from certain subtypes of the group A streptococci which cause an autoimmune response in the body through what has been termed [[molecular mimicry]]. The antibodies which the person’s immune system developed to attack the group A streptococci are in these cases also able to attack the person's own tissues. The following complications result depending on which tissues in the person's body are targeted by those antibodies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
* [[Acute rheumatic fever]] This is a complication which results 2–6 weeks after a group A streptococcal infection of the upper respiratory tract.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; It presents in developing countries, where antibiotic treatment of streptococcal infections is less common, as a febrile illness with several clinical manifestations which are organized into what is called the [[Jones criteria]]. These criteria include arthritis, carditis, neurological issues and skin findings. There also needs to be evidence of a prior group A streptococcal infection in the upper respiratory tract (as seen in streptococcal pharyngitis and scarlet fever). The carditis is the result of the immunologic response targeting the person's heart tissue and it is the most serious sequelae which develops from acute rheumatic fever. When this involvement of the heart tissue occurs it is called [[rheumatic heart disease]]. In most cases of rheumatic heart disease, the mitral valve is affected, ultimately leading to [[Mitral valve stenosis|mitral stenosis]].&lt;ref name=":74"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langlois|first=Debra|last2=Andreae|first2=Margie|date=October 2011|title=Group A Streptococcal Infections|journal=Pediatrics in Review|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;
* [[Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]]: This is inflammation of the kidney which presents 1–2 weeks after a group A streptococcal pharyngitis. It can also develop after an episode of [[Impetigo]] or any group A streptococcal infection in the skin (this differs from acute rheumatic fever which only follows group A streptococcal pharyngitis).&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is the result of the autoimmune response to the streptococcal infection impacting the part of the kidney. Patient’s present with what is called acute [[nephritic syndrome]] in which they have high blood pressure, swelling and urinary abnormalities. Urinary abnormalities include blood and protein found in the urine as well as less urine production overall.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;
* Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis: The presentation of arthritis after a recent episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis raises suspicion for acute rheumatic fever since it is one of the [[Jones criteria]] for that separate complication. However, when the arthritis is an isolated symptom then it is referred to as poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. This arthritis can involve a variety of joints throughout the body, unlike the arthritis of acute rheumatic fever which primarily impacts larger joints like the knee joints. It can present less than 10 days after the group A streptococcal pharyngitis.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

==Cause==

Spread of strep throat occurs by close contact, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge).&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; A person in close contact with another person infected with Group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt; One in ten children who are infected with Group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

[[File:Streptococcus pyogenes.jpg|thumb|''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' ''(pictured)'']]

The rash of scarlet fever, which is what differentiates this disease from an isolated Group A Strep pharyngitis (or strep throat), is caused by specific strains of Group A Streptococcus which produce a [[Erythrogenic toxin|pyrogenic exotoxin]].&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; These toxin producing strains cause scarlet fever in people who do not already have antitoxin [[Antibody|antibodies]]. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, and C (speA, speB, and speC) have been identified. The pyrogenic exotoxins are also called erythrogenic toxins and cause the [[erythema]]tous rash of scarlet fever.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The strains of Group A Streptococcus which cause scarlet fever need specific bacteriophages in order for there to be pyrogenic exotoxin production. Specifically, [[Bacteriophage T12|bacteriophage]] T12 is responsible for the production of speA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McShan|first=W. Michael|date=February 1997|title=Bacteriophage T12 of Streptococcus pyogenes integrates into the gene encoding a serine tRNA|journal=Molecular Microbiology|volume=23|pages=719–728|pmid=9157243|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1997.2591616.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin A, speA, is the one which is most commonly associated with cases of scarlet fever which are complicated by the immune mediated sequelae acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

These toxins are also known as “[[superantigen]]s” because they are able to cause an extensive immune response within the body through activation of some of the main cells responsible for the persons immune system.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;The body responds to these toxins by making antibodies to those specific toxins. However, those antibodies do not completely protect the person from future Group A Streptococcal infections since there are 12 different pyrogenic exotoxins possible.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

===Microbiology===

The disease is caused by secretion of [[pyrogen (fever)|pyrogenic]] exotoxins by the infecting ''Streptococcus'' bacteria.&lt;ref name="Zabriskie1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Zabriskie|first = J. B.|year = 1964|title = The role of temperate bacteriophage in the production of erythrogenic toxin by Group A ''Streptococci''|journal = [[J. Exp.

M. |year=2002 |title=A Half-century of Streptococcal Research: Then &amp; Now |journal=[[Indian Journal of Medical Research|Indian J Med Res]] |volume=115 |issue= |pages=215–241 |doi= |pmid=12440194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erythrogenic toxin|Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A]] (''speA'') is probably the best studied of these toxins. It is carried by the bacteriophage T12 which integrates into the streptococcal genome from where the toxin is transcribed. The phage itself integrates into a serine tRNA gene on the chromosome.&lt;ref name="McShan1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McShan |first=W. M. |last2=Ferretti |first2=J. J. |year=1997 |title=Genetic diversity in temperate bacteriophages of ''Streptococcus pyogenes'': identification of a second attachment site for phages carrying the erythrogenic toxin A gene |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=179 |issue=20 |pages=6509–6511 |doi= |pmc=179571 |pmid=9335304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T12 virus itself has not been placed into a taxon by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]. It has a double-stranded DNA genome and on morphological grounds appears to be a member of the ''[[Siphoviridae]].''

The ''speA'' gene was cloned and sequenced in 1986.&lt;ref name="Weeks1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weeks |first=C. R. |last2=Ferretti |first2=J. J. |year=1986 |title=Nucleotide sequence of the type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) gene from ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' bacteriophage T12 |journal=Infect Immun |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=144–150 |doi= |pmid=3514452 |pmc=262210}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 753 base pairs in length and encodes a 29.244 [[Atomic mass unit|kiloDalton]] (kDa) [[protein]]. The protein contains a putative 30-
amino-acid [[signal peptide]]; removal of the signal sequence gives a predicted molecular weight of 25.787 kDa for the secreted protein. Both a promoter and a ribosome binding site ([[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]]) are present upstream of the gene. A transcriptional terminator is located 69 bases downstream from the translational termination [[codon]]. The carboxy terminal portion of the protein exhibits extensive homology with the carboxy terminus of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[Enterotoxin type B|enterotoxins B]] and C1.

Streptococcal phages other than T12 may also carry the ''speA'' gene.&lt;ref name="Yu1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=C. E. |last2=Ferretti |first2=J. J. |year=1991 |title=Molecular characterization of new group A streptococcal bacteriophages containing the gene for streptococcal erythrogenic toxin A (''speA'') |journal=Mol Gen Genet |volume=231 |issue=1 |pages=161–168 |pmid=1753942 |doi=10.1007/BF00293833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Although the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with [[strep throat]] can be useful.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; [[rapid antigen detection test]] and [[throat culture]].&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt;

The rapid antigen detection test is a very [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific test]] but not very sensitive. This means that if the result is positive (indicating that the Group A Strep Antigen was detected and therefore confirming that the patient has a Group A Strep Pharyngitis) then it is appropriate to treat them with antibiotics. However, if the Rapid Antigen Detection Test is negative (indicating that they do not have Group A Strep Pharyngitis), then a throat culture is required to confirm since it could be a [[False positives and false negatives|false negative]] result.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Red Book Atlas of Pediatric Infectious Diseases|last=American Academy of Pediatrics|first=|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|year=2013|isbn=9781581107951|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=Carol|location=|pages=473–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The throat culture is the current gold standard for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt;

[[Serology|Serologic testing]] looks for the antibodies that the body produces against the streptococcal infection including antistreptolysin-O and antideoxyribonuclease B. It takes the body 2–3 weeks to make these antibodies so this type of testing is not useful for diagnosing a current infection. However, it is useful when assessing a patient who may have one of the complications from a previous streptococcal infection.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt;

Throat cultures done after antibiotic therapy can tell you if the infection has been removed. These throat swabs however are not indicated because up to 25% of properly treated individuals can continue to carry the streptococcal infection while asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===

* Viral [[exanthem]]: Viral infections are often accompanied by a rash which can be described as [[morbilliform]] or [[Maculopapular rash|maculopapular]]. This type of rash is accompanied by a prodromal period of cough and runny nose in addition to a fever, indicative of a viral process.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
* Allergic or [[contact dermatitis]]: The erythematous appearance of the skin will be in a more localized distribution rather than the diffuse and generalized rash seen in Scarlet Fever.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;
* [[Drug eruption]]: These are potential side effects of taking certain drugs such as Penicillin. The reddened maculopapular rash which results can be itchy and be accompanied by a fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ferri's Color Atlas and Text of Clinical Medicine|last=Ferri|first=Fred|publisher=Saunders|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kawasaki disease]] Children with this disease also present with a strawberry tongue and undergo a desquamative process on their palms and soles. However these children tend to be younger than 5 years old, their fever lasts longer (at least five days) and they have additional clinical criteria (including signs such as conjunctival redness and cracked lips) which can help distinguish this from Scarlet Fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cardiology, Third Edition|last=Kato|first=Hirohisa|publisher=Elsevier|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=1613–1626}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Toxic shock syndrome]]: Both Streptococcal and Staphylococcal bacteria can cause this syndrome. Clinical manifestations include diffuse rash and desquamation of the palms and soles. Can be distinguished from Scarlet Fever by low blood pressure, the rash will lack sandpaper texture, and multi-organ system involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Dermatology|last=Habif|first=Thomas|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=534–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]]: This is a disease which occurs primarily in young children due to a toxin producing strain of the bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus. The abrupt start of the fever and diffused sunburned appearance of the rash can resemble Scarlet Fever. However, this rash is associated with tenderness and large blister formation. These blisters easily pop and then cause the skin to peel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emergency Medicine Clinical Essentials|last=Adams|first=James|publisher=Saunders|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=149–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Staphylococcal Scarlet Fever: The rash is identical to the streptococcal scarlet fever in distribution and texture however the skin affected by the rash will be tender.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

==Prevention==

One method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group A streptococcal infections. This method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group A streptococci that can cause the infection.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The vaccine approach has a greater likelihood of effectively preventing group A streptococcal infections because vaccine formulations can target multiple subtypes of the bacteria.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; A vaccine developed by George and Gladys Dick in 1924 was discontinued due to poor efficacy and the introduction of antibiotics. Difficulties in vaccine development include the considerable strain variety of group A streptococci present in the environment and the amount of time and number of people needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of any potential vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_bacterial/en/index3.html|title=Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR)—Group A Streptococcus|publisher=World Health Organization|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513105141/http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/soa_bacterial/en/index3.html|archivedate=13 May 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=15 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several attempts to create a vaccine in the past few decades.

==Treatment==

[[Antibiotics]] to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin however will happen despite treatment.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt; As long as antibiotics are started within 9 days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first 2 weeks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nelson Pediatric Symptom-Based Diagnosis|last=Tanz|first=Robert|publisher=Elsevier|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=1–14|chapter=Sore Throat}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The antibiotic of choice is [[Penicillin|penicillin V]] which is taken by mouth in pill form. Children who are not able to take pills can be given [[amoxicillin]] which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days.&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt; [[Benzathine penicillin G|Benzathine Penicillin G]] can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2018|last=Ferri|first=Fred|publisher=Elsevier|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the patient is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of ([[Β-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam antibiotics]]), a first generation [[cephalosporin]] is used.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Cephalosporin antibiotics however can still cause adverse reactions in patients whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a [[Type I hypersensitivity reaction|Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction]]. In those cases it is appropriate to choose [[clindamycin]] or [[erythromycin]] instead.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

Tonsillectomy, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated. This is due to the fact that a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
A [[Drug resistance|drug-resistant]] strain of scarlet fever, resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics such as [[erythromycin]], but retaining drug-sensitivity to [[beta-lactam antibiotics]] such as penicillin, emerged in [[Hong Kong]] in 2011, accounting for at least two deaths in that city—the first such in over a decade.&lt;ref name=APo&gt;{{cite news|title=Second HK child dies of mutated scarlet fever|url=http://www.salon.com/wires/health/2011/06/22/D9O0TMJO0_as_hong_kong_scarlet_fever/index.html|accessdate=23 June 2011|newspaper=Associated Press (online)|date=22 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624213104/http://www.salon.com/wires/health/2011/06/22/D9O0TMJO0_as_hong_kong_scarlet_fever/index.html|archivedate=24 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of circulating strains of the group A ''Streptococcus'' which cause scarlet fever in Hong Kong are resistant to macrolide [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]], says Professor [[Yuen Kwok-yung|Kwok-yung Yuen]], head of [[Hong Kong University|Hong Kong University's]] [[microbiology]] department. Previously, observed [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] rates had been 10–30%; the increase is likely the result of overuse of macrolide antibiotics in recent years.

== Epidemiology ==

Scarlet fever occurs equally in both males and females.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Children are most commonly infected, typically between 5–15 years old. Although streptococcal infections can happen at any time of year, infection rates peak in the winter and spring months, typically in colder climates.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

The morbidity and mortality of scarlet fever has declined since the 18th and 19th century when there were epidemics caused by this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2017|title=Managing Scarlet Fever|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=55|issue=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 the mortality rate in multiple places reached 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tropical Infectious Diseases: Principles, Pathogens and Practice|last=Guerrant|first=Richard|last2=Walker|first2=David|last3=Weller|first3=Peter|publisher=Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=9780702039355|location=|pages=203–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improvement in prognosis can be attributed to the use of penicillin in the treatment of this disease.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The frequency of scarlet fever cases has also been declining over the past century. However, there have been several reported outbreaks of the disease in various countries in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basetti|first=S.|last2=Hodgson|first2=J.|last3=Rawson|first3=T.M.|last4=Majeed|first4=A.|date=August 2017|title=Scarlet Fever: A guide for general practitioners|url=|journal=London Journal of Primary Care|volume=9|pages=77–79|pmc=5649319|via=|doi=10.1080/17571472.2017.1365677|pmid=29081840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these recent increases remains unclear in the medical community. Between 2013 and 2016 population rates of scarlet fever in England increased from 8.2 to 33.2 per 100,000 and hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarlet fever in England reaches highest level in 50 years|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204029.article|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It is unclear when a description of this disease was first recorded.&lt;ref name=Rolleston1928&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rolleston |first=J. D. |year=1928 |title=The History of Scarlet Fever |journal=[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] |volume=2 |issue=3542 |pages=926–929 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3542.926 |pmid=20774279 |pmc=2456687}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]], writing around 400 BC, described the condition of a patient with a reddened skin and fever.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferretti|first=Joseph|last2=Kohler|first2=Werner|date=February 2016|title=History of Streptococcal Research|url=|journal=Streptococcus pyogenes : Basic Biology to Clinical Manifestations|volume=|pages=|pmid=26866232|separator=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first description of the disease in the medical literature appeared in the 1553 book ''De Tumoribus praeter Naturam'' by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] anatomist and physician [[Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia]], where he referred to it as ''rossalia''. He also made a point to distinguish that this presentation had different characteristics than measles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was redescribed by [[Johann Weyer]] during an epidemic in lower [[Germany]] between 1564 and 1565; he referred to it as ''scalatina anginosa''. The first unequivocal description of scarlet fever appeared in a book by [[Jean Coytard de Thaire|Joannes Coyttarus]] of [[Poitiers]], ''De febre purpura epidemiale et contagiosa libri duo'', which was published in 1578 in [[Paris]]. [[Daniel Sennert]] of [[Wittenberg]] described the classical 'scarlatinal desquamation' in 1572 and was also the first to describe the early [[arthritis]], scarlatinal [[dropsy]], and [[ascites]] associated with the disease.

In 1675 the term that has been commonly used to refer to scarlet fever, "scarlatina", was written by Thomas Sydenham, an English physician.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1827, [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] was the first to recognize the involvement of the renal system in scarlet fever.

The association between streptococci and disease was first described in 1874 by [[Theodor Billroth]], discussing patients with skin infections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Billroth also coined the genus name ''Streptococcus''. In 1884 Friedrich Julius Rosenbach edited the name to its current one, ''Streptococcus pyogenes,'' after further looking at the bacteria in the skin lesions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The organism was first cultured in 1883 by the German surgeon [[Friedrich Fehleisen]]. He cultured it from [[erysipelas]] lesions.

Also in 1884, the German physician [[Friedrich Loeffler]] was the first to show the presence of streptococci in the throats of patients with scarlet fever. Because not all patients with pharyngeal streptococci developed scarlet fever, these findings remained controversial for some time. The association between streptococci and scarlet fever was confirmed by Alphonse Dochez and George and Gladys Dick in the early 1900s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Nil Filatow (in 1895) and Clement Dukes (in 1894) described an exanthematous disease which they thought was a form of rubella, but in 1900, Dukes described it as a separate illness which came to be known as [[Dukes' disease]],&lt;ref name="Duke original"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Clement|title=On the confusion of two different diseases under the name of rubella (rose-rash).|journal=The Lancet|date=30 June 1900|volume=156|issue=4011|pages=89–95|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)65681-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filatov’s disease, or fourth disease. However, in 1979, Keith Powell identified it as in fact the same illness as the form of scarlet fever which is caused by staphylococcal exotoxin and is known as [[staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid11214144"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weisse|first=Martin E|title=The fourth disease, 1900–2000|journal=The Lancet|date=31 December 2000|volume=357|issue=9252|pages=299–301|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03623-0|pmid=11214144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid367152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=KR|title=Filatow-Dukes' disease.

[[Scarlet fever serum]] from horses was used in the treatment of children beginning in 1900 and reduced mortality rates significantly.

In 1906, the [[Austria]]n [[pediatrician]] [[Clemens von Pirquet]] postulated that disease-causing immune complexes were responsible for the [[nephritis]] that followed scarlet fever.&lt;ref name=Huber2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huber |first=B. |year=2006 |title=100 years of allergy: Clemens von Pirquet—his idea of allergy and its immanent concept of disease |journal=Wien.

[[Bacteriophage]]s were discovered in 1915 by [[Frederick Twort]]. His work was overlooked and bacteriophages were later rediscovered by [[Felix d'Herelle]] in 1917. The specific association of scarlet fever with the group A streptococci had to await the development of [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield's]] streptococcal grouping scheme in the 1920s. George and Gladys Dick showed that cell-free filtrates could induce the erythematous reaction characteristic of scarlet fever, proving that this reaction was due to a toxin. Karelitz and Stempien discovered that extracts from human serum globulin and placental globulin can be used as lightening agents for scarlet fever and this was used later as the basis for the Dick test. The association of scarlet fever and bacteriophages was described in 1926 by Cantucuzene and Boncieu.&lt;ref name="Cantacuzène1926"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cantacuzène |first=J. |last2=Bonciu |first2=O. |year=1926 |title=Modifications subies par des streptocoques d'origine non scarlatineuse au contact de produits scarlatineux filtrès|language=fr |journal=C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris |volume=182 |issue= |pages=1185–1187 |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Scarlet fever serum|antitoxin]] for scarlet fever was developed in 1924.

The first toxin which causes this disease was cloned and sequenced in 1986 by Weeks and Ferretti.&lt;ref name="Weeks1986"/&gt; The discovery of penicillin and its subsequent widespread use has significantly reduced the mortality of this once feared disease. Reports of cases of Scarlet fever in recent years has been on the rise. Countries including England, Wales, South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Hong Kong. Researchers are unsure as to what has caused the spike in cases of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamagni|first1=Theresa|last2=Guy|first2=Rebecca|last3=Chand|first3=Meera|title=Resurgence of scarlet fever in England, 2014–16: a population-based surveillance study|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30693-X/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr|publisher=The Lancet: Infectious Disease|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branswell|first1=Helen|title=Scarlet fever, a disease of yore, is making a comeback in parts of the world|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/27/scarlet-fever-cases/|publisher=STAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Dick test  ===

The [[Gladys Dick|Dick test]] was invented in 1924 and was used to identify those susceptible to scarlet fever.&lt;ref name=Dick1924&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dick |first=G. F. |first2=G. H. |last2=Dick |year=1924 |title=A skin test for susceptibility to scarlet fever |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|J Am Med Assoc]] |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=265–266 |doi=10.1001/jama.1924.02650300011003 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dick test consisted of injecting a diluted strain of the streptococci known to cause scarlet fever into a person's skin. A local reaction in the skin at the site of injection appeared in people who were susceptible to developing scarlet fever. This reaction was most notable around 24 hours after the injection but could be seen as early as 4–6 hours. If there is no reaction seen in the skin, then that person was assumed to have already developed immunity to the disease and was not at risk of developing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claude|first=B|last2=McCartney|first2=J.E.|last3=McGarrity|first3=J.|date=January 1925|title=The Dick test for susceptibility to scarlet fever|journal=The Lancet|volume=205|issue=5292|pages=230–231|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)56009-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Family of Awaya Senkichi Hiroshima mayor.jpg|thumb|Senkichi Awaya (third left), with his brothers, wife and eldest daughter]]
Senkichi Awaya was born the second son of {{Nihongo|Eisuke Awaya|粟屋 頴祐|Awaya Eisuke}}, a railway bureaucrat and nephew of [[Viscount]] [[Inoue Masaru (bureaucrat)|Inoue Masaru]], in the city of [[Sendai]], after which he was named. He spent his [[high school]] years in [[Yonago, Tottori]] and then entered the First Higher School, the preparatory division to the [[Imperial University of Tokyo]], where he studied [[German law]].&lt;ref name="tsugami222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsugami|1966|pp=222–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miyoshi2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miyoshi|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisuke had a [[drinking problem]], over which his wife often went to seek help at a local [[Christian church]] with her children. [[Christianity]] therefore was the most familiar [[religion]] for Senkichi since his childhood. One day when he was a high school student, Senkichi was advised by his [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] to read [[Kanzō Uchimura]]'s ''The Biblical Studies'', which impressed him and made him a devout Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadota|2009|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his father, he grew up to be a [[teetotaler]].&lt;ref name="miyoshi2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsugami|1966|pp=107–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awaya started [[judo]] in his early teen, and later obtained a fifth degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] and became a higher-ranking winner in the national police judo championships.&lt;ref name="miyoshi2001"/&gt;

In March 1922, Awaya married Sachiyo Andō, who gave birth to four sons and three daughters; five of whom [[infant mortality|survived beyond infancy]].

==Early career==
After graduating from the university, Awaya joined the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]], assigned to the Hiroshima Prefectural Police in 1919. He was installed as district executive of [[Mitsugi District]] in March 1923.&lt;ref name="tsugami222"/&gt;

In July 1924, Awaya was assigned to the prefectural government of [[Hokkaidō]], where he was appointed chief of the [[city planning]] division the following year. Living in [[Sapporo]], he was a regular churchgoer at the Independent Church of Sapporo. Awaya had a chance to talk personally with Kanzō Uchimura, for whom he had a lifelong respect, when Uchimura visited Sapporo in the summer of 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsugami|1966|pp=123–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Awaya and his family socialized with Uchimura and his son, who became [[Commissioner of Baseball (NPB)|Commissioner of the Nippon Professional Baseball]] later.&lt;ref name="miyoshi2001"/&gt;

Awaya was appointed [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] of the [[Kōchi Prefecture|Kōchi]] Prefecutural Police in July 1929. He succeeded in settling a long-unsolved dispute between a fishery company and local fishermen. Shinobu Agata, who was [[governor]] of [[Osaka Prefecture]] then, appreciated Awaya's negotiating ability and asked him to be the head of the Osaka Prefectural Police. He accepted the governor's offer in 1932.&lt;ref name="tsugami222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miyoshi2001"/&gt;

==Clash with the Army==
On 17 June 1933 occurred what is later called the [[Go-Stop Incident]], in which the verbal altercation between two young men—an off-duty [[soldier]] in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a [[policeman]] who warned the soldier— developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the Home Ministry and the Army.&lt;ref name="tobe248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&amp;lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hisaichi Terauchi]], Commander of the [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|4th Division]] of the Army, demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the army's prestige. Awaya, however, refused to apologize because he believed that [[military personnel]] should also observe the traffic regulations as well as [[civilian]]s.&lt;ref name="tobe248"/&gt; Although their freedom of speech was limited under the [[Peace Preservation Law]], the public was critical of the army's highhandedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miyoshi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five months later, Awaya and Terauchi resolved their conflict through the mediation of the [[governor]] of [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyogo]], with both apologizing to each other. A year later, when Awaya left the police, however, the Home Ministry and the Army made an agreement that would preclude the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel and bolster [[militarism in Japan]].&lt;ref name="tobe248"/&gt;

Awaya was transferred to the prefectural government of [[Aichi]] in January 1935. After serving as [[Ōita Prefecture|Oita]]'s governor for 20 months, he was farmed out to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry]]. In March 1942, he resigned his office at age 48. He sequestered himself at his house in [[Setagaya]], [[Tokyo]], devoted to faith at the Marunouchi Bible study group, led by [[Toraji Tsukamoto]], the leader of Nonchurch movement after Kanzō Uchimura's death.&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"&gt;{{Harvnb|City of Hiroshima|1971|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayor of Hiroshima==
In 1943, Awaya was offered the mayoralty of [[Hiroshima]] by his [[senpai]] [[Okinori Kaya]]. He had not been willing to accept it until he decided to try himself when one of his friends told him that mayors should never be angry.&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"/&gt;

On the Sunday before he left Tokyo for Hiroshima, Awaya attended at the Bible study group as usual. There he talked about how he had stood in his belief and practiced teetotalism through his life in bureaucracy. Reverend Toraji Tsukamoto wrote in his diary, "Mr. Awaya's words are proceleusmatic and impressive to the audience. Blessed is Hiroshima to have such a great mayor!"&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"/&gt;

Awaya took the mayoralty in July 1943. Militarists held bad feelings toward him, but among citizens his popularity was high for his rectitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardest job that he had to do in Hiroshima was to order to demolish buildings to create [[firebreak]]s according to the military's directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awaya lived at the official mayoral residence in the Kakomachi district of Hiroshima apart from his family at first, but he decided to invite his family after the [[Great Tokyo Air Raid]], believing that Hiroshima was much safer than Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Sachiyo and third son Shinobu came to live in Hiroshima in April and in June 1945, respectively.&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"/&gt; On 3 August, three days before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Senkichi and Sachiyo Awaya invited their 3-year-old granddaughter Ayako Sakama.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Hiroshima red cross hospital october 1945.jpg|thumb|The Red Cross Hospital near Hiroshima's city office]]
When the [[United States Army Air Forces]] dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Senkichi Awaya was eating breakfast with Shinobu and Ayako.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt; All of them are believed to have died instantly after the bombing.&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"/&gt;

The city officials who had survived the bomb began to gather at the city office that afternoon, but the mayor was still missing. The city's [[treasurer]] went to look for Awaya and found [[corpse]]s at the ruin of the mayoral residence. On 9 August, Awaya's chief secretary Kazumasa Maruyama and his coworkers went there to confirm that the half-burnt corpses were those of the mayor and his son. After finding a [[skeleton]] which appeared to be Ayako's, they carried out the unburnt parts of the bodies to cremate them at the park near the city hall.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|City of Hiroshima|1971|pp=59, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadota|2009|pp=198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachiyo was the only person who had escaped instant death in the mayoral residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadota|2009|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seriously injured, she was carried into the [[Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital]] (Nisseki Hospital) and taken care of by her daughters, but died on 7 September that year.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiroshima6567"/&gt;

The officials chose [[Shigetada Morishita]], who had been one of the two [[deputy mayor]]s, as [[acting mayor]] upon confirming Awaya's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|City of Hiroshima|1971|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Shichirō Kihara]], whom the city council appointed mayor on 22 October 1945.

Toraji Tsukamoto delivered a [[eulogy]] for Awaya and his family at their official [[funeral service]] held in December 1945. They were buried at [[Tama Cemetery]] in [[western Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kadota|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Mayor Awaya monument Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|The cenotaph stands on the side of the Motoyasu River.]]
In August 1995, a half century after the bombing, the government of Hiroshima created a [[monument]] in commemoration of Awaya's death where the mayoral residence used to stand. Tsuneo Kanazawa, the minister of the Independent Church of Sapporo, wrote an epitaph to commemorate his 51-year-long life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fukase|Ōtomo|1982|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awaya's private house in Setagaya, Tokyo, was inherited by his eldest daughter Motoko Sakama.&lt;ref name="csm9aug"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated a cultural asset by the government of Tokyo in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=坂間家|journal=Setagaya Life Magazine|volume=16|pages=92–93|publisher=Ei Publishing|location=Tokyo|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awaya's third daughter Chikako graduated from the [[International Christian University]], receiving a [[scholarship]] from an anonymous donor who turned out to be an American woman.&lt;ref name="csm9aug"/&gt; His fourth son Tadashi became a public official like his father.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt;

The diary of Yasuko, Awaya's second daughter, was featured in a documentary by Ryūshō Kadota in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=16 July 2009|script-title=ja:被爆死の粟屋元広島市長の次女 康子さんの評伝 日記を基に刊行|last =Dōmen|first=Masaaki|publisher=Hiroshima Peace Media Center, Chūgoku Shimbun|accessdate=24 July 2009|location=Hiroshima|language= Japanese|url=http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20090716153755186_ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student of today's [[Ochanomizu University]], she was conscripted to work at an armaments factory in northern Tokyo during the closing months of the war. Two weeks after [[Japan's surrender]], she went to Hiroshima to take care of her heavily injured mother until her death on 7 September 1945. Yasuko also died from [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] at age 19 on 24 November of that year.&lt;ref name="csm2aug"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6318">[[Sleep]] is important in regulating [[metabolism]]. Mammalian sleep can be sub-divided into two distinct phases - [[REM sleep|REM]] (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans and cats, NREM sleep has four stages, where the third and fourth stages are considered [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS). SWS is considered deep sleep, when metabolism is least active.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Sunil|author2=Kavuru, Mani |title=Sleep and Metabolism: Overview|journal=International Journal of Endocrinology|date=2 August 2010|PMC=2929498|pmid=20811596|doi=10.1155/2010/270832|volume=2010|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metabolism]] involves two [[biochemical]] processes that occur in living organisms. The first is [[anabolism]], which refers to the build up of molecules. The second is [[catabolism]], the breakdown of molecules. These two processes work to regulate the amount of energy the body uses to maintain itself. During non-REM sleep, [[metabolic rate]] and brain temperature are lowered to deal with damages that may have occurred during time of wakefulness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Normal metabolism ==

After eating, the [[pancreas]] releases [[insulin]]. Insulin signals [[muscle cells|muscle]] and [[fat cells]] to absorb [[glucose]] from [[food]]. As a result, [[blood glucose]] levels return to normal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Matthew|title=Sleep Deprivation I: Immune Function and Metabolism|date=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleep deprivation and Type 2 diabetes==
[[Insulin resistance|Insulin-Resistant]] Metabolism

Baseline levels of insulin do not signal muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose. When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. Blood sugar will then rapidly drop. This can progress to [[type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Sleep loss can affect the basic metabolic functions of storing [[carbohydrates]] and regulating [[hormones]]. Reduction of sleep from eight hours to four hours produces changes in [[glucose tolerance]] and [[endocrine system|endocrine function]]. Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center followed 11 healthy young men for 16 consecutive nights. The first 3 nights, the young men slept for the normal 8 hours. The next 6 nights, they slept for 4 hours. The next 7 nights, they spent 12 hours in bed. They all had the same diet. They found that there were changes in [[glucose metabolism]] that resemble that of [[type 2 diabetes]] patients. When the participants were tested after sleep deprivation, they took 40% longer than normal to regulate [[blood sugar]] levels after a high-[[carbohydrate]] meal. The secretion of insulin and the body's response to insulin decrease by 30%. [[Sleep deprivation]] also alters the productions of [[hormones]], lowering the secretion of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] and increasing blood levels of [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of Deep Sleep May Increase Risk of Type 2 Diabetes|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080101093903.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

It has also been shown that when slow-wave sleep was suppressed for three nights, young healthy subjects were 25% less sensitive to insulin. They needed more insulin to get rid of the same amount of glucose. If the body does not release more insulin to compensate, the blood-glucose levels will increase. This resembles impaired glucose tolerance, which can result in type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

==Sleep deprivation and appetite control==
Sleep plays a vital role in regulating metabolism and [[appetite]]. When sleep deprived, the metabolic system will be out of balance, which will ultimately affect the dietary choices people make. Teens who are sleep deprived crave more carbohydrates. Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for [[obesity]] among young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daytime Sleepiness is associated with an increased craving for carbs among teen|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110614101246.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

There are two hormones, [[leptin]] and [[ghrelin]], that are important in appetite control. Leptin, released by [[adipose tissue]], is a hormone that inhibits [[appetite]] and increases energy expenditure. Ghrelin, released from the stomach, is a hormone that increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation can cause a 19% decrease in the level of leptin. Subjects were deprived of sleep for 2 nights (4 hours per night) and got compensation of sleep for the next 2 nights (10 hours per night). Leptin levels decreased by 18% and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. There was an increase in hunger level by 23 which is probably due to the reduction leptin level. Subjects also preferred high carbohydrate foods (sweets, salty food and starchy food). Craving for salty food increased by 45%. Sleep deprivation can cause people to intake food for emotional/psychological need rather than caloric need of the body.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Chronic sleep deprivation (less than 8 hours of sleep) was associated with increase in [[body mass index]] (BMI). In the Wisconsin sleep cohort study of 1024 patients, the shorter sleep durations showed reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin. In a study with 3000 patients, it has been found that men and women who sleep less than 5 hours have elevated [[body mass index]] (BMI). In another study that followed about 70.000 women for 16 years, there was a significant increase in body weight in those who slept 5 hours or less compared to those who slept 7–8 hours.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trebekk|title=Sleep and metabolic control: waking to a problem?|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Physiology|year=2007|volume=34|issue=1-2|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sleep time decreased over time from the 1950s to 2000s from about 8.5 hours to 6.5 hours, there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity from about 10% to about 23%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

A '''test''' or '''examination''' (informally, '''exam''' or '''evaluation''') is an [[Educational assessment|assessment]] intended to measure a test-taker's [[knowledge]], [[skill]], [[aptitude]], [[physical fitness]], or classification in many other topics (e.g., [[belief]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/test|title=Definition of TEST|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a [[Computer-adaptive testing|computer]], or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. For example, in a closed book test, a test taker is usually required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in an open book test, a test taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding. A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test would be a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a [[final examination]] administered by a teacher in a classroom or an I.Q. test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a [[Grade (education)|grade]] or a [[test score]].&lt;ref&gt;Thissen, D., &amp; Wainer, H. (2001). Test Scoring. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. ''Page 1, sentence 1.''&lt;/ref&gt; A test score may be interpreted with regards to a [[Norm-referenced test|norm]] or [[Criterion-referenced test|criterion]], or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of a large number of participants.
An exam is meant to test a child's knowledge or
willingness to give time to manipulate that subject.

A [[standardized test]] is any test that is administered and scored in a consistent manner to ensure legal defensibility.&lt;ref&gt;North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/students/earlycld/ea5lk3.htm NCREL.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305174206/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/students/earlycld/ea5lk3.htm |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standardized tests are often used in [[education]], [[professional certification]], [[psychology]] (e.g., [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]]), the [[military]], and many other fields.

A non-standardized test is usually flexible in scope and format, variable in difficulty and significance. Since these tests are usually developed by individual instructors, the format and difficulty of these tests may not be widely adopted or used by other instructors or institutions. A non-standardized test may be used to determine the proficiency level of students, to motivate students to study, and to provide feedback to students. In some instances, a teacher may develop non-standardized tests that resemble standardized tests in scope, format, and difficulty for the purpose of preparing their students for an upcoming standardized test.&lt;ref name="Put to the Test: The Effects of External Testing on Teachers. Educational Researcher"/&gt; Finally, the frequency and setting by which a non-standardized tests are administered are highly variable and are usually constrained by the duration of the class period. A class instructor may for example, administer a test on a weekly basis or just twice a semester. Depending on the policy of the instructor or institution, the duration of each test itself may last for only five minutes to an entire class period.

In contrasts to non-standardized tests, standardized tests are widely used, fixed in terms of scope, difficulty and format, and are usually significant in consequences. Standardized tests are usually held on fixed dates as determined by the test developer, educational institution, or governing body, which may or may not be administered by the instructor, held within the classroom, or constrained by the classroom period. Although there is little variability between different copies of the same type of standardized test (e.g., [[SAT]] or [[GRE]]), there is variability between different types of standardized tests.

Any test with important consequences for the individual test taker is referred to as a [[high-stakes test]].

A test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider. In some instances, the developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration. For example, [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS), a nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization, develops standardized tests such as the SAT but may not directly be involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests. As with the development and administration of educational tests, the format and level of difficulty of the tests themselves are highly variable and there is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies. In general, tests developed and administered by individual instructors are non-standardized whereas tests developed by testing organizations are standardized.assesment

==History==

===Early history===
Ancient China was the first country in the world that implemented a nationwide standardized test, which was called the [[imperial examination]]. The main purpose of this examination was to select able candidates for specific governmental positions.&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Level Examination, Chinese Language and Culture, Paper 1A&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial examination was established by the [[Sui dynasty]] in 605 AD and was later abolished by the [[Qing dynasty]] 1300 years later in 1905. England had adopted this [[examination system]] in 1806 to select specific candidates for positions in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]], modeled on the Chinese [[imperial examination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s10/ideas.pdf Bodde, D., ''Chinese Ideas in the West'']&lt;/ref&gt; This examination system was later applied to education and it started to influence other parts of the world as it became a prominent standard (e.g. regulations to prevent the markers from knowing the identity of candidates), of delivering [[standardised test]]s.

===Modern era===

====Civil service====
[[File:Tripos_exam_1842.jpg|thumb|right|From the mid 19th century, universities began to institute written examinations to assess the aptitude of the pupils. This is an excerpt from the 1842 [[Tripos]] examination in [[Cambridge University]].]]
As the profession transitioned to the modern mass-education system, the style of examination became fixed, with the stress on standardized papers to be sat by large numbers of students. Leading the way in this regard was the burgeoning [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] that began to move toward a [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] basis for selection in the mid 19th century in England.

British civil service was influenced by the [[imperial examination]]s system and  meritocratic system of China. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], China argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde,|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as in 1806, the [[Honourable East India Company]] established a [[East India Company College|college]] near London to train and examine administrators of the Company's territories in India.&lt;ref&gt;(Bodde 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Examinations for the Indian 'civil service'- a term coined by the Company – were introduced in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zR7Nsts5zcC|title=The Higher Civil Service in the United States: Quest for Reform|author=Mark W. Huddleston, William W. Boyer|year=1996|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[William Gladstone]], commissioned Sir [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Stafford Northcote]] and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] to look into the operation and organisation of the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]]. Influenced by the ancient Chinese Imperial Examination, the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 made four principal recommendations: that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through standardized written examination, that candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, that recruits should be graded into a hierarchy and that promotion should be through achievement, rather than 'preferment, patronage or purchase'.&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Civil Service Commission]] was also set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote–Trevelyan recommendations were implemented over some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|work=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northcote–Trevelyan model of meritocratic examination remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change. It also had a great international influence and was adapted by members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] established a similar system in the United States.

====Education====
[[File:StateLibQld 1 100348.jpg|thumb|Students taking a [[scholarship]] examination inside a classroom in 1940]]
Written examinations had been unheard of before 1702 for European education. "The Chinese examinations were described repeatedly in Western literature on China of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Bodde, D., [http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s10/ideas.pdf ''Chinese Ideas in the West'', p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standardized test]]ing began to influence the method of examination in British universities from the 1850s, where [[oral examination]] had been the norm since the [[Middle Ages]]. In the US, the transition happened under the influence of the educational reformer [[Horace Mann]]. This shift decisively helped to move education into the modern era, by standardizing expanding curricula in the sciences and [[humanities]], creating a rationalized method for the evaluation of teachers and institutions and creating a basis for the [[Tracking (education)|streaming of students]] according to ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty5Tp9MC2wMC|title=Writing in the Academic Disciplines: A Curricular History|author=David R. Russell|year=2002|publisher=SIU Press|pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both World War I and World War II demonstrated the necessity of [[standardized test]]ing and the benefits associated with these tests. Tests were used to determine the mental aptitude of recruits to the military. The US Army used the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale]] to test the [[IQ]] of the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M., &amp; Saccuzzo, D. P. (2009) ''Psychological Testing'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, industry began using tests to evaluate applicants for various jobs based on performance. In 1952, the first Advanced Placement (AP) test was administered to begin closing the gap between high schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075824/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day use==

===Education===
Some countries such as the United Kingdom and France require all their secondary school students to take a standardized test on individual subjects such as the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)]] (in England) and [[Baccalauréat]] respectively as a requirement for graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GCSEs: The official guide to the system | url = http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/GCSE_Guide.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120604144017/http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/GCSE_Guide.pdf | archivedate = 2012-06-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests are used primarily to assess a student's proficiency in specific subjects such as mathematics, science, or literature. In contrast, high school students in other countries such as the United States may not be required to take a standardized test to graduate. Moreover, students in these countries usually take standardized tests only to apply for a position in a university program and are typically given the option of taking different standardized tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] or [[SAT]], which are used primarily to measure a student's reasoning skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the SAT | url=http://sat.collegeboard.com/why-sat/what-is-sat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACThistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.act.org/aboutact/history.html |title=About ACT: History |accessdate=October 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008113919/http://www.act.org/aboutact/history.html |archivedate=October 8, 2006 |df= }}Name changed in 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; High school students in the United States may also take [[Advanced Placement]] tests on specific subjects to fulfill university-level credit. Depending on the policies of the test maker or country, administration of standardized tests may be done in a large hall, classroom, or testing center. A [[Exam invigilator|proctor or invigilator]] may also be present during the testing period to provide instructions, to answer questions, or to prevent cheating.

Grades or test scores from standardized test may also be used by universities to determine if a student applicant should be admitted into one of its academic or professional programs. For example, universities in the United Kingdom admit applicants into their undergraduate programs based primarily or solely on an applicant's grades on pre-university qualifications such as the [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE A-levels]] or [[Cambridge Pre-U]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Pre-U"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/preu |title=Cambridge Pre-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="International Qualifications - University of Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/international_students/international_qualifications/index.html |title=International Qualifications - University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822000805/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/international_students/international_qualifications/index.html |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, universities in the United States use an applicant's test score on the SAT or ACT as just one of their many admission criteria to determine if an applicant should be admitted into one of its undergraduate programs. The other criteria in this case may include the applicant's grades from high school, extracurricular activities, personal statement, and letters of recommendations.&lt;ref name="Harvard College Admissions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/apply/application_process/requirements.html |title=Harvard College Admissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once admitted, undergraduate students in the United Kingdom or United States may be required by their respective programs to take a [[comprehensive examination]] as a requirement for passing their courses or for graduating from their respective programs.

Standardized tests are sometimes used by certain countries to manage the quality of their educational institutions. For example, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] in the United States requires individual states to develop assessments for students in certain grades. In practice, these assessments typically appear in the form of standardized tests. Test scores of students in specific grades of an educational institution are then used to determine the status of that educational institution, i.e., whether it should be allowed to continue to operate in the same way or to receive funding.

Finally, standardized tests are sometimes used to compare proficiencies of students from different institutions or countries. For example, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] uses [[Programme for International Student Assessment|Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)]] to evaluate certain skills and knowledge of students from different participating countries.&lt;ref name=PISA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pisa.oecd.org/pages/0,2987,en_32252351_32235731_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=PISA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing and certification===

Standardized tests are sometimes used by certain governing bodies to determine if a test taker is allowed to practice a profession, to use a specific job title, or to claim competency in a specific set of skills. For example, a test taker who intends to become a lawyer is usually required by a governing body such as a governmental bar licensing agency to pass a [[bar exam]].

===Immigration and naturalization===

Standardized tests are also used in certain countries to regulate immigration. For example, intended immigrants to Australia are legally required to pass a citizenship test as part of that country's naturalization process.&lt;ref name="Australian Citizenship - Australian Citizenship test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/practice/ |title=Australian Citizenship - Australian Citizenship test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language Testing in naturalization process ===
When analyzed in the context of language texting in the naturalization processes, the ideology can be found from two distinct but nearly related points. One refers to the construction and deconstruction of the nation's constitutive elements that makes their own identity, while the second has a more restricted view of the notion of specific language and ideologies that may served in an specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=European Journal of Language Policy.|first=ENGLISH DEPARTMENT , UNIVERSITY OF ZADAR , CROATIA|date=October 2012|title=Language ideology and citizenship: a comparative analysis of language testing in naturalisation processes|url=https://dx.doi.org.db16.linccweb.org/10.3828/ejlp.2012.13|journal=COPYRIGHT 2012 Liverpool University Press (UK)|volume=|pages=218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligence quotient===

{{Main article|Intelligence quotient}}

===Competitions===

Tests are sometimes used as a tool to select for participants that have potential to succeed in a competition such as a sporting event. For example, serious skaters who wish to participate in figure skating competitions in the United States must pass official U.S. Figure Skating tests just to qualify.&lt;ref name="Welcome to U.S. Figure Skating"&gt;{{cite web | title = Welcome to U.S. Figure Skating | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Clubs.asp?id=353 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100727170634/http://www.usfigureskating.org/Clubs.asp?id=353 | archivedate = 2010-07-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group memberships===

Tests are sometimes used by a group to select for certain types of individuals to join the group. For example, Mensa International is a high I.Q. society that requires individuals to score at the 98th percentile or higher on a standardized, supervised IQ test.&lt;ref name="What is Mensa?"&gt;{{cite web | title = What is Mensa? | url=http://www.mensa.org/?page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{merge from|Types of Assessment|date=February 2018|section=TRUE|discuss=Talk:Test (assessment)#Merge}}
===Written tests===
[[File:SMATrinitasUlum.JPG|thumb|180px|Indonesian Students taking a written test]]
[[Writing assessment|Written tests]] are tests that are administered on paper or on a computer (as an [[eExam]]). A test taker who takes a written test could respond to specific items by writing or typing within a given space of the test or on a separate form or document.

In some tests; where knowledge of many constants or technical terms is required to effectively answer questions, like [[Chemistry]] or [[Biology]] – the test developer may allow every test taker to bring with them a [[cheat sheet]].

A test developer's choice of which style or format to use when developing a written test is usually arbitrary given that there is no single invariant standard for testing. Be that as it may, certain test styles and format have become more widely used than others. Below is a list of those formats of test items that are widely used by educators and test developers to construct paper or computer-based tests. As a result, these tests may consist of only one type of test item format (e.g., multiple choice test, essay test) or may have a combination of different test item formats (e.g., a test that has multiple choice and essay items).

==== Multiple choice ====

{{Main article|Multiple choice}}

In a test that has items formatted as multiple choice questions, a candidate would be given a number of set answers for each question, and the candidate must choose which answer or group of answers is correct. There are two families of multiple choice questions.&lt;ref name="Constructing Written Test Questions For the Basic and Clinical Sciences"&gt;{{cite web| title = Constructing Written Test Questions For the Basic and Clinical Sciences | url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/documents/nbme_iwgindex.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first family is known as the True/False question and it requires a test taker to choose all answers that are appropriate. The second family is known as One-Best-Answer question and it requires a test taker to answer only one from a list of answers.

There are several reasons to using multiple choice questions in tests. In terms of administration, multiple choice questions usually requires less time for test takers to answer, are easy to score and grade, provide greater coverage of material, allows for a wide range of difficulty, and can easily diagnose a test taker's difficulty with certain concepts.&lt;ref name="Types of Test Item Formats"&gt;{{cite web| title = Types of Test Item Formats | url = http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testformats.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educational tool, multiple choice items test many levels of learning as well as a test taker's ability to integrate information, and it provides feedback to the test taker about why distractors were wrong and why correct answers were right. Nevertheless, there are difficulties associated with the use of multiple choice questions. In administrative terms, multiple choice items that are effective usually take a great time to construct.&lt;ref name="Types of Test Item Formats"/&gt; As an educational tool, multiple choice items do not allow test takers to demonstrate knowledge beyond the choices provided and may even encourage guessing or approximation due to the presence of at least one correct answer. For instance, a test taker might not work out explicitly that &lt;math&gt;6.14 \cdot 7.95=48.813&lt;/math&gt;, but knowing that &lt;math&gt;6 \cdot 8=48&lt;/math&gt;, they would choose an answer close to 48. Moreover, test takers may misinterpret these items and in the process, perceive these items to be tricky or picky. Finally, multiple choice items do not test a test taker's attitudes towards learning because correct responses can be easily faked.

==== Alternative response ====
True/False questions present candidates with a binary choice – a statement is either true or false. This method presents problems, as depending on the number of questions, a significant number of candidates could get 100% just by guesswork, and should on average get 50%.

====Matching type====

A matching item is an item that provides a defined term and requires a test taker to match identifying characteristics to the correct term.&lt;ref name="MFO Topic C5: Developing Test Questions"&gt;{{cite web| title = MFO Topic C5: Developing Test Questions | url = http://www.mdfaconline.org/modules/module_c05/module_c5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Completion type ====

A fill-in-the-blank item provides a test taker with identifying characteristics and requires the test taker to recall the correct term.&lt;ref name="MFO Topic C5: Developing Test Questions"/&gt;  There are two types of fill-in-the-blank tests.  The easier version provides a word bank of possible words that will fill in the blanks.  For some exams all words in the word bank are used exactly once.  If a teacher wanted to create a test of medium difficulty, they would provide a test with a word bank, but some words may be used more than once and others not at all.  The hardest variety of such a test is a fill-in-the-blank test in which no word bank is provided at all.  This generally requires a higher level of understanding and memory than a multiple choice test.  Because of this, fill-in-the-blank tests[with no word bank] are often feared by students.

==== Essay ====

Items such as short answer or essay typically require a test taker to write a response to fulfill the requirements of the item. In administrative terms, essay items take less time to construct.&lt;ref name="Types of Test Item Formats"/&gt; As an assessment tool, essay items can test complex learning objectives as well as processes used to answer the question. The items can also provide a more realistic and generalizable task for test. Finally, these items make it difficult for test takers to guess the correct answers and require test takers to demonstrate their writing skills as well as correct spelling and grammar.

The difficulties with essay items is primarily administrative. For one, these items take more time for test takers to answer.&lt;ref name="Types of Test Item Formats"/&gt; When these questions are answered, the answers themselves are usually poorly written because test takers may not have time to organize and proofread their answers. In turn, it takes more time to score or grade these items. When these items are being scored or graded, the grading process itself becomes subjective as non-test related information may influence the process. Thus, considerable effort is required to minimize the subjectivity of the grading process. Finally, as an assessment tool, essay questions may potentially be unreliable in assessing the entire content of a subject matter.

'''Quizzes''' 

A quiz is a brief assessment that may cover a small amount of material that was given in a class. Some of them cover two to three lectures that were given in a period of times as a reading section or a given exercise in were the most important part of the class was summarize. However, a simple quiz usually does not count very much, and instructors usually provide this type of test in order to help and know if the student is learning the material. In addition, doing this at the time the instructor collected all can make a significant part of the final course grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=overcoming Math Anxiety|last=Tobias|first=S|publisher=New York: W.W. Norton and Company|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 4 page 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mathematical questions ====

Most [[mathematics]] questions, or calculation questions from subjects such as [[chemistry]], [[physics]] or [[economics]] employ a style which does not fall into any of the above categories, although some papers, notably the [[United Kingdom Mathematics Trust#Mathematical Challenges|Maths Challenge]] papers in the [[United Kingdom]] employ multiple choice. Instead, most mathematics questions state a [[mathematical problem]] or [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] that requires a student to write a freehand response. Marks are given more for the steps taken than for the correct answer. If the question has multiple parts, later parts may use answers from previous sections, and marks may be granted if an earlier incorrect answer was used but the correct method was followed, and an answer which is correct (given the incorrect input) is returned.

Higher level mathematical papers may include variations on true/false, where the candidate is given a statement and asked to verify its validity by direct proof or stating a [[counterexample]].

==== Open-Note Tests ====
Though not as popular as the closed-note test, open-note tests are slowly rising in popularity. An open-note test allows the test taker to bring in all of their notes and use them while taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.goconqr.com/en/examtime/blog/exam-types-and-tips/|title=Different Exam Types - Different Approaches|date=2012-02-21|work=ExamTime|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions asked on open-note exams are typically more thought provoking and intellectual than questions on a closed-note exam. Rather than testing what facts you know, open-note exams force you to apply the facts to a broader question. The main benefit that is seen from open-note tests is that they are a better preparation for the real world where you don't have to memorize and have anything you need at your disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-01|title=A systematic review comparing open-book and closed-book examinations: Evaluating effects on development of critical thinking skills|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471595317305486|journal=Nurse Education in Practice|volume=27|pages=89–94|doi=10.1016/j.nepr.2017.08.018|issn=1471-5953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral tests===

===Physical fitness tests===
[[File:APFT-JH-12-19.jpg|thumb|A Minnesota National Guardsman performs pushups during a physical fitness test.]]
A '''physical fitness test''' is a test designed to measure [[physical strength]], [[sport agility|agility]], and [[endurance]]. They are commonly employed in educational institutions as part of the [[physical education]] curriculum, in medicine as part of diagnostic testing, and as eligibility requirements in fields that focus on physical ability such as [[military]] or [[police]]. Throughout the 20th century, scientific evidence emerged demonstrating the usefulness of [[strength training]] and [[aerobic exercise]] in maintaining overall health, and more agencies began to incorporate standardized fitness testing. In the [[United States]], the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports|President's Council on Youth Fitness]] was established in 1956 as a way to encourage and monitor fitness in schoolchildren.

More specialised tests may be used to test ability to perform a particular job or role. Many gyms, private organisations and event organisers have their own fitness tests.

===Performance tests===

A performance test is an assessment that requires an examinee to actually perform a task or activity, rather than simply answering questions referring to specific parts. The purpose is to ensure greater [[fidelity]] to what is being tested.

An example is a behind-the-wheel driving test to obtain a driver's license. Rather than only answering simple multiple-choice items regarding the driving of an automobile, a student is required to actually drive one while being evaluated.

Performance tests are commonly used in workplace and professional applications, such as professional certification and [[licensure]]. When used for personnel selection, the tests might be referred to as a work sample. A licensure example would be cosmetologists being required to demonstrate a haircut or manicure on a live person. The [[Bourdon-Wiersma test|Group-Bourdon test]] is one of a number of [[psychometrics|psychometric]] tests which trainee train drivers in the UK are required to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group-Bourdon tool|url=http://www.digital-reality.org.uk/|publisher=Digital Reality|accessdate=2 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103204755/http://www.digital-reality.org.uk/|archivedate=3 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some performance tests are simulations. For instance, the assessment to become certified as an ophthalmic technician includes two components, a multiple-choice examination and a computerized skill simulation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to complete seven tasks commonly performed on the job, such as [[retinoscopy]], that are simulated on a computer.

==Preparations==

From the perspective of a test developer, there is great variability with respect to time and effort needed to prepare a test. Likewise, from the perspective of a test taker, there is also great variability with respect to the time and needed to obtain a desired grade or score on any given test. When a test developer constructs a test, the amount of time and effort is dependent upon the significance of the test itself, the proficiency of the test taker, the format of the test, class size, deadline of test, and experience of the test developer.

The process of test construction has been aided in several ways. For one, many test developers were themselves students at one time, and therefore are able to modify or outright adopt questions from their previous tests. In some countries, book publishers often provide teaching packages that include test banks to university instructors who adopt their published books for their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.oup.com/uk/orc/learntestbanks/|title=Oxford University Press {{!}} Online Resource Centre {{!}} Learn about Test banks|last=WEHMEIER|first=Nicolas|website=global.oup.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These test banks may contain up to four thousand sample test questions that have been peer-reviewed and time-tested. The instructor who chooses to use this testbank would only have to select a fixed number of test questions from this test bank to construct a test.

As with test constructions, the time needed for a test taker to prepare for a test is dependent upon the frequency of the test, the test developer, and the significance of the test. In general, nonstandardized tests that are short, frequent, and do not constitute a major portion of the test taker's overall course grade or score do not require the test taker to spend much time preparing for the test.&lt;ref name="How to study for Quizzes and Exams in Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite web| title = How to study for Quizzes and Exams in Biochemistry| url = https://www.pharmacy.purdue.edu/~mcmp304/HowToStudyForQuizzesAndExams.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101231195958/https://www.pharmacy.purdue.edu/~mcmp304/HowToStudyForQuizzesAndExams.pdf| archivedate = 2010-12-31| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, nonstandardized tests that are long, infrequent, and do constitute a major portion of the test taker's overall course grade or score usually require the test taker to spend great amounts of time preparing for the test. To prepare for a nonstandardized test, test takers may rely upon their reference books, class or lecture notes, Internet, and past experience. Test takers may also use various learning aids to study for tests such as [[flashcards]] and [[mnemonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Study strategies | url = http://www.k-state.edu/counseling/topics/career/studystr.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007171538/http://www.k-state.edu/counseling/topics/career/studystr.htm | archivedate = 2011-10-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Test takers may even hire tutors to coach them through the process so that they may increase the probability of obtaining a desired test grade or score. In countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], demand for private tuition has increased significantly in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/sharp-rise-in-children-receiving-private-tuition|title=Sharp rise in children receiving private tuition|last=Weale|first=Sally|date=2016-09-07|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, test takers may rely upon past copies of a test from previous years or semesters to study for a future test. These past tests may be provided by a friend or a group that has copies of previous tests or by instructors and their institutions, or by the test provider (such as an [[examination board]]) itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Past Exam Papers | url = http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/examdb/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100810015620/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/examdb/ | archivedate = 2010-08-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/mathematics/gcse/mathematics-4360/past-papers-and-mark-schemes|title=Past papers and mark schemes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aqa.org.uk|publisher=AQA|access-date=2016-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221110652/http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/mathematics/gcse/mathematics-4360/past-papers-and-mark-schemes|archivedate=2016-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a nonstandardized test, the time needed by test takers to prepare for standardized tests is less variable and usually considerable. This is because standardized tests are usually uniform in scope, format, and difficulty and often have important consequences with respect to a test taker's future such as a test taker's eligibility to attend a specific university program or to enter a desired profession. It is not unusual for test takers to prepare for standardized tests by relying upon commercially available books that provide in-depth coverage of the standardized test or compilations of previous tests (e.g., [[Ten year series|10 year series in Singapore]]). In many countries, test takers even enroll in test preparation centers or [[cram schools]] that provide extensive or supplementary instructions to test takers to help them better prepare for a standardized test. In Hong Kong, it has been suggested that the tutors running such centers are celebrities in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20085558|title=Meet the 'tutor kings and queens'|last=Sharma|first=Yojana|date=2012-11-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to private tuition being a popular career choice for new graduates in developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rsleducational.co.uk/blog/blog/how-to-become-a-private-tutor|title=How to become a private tutor|last=Lomax|first=Robert|date=|work=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/25/new-boom-home-tuition|title=The new boom in home tuition – if you can pay £40 an hour|last=Cohen|first=Daniel H.|date=2013-10-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in some countries, instructors and their institutions have also played a significant role in preparing test takers for a standardized test.

==Cheating==
[[File:US Navy 120119-N-GZ832-006 Chief Damage Controlman Ty Griffin proctors the chief petty officer exam aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ca.jpg|thumb|[[Exam invigilator|Invigilators]] may oversee a test to reduce cheating methods such as copying]]
[[Cheating]] on a test is the process of using unauthorized means or methods for the purpose of obtaining a desired test score or grade. This may range from bringing and using notes during a closed book examination, to copying another test taker's answer or choice of answers during an individual test, to sending a paid proxy to take the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccie-in-3-months.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/proxy-test-takers-item-harvesters-and.html|title=Proxy test takers, item harvesters and cheaters... be very afraid|website=ccie-in-3-months.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several common methods have been employed to combat cheating. They include the use of multiple proctors or invigilators during a testing period to monitor test takers. Test developers may construct multiple variants of the same test to be administered to different test takers at the same time, or write tests with few multiple-choice options, based on the theory that fully worked answers are difficult to imitate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teachhub.com/easy-ways-prevent-cheating|title=Easy Ways to Prevent Cheating|newspaper=TeachHUB|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, instructors themselves may not administer their own tests but will leave the task to other instructors or invigilators, which may mean that the invigilators do not know the candidates, and thus some form of identification may be required. Another method is that if the student showed too many failed test at given color levels,{{clarify|reason=what are color levels?|date=November 2018}} the students have to begin again at work in through additional skills builders, at that level the student choose to drop down a color level or obtain a missing prerequisite skills. For that if the student passed the requisites number of test without a color level, the student will color by his or her name a large wall chart that provide the status of the entire class &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cheating on Test|last=How to do it , Detected , Prevent|first=Cizek, Gregory J.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1999|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Finally, instructors or test providers may compare the answers of suspected cheaters on the test themselves to determine if cheating did occur.

==Support and criticisms==
Despite their widespread use, the validity, quality, or use of tests, particularly standardized tests in education have continued to be widely supported or criticized. Like the tests themselves, supports and criticisms of tests are often varied and may come from a variety of sources such as parents, test takers, instructors, business groups, universities, or governmental watchdogs.

Supporters of standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for promoting testing in education:
* Feedback or diagnosis of test taker's performance&lt;ref name="Defending standardized testing"&gt;{{cite book | last = Phelps | first = Richard | title = Defending standardized testing | publisher = Psychology Press | location = London | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-8058-4912-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prediction and selection&lt;ref name="Defending standardized testing"/&gt;
* Improves performance&lt;ref name="Defending standardized testing"/&gt;

Critics of standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for revising or removing standardized tests in education:
* Narrows curricular format and encourages [[teaching to the test]].&lt;ref name="Put to the Test: The Effects of External Testing on Teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">The '''Trent Accreditation Scheme''' ('''TAS'''), now replaced ''de facto'' by a number of independent accreditation schemes, such as the QHA Trent Accreditation, was a British accreditation scheme formed with a mission to maintain and continually evaluate standards of quality, especially in [[health care]] delivery, through the surveying and [[accreditation]] of health care organisations, especially hospitals and clinics, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world.

The Trent UK Accreditation Scheme, or TAS UK, ceased to operate in May 2010, when a majority of Board members decided to end the scheme.

Subsequently, a number of independent accreditation schemes were set up, including the British-based scheme QHA Trent Accreditation.

==History of the scheme==

Trent's basic mission resembled that of the USA's [[Joint Commission]] International, or JCI, and other major [[international healthcare accreditation]] groups, although there were some significant differences in the way the different groups work.

Apart from [[hospital]]s in the United Kingdom, Trent also surveyed a large number of private sector hospitals in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hkah.org.hk/en/jci.html |title=Hong Kong Adventist Hospital |work= |accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.union.org/new/english/about_us/mission.htm |title=Union Hospital |work= |accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of its demise had been developing links with hospitals in Cyprus.

The approach Trent took to Clinic and [[Hospital Accreditation]] was based on the axiom that no single healthcare system, whether European, American, Asian or otherwise in origin, has the right to claim a monopoly viewpoint over what represents acceptable quality and best clinical practice throughout the world, and no one country has the absolute right to tell another how their hospitals should be run.  What is vital is that the quality of care which patients receive should be of the highest possible standard, and also that the hospitals and clinics providing that care should be independently capable when it comes to working out how best to maintain those standards and how best to respond to any new challenges which will inevitably come along.  If the overall standards of a hospital or clinic can be shown to be of acceptable quality, then it is desirable, and even ideal, that local differences related to culture and to legislation should be specifically discussed and incorporated into the assessment standards in an appropriate fashion.  That said, Trent was very interested in the [[medical ethics|medical ethical standards]] of the hospitals it worked with.

To achieve all of this, Trent worked in close partnership with participating hospitals and clinics to generate an appropriate and mutually acceptable set of standards to survey against.  Because the world of healthcare is constantly changing, the standards were constantly reviewed and up-dated through a system of working jointly with representatives of partner hospitals.

Trent developed various ways to ensure local participation, and even ownership, over the accreditation process in a locality.  Trent utilised UK-sourced surveyors who were either working in the British [[National Health Service]], or NHS, or had retired in recent times, and hence have valuable experience and insight "at the coal face", and in Hong Kong Trent also appoints locally domiciled surveyors (see later).  Trent surveyors are drawn from a wide variety of professional backgrounds, but especially from the worlds of medicine, dentistry, nursing, the professions complementary to [[medicine]] (e.g. [[physiotherapy]], [[pharmacy]] etc.) and healthcare management/administration, so as to ensure an appropriately broad portfolio of knowledge and skills are always present within the surveying teams and the wider organisation.  Surveyors were all volunteer professionals rather than salaried employees.

Trent surveys were not just a matter of working through a “tick-list” of standards, a process which Trent believed might elevate standards to a certain level but nevertheless do little to inculcate a culture of “thinking for oneself” – instead, Trent surveys involved direct face-to-face conversation with all levels of staff, including clinical medical staff and senior management (for this reason, qualified medical doctors are included in all surveying teams organised by Trent) and Trent surveyors expected full freedom to go anywhere in the hospital or clinic under survey and to talk to anyone they choose to.  Discussion and analysis of the data thus generated, not only by the Trent team but also by the hospital or clinic under survey, represented a major component of Trent's approach to hospital and clinic accreditation, and reflected an underlying philosophy that the whole process was about improving services to patients and the ability of an organisation to work effectively towards that aim.

Trent surveyors evaluated a vast range of modalities of a hospital's (or clinic's) activities and governance, including management, estates, equipment, [[clinical audit]], research, education and training, as well as clinical/medical activity.  In Hong Kong hospitals, survey teams always consisted of 2 or 3 surveyors from the UK working together with (usually) 2 based in Hong Kong and who were actively working in the local hospitals.  One surveyor will be nominated as the lead.  The Hong Kong-based surveyors were nominated by the participating hospitals, and after receiving training they always surveyed hospitals other than their own.  This approach led to unrivaled opportunity and potential for the sharing of ideas about best practice between hospitals working in the same locality, and the development of camaraderie.  Also, patients were spoken to, and their views and experiences also sought.

At the end of a survey, the key findings were initially presented by the Lead Surveyor to the hospital or clinic undergoing the survey, this event taking place almost always on the last day.  The findings were subsequently digested, analysed and put into a more detailed printed report, with positive virtues being highlighted as well as problems. However, because of the end-of-survey oral presentation, hospitals and clinics could start putting remedial action into place as soon as possible.

After a round of surveys, a joint meeting was held at which the printed reports of all the hospital and clinic surveys conducted in that particular round are discussed jointly and in depth by the Trent Board (which had both local and UK representation) together with senior representatives of the hospital or clinic being surveyed, and a decision was then taken as to whether or not accreditation would be granted unconditionally, or if it would be subject to conditions.

The Trent approach to accreditation ensured that the local hospitals and clinics enjoyed some ownership over the whole process, which would not be the case if all of the standards, all of the surveyors and all of the decisions regarding who was successful or not in achieving accreditation were imposed unilaterally from outside.  It helped to build up the confidence of participating hospitals in their ability to develop ways to maintain and improve quality in a way that schemes which operate da more didactic approach to standards and their assessment would not.  It also meant that there were Trent surveyors constantly present in the majority of the scheme’s participating hospitals.

Trent was a member of the [[United Kingdom Accreditation Forum]] (UKAF) [http://www.ukaf.org.uk/] and an institutional member of ISQUA [http://www.who.int/patientsafety/isqua_dec08_bulletin.pdf].

==International Healthcare Accreditation==

With the advent of [[medical tourism]], [[international healthcare accreditation]] has increasingly grown in importance. A number of accreditation organisations sourced from a number of countries fulfil this internationally orientated role, including:

*Accreditation Canada International (formerly "The Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation", or CCHSA)
*[[Joint Commission International]] (JCI), in the United States
*The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards, or ACHS
*[[QHA Trent Accreditation]] (UK)

No single accreditation scheme enjoys exclusive rights to be seen as an overall world-wide-relevant scheme, and some hospitals are looking towards multiple accreditation to achieve performance credibility in different parts of the world.

The Trent Scheme was the first accreditation scheme to survey and accredit a hospital in Asia, in Hong Kong in 2000 [http://www.union.org/new/english/about_us/mission.htm].  Since then others such as [[Joint Commission International|JCI]] have entered the market, with JCI first accrediting [[Bumrungrad International Hospital]] in Thailand in 2002.

==Closure of Trent Accreditation Scheme==

The UK-based Trent Accreditation Scheme (TAS UK) ceased surveying and accreditation activities in 2010.  Subsequently, the British-based scheme [[QHA Trent Accreditation]] began operating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">The '''vacuum exercise''' is an [[exercise]] which involves contracting some internal [[Human abdomen|abdominal muscles]], primarily the [[transverse abdominal muscle]], and not as much the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]].

Repetitions of the exercise may be used as a form of [[aerobic exercise|endurance training]], and light [[strength training]]. There is difficulty building strength in the muscle, as it is not easy to apply resistance training to the deeper internal muscles.

The reasons for performing this exercise vary. It has been done for [[aesthetic]] purposes in [[bodybuilding]] competitions (to suck the abdomen in, making it appear less bulgy). It can be done to enhance overall core stability and strength. It is used in [[belly dance]] to actively perform flutters, engaging various fibres in the muscle selectively. Some believe the pressures it exerts upon the intestines are an aid to [[digestion]]. It is used in [[reverse breathing]] upon exhalation.

People may also sometimes contract these muscles in public to reduce the appearance of their abdomen, consciously or unconsciously. "Sucking in" the stomach to appear thinner may be most common form of this exercise, but with little of the intensity or long-term purpose of the other forms.

==Performing a vacuum==
In performing a vacuum (activating the transverse abdominis), one draws one's bellybutton inward, toward the spine. Some perform a vacuum in conjunction with bending over, reaching overhead, or when lifting heavy weights, although the benefit and healthiness of this is disputed (some advocated just tensing the midsection, with primary focus more so on the lower back). Increasing the range of motion (how far it is drawn in), the intensity (very little can be done, other than resisting gravity) or the duration are the methods of making the muscles stronger. Performing flutters or Tabata intervals of high intensity and rest similar to [[kegel exercise]]s is also common. It may also be possible to vary the pressures by contorting the body or exerting various pressures on tissues connected to the transversus abdominis, although how this might be done is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Cosmo150708"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norins|first1=Elizabeth|title=Vacuuming Your Stomach Is the Easiest Way to Get Flat Abs|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a43027/flat-ab-hack-vacuum-your-stomach/|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=Cosmopolitan|date=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
People who are predisposed to [[inguinal hernia]]tion should avoid this exercise as it increases intra abdominal pressure.

==Yoga method==
In the [[Hatha yoga]] asanas known as [[cat stretch]] and [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]], the exercise can be performed while on all-Fours so that the muscles must resist gravity, making a slight difference in the resistance required.

The pranayama known as kapalabhati involves exhaling powerfully and rapidly a number of times while sitting with the legs crossed in a meditation Adana.This is known as Breath of Fire in Kundalini yoga.

Sat Kriya is fundamental to Kundalini yoga and could be practiced on its own every day for at least 3 minutes. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spiritrisingyoga.org/kundalini-info/sat-kriya&lt;/ref&gt;
==String method==
A method of developing long-term daily endurance in the muscles is to tie a string around the waist at the [[bellybutton]] level. The string is tied at 3/4 of one's maximum vacuum point. The string should be tight, but not noticeably cutting into the skin. When the transverse abdominis relaxes, the abdominal wall (belly) expands and the string will tighten for immediate feedback, reminding the user to contract the TA.

==Hypopressive exercises==

{{main|Hypopressive exercise}}

[[Hypopressive exercise]]s also involve the [[transverse abdominal]], but they are based upon reflex contraction of the abdominal wall, rather than voluntary contractions that are a feature of traditional abdominal exercises. The significance of this is thought to be that hypopressive exercises increase the base tone of the abdominal wall (as well as the pelvic floor) and hence reduce resting waist circumference.

A '''vaginal syringe''' was an object used in the 19th century in the [[Western world]] for [[Douche|douching]], treating diseases and for [[birth control]]. Vaginal syringes were fairly common at the time, but were not openly discussed because of [[taboo]]s about discussing [[feminine hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/43583-vaginal-syringe-ny-city-hall.html|title=200-Year-Old Douche Found Under New York's City Hall|last=Gannon|first=Megan|date=21 February 2014|work=Live Science|access-date=24 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal syringes were most often made of metal, glass or [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140328-british-museum-celtic-brooch-viking-discovery-archaeology-science/|title=11 Museum Surprises: Rediscovered Treasures, from a Celtic Brooch to an Early Hitchcock Film|last=Williams|first=A.R.|date=29 March 2014|work=National Geographic|access-date=24 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Vaginal syringes were marketed under various names, such as the ones made by the E. Edwards and Company of New York called "Lady's Friend" or the "Diamond Syringe No. 10."{{Sfn|Fuller|2003|p=181}} It was important for manufacturers to be vague in advertising because they could be arrested on [[obscenity]] charges, like [[Ezra Heywood]] was for advertising a vaginal syringe in his [[newspaper]] in 1882.{{Sfn|Tone|2001|p=37}} His involvement in the issue led his wife, [[Angela Heywood]] to speak openly about birth control and feminine hygiene as a woman's "natural right."{{Sfn|Gordon|1973|p=14}} Others, like [[Sarah Chase]], were arrested for selling vaginal syringes as a method of birth control.{{Sfn|Tone|2000|p=435}} Vaginal syringes have been recorded in paintings by the 17th century artist, [[Jan Steen]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29284|title=1800s Douche Found Under New York City Hall|last=|first=|date=20 February 2014|work=The History Blog|access-date=24 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have created and patented vaginal syringes for use as birth control as early as the 1879 model developed by Ann Palmer.{{Sfn|Stanley|1995|p=273}}

== Treating disease and douching ==
Vaginal syringes were used to treat maladies such as [[Leukorrhea|leucorrhea]] or disease of the "[[Organ (anatomy)|pelvic viscera]]" by injecting water or water and chemicals into the vagina.{{Sfn|Parker|1886|p=8-9}} Vaginal syringes were also used to treat [[Dysmenorrhea|menstrual cramps]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The vaginal syringe was also used to promote the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] notion that [[Douche|douching]] was an appropriate method of feminine hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeology.uiowa.edu/ladys-syringe|title=A Lady's Syringe|last=Collins|first=Angela R.|date=12 March 2014|website=The Office of the State Archaeologist|publisher=The University of Iowa|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, "many reputable gynecologists" were reporting that "habitual use of a vaginal syringe" was unhealthy.{{Sfn|Cox|1937|p=157}}

== Birth control ==
The vaginal syringe as a method of birth control was available to women in the early nineteenth century.{{Sfn|Draznin|2001|p=100}} In the 1860s, [[Henry Dyer Grindle]], advocated using vaginal syringes for the application of [[spermicide]] into the vagina after [[sexual intercourse]].{{Sfn|Brodie|1994|p=73-74}} Women used different types of spermicides with the vaginal syringes including [[alum]], chloride of [[zinc]], [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], [[vinegar]], [[borax]], white [[oak]] bark, [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] and other chemical combinations.{{Sfn|Brodie|1994|p=73-74}} Some chemicals which could be used as a douche were "capable of inducing an [[abortion]]."{{Sfn|Bagley|2016|p=142}}

[[File:Vermicomposting of toilet blackwater 1.jpg|thumb|Domestic sewage vermifilter showing accumulated contents (composting worms exposed)]]

A '''vermifilter''' (also '''vermi-digester''') is an [[aerobic treatment system]], consisting of a [[Bioreactor|biological reactor]] containing media that filters [[Organic matter|organic material]] from [[wastewater]]. The media also provides a habitat for [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] bacteria and [[Vermicompost#Suitable worm species|composting earthworms]] that produce [[humus]]. The "trickling action" of the wastewater through the media [[Dissolved Oxygen|dissolves oxygen]] into the wastewater. This is an important feature because bacteria and worms that rapidly decompose organic substances need oxygen to survive. Wastewater is purified by removing pathogens and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|oxygen demand]].

Vermifilters are most commonly used for [[sewage treatment]] and for agro-[[industrial wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref name="Furlong2014" /&gt; Treatment can take place in either large centralized systems or by smaller [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sewage treatment]].  Vermifilters are also used if wastewater requires treatment before it can be safely discharged into the environment.

Vermifilters can be used for [[Secondary treatment#Primary treatment|primary]], [[Secondary treatment|secondary]] and [[Secondary treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary]] treatment of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and [[greywater]]. On-site systems can treat influent from [[flush toilet]]s (vermifilter toilets).  In this case, the treated effluent is disposed of to either surface or [[Septic drain field|subsurface]] leach fields. Solid material (such as fecal matter and toilet paper) is retained, de-watered and digested by bacteria and [[earthworms]]. This converts material into humus. The liquid passes through filtration media to which microorganisms attach themselves and secondary treatment occurs. At that point, [[organic compound]]s naturally [[biodegradation|biodegrade]]. The oxygen dissolved in the water allows further degradation to take place.

Vermifilters are low cost aerobic wastewater treatment options. Because energy is not required for aeration, vermifilters can be considered "[[Passive treatment system|passive treatment]]" systems (pumps may be required if gravity flow is not possible). Another advantage is the high treatment efficiency given the low space requirement.

==Terminology==

A great number of terms are in use to describe vermifilters, including for example the words digester, [[composting]], vermi-trickling filters or [[vermicomposting]]. Further alternative names for this process include aerobic biodigester or biological filter with [[earthworm]]s.

When this kind of [[sanitation]] system is used to treat only the mixture of excreta and water from [[flush toilet]]s or [[Pit latrine#Pour-flush pit latrine|pour flush toilets]] (called [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]]) then the term "toilet" is added to the name of the process, such as "vermi-digester toilet" or "tiger (worm) toilet".

==Overview==
Vermifiltration was first advocated by researchers at the University of Chile in 1992 as a low cost sustainable technology suitable for decentralised sewage treatment in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Xing2010"&gt;Meiyan Xing, Xiaowei Li and Jian Yang. [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/view/126784/116312 Treatment performance of small-scale vermifilter for domestic wastewater and its relationship to earthworm growth, reproduction and enzymatic activity], African Journal of Biotechnology, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Vermifilters offer treatment performance similar to conventional decentralised wastewater treatment systems but with potentially higher hydraulic processing capacities.&lt;ref name="Xing2010"/&gt;

Vermifilters are a type of wastewater treatment [[biofilter]] or [[trickling filter]] but with the addition of [[earthworms]] to improve treatment efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Manyuchi, M.M., Kadzungura, L., Boka, S. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256452259_Vermifiltration_of_Sewage_Wastewater_using_Eisenia_Fetida_Earthworms_for_Potential_use_in_Irrigation_Purposes Vermifiltration of Sewage Wastewater for Potential Use in Irrigation Purposes Using ''Eisenia fetida'' Earthworms] World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 78 2013, 538–542.&lt;/ref&gt; Vermifilters provide an aerobic environment and wet substrate that facilitates microorganism growth as a [[biofilm]]. Microorganisms perform biochemical degradation of organic matter present in wastewater. [[Earthworm]]s regulate microbial biomass and activity by directly or/and indirectly grazing on microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, L., Liu, Y., Hu, X., Zeng, G., Wang, H., Zhou, L., Tan, X., Huang, B., Liu, S., Liu, S., 2016.

Technol. 200, 999–1007&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm and organic matter consumed by [[Vermicompost#Suitable worm species|composting earthworms]] is then digested into biologically inert castings (humus).&lt;ref&gt;Liu, J., Lu, Z., Yang, J., Xing, M., Yu, F., Guo, M., 2012.

Technol. 117, 214–21&lt;/ref&gt; The vermicast is incorporated into the media substrate, slowly increasing its volume. As this builds up it can be removed and applied to soil as an amendment to improve soil fertility and structure.

Microorganisms present are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[autotroph]]ic. Heterotrophic microorganisms are important in oxidising carbon (decomposition) whereas autotrophic microorganisms are important in nitrification.

As a result of oxidation reactions, biodegradation and microbial stimulation by enzymatic action, organic matter decomposition and pathogen destruction occurs in the vermifilter. In a study where municipal wastewater was treated in a vermifilter, removal ratios for [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) were 90%, [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) 85%, [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) 98%, [[ammonia]] nitrogen 75% and fecal coliforms eliminated to a level that meets World Health Organisation guidelines for safe re-use in crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lourenço|first=N.|last2=Nunes|first2=L.M.|title=Optimization of a vermifiltration process for treating urban wastewater|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925857416307145|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=100|pages=138–146|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.11.074|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process types ==
Vermifilters can be used for [[Secondary treatment#Primary treatment|primary]], [[Secondary treatment|secondary]] and [[Secondary treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary]] treatment of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and [[greywater]].

=== Primary treatment of blackwater ===
[[File:Vermicomposting of toilet blackwater 2.jpg|thumb|Primary treatment domestic vermifilter with solids pile on surface (comprising feces and toilet paper) sitting on vermicast humus substrate (1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface area)]]
Vermifilters can be used for aerobic [[primary treatment]] of domestic [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]].&lt;ref name="Sinha2008"&gt;Rajiv K. Sinha, Gokul Bharambe, Uday Chaudhari. Sewage treatment by vermifiltration with synchronous treatment of sludge by earthworms: a low-cost sustainable technology over conventional systems with potential for decentralization, Environmentalist, 2008 28:409-420&lt;/ref&gt; Untreated blackwater enters a ventilated enclosure above a bed of filter medium. Solids accumulate on the surface of the filter bed while liquid drains through the filter medium and is discharged from the reactor. The solids (feces and toilet paper) are aerobically digested by aerobic bacteria and [[Vermicompost#Suitable species|composting earthworms]] into castings (humus), thereby significantly reducing the volume of organic material.
[[File:Twin chamber primary vermifilter.jpg|thumb|Twin chamber constructed primary treatment vermifilter fed by a domestic flush toilet.]]
Primary treatment vermifilter reactors are designed to digest solid material, such as contained in raw sewage. Twin-chamber parallel reactors offer the advantage of resting one reactor while the other is active, to facilitate hygienic removal of humus with reduced pathogen levels.

Worms actively digest the solid organic material. An equilibrium is reached whereby volume digested by a stable population of worms matches the input volume of solid waste. Seasonal and environmental factors (such as temperature) and variable influent volumes can cause buildup of solid waste as a pile. Although oxygen is excluded from the centre of this "wet" compost pile, worms work from the outside in and introduce air as necessary into the pile to meet their nutritional requirements. This food resource buffer ensures primary treatment vermifilters have a level of resilience and reliability, provided space is provided for a pile to build up. There is some evidence that the wet environment facilitates digestion of solid waste by worms.&lt;ref name="Furlong2015"&gt;C. Furlong, W. T. Gibson, M. R. Templeton, M. Taillade, F. Kassam, G. Crabb, R. Goodsell, J. McQuilkin, A. Oak, G. Thakar, M. Kodgire, R. Patankar. [http://washdev.iwaponline.com/content/5/4/608 The development of an onsite sanitation system based on vermifiltration: the "Tiger Toilet"], Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of vermicast humus increases only slowly and occasionally needs to be removed from the primary treatment reactor.

Primary treatment of wet mixed blackwater can also include greywater containing food solids, grease and other [[biodegradable waste]]. Solid material is reduced to stable humus (wormcastings), with volume reductions of up to tenfold.&lt;ref name="Furlong2014"&gt;C. Furlong, M.R. Templeton, W.T. Gibson. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270438081_Processing_of_human_faeces_by_wet_vermifiltration_for_improved_on-site_sanitation Processing of human faeces by wet vermifiltration for improved on-site sanitation], Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development 4(2):231, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The process produces primary treated blackwater, with much of the solid organic material removed from the effluent. Because liquid effluent is discharged almost immediately on entering the digester, little dissolved oxygen is consumed by the wastewater through the filtration stage. However, oxygen demand is leached into the wastewater flow through the filter as worms digest retained solids.&lt;ref name="Taylor2003"&gt;Taylor, M. Clarke, W. P., Greenfield, P. F. The treatment of domestic wastewater using small-scale vermicompost filter beds, Journal of Ecological Engineering, December 2003 21: 197–203&lt;/ref&gt; This oxygen demand can be removed with secondary treatment vermifilter reactors.&lt;ref name="Taylor2003"/&gt; Primary treatment vermifilters provide a similar level of liquid effluent treatment to a septic tank,&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Molla , P. O. Antwi , R.A. Buamah , H.M. Essandoh , E. Awuah [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273254620_The_potential_of_subsurface_infiltration_for_the_treatment_of_vermibed_effluents_generated_by_the_Biofil_toilet The Potential of Subsurface Infiltration for the Treatment of Biofil Toilet Technology Effluent], Management Studies, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but in less time because digestion of solids by worms takes place rapidly in the aerobic environment.&lt;ref name="Furlong2015" /&gt;

The liquid effluent is either discharged directly to a drain field or undergoes [[secondary treatment]] before being used for surface irrigation of soil.

===Secondary treatment===
[[File:Domestic vermifilter.jpg|thumb|Secondary treatment domestic vermifilter for wastewater showing drippers]]
Secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilters can be underneath the primary vermifilter in a single tower but are typically single reactors, where several reactors can be chained in series as sequential vermifilters. Drainage within the reactor is provided by filter media packed according to the [[hydraulic conductivity]] and [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of each material that is present within the vermifilter. The filter packing retains the solid particles present in the effluent wastewater, increases the hydraulic retention time and also provides a suitable habitat for sustaining a population of [[Vermicompost#Suitable species|composting earthworms]]. This population requires adequate moisture levels within the filter media, but also adequate drainage and oxygen levels.

Sprinklers or drippers can be used in secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilter reactors (see image).

Hydraulic factors (hydraulic retention time, hydraulic loading rate and organic loading rate) and biological factors (earthworm numbers, levels of biofilm) can influence treatment efficiency.

==  Design ==
Vermifilters are enclosed reactors made from durable materials that eliminate vermin entry, usually plastic or concrete. Ventilation must be sufficient to ensure an aerobic environment for the worms and microorganisms, while also inhibiting entry of unwanted flies. Temperature within the reactor needs to be maintained within a range suitable for the species of compost worms used.&lt;ref name="Taylor2003" /&gt;

=== Influent entry ===
Influent entry is from above the filter media. Full-flush toilets can have the entry point into the side of the reactor, whereas micro-flush toilets, because these do not provide sufficient water to convey solids through sewer pipes, are generally installed directly above the reactor. For primary treatment reactors, sufficient vertical space must be provided for growth of the pile. This is dependent on volume of solids in the influent and decomposition rate. Secondary and tertiary treatment reactors can use sprinklers or tricklers to distribute the influent wastewater evenly over the filter media to improve treatment efficiency of the filter media.

=== Sections ===
Vermifilter reactors may have three different filter sections: an organic filter as the top layer that provides habitat for the earthworms; the inorganic or inert filter - constituting a layer of gravel and a layer of sand; and the drainage layer or equalizer (a sump where the treated effluent is discharged and/or recirculated to the top of the reactor). The filter media may be suspended above a sump in a basket. Alternatively the filter media might sit on a drainage layer of coarse gravel or pervious plastic drainage coil. Synthetic geotextile cloth is used to retain the filter media in place above the drainage layer. To remain aerobic, adequate ventilation must be provided, along with an outlet for the liquid effluent to drain away.

=== Filter substrate ===
Drainage within the vermifilter reactor is provided by the filter media. The filter media has the dual purpose of retaining the solid organic material while also providing a habitat suitable for sustaining a population of [[composting worms]]. This population requires adequate moisture levels within the media, along with good drainage and aerobic conditions.

Common filter packing materials include sawdust,&lt;ref&gt;Arora, S., Rajpal, A., Kumar, T., Bhargava, R., Kazmi, A.A., 2014. Pathogen removal during wastewater treatment by vermifiltration. Environ. Technol. 35, 2493–2499.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arora, S. 2016"&gt;Arora, S., Rajpal, A., Kazmi, A.A., 2016. Antimicrobial Activity of Bacterial Community for Removal of Pathogens during Vermifiltration. J. Environ. Eng. 142 (5).&lt;/ref&gt; wood chips, coir, bark, peat, and straw for organic packing. Gravel, quartz sand, river bed gravel, pumice, mud balls, glass balls, ceramsite and charcoal are commonly used for inert packing. Surface area and porosity of filter packing materials influence treatment performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dahab, M.F. 1982 Effect of media design on the performance of fixed-bed anaerobic filters. Water Science &amp; Technology, 15, 369–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus materials with low granulometry and large surface area may improve the performance of the vermifilter.

==Sizing ==
Vermifilters can be constructed as single tower systems, or separate staged reactors (either gravity or pump operated) for the treatment of wastewater according to design requirements (primary, secondary, tertiary treatment). More stages &lt;ref&gt;Wang, L., Guo, F., Zheng, Z., Luo, X. &amp; Zhang, J. 2011 Enhancement of rural domestic sewage treatment performance, and assessment of microbial community diversity and structure using tower vermifiltration. Bioresource Technology, 102, 9462–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomar, P., Suthar, S. 2011 Urban wastewater treatment using vermi-biofiltration system. Desalination, 282, 95–103.&lt;/ref&gt; can increase level of treatment because multiple stage systems provide accumulating aerobic conditions suitable for nitrification of ammonium and removal of [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]].

The design parameters of vermifilters include stocking density of earthworms&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, R.K., Bharambe, G., Chaudhari, U., 2008. Sewage treatment by vermifiltration with synchronous treatment of sludge by earthworms: a low-cost sustainable technology over conventional systems with potential for decentralization. Environmentalist, 28(4), 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; (although over time earthworm population tends to be self-moderating), filter media composition,&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso-Vigueros, L., Ramírez-Camperos, E., Garzón-Zúñiga, M., 2013.  Evaluation of a pilot vermifilter for the treatment of wastewater.

Evaluation of vermifiltration process using natural ingredients for effective wastewater treatment. Ecol. Eng. 75, 370–377.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydraulic retention time]]&lt;ref name="Arora, S. 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arora, S., Rajpal, A., Kumar, T., Bhargava, R., Kazmi, A.A., 2014. A comparative study for pathogen removal using different filter media during vermifiltration. Water Sci. Technol. 70, 996–1003.&lt;/ref&gt; and organic loading rate. Hydraulic retention time and hydraulic loading rate both affect treatment and effluent quality. Hydraulic retention time is the actual time the wastewater is in contact with the filter media and is related to the depth of the vermifilter (which may increase over time due to the accumulation of earthworm vermicastings), reactor volume and type of material used (porosity). The hydraulic retention time determines wastewater inflow rate (hydraulic loading as influent volume per hour).

In principle, provided the environment is aerobic, the longer the wastewater remains inside the filter, the greater the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and COD removal efficiency will be, but at the expense of hydraulic loading. Wastewater requires sufficient contact time with the biofilm to allow for the adsorption, transformation, and reduction of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.J., Nair, J., Ho, G., 2008. The toxicity of ammonia/ammonium to the vermifiltration wastewater treatment process. Water Sci. Technol. 58, 1215–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydraulic loading rate is an essential design parameter and equates to the volume and of wastewater that a vermifilter can reasonably treat in a given time. For a given system, higher hydraulic loading rates will cause [[hydraulic retention time]] to decrease and therefore reduce level of treatment. Hydraulic loading rate may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application.&lt;ref name="Siegrist, R.L. 1987"&gt;Siegrist, R.L., 1987. Soil Clogging During Subsurface Wastewater Infiltration as Affected by Effluent Composition and Loading Rate. J. Environ.

Volume 100, March 2017, Pages 138–146&lt;/ref&gt; Organic loading rate is defined as the application of soluble and particulate organic matter (as BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) per unit area per unit time.&lt;ref name="Siegrist, R.L. 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otis, R.J., 2001.

Treatment efficiency is influenced by health, maturity and population abundance of earthworms. Abundance is a fundamental parameter for efficient operation of a vermifiltration system.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Y.S., Robin, P., Cluzeau, D., Bouché, M., Qiu, J.P., Laplanche,  A., Hassouna, M., Morand, P., Dappelo, C., Callarec, J., 2008. Vermifiltration as a stage in reuse of swine wastewater: Monitoring methodology on an experimental farm. Ecol. Eng. 32, 301–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Different values are reported in literature usually in grams or number of individuals per volume of filter packing or surface area of filter packing. Common densities vary between 10 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 40 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; per filter packing material.&lt;ref&gt;Tomar, P., Suthar, S., 2011. Urban wastewater treatment using vermi-biofiltration system. Desalination 282, 95–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, L., Wang, Y., Yang, J., Xing, M., Li, X., Yi, D., Deng, D., 2010. Earthworm-microorganism interactions: a strategy to stabilize domestic wastewater sludge. Water Res. 44(8), 2572–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

An abundance of earthworms improves treatment efficiency, in particular BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, TSS and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; removal. This is because earthworms release organic matter into the filter media and stimulate nitrogen mineralization. Earthworm castings may have substances which contribute to higher BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; removal.&lt;ref&gt;Lourenço, N., Nunes, L.M., Submitted. Optimization of a vermifiltration process for treating urban wastewater. Ecological Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and maintenance==
[[File:Sawdust..jpg|thumb|Sawdust]] 
[[File:Shredded olive branches..jpg|thumb|Shredded olive branches]]
A vermifilter has low mechanical and manual maintenance requirements, and, where gravity operated, requires no energy input. Recirculation, if required for improved effluent quality, would require a pump. 

An annual application of dry organic materials on the top of the filter media may be required for secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilters.
The volume of vermicast increases only slowly and occasionally vermicompost needs to be removed from the vermifilter.

Solids accumulate on the surface of the organic filter media (or filter packing). The liquid fraction drains through the medium into the sump or equaliser and is either discharged from the reactor or recirculated to the top entry for further treatment. Wastewater is discharged to the surface of the filter packing by direct application or by sprinklers, drippers or tricklers.

==Examples==

* A household pour flush toilet combined with primary vermifiltration and direct effluent soakage to soil, called the "Tiger Toilet", has been tested by Bear Valley Ventures and Primove Infrastructure Development Consultants in rural India. Unlike in a [[pit latrine]], it was found that there was virtually no accumulation of fecal material over a one-year period. In the effluent there was a 99% reduction in [[fecal coliforms]]. User satisfaction was high, driven mainly by a lack of odour.&lt;ref name="Furlong2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furlong|first1=C.|last2=Gibson|first2=W.T.|last3=Oak|first3=A.|last4=Thakar|first4=G.|last5=Kodgire|first5=M.|last6=Patankar|first6=R.|title=Technical and user evaluation of a novel worm-based, on-site sanitation system in rural India|journal=Waterlines|date=April 2016|volume=35|issue=2|pages=148–162|doi=10.3362/1756-3488.2016.013|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is now being marketed commercially in India where over 2000 of these toilets and treatment systems had been sold and installed by May 2017.&lt;ref name="tigertoiletwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigertoilet.com/|title=Tiger Toilet - A Breakthrough Sanitation Solution|last=|first=|date=|website=Tiger Toilet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, voters in Mississippi rejected Initiative 26, a measure that would have declared that human life begins at fertilization, which had drawn support from conservative Republicans and Democrats.

=== Workplace and pay discrimination ===
In April 2012, [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]'s repeal of Wisconsin's ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was described by opponents as furthering the "War on Women", which became a big issue in his recall election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/scott-walker-recall-war-women_n_1431143.html|title=Scott Walker Recall: 'War On Women' Fight Becomes Big Issue In Election|publisher=The Huffington Post| date=April 17, 2012|first=Amanda|last=Terkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was passed in 2009 in response to the large gap between the wages of men and women in Wisconsin.

===2016 Presidential candidates===
Political analysts have interpreted the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]] as appealing to a female constituency, and have used the phrase "war on women" to describe Republican opposition.&lt;ref name=thinkprogress2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/29/politics/hillary-clinton-women-gender-planned-parenthood/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/20/hillary-s-ready-for-the-war-on-women.html|title=Hillary's Ready for the 'War on Women'|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/gop-war-on-women-in-congress-213209|title=The House GOP's War on Women|author=Elijah Cummings|author-link=Elijah Cummings|date=30 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican presidential candidate [[Carly Fiorina]] said "If Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, there are a whole set of things that she won't be able to talk about. She won't be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won't be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged.

[[Donald Trump]], a [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate for the 2016 Presidency]] attended a Fox News debate in August 2015, where [[Megyn Kelly]] asked him about how he would respond to a [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton campaign]] saying that he was waging a "war on women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOqtra7j6UM|title=Is Donald Trump part of the 'war on women'? - Fox News Republican Debate|date=August 6, 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/07/us-usa-election-trump-women-idUSKCN0QC04W20150807|title=Trump draws boos as he bristles at 'war on women' question|website=Reuters|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with [[Don Lemon]] on ''[[CNN Tonight]]'', Trump said that Kelly is a "lightweight" and had "blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/index.html|title=Trump draws outrage after Megyn Kelly remarks - CNNPolitics.com|author=Holly Yan, CNN|date=August 8, 2015|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33833516|title=Donald Trump axed from event over Megyn Kelly blood comment|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump tweeted that his remark referred to Kelly's "nose" but was interpreted by critics as a reference to [[menstruation]].

== Reaction ==

=== Response from Republicans ===
Critics of the term have denied that a War on Women exists and some have suggested that it is a ploy to influence women voters. [[Reince Priebus]], the Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee|RNC]], referred to the War as a "fiction", saying "If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we'd have problems with caterpillars."&lt;ref name="caterpillars"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=David|title=RNC chair: GOP 'war on women' fictional like 'war on caterpillars'|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/05/rnc-chair-gop-war-on-women-fictional-like-war-on-caterpillars/|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=RNC chairman reflects on women, caterpillars|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11035818-rnc-chairman-reflects-on-women-caterpillars|newspaper=The Maddow Blog|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Kristin|title=Priebus Says Gender Battle Fictional as Caterpillar War|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-05/priebus-says-gender-battle-as-fictonal-as-caterpillar-war|newspaper=Businessweek|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Representative [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]] called the war a myth, saying "It's an effort to drive a political wedge in an election year." Referring to the 2010 elections and [[Nancy Pelosi]], she said that "It could be argued that the women actually unelected the first woman Speaker of the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dennis|first=Steven T.|title=Hill Women Play Starring Role in 'Mommy Wars'|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/hill-women-play-starring-role-mommy-wars-213960-1.html?pos=htmbtxt|newspaper=Roll Call|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/us-usa-campaign-rodgers-idUSBRE84H0YD20120518|title=Top Republican woman in Congress becomes a force|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina Governor [[Nikki Haley]] said in 2012 "There is no war on women.

Senator [[John McCain]], when asked by journalist [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] if there was a Republican War on Women, said "I think that there is a perception out there because of how this whole contraception issue played out — ah, we need to get off of that issue, in my view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Kathleen|title=McCain decries GOP fight against Obama mandate: 'we need to get off that issue'|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/mccain-decries-gop-fight-against-obama-mandate-we-need-to-get-off-that-issu/|newspaper=LifeSiteNews.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] countered the criticism from her fellow party members, challenging them to "go home and talk to your wife and your daughters" if they did not think there was a war on women, saying "It makes no sense to make this attack on women."&lt;ref name="Murkowski"/&gt;

After the [[Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012|2012 rape and pregnancy controversies]], Republican strategists met with aides of Republican figures to advise them on how to run against female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/gop-men-tutored-in-running-against-women-100701|title=GOP men told how to talk to women|author=Anna Plamer|date=12 May 2013|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-war-on-women-105453|author=Anna Palmer|date=4 Aug 2014|title=GOP solution to 'war on women'|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic sexual harassment scandals ===
Members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], both prominent and local, have been accused of participating in the war on women. In a column for ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Glenn Reynolds]] wrote in July 2013 that "most of the action in the war on women seems to be coming from the Democratic front," referring to the allegations of sexual harassment against [[San Diego]] mayor [[Bob Filner#Allegations of sexual harassment|Bob Filner]], the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal]], and the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'': [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/07/29/women-harassment-filner-weiner-sydney-leathers-column/2594213/ The latest in the war on women]. July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republican National Senatorial Committee]] has also used these scandals in press releases, tying Democratic Senators in [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;NRSC Press Release: [http://www.iowagop.org/war-on-women-bruce-braley-silent-as-fellow-democrats-mistreat-women/ Republican Party of Iowa].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NH Journal'': [http://nhjournal.com/2013/07/23/nrsc-dings-shaheen-over-war-on-women/ NRSC dings Shaheen over 'war on women'.] July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The messaging from Republicans was described as unlikely to be effective by Garance Franke-Ruta in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' because "[the War on Women] was an argument about Republican policies on women ... rather than about reprehensible individual behavior." Noting that many of the targets are not on upcoming ballots, Franke-Ruta continued by saying the Republican Party "is going to need its own pro-active framework for thinking about what is happening in America and why women have been drawn to Democrats in numbers that matter in key elections."&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
[[Jonathan Alter]] characterized the phrase as an "alliteratve but unfair notion".&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Jonathan, ''The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover ed. 2013 ({{ISBN|978-1-4516-4607-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;281 (author columnist, ''Bloomberg Voice'', analyst &amp; contributing ed., NBC News &amp; MSNBC, &amp; former sr. ed. &amp; columnist, ''Newsweek'').&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Weigel]] called for "a moment of silence" in his article entitled "The 'War on Women' Is Over: The life cycle of a political talking point, from birth to adolescence to death." In it he explained his understanding of the stages in the "life cycle" of the Democratic "talking point".&lt;ref name="Weigel" /&gt;

Molly Redden wrote an article for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' entitled "The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost". She described the difficulties faced by abortion providers: "Activists have been calling it the 'war on women.' But the onslaught of new abortion restrictions has been so successful, so strategically designed, and so well coordinated that the war in many places has essentially been lost."&lt;ref name=Redden &gt;{{Citation | last =Redden | first =Molly | author-link = | date=September 1, 2015 |title=The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost.

'''Zafrullah Chowdhury''' (born 27 December 1941) is a Bangladeshi public health activist. He is the founder of Gonoshasthaya Kendra (meaning the People's Health Center in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), a rural healthcare organisation. Dr. Chowdhury is known more for his work in formulating the [[Bangladesh]] National Drug Policy in 1982.

==Early life and career==
He spent his early childhood in [[Calcutta|Kolkata]] and later his family settled in [[Dhaka]]. He was one of ten children born to his parents. After attending Nabakumar School at Bakshibazar, he studied at [[Dhaka College]]. He studied medicine at [[Dhaka Medical College]], where he got involved with leftist political ideologies. As the general secretary of the Dhaka Medical College students' union, he held a press conference to expose the corruption at the hospital. After a turbulent student life, he finished his [[MBBS]] degree in 1964 and left for the UK for post-graduate studies in general and vascular surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Chozdhury, Z. 1995 The Politics of Essential Drugs, Zed Books Ltd; London&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he fought for independence during [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=History will absolve Zafrullah and his comrades|url=http://newagebd.net/128410/history-will-absolve-zafrullah-and-his-comrades/#sthash.ReJdAySR.YB6xiKEm.dpbs|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=The New Age|publisher=The New Age|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was involved in setting up the 480-bed [[Bangladesh Hospital]] for freedom fighters and the refugees. The hospital was run by a team of Bangladeshi doctors, medical students and volunteers. Women with no previous training in healthcare were trained within days to help out the patients. This experience in the field hospital led him to believe that an effective healthcare delivery system can be developed in rural Bangladesh by training women as a primary healthcare delivery platform. This achieved worldwide credibility when it was eventually published in [[The Lancet]].&lt;ref name="publichealthheroes.org"&gt;[http://www.publichealthheroes.org/past_heroes/2002/chowdhury.html Public Health Heroes Awards Ceremony&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gonoshasthaya Kendra==

In 1972 Dr. Chowdhury set up the [[Gonoshasthaya Kendra]]. Actually the idea was introduced in a concept paper titled, 'Basic Health Care in Rural Bangladesh' in [[Dhaka]]. The centre focuses on providing basic healthcare to the rural areas. The centre also runs a university, vocational training centre, agricultural cooperatives, hospital, a printing press, community schools and a generic drug manufacturing plant. Gonoshasthaya Kendra has been very successful in providing family planning services, lowering maternal, infant mortality rates. Though limited in its reach, it pioneered the introduction of cheaper generic drugs. In 1973, Gonoshasthaya Kendra introduced a Rural Healthcare Insurance System, the first of its kind in [[Bangladesh]].

Critiques have pointed out that rather than being national, the centre's reach has been confined to specific areas. However, Zafrullah Chowdhury believes that public health is a state matter, it can never be left to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newagebd.com/2006/dec/28/newyear07/heroes02.html New Age New Year Special 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Drug Policy==

Dr. Chowdury gained prominence by being the driving force in formulating the Bangladesh National Drug Policy in 1982. Before that, 4,000 commercial drugs were available in the market, mostly manufactured by the multi-national companies or imported from abroad. Most of the drugs were out of reach for majority of the people. Some of these drugs were unnecessary and even dangerous whereas the most essential 150 remained in short supply.

National drug policy changed all that. Following [[WHO]] guidelines for the developing countries, the policy restricted manufacturing and import of number of drugs to 225. It emphasised on manufacturing of generic drugs and manufacturing them locally. The result has been the wider availability of drugs at drastically reduced prices. And today, [[Bangladesh]] has turned into a drug exporting country.
==Controversy==
In 2015, the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]], which was set up to try perpetrators of war crimes committed during [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, charged Zafrullah Chowdhury on charge of contempt of court and sentenced him to "one hour" of 'confinement in the dock inside the courtroom" and fined him 5000 [[Bangladesh Taka|taka]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The court found guilty of contempt of court for his statement expressing concern over British journalist [[David Bergman (journalist)|David Bergman]]'s conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/06/18/arrest-warrant-issued-for-gonoshasthaya-kendra-founder-zafrullah-chowdhury|title = Arrest warrant issued for Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Zafrullah Chowdhury|last = |first = |date = 18 June 2015|work = |access-date = 19 June 2015|via = |publisher = BDNews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came as a surprise to many as being a freedom fighter, he was one of the vocal supporters of the controversial tribunal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
