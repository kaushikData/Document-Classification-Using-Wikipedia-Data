The '''752 Squadron "Pumas"''' (''Esquadra 572'') was a helicopter [[Search and Rescue]] squadron of the [[Portuguese Air Force]].

==History==
Activated on November 30, 1977, along with its sister [[751 Squadron]], the 752 Sqn. was the direct successor of the [[42 Squadron (Portugal)|42 Squadron]], which had been activated in the beginning of that year and was later disbanded leading to the creation of the 752 Squadron.

In October 1993, the 752 Squadron was disbanded after the creation of the "Puma" Flight in the recently formed [[711 Squadron]].

In 2008, the entry in service of the [[AgustaWestland EH101]] with the PoAF lead to changes in the operational structure of the branch in Azores. With this the Helicopter Flight of the 711 Squadron was deactivated and a detachment of the 751 Squadron replaced this flight in the Search and Rescue mission in Azores. However, due to complications in the logistical support provided by the manufacturer of the EH 101, the choice was made to reintroduce the SA 330 Puma into the medical evacuation operations to complement the 751 Squadron's detachment.

On September 24, 2008, the 752 Squadron is reactivated, at [[Lajes Air Base]], to operate the Aérospatiale SA 330, beginning its operational mission on October 1. With this the 751 Sqn. will provide transport, medical evacuation, and search and rescue operations together with the EH 101 Merlin helicopters of the 751 Sqn, which will guarantee the long-range search and rescue.[http://www.acorianooriental.pt/noticias/view/174946] The 752 Squadron was disbanded April 5, 2011.

[[File:Hiiumaa laiud Muhust.jpg|thumb|Hiiumaa islet from Muhu; from right to left: Kõverlaid, Heinlaid, Ahelaid, Kõrgelaid, Vareslaid, Hanerahu, Hanikatsi laid, Saarnaki laid, Moonsund]]
'''Ahelaid''' is a small uninhabited [[islet]] in [[Estonia]].  It lies in the [[Baltic Sea]], south-east of [[Hiiumaa]] island. It has a surface area of 25 hectares.  It is part of the [[Hiiumaa Islets Landscape Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.laiud.hiiuloodus.ee/english/index.html |title=Hiiumaa Islets Landscape Reserve website |access-date=2008-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221090158/http://www.laiud.hiiuloodus.ee/english/index.html |archive-date=2009-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahelaid lies 10.5&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Sarve peninsula]] on Hiiumaa, 14&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Salinõmme peninsula]] on Hiiumaa and 6.5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tammiski nukk]] on [[Muhu]].  Although it is closer to Muhu than to Hiiumaa, it is administered as part of [[Hiiu County]].  Near the island are some smaller islets: to the north, stony [[Aherahu]]; to the west [[Ankrurahu]], which has some vegetation; to the east [[Luigerahu]] and to the northeast a few stone piles barely above the sea level called [[Kajakarahud]].

The average height of the islet is below 2 meters and the highest point is 4.6 meters.

There are 45 bird species nesting on the islet annually, including [[sedge warbler]] (''Acrocephalus schoenobaenus''), [[Arctic tern]] (''Sterna paradisaea'') and  [[whitethroat]] (''Sylvia communis'').  Altogether 60 species of birds have been recorded.

The islet is also known as '''Hakilaid''', probably from the [[common eider]] (''Somateria mollissima'') ({{lang-et|hahk}}).

There has been no habitation on the islet. People from both Muhu and Hiiumaa have gathered [[hay]] there in summer as until the end of the 19th century there was a shortage of land for hay. The islet may also have been used as pasture. There has been a fishermen's hut on the islet.

'''''Bota Sot''''' (English: World Today) is a daily [[newspaper]] from [[Kosovo]], originally published by members of the Kosovo diaspora in Switzerland.

==History==

''Bota Sot'' is published by Media Print and is owned by Xhevdet Mazrekaj, a diaspora businessman. The newspaper was published for the first time in 1995, and initially solely published abroad.  The paper editorially supports the [[Democratic Party of Albania]] and has supported two previous presidents of Kosovo from that party, [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and [[Sali Berisha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attacks on the Press in 2001 - Yugoslavia |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,COI,CPJ,ANNUALREPORT,MNE,47c5664f24,0.html |publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=February 2002 |quote=the Geneva-based Bota Sot, supports politician Ibrahim Rugova and his leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018133210/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category%2CCOI%2CCPJ%2CANNUALREPORT%2CMNE%2C47c5664f24%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the newspaper's journalists have been assassinated.  [[Xhemail Mustafa]], a journalist and advisor to President Rugova, was assassinated in November, 2000.  ''Bota Sot'' journalist Bekim Kastrati was assassinated in October, 2001, along with two other men who were in his car at the time, in the village of Lauša, near [[Prishtina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attacks on the Press in 2001 - Yugoslavia |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,COI,CPJ,ANNUALREPORT,MNE,47c5664f24,0.html |publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=February 2002 |quote=Bekim Kastrati, Bota Sot KILLED (motive unconfirmed)  Kastrati, an ethnic Albanian journalist for the Albanian-language daily Bota Sot, was shot on October 19 at around 8 p.m. in the village of Lausa, west of the provincial capital, Pristina, along with two other men who were riding in his car at the time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018133210/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category%2CCOI%2CCPJ%2CANNUALREPORT%2CMNE%2C47c5664f24%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the [[United Kingdom]] used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each. 

The constituency of '''Cheshire West''' was one of them.

From 1979 to 1984, it consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Bebington and Ellesmere Port (UK Parliament constituency)|Bebington and Ellesmere Port]], [[Birkenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Birkenhead]], [[City of Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|City of Chester]], [[Nantwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Nantwich]], [[Northwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Northwich]], [[Wallasey (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallasey]], and [[Wirral (UK Parliament constituency)|Wirral]].  From 1984 to 1994, it consisted of Birkenhead, City of Chester, Eddisbury, Ellesmere Port and Neston, Halton, Wallasey, Wirral South, and Wirral West.

The '''coat of arms of Sogn og Fjordane''' is an official symbol of [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county, [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/kommunev%C3%A5pen/fastsettelse_av_kommunev%C3%A5pen ''kommunevåpen – fastsettelse av kommunevåpen'' (Store norske leksikon, 2005 - 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coat of arms]] features the geographical layout of the county. The three blue peaks on  a silver background symbolize the three fjords of the county: [[Nordfjorden (Sogn og Fjordane)|Nordfjord]], [[Sunnfjord]], and [[Sognefjord]].  The name of the county is derived from these fjords. Nearly all villages, towns and population centers are situated on one of these fjords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/sognfjord.htm|title=Sogn og Fjordane|publisher=Norske Kommunevåpen|accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms was introduced on 23 September 1983. It is almost exclusively used by the [[Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality|County Administration]] and use by others must be approved by them in advance.  A banner of the coat of arms is used as the [[Flag of Sogn og Fjordane|county flag]].

Geostrategists, as distinct from geopoliticians, advocate aggressive strategies, and approach geopolitics from a [[nationalist]] point of view. As with all [[political theory|political theories]], geostrategies are relevant principally to the context in which they were devised: the nationality of the strategist, the strength of his or her country's resources, the scope of his or her country's goals, the political geography of the time period, and the technological factors that affect military, political, economic, and cultural engagement. Geostrategy can function normatively, advocating foreign policy based on geographic factors, analytically, describing how foreign policy is shaped by geography, or predictively, predicting a country's future foreign policy decisions on the basis of geographic factors.

Many geostrategists are also geographers, specializing in subfields of [[geography]], such as [[human geography]], [[political geography]], [[economic geography]], [[cultural geography]], [[military geography]], and [[strategic geography]]. Geostrategy is most closely related to strategic geography.

Especially following [[World War II]], some scholars divide geostrategy into two [[school of thought|schools]]: the uniquely German [[Organic theory of the state|organic state theory]]; and, the broader [[Anglo-American relations|Anglo-American]] geostrategies.&lt;ref name="parameters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillen|first=John|author2=Michael P.

Critics of geostrategy have asserted that it is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] gloss used by dominant nations to justify [[imperialism|imperialist]] or [[hegemony|hegemonic]] aspirations, or that it has been rendered irrelevant because of technological advances, or that its [[essentialism|essentialist]] focus on geography leads geostrategists to incorrect conclusions about the conduct of foreign policy. {{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Defining geostrategy==
Academics, theorists, and practitioners of geopolitics have agreed upon no standard definition for "geostrategy." Most all definitions, however, emphasize the merger of [[strategy|strategic]] considerations with geopolitical factors. While geopolitics is ostensibly neutral, examining the geographic and political features of different regions, especially the impact of geography on politics, geostrategy involves comprehensive planning, assigning means for achieving national goals or securing assets of [[military]] or political significance.

===Coining the term===
The term "'''geo-strategy'''" was first used by [[Frederick L. Schuman]] in his 1942 article "Let Us Learn Our Geopolitics." It was a translation of the [[German language|German]] term "'''''Wehrgeopolitik'''''" as used by German geostrategist [[Karl Haushofer]]. Previous translations had been attempted, such as "'''defense-geopolitics'''." [[Robert Strausz-Hupé]] had coined and popularized "'''war geopolitics'''" as another alternate translation.&lt;ref name="gyorgy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyorgy|first=Andrew|date=November 1943|title=The Geopolitics of War: Total War and Geostrategy|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=5|issue=4|pages=347–362|doi=10.2307/2125293|jstor=2125293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern definitions===
{{over-quotation|section|date=September 2012}}
* "[G]eostrategy is about the exercise of power over particularly critical spaces on the Earth's surface; about crafting a political presence over the international system. It is aimed at enhancing one's security and prosperity; about making the international system more prosperous; about shaping rather than being shaped. A geostrategy is about securing access to certain trade routes, strategic bottlenecks, rivers, islands and seas. It requires an extensive military presence, normally coterminous with the opening of overseas military stations and the building of warships capable of deep oceanic power projection. It also requires a network of alliances with other great powers who share one's aims or with smaller 'lynchpin states' that are located in the regions one deems important."
:—James Rogers and Luis Simón, "Think Again: European Geostrategy"&lt;ref name="geostrategy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europeangeostrategy.ideasoneurope.eu/2010/03/14/think-again-european-geostrategy/ |title=Think Again: European Geostrategy |first1=James |last1=Rogers |first2=Luis |last2=Simón |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424042233/http://europeangeostrategy.ideasoneurope.eu/2010/03/14/think-again-european-geostrategy/ |archivedate=24 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[T]he words ''geopolitical, strategic,'' and ''geostrategic'' are used to convey the following meanings: ''geopolitical'' reflects the combination of geographic and political factors determining the condition of a state or region, and emphasizing the impact of geography on politics; ''strategic'' refers to the comprehensive and planned application of measures to achieve a central goal or to vital assets of military significance; and '''geostrategic''' merges strategic consideration with geopolitical ones."
:—[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], ''Game Plan'' (emphasis in original)&lt;ref name="gameplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brzezinski|first=Zbigniew|authorlink=Zbigniew Brzezinski|year=1986|title=Game Plan: A Geostrategic Framework for the Conduct of the U.S.–Soviet Contest|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Press|location=Boston|page=xiv|isbn=0-87113-084-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the [[United States]], [[Eurasia]]n geostrategy involves the purposeful management of geostrategically dynamic states and the careful handling of geopolitically catalytic states, in keeping with the twin interests of America in the short-term preservation of its unique global power and in the long-run transformation of it into increasingly [[institutionalism in international relations|institutionalized]] global cooperation. To put it in a terminology that hearkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of [[Imperialism|imperial]] geostrategy are to prevent [[collusion]] and maintain [[collective defense|security dependence]] among the [[vassal]]s, to keep [[tributary|tributaries]] [[:wikt:pliant|pliant]] and protected, and to keep the [[barbarian]]s from coming together."
:—Zbigniew Brzezinski, ''The Grand Chessboard''&lt;ref name="chessboard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brzezinski|first=Zbigniew|authorlink=Zbigniew Brzezinski|year=1997|title=The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-02725-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Geostrategy'' is the geographic direction of a state's foreign policy. More precisely, geostrategy describes where a state concentrates its efforts by projecting military power and directing diplomatic activity. The underlying assumption is that states have limited resources and are unable, even if they are willing, to conduct a ''tous asimuths'' foreign policy. Instead they must focus politically and militarily on specific areas of the world. Geostrategy describes this foreign-policy thrust of a state and does not deal with motivation or decision-making processes. The geostrategy of a state, therefore, is not necessarily motivated by geographic or geopolitical factors. A state may project power to a location because of ideological reasons, interest groups, or simply the whim of its leader.

* "It is recognized that the term ''' 'geo-strategy' ''' is more often used, in current writing, in a global context, denoting the consideration of global land-sea distribution, distances, and accessibility among other geographical factors in strategic planning and action... Here the definition of geo-strategy is used in a more limited regional frame wherein the ''sum of geographic factors interact to influence or to give advantage to one adversary, or intervene to modify strategic planning as well as political and military venture.''"

==Theory and methodology==

As a science or science based political practice geostrategy uses factual and [[empirical analysis]],&lt;ref name="DeiniolJones"&gt;Deiniol Jones, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1C7pAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Cosmopolitan Mediation?: Conflict Resolution and the Oslo Accords]'', Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; thus theoretical formulations in geostrategy usually heavily rely on empirical base although [[fact]]s-[[Value (ethics)|value]]s relations  or conclusions are differently observed by different and/or competitive geostrategic approaches.&lt;ref name="DeiniolJones"/&gt; Geostrategic conceptions that stems from the theory become base for the countries foreign and international policies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Erickson and Lyle J. Goldstein, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Xu Qi&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, "21世纪初海上地缘战略与中国海军的发展" [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Maritime+geostrategy+and+the+development+of+the+Chinese+navy+in+the+...-a0156364589 Maritime Geostrategy and the Development of the Chinese Navy in the Early 21st Century], 中国军事科学 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;China Military Science&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Vol. 17, No. 4) 2004, pp. 75-81, Naval War College Review Vol. 59, No. 4, Autumn 2006, pp. 46-67&lt;/ref&gt; Geostrategic conceptions are also historically acquired or even inherited from one country to another due to common history, relations between the countries, culture and even propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Saw Swee-Hock, Sheng Lijun, Chin Kin Wah, ''[https://books.google.en/books?id=hsFCNjxI0P8C&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;ots=uwNbe1RA17&amp;dq=%22geostrategic%20conception%22&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Asean-China Relations: Realities and Prospects]'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2005, pp.136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The geostrategy of location include river valleys, inland sea, world ocean, world island, and so on. For instance, the start of Western civilization was located in the river valleys of the [[Nile]] in Egypt and the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] in Mesopotamia. The Nile and Tigris and Euphrates not only provided the fertile soil for crop production, but also allowed for the floods that taxed the ingenuity of the inhabitants. The climate of the area was conducive to an existence based primarily upon agriculture. The rivers also provided the avenues of trade in a period when muscles of man and the winds of the sky were the motive power of ships. The river valleys became a unifying factor in the political development of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Fifield, Russell H. (The Journal of geography, Vol.- No.-, [1944]) [SSCI, SCOPUS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
As early as [[Herodotus]], observers saw strategy as heavily influenced by the geographic setting of the actors. In ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|History]]'', Herodotus describes a clash of civilizations between the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Scythia]]ns, and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]—all of which he believed were heavily influenced by the physical geographic setting.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|others=trans. David Grene|title=[[Histories (Herodotus)|The History]]|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=1-4165-1697-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] proposed a geometrical science of strategy in the 1799 ''[[The Spirit of the Modern System of War]].'' His system predicted that the larger states would swallow the smaller ones, resulting in eleven large states. Mackubin Thomas Owens notes the similarity between von Bülow's predictions and the map of Europe after the [[unification of Germany]] and [[unification of Italy|of Italy]].&lt;ref name="owens"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mackubin Thomas Owens|date=Autumn 1999|title=In Defense of Classical Geopolitics|journal=Naval War College Review|volume=LII|issue=4|url=http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review/1999/autumn/art3-a99.htm|accessdate=2004-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010306130037/http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/review/1999/autumn/art3-a99.htm |archivedate=2001-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden age===
Between 1890 and 1919 the world became a geostrategist's paradise, leading to the formulation of the classical geopolitical theories. The international system featured rising and falling [[great power]]s, many with global reach. There were no new [[frontier]]s for the great powers to [[exploration|explore]] or [[colonization|colonize]]—the entire world was divided between the empires and colonial powers. From this point forward, international politics would feature the struggles of state against state.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

Two strains of geopolitical thought gained prominence: an Anglo-American school, and a German school. [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and [[Halford J. Mackinder]] outlined the American and British conceptions of geostrategy, respectively, in their works ''[[The Problem of Asia]]'' and "''[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]''".&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, The geographical pivot of history. The Geographical Journal, 1904, 23, pp. 421–37; Pascal Venier, "[http://www.pascalvenier.com/venier2004c.pdf The Geographical Pivot of History and Early 20th Century Geopolitical Culture]", ''Geographical Journal'', vol. 170, no 4, December 2004, pp. 330-336.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Ratzel]] and [[Rudolf Kjellén]] developed an [[organic theory of the state]] which laid the foundation for Germany's unique school of geostrategy.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Edmund A. Walsh and Gen. MacArthur, Tokyo, 1948.jpg|thumb|Fr. [[Edmund A. Walsh]], SJ]]
The most prominent [[Germany|German]] geopolitician was General [[Karl Haushofer]]. After [[World War II]], during the [[Allied Control Council|Allied occupation of Germany]], the [[United States]] investigated many officials and public figures to determine if they should face charges of [[war crimes]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. [[Haushofer]], an academic primarily, was interrogated by Father [[Edmund A. Walsh]], a professor of geopolitics from the [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]], at the request of the U.S. authorities. Despite his involvement in crafting one of the justifications for Nazi aggression, Fr. Walsh determined that Haushofer ought not stand trial.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Edmund A.|authorlink=Edmund A. Walsh|year=1949|title=Total Power: A Footnote to History|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|location=Garden City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the term "geopolitics" fell into disrepute, because of its association with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[geopolitik]]''. Virtually no books published between the end of World War II and the mid-1970s used the word "geopolitics" or "geostrategy" in their titles, and geopoliticians did not label themselves or their works as such. German theories prompted a number of critical examinations of ''geopolitik'' by American geopoliticians such as [[Robert Strausz-Hupé]], [[Derwent Whittlesey]], and [[Andrew Gyorgy]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

As the [[Cold War]] began, [[N.J. Spykman]] and [[George F. Kennan]] laid down the foundations for the U.S. policy of [[containment]], which would dominate [[Western world|Western]] geostrategic thought for the next forty years.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Alexander P. de Seversky.jpg|thumb|Alexander de Seversky]] --&gt;

[[Alexander Procofieff de Seversky|Alexander de Seversky]] would propose that airpower had fundamentally changed geostrategic considerations and thus proposed a "geopolitics of airpower." His ideas had some influence on the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], but the ideas of Spykman and Kennan would exercise greater weight.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt; Later during the Cold War, [[Colin S. Gray|Colin Gray]] would decisively reject the idea that airpower changed geostrategic considerations, while [[Saul B. Cohen]] examined the idea of a "shatterbelt", which would eventually inform the [[domino theory]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

===Post-Cold War===

After Cold War ended, states started preferring management of space at low cost to expansion of it with military force. Use of military force in order to secure space causes not only great burden on countries, but also severe criticism from the [[international society]] as interdependence between countries continuously increases. As a way of new space management, countries either created regional institutions related to the space or make [[regimes]] on specific issues to allow intervention on space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbpia.co.kr.access.ewha.ac.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06616401&lt;/ref&gt; Such mechanisms let countries to have indirect control over space. The indirect space management reduces required capital and at the same time provides justification and legitimacy of the management, that the countries involved do not have to face criticism from the international society.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, for most [[NATO]] or former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, Geopolitical strategies have generally followed the course of either solidifying security obligations or accesses to global resources; however, the strategies of other countries have not been as palpable.

==Notable geostrategists==
The below geostrategists were instrumental in founding and developing the major geostrategic [[doctrine]]s in the discipline's history. While there have been many other geostrategists, these have been the most influential in shaping and developing the field as a whole.

===Alfred Thayer Mahan===
[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] was an [[United States Navy|American Navy]] officer and president of the [[U.S. Naval War College]]. He is best known for his ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History|Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'' series of books, which argued that naval supremacy was the deciding factor in [[great power]] warfare. In 1900, Mahan's book ''The Problem of Asia'' was published. In this volume he laid out the first geostrategy of the modern era.

The ''Problem of Asia'' divides the continent of Asia into 3 zones:
* A northern zone, located above the [[40th parallel north]], characterized by its cold climate, and dominated by land power;
* The "Debatable and Debated" zone, located between the 40th and [[30th parallel north|30th parallels]], characterized by a temperate climate; and,
* A southern zone, located below the 30th parallel north, characterized by its hot climate, and dominated by sea power.&lt;ref name="mahan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahan|first=Alfred Thayer|authorlink=Alfred Thayer Mahan|title=The Problem of Asia: Its Effect upon International Politics|year=1900|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|isbn=0-7658-0524-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Debated and Debatable zone, Mahan observed, contained two [[peninsula]]s on either end ([[Anatolia]] and the [[Korean Peninsula]]), the [[Suez Canal]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]], two countries marked by their mountain ranges ([[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]), the [[Pamir Mountains]], the [[Himalayas]], the [[Yangtze]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt; Within this zone, Mahan asserted that there were no strong states capable of withstanding outside influence or capable even of maintaining stability within their own borders. So whereas the political situations to the north and south were relatively stable and determined, the middle remained "debatable and debated ground."&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

North of the 40th parallel, the vast expanse of Asia was dominated by the [[Russian Empire]]. Russia possessed a central position on the continent, and a wedge-shaped projection into [[Central Asia]], bounded by the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and [[Caspian Sea]] on one side and the mountains of Afghanistan and Western China on the other side. To prevent Russian expansionism and achievement of predominance on the Asian continent, Mahan believed pressure on Asia's flanks could be the only viable strategy pursued by sea powers.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

South of the 30th parallel lay areas dominated by the sea powers – the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Germany]] and [[Japan]]. To Mahan, the possession of [[India]] by the United Kingdom was of key strategic importance, as India was best suited for exerting balancing pressure against Russia in Central Asia. The United Kingdom’s predominance in [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]] was also considered important.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

The strategy of sea powers, according to Mahan, ought to be to deny Russia the benefits of commerce that come from sea commerce. He noted that both the [[Turkish Straits]] and [[Danish straits|Danish Straits]] could be closed by a hostile power, thereby denying Russia access to the sea. Further, this disadvantageous position would reinforce Russia's proclivity toward expansionism in order to obtain wealth or [[warm water port]]s.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt; Natural geographic targets for Russian expansionism in search of access to the sea would therefore be the Chinese seaboard, the [[Persian Gulf]], and Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

In this contest between land power and sea power, [[Russia]] would find itself allied with [[France]] (a natural sea power, but in this case necessarily acting as a land power), arrayed against Germany, Britain, Japan, and the United States as sea powers.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt; Further, Mahan conceived of a unified, modern state composed of [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], possessing an efficiently organized army and navy to stand as a counterweight to Russian expansion.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

Further dividing the map by geographic features, Mahan stated that the two most influential lines of division would be the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]]. As most developed nations and resources lay above the [[North–South divide]], politics and commerce north of the two canals would be of much greater importance than those occurring south of the canals. As such, the great progress of historical development would not flow from north to south, but from east to west, in this case leading toward Asia as the locus of advance.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;

===Halford J. Mackinder===
[[Halford J. Mackinder]]'s major work, Democratic ideals and reality: a study in the politics of reconstruction, appeared in 1919.[12] It presented his theory of the Heartland and made a case for fully taking into account geopolitical factors at the Paris Peace conference and contrasted (geographical) reality with Woodrow Wilson's idealism. The book's most famous quote was: "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World."

This message was composed to convince the world statesmen at the Paris Peace conference of the crucial importance of Eastern Europe as the strategic route to the Heartland was interpreted as requiring a strip of buffer state to separate Germany and Russia. These were created by the peace negotiators but proved to be ineffective bulwarks in 1939 (although this may be seen as a failure of other, later statesmen during the interbellum). The principal concern of his work was to warn of the possibility of another major war (a warning also given by economist John Maynard Keynes).

Mackinder was anti-[[Bolshevik]], and as British High Commissioner in Southern Russia in late 1919 and early 1920, he stressed the need for Britain to continue her support to the [[White Movement|White Russian]] forces, which he attempted to unite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blouet | first1 = Brian W. | year = 1976 | title = Sir Halford Mackinder as British high commissioner to South Russia 1919–1920 | url = | journal = Geographical Journal | volume = 142 | issue = | pages = 228–36 | doi=10.2307/1796597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackinder's work paved the way for the establishment of geography as a distinct discipline in the United Kingdom. His role in fostering the teaching of geography is probably greater than that of any other single British geographer.

Whilst Oxford did not appoint a professor of Geography until 1934, both the [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] established professorial chairs in Geography in 1917. Mackinder himself became a full professor in Geography in the University of London ([[London School of Economics]]) in 1923.

Mackinder is often credited with introducing two new terms into the English language: "manpower" and "heartland".

The [[Heartland Theory]] was enthusiastically taken up by the German school of [[Geopolitik]], in particular by its main proponent [[Karl Haushofer]]. Geopolitik was later embraced by the [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in the 1930s. The German interpretation of the Heartland Theory is referred to explicitly (without mentioning the connection to Mackinder) in ''[[The Nazis Strike]]'', the second of [[Frank Capra]]'s "[[Why We Fight]]" series of [[United States|American]] [[World War II]] [[propaganda film]]s.

The Heartland Theory and more generally classical geopolitics and geostrategy were extremely influential in the making of US strategic policy during the period of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, G.R. ''Geopolitics in United States Strategic Policy'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], particularly in his geopolitical model "[[Intermediate Region]]".

===Friedrich Ratzel===
[[File:Friedrich Ratzel.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Ratzel]].]]
Influenced by the works of Alfred Thayer Mahan, as well as the German geographers [[Carl Ritter]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]], '''[[Friedrich Ratzel]]''' would lay the foundations for ''[[geopolitik]]'', [[Germany]]'s unique strain of [[geopolitics]].

Ratzel wrote on the natural division between [[land power]]s and [[sea power]]s, agreeing with Mahan that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from [[international trade|trade]] would support the development of a [[merchant marine]].&lt;ref name="dorpalen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorpalen|first=Andreas|year=1984|title=The World of General Haushofer|publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8046-0112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his key contribution were the development of the concepts of ''[[lebensraum|raum]]'' and the [[organic theory of the state]]. He theorized that states were [[organic (model)|organic]] and growing, and that [[border]]s were only temporary, representing pauses in their natural movement.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; ''Raum'' was the land, [[spirituality|spiritually]] connected to a [[nation]] (in this case, the German peoples), from which the people could draw sustenance, find adjacent inferior nations which would support them,&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; and which would be fertilized by their ''kultur'' (culture).&lt;ref name="mattern"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattern|first=Johannes|year=1942|title=Geopolitik: Doctrine of National Self-Sufficiency and Empire|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzel's ideas would influence the works of his student Rudolf Kjellén, as well as those of General Karl Haushofer.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

===Rudolf Kjellén===
[[Rudolf Kjellén]] was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] political scientist and student of Friedrich Ratzel. He first coined the term "geopolitics."&lt;ref name="mattern" /&gt; His writings would play a decisive role in influencing [[General Karl Haushofer]]'s ''geopolitik'', and indirectly the future [[Nazism|Nazi]] foreign policy.&lt;ref name="mattern" /&gt;

His writings focused on five central concepts that would underlie German ''geopolitik'':
# ''Reich'' was a territorial concept that was composed of ''Raum'' (''[[Lebensraum]]''), and strategic military shape;
# ''[[Volk]]'' was a racial conception of the state;
# ''Haushalt'' was a call for [[autarky]] based on land, formulated in reaction to the vicissitudes of [[international trade|international markets]];
# ''Gesellschaft'' was the social aspect of a nation's organization and cultural appeal, Kjellén [[anthropomorphize|anthropomorphizing]] inter-state relations more than Ratzel had; and,
# ''Regierung'' was the form of [[government]] whose [[bureaucracy]] and [[army]] would contribute to the people's pacification and coordination.&lt;ref name="mattern" /&gt;

===General Karl Haushofer===
[[Karl Haushofer]]'s geopolitik expanded upon that of Ratzel and Kjellén. While the latter two conceived of geopolitik as the state-as-an-organism-in-space put to the service of a leader, Haushofer's Munich school specifically studied geography as it related to war and designs for empire.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; The behavioral rules of previous geopoliticians were thus turned into dynamic [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[doctrine]]s for action on lebensraum and world power.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

Haushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as "the duty to safeguard the right to the soil, to the land in the widest sense, not only the land within the frontiers of the Reich, but the right to the [[Volksdeutsche|more extensive Volk]] and cultural lands."&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt; Culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic expansion. Culture provided a guide as to the best areas for expansion, and could make expansion safe, whereas solely military or commercial power could not.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

To Haushofer, the existence of a state depended on living space, the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies. Germany had a high [[population density]], whereas the old colonial powers had a much lower density: a virtual mandate for German expansion into resource-rich areas.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; A buffer zone of territories or insignificant states on one's borders would serve to protect Germany.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

Closely linked to this need was Haushofer's assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the international system. The small states surrounding Germany ought to be brought into the vital German order.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; These states were seen as being too small to maintain practical autonomy (even if they maintained large colonial possessions) and would be better served by protection and organization within Germany. In Europe, he saw [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]] and the "mutilated alliance" of [[Austro-Hungary]] as supporting his assertion.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

Haushofer and the Munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past a restoration of the [[German Empire|German borders of 1914]] and "a place in the sun." They set as goals a New European Order, then a New Afro-European Order, and eventually to a Eurasian Order.&lt;ref name="mattern" /&gt; This concept became known as a [[pan-region]], taken from the American [[Monroe Doctrine]], and the idea of national and continental self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="mattern" /&gt; This was a forward-looking refashioning of the [[colonialism|drive for colonies]], something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity, but more as a matter of prestige, and of putting pressure on older colonial powers. The fundamental motivating force was not be economic, but cultural and spiritual.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt;

Beyond being an economic concept, pan-regions were a strategic concept as well. Haushofer acknowledged the strategic concept of the [[Heartland Theory|Heartland]] put forward by the Halford Mackinder.&lt;ref name="dorpalen" /&gt; If Germany could control [[Eastern Europe]] and subsequently [[European Russia|Russian territory]], it could control a strategic area to which hostile [[sea power]] could be denied.&lt;ref name="mackinder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackinder|first=Halford J.|authorlink=Halford J. Mackinder|year=1942|title=Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction|url=http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books/Books%20-%201979%20and%20earlier/Democratic%20Ideals%20and%20Reality%20-%201942/DIR.pdf|publisher=National Defense University Press|location=Washington D.C.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305174521/http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books/Books%20-%201979%20and%20earlier/Democratic%20Ideals%20and%20Reality%20-%201942/DIR.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allying with [[Italy]] and [[Japan]] would further augment German strategic control of Eurasia, with those states becoming the naval arms protecting Germany's insular position.&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt;

===Nicholas J. Spykman===
[[Nicholas J. Spykman]] was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-American geostrategist, known as the "godfather of [[containment]]." His geostrategic work, ''The Geography of the Peace'' (1944), argued that the balance of power in [[Eurasia]] directly affected United States security.

N.J. Spykman based his geostrategic ideas on those of Sir Halford Mackinder's Heartland theory. Spykman's key contribution was to alter the strategic valuation of the Heartland vs. the "Rimland" (a geographic area analogous to Mackinder's "Inner or Marginal Crescent").&lt;ref name="spykman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spykman|first=Nicholas J.|authorlink=Nicholas J. Spykman|year=1944|title=The Geography of the Peace|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|location=New York|isbn=0-208-00654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spykman does not see the heartland as a region which will be unified by powerful [[transport]] or [[communication]] infrastructure in the near future. As such, it won't be in a position to compete with the United States' [[sea power]], despite its uniquely defensive position.&lt;ref name="spykman" /&gt; The rimland possessed all of the key resources and populations—its domination was key to the control of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="spykman" /&gt; His strategy was for Offshore powers, and perhaps Russia as well, to resist the consolidation of control over the rimland by any one power.&lt;ref name="spykman" /&gt; Balanced power would lead to peace.

===George F. Kennan===
[[File:Kennan.jpeg|thumb|George F. Kennan]]
[[George F. Kennan]], U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, laid out the seminal Cold War geostrategy in his ''[[Long Telegram]]'' and ''[[The Sources of Soviet Conduct]]''. He coined the term "[[containment]]",&lt;ref name="kennan-x"&gt;{{cite journal|author="X"|date=July 1947|title=The Sources of Soviet conduct|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|issue=XXV|pages=575–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would become the guiding idea for U.S. [[grand strategy]] over the next forty years, although the term would come to mean something significantly different from Kennan's original formulation.&lt;ref name="kennan-m"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennan|first=George F.|authorlink=George F. Kennan|title=Memoirs: 1925–1950|pages=354–367|isbn=0-09-085800-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennan advocated what was called "strongpoint containment." In his view, the United States and its allies needed to protect the productive industrial areas of the world from Soviet domination. He noted that of the five centers of industrial strength in the world—the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany, and Russia—the only contested area was that of Germany. Kennan was concerned about maintaining the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] between the U.S. and the [[USSR]], and in his view, only these few industrialized areas mattered.

Here Kennan differed from [[Paul Nitze]], whose seminal Cold War document, [[NSC 68]], called for "undifferentiated or global containment," along with a massive military buildup.&lt;ref name="LaFeber"&gt;{{cite book|last=LaFeber|first=Walter|year=2002|title=America, Russia, and the Cold War|location=New York|page=69|isbn=0-471-51138-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennan saw the Soviet Union as an [[ideology|ideological]] and political challenger rather than a true military threat. There was no reason to fight the Soviets throughout [[Eurasia]], because those regions were not productive, and the Soviet Union was already exhausted from [[World War II]], limiting its ability to project power abroad. Therefore, Kennan disapproved of U.S. involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and later spoke out critically against [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s military buildup.

===Henry Kissinger===
[[File:Henry Kissinger.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Kissinger]].]]
[[Henry Kissinger]] implemented two geostrategic objectives when in office: the deliberate move to shift the [[polarity in international relations|polarity]] of the international system from bipolar to tripolar; and, the designation of regional stabilizing states in connection with the [[Nixon Doctrine]]. In Chapter 28 of his long work, ''[[Diplomacy (Kissinger)|Diplomacy]]'', Kissinger discusses the "[[opening of China]]" as a deliberate strategy to change the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in the international system, taking advantage of the [[Sino-Soviet split|split within the Sino-Soviet bloc]].&lt;ref name="kissdip"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Kissinger|title=Diplomacy|page=723|isbn=0-671-65991-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional stabilizers were pro-American states which would receive significant U.S. aid in exchange for assuming responsibility for regional stability. Among the regional stabilizers designated by Kissinger were [[Zaire]], [[Iran]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="ampros"&gt;Stephen Kinzer. "[http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewPrint&amp;articleId=10824 Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally, now pursues its own path. Guess why.]" ''[[American Prospect]]'', 5 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zbigniew Brzezinski===
[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] laid out his most significant contribution to post-[[Cold War]] geostrategy in his 1997 book ''[[The Grand Chessboard]]''. He defined four regions of [[Eurasia]], and in which ways the United States ought to design its policy toward each region in order to maintain its global primacy. The four regions (echoing Mackinder and Spykman) are:
* Europe, the Democratic Bridgehead
* Russia, the Black Hole
* The Middle East, the Eurasian Balkans
* Asia, the Far Eastern Anchor
In his subsequent book, ''The Choice'', Brzezinski updates his geostrategy in light of [[globalization]], [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] and the intervening six years between the two books.

In his journal called [["America's New Geostrategy"]], he discusses the need of shift in America's geostrategy to avoid its massive collapse like many scholars predict. He points out that:
* the United States needs to shift away from its long-standing preoccupation with the threat of a nuclear war between the [[superpower]]s or a massive Soviet conventional attack in central Europe. 
* a doctrine and a force posture are needed that will enable the United States to respond more selectively to a large number of possible security threats to enhance deterrence in the current and foreseeable conditions. 
* the United States should rely to a greater extent on a more flexible mix of nuclear and even [[non-nuclear]] strategic forces capable of executing more selective military mission&lt;ref&gt;Brzezinski, Zbigniew (Foreign affairs, Vol.66 No.4, [1988]) [SSCI, SCOPUS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of geostrategy==
:"Few modern ideologies are as whimsically all-encompassing, as romantically obscure, as intellectually sloppy, and as likely to start a third world war as the theory of 'geopolitics.'"
::—Charles Clover, "Dreams of the Eurasian Heartland"&lt;ref name="clover"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Clover|date=March–April 1999|title=Dreams of the Eurasian Heartland|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=78|issue=9|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990301facomment963/charles-clover/dreams-of-the-eurasian-heartland-the-reemergence-of-geopolitics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geostrategy encounters a wide variety of criticisms. It has been called a crude form of [[geographic determinism]]. It is seen as a gloss used to justify international aggression and [[expansionism]]—it is linked to [[Nazi]] war plans, and to a perceived U.S. creation of Cold War divisions through its containment strategy. [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxists]] and [[Critical international relations theory|critical theorists]] believe geostrategy is simply a justification for [[American imperialism]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

Some political scientists argue that as the importance of [[non-state actor]]s rises, the importance of geopolitics concomitantly falls.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt; Similarly, those who see the rise of economic issues in priority over security issues argue that [[geoeconomics]] is more relevant to the modern era than geostrategy.&lt;ref name="demko"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George J. Demko and William B. Wood|title=Reordering the World: Geopolitical Perspectives on the 21st Century|year=1994|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Usman W. Chohan |date=May 2015 |title=Geostrategic Location and the Economic Center of Gravity of the World |journal = McGill University Economic Publications|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/geostrategic-location-and-economic-center-gravity-world-249376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[international relations theory]] that is critical of [[realism in international relations]] is likewise critical of geostrategy because of the assumptions it makes about the hierarchy of the international system based on [[power in international relations|power]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

Further, the relevance of geography to international politics is questioned because advances in technology alter the importance of geographical features, and in some cases make those features irrelevant. Thus some geographic factors do not have the permanent importance that some geostrategists ascribe to them.&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

'''"Gleðibankinn"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "The Bank of Joy") was the [[Iceland]]ic entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986]], performed in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] by [[ICY]], where singers [[Eiríkur Hauksson]], Helga Möller and [[Pálmi Gunnarsson]] joined their efforts. This was Iceland's debut entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and consequently the first time that Icelandic had been heard.

The song is an up-tempo number about "the bank of joy", which the band sings is where one's happiness is to be found. As they put it, "You don't deposit your empty blues in the Bank of Joy". Further, because happiness is stored in a bank, it can be withdrawn anytime one is feeling depressed.

In the Icelandic finals the song was performed by Pálmi alone, but before official submission, Eiríkur and Helga joined him. They had both competed with other songs in the Icelandic finals.

It was performed sixth on the night (following the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Ryder (band)|Ryder]] with "[[Runner In The Night]]" and preceding the [[Netherlands]]' [[Frizzle Sizzle]] with "[[Alles heeft ritme]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 19 points, placing 16th in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Icelandic representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987 Contest]] by [[Halla Margrét]] with "[[Hægt og hljótt]]".

The first African Nations Cup of Ice Hockey was planned for [[South Africa]] between 19–26 September 2009. The matches of the championship were to be played at the ice rink of "Festival Shopping Centre" in [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]]. The competing countries were to be South Africa, [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockeyalgeria.com/wordpress/ |title=African Nations schedule released |date=August 4, 2009 |publisher=Association Algerienne de Ice et Inline Hockey |accessdate=2009-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725085743/http://hockeyalgeria.com/wordpress/ |archivedate=July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tournament was postponed due to lack of response from the invited countries and never played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saicehockey.org.za/default_files/page325.htm|title=archives|website=saicehockey.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Egyptian players of Anubis Ice Hockey Team, Egypt's first ice hockey team started to initiate with the [[Royal Moroccan Ice Hockey Federation]] the first African Cup. And in July 2016 the first African Ice Hockey Clubs Cup was held in [[Rabat]], [[Morocco]] between 24 and 31 July. The championship was contested between 6 teams from [[Egypt]], Morocco, [[Tunisia]], and Algeria. Teams of [[Kenya]], [[Libya]] and South Africa were also invited but they didn't participate. The cup was won by the Tunisian team.

==Southern Africa==

==Future of African ice hockey==
So far there is no unifying African federation for ice hockey to govern the sport in the large continent. However, 12 African countries have different levels of ice hockey activities, South Africa is a full member of the IIHF with a national federation, ice hockey rinks, clubs and national teams. Morocco is an associate member of the IIHF with a national federation, a few clubs and a national team. Algeria has a national team and a national association but still with no IIHF membership and no clubs or ice hockey rinks. Namibia has a national federation with an affiliate membership in the IIHF, but it doesn't have a national ice hockey team. Tunisia has a national team and a national association but still with no IIHF membership. While in Egypt, Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire, there are amateur clubs and teams with no official statuses.

{{Redirects here|Greater Britain|the island off the northwest coast of Europe on which England, Scotland, and Wales are located|Great Britain|the 18th century state which unified England and Scotland into a single kingdom|Kingdom of Great Britain}}[[File:Imperial Federation, Map of the World Showing the Extent of the British Empire in 1886 (levelled).jpg|thumb|Imperial Federation, showing the British Empire in 1886 (before expansion in Africa)]]
The '''Imperial Federation''' was a proposal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a [[federal union]] in place of the existing [[British Empire]].  The project was championed by [[Unionism_in_the_United_Kingdom|Unionists]] such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] as an alternative to [[William_Ewart_Gladstone|William Gladstone's]] proposals for [[home rule]].

==Motivators==
At the time, the British Empire consisted of many [[Colony|colonies]], some of which were largely self-governing [[dominion]]s ([[Canada]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]) and others were not ([[British Raj|India]], [[British West Indies|West Indies]], [[Fiji]]). The future of the empire remained uncertain, as it was unclear what the end result would be if all colonies eventually became self-governing. Among other concerns, it would be very difficult for British interests to be maintained if every colony was essentially already sovereign.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

Creating an Imperial Federation thus became a popular alternative proposal to [[colonialism|colonial]] [[imperialism]].{{cn|date=November 2015}} The plan was never firm, but the general proposal was to create a single federal [[Sovereign state|state]] among all colonies of the British Empire. The federation would have a common [[parliament]] and would be governed as a [[superstate]]. Thus, Imperial unity could be maintained while still allowing for democratic government. The colonies would increase their influence while [[United Kingdom|Britain]] would be able to share the costs of imperial defence. The best features of large states could be combined with the best features of small states.

It was seen as a method of solving the [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]] problem in [[Ireland]], as [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Ireland]] (along with the other members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations#New Commonwealth|Old Commonwealth]]) would have their own Parliaments. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] would become a purely Imperial body.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

Supporters of the Imperial Federation regarded the [[United Kingdom]] as having two possible futures; imperial union and continued long-term importance or imperial dissolution and the reduction of the status of the UK to a second-class nation.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

In response to claims that [[geography]] was against federation on such a large scale, it was said that scientific advancements would solve the difficulty. [[Edward Ellis Morris]] reminded listeners to his lecture in 1885 that it was now as easy to reach [[London]] from [[Melbourne]] as it had been to reach London from [[Orkney]] at the time of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], or to reach [[Washington, D.C.]] from [[California]] before passes over the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] were made.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

== Organisation ==
The [[Imperial Federation League]] was founded in London in 1884 and subsequent branches were established in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Barbados, and British Guiana. While the proposal was often associated with segments of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], it was also popular among [[Liberal Imperialists]] or [[New Imperialism]] such as [[William Edward Forster]]. The movement was also a vehicle for British race nationalism, inspired by such writers as [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Charles Dilke]] and [[John Robert Seeley]] and ideas of a greater Britain encompassing the largely white self-governing colonies and dominions.

Canadian advocates of imperial federation, are called "Canadian Imperialists"  and their ideology "Canadian Imperialism" in Canadian historiography since [[Carl Berger]] 1970's book ''The Sense of Power'' identified this as a separate ideology from [[Canadian nationalism]].{{cn|date=November 2015}}  Noted Canadian Imperialists included [[George Monro Grant]], Sir [[George Robert Parkin]], [[Stephen Leacock]], and [[George Taylor Denison III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/imperialism Imperialism]. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Thomas Hedderwick]], a Scottish [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] MP, raised the issue in the British House of Commons. Recalling to the House the contributions of [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and [[Mancherjee Bhownagree]], Indian MPs serving in the House of Commons, Hedderwick mooted the possibility that an autonomous India might one day be represented in an Imperial Parliament.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Obstacles==
One of the main obstacles to the scheme was what one of its proponents, [[Richard Jebb (journalist)|Richard Jebb]], called colonial nationalism. The granting of authority to a super-parliament composed of many competing interests was seen by opponents as a compromise to the powers of the local parliaments. Leading colonial supporters of imperial federation, such as Australian prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]], however saw the movement as a way to increase the influence of the [[dominion]]s over imperial defence and foreign policy. The colonial branches of the Imperial Federation League in fact outlived the demise of the home branch in London, which collapsed in 1896 when it failed to resolve internal disputes over imperial trade policy.

While [[Joseph Chamberlain]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] from 1895 to 1903, was sympathetic to the idea, his proposals for a permanent Imperial Council or Council of the Empire which would be a kind of Imperial Parliament passing policies that would bind colonial governments, was rejected at the [[1897 Colonial Conference]] and [[1902 Colonial Conference]]s due to fears that such a scheme would undermine the autonomy of colonies. Similarly, proposals for centralising the Empire's armed forces were also rejected as were his proposals for an Empire [[customs union]]. At subsequent [[Imperial Conference]]s, proposals for [[Imperial Preference|Imperial preferential trade]] were rejected by the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] governments due to their preference for international [[free trade]]. It would not be until the [[British Empire Economic Conference]] in 1932 that [[Imperial Preference]] would be implemented; however, the policy did not survive [[World War II]].

==Decline==
Support for imperial federation waned with [[World War I]] which produced greater feelings of national identity in several dominions, Canada and Australia in particular. Defence concerns and problems of imperial cooperation were partially resolved through the system of colonial or [[Imperial Conference]]s and with growing sentiments by various dominion governments for greater independence resulting in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. It was last discussed seriously at the governmental level at the [[1937 Imperial Conference]] where it was dismissed.

The idea of Imperial unity was carried on after World War I by [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]] and the [[Round Table movement]], which continues to this day as a forum and promoter of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and also by the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] which continues to promote the Commonwealth.

In recent years, the idea has received new life in several Commonwealth nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A federation of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom ([[CANZUK]]) has been promoted by some in the United Kingdom as an alternative to continued British membership in the [[European Union]].

In the northern provinces, the locally dominant Fulani overwhelmingly is Muslim. Other ethnic groups, known collectively as the [[Kirdi]], generally practice some form of Islam. The [[Bamum people|Bamoun]] ethnic group of the West Province is also largely Muslim.

==Islam in German Cameroon 1884-1916==
In the rush to claim African territories Germany first entered Cameroon in 1884 and established rule in northern Cameroon by 1902. Throughout the German colonial period, the Adamawa and Lake Chad regions were governed by combining heavy military presence with indirect rule. The local Muslim rulers, called ''Lamido'' in Adamawa and ''Sultan'' in the far north, remained in power, although their influence was much more limited than during the nineteenth century, owing their legitimacy to the Germans and not to the Emir in [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], the [[Caliph]] in [[Sokoto]] or the Shehu in Kuka. Existing political and legal institutions, together with Muslim and native law and customs, were kept intact. Contrary to [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in Northern [[Nigeria]], German indirect rule did not involve immediate taxes or [[land reform]]s before 1913, when such reforms were proposed but, due to the war, never implemented.

'''"Le Dernier qui a parlé..."''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "The last one who spoke...") was the [[France|French]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[French Language|French]] by [[Amina Annabi|Amina]] as '''"C'est le dernier qui a parlé qui a raison"'''

==Background==
The song - the full title of which is one of the longest in Contest history - was written by Amina herself (of [[North Africa]]n ancestry) and composed by [[Wasis Diop]], resulting in an [[Africa]]n feel to the music.

Lyrically, Amina sings about the truth of the saying referenced in the title. She also extends it to ''"It's the loudest one who spoke who is right"''.

The song was performed ninth on the night (following [[Sweden]]'s [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]] with "[[Fångad av en stormvind]]" and preceding [[Turkey]]'s [[İzel Çeliköz]], [[Reyhan Karaca]] &amp; [[Can Uğurluer]] with "[[İki Dakika]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 146 points, placing 2nd in a field of 22 (she tied with [[Carola]], but the tie-break rules gave the win to Sweden).

It was succeeded as [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|French representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Contest]] by [[Kali (singer)|Kali]] with "[[Monté la riviè]]".

'''MV ''Fedra''''' was a [[Liberia]]n-registered [[Bulk carrier|bulk-carrier]] [[cargo ship]]. It ran aground and smashed against [[Europa Point]], the southernmost tip of [[Gibraltar]] on 10 October 2008 following severe [[gale]] force winds measuring 12 on the [[Beaufort scale]]. Spanish and Gibraltarian emergency services mounted a joint rescue operation, Gibraltar declared a Major Incident and requested the standby of additional statutory and voluntary emergency services (including [[St John Ambulance]] Gibraltar), although due to the safe rescue of all crew from ''Fedra'' they were ultimately not needed.  

Five of its 31 crew members were airlifted to safety by a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[coast guard]] helicopter and the rest were hoisted up by an improvised crane system. The vessel broke in half shortly thereafter.

About half of its 300 tons of fuel spilled into the sea. Some of such oil washed ashore along Gibraltar's western coast, particularly in the area of [[Rosia Bay, Gibraltar|Rosia Bay]] and [[Camp Bay, Gibraltar|Camp Bay]]. Spanish sources said that some fuel from ''Fedra'' had washed up on some [[Campo de Gibraltar|Campo]] beaches having drifted as far as [[Tarifa]]. There were also oil slicks in the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].

''Fedra'' avoided becoming a [[List of shipwrecks of Gibraltar|permanent shipwreck]] when the forward section was re-floated and towed round into the [[Bay of Gibraltar]] in February 2009. It was moored alongside the [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|South Mole]] in Gibraltar Harbour.  The superstructure was cut away from the hull of the aft section, and was placed the dockside at [[Gibraltar#Military|HM Naval Base]].

A report was released by the Gibraltar Maritime Association in January 2012 which reveals how the Company undermined the Master of ''Fedra'' and his authority in his attempts to save both the crew and the ship. The report also explains the various aspects which led to the demise of MV ''Fedra''.

She was also part of the [[Levin Institute|SUNY-Levin Institute]] New York in the World Advisory Council, which issued its recommendations in 2011 to New York City and State on policy responses to [[economic globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nycfuture.org/pdf/New_York_in_the_World.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Wucker left the World Policy Institute to join the [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] as Vice President for Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/press-release/wucker-named-vice-president-studies-chicago-council-global-affairs|title=Wucker Named Vice President of Studies for The Chicago Council on Global Affairs {{!}} Chicago Council on Global Affairs|last=Affairs|first=Chicago Council on Global|website=www.thechicagocouncil.org|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, she left that organization and founded Gray Rhino &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.illinoisregistry.org/gray-rhino-company|title=GRAY RHINO &amp; COMPANY in Illinois|website=www.illinoisregistry.org|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Gray Rhinos ===
Wucker introduced the term "gray rhino" at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlngQdxduKw&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike highly improbable "black swans" popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s 2007 book, gray rhinos&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2016/04/michele-wucker-thinks-we-know-what-are-problems-are-and-ignore-them/&lt;/ref&gt; are highly probable, high impact yet neglected threats.  The concept is developed further in her 2016 book, ''The Gray Rhino: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore''.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/thegrayrhino/michelewucker&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government embraced the term in a front-page editorial in the official newspaper, People's Daily, on July 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;People’s Daily. "Effectively guard against financial risks", July 17, 2017 http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2017-07/17/nw.D110000renmrb_20170717_3-01.htm

&lt;/ref&gt; Coming right after the important National Financial Work Conference strategy session, which occurs every five years, the official use of the "gray rhino" concept was interpreted widely as signaling a concerted effort to tighten regulation and reduce financial risk.&lt;ref&gt;Sunny Oh, "Why China fears ‘gray rhino’ risk to fragile financial system," Marketwatch, July 18, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-china-&lt;/nowiki&gt; fears-

gray-rhino- risk-to- fragile-financial- system-2017- 07-17 Accessed July 24, 2017
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, investors sold stocks perceived as risky, sending the Shenzhen small-cap stock index down 4.3% and the ChiNext tech index down 5.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Egan. What’s a ‘gray rhino’ and Why Did It Cause Chinese Stocks to Drop?

The New York Times referenced gray rhinos and China's policy shift in a front-page article on July 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee We "In China, Herd of ‘Gray Rhinos’ Threatens Economy." The New York Times. July 24, 2017.

&lt;/ref&gt; editions.

=== Sovereign debt crisis ===
Months before Argentina’s 2001 default, Wucker sounded an alarm that the lack of a process like an international Chapter 11 for sovereign defaults would increase the likelihood and costs of larger financial crises.&lt;ref&gt;Wucker, Michele. "Passing the Buck: No Chapter 11 for Bankrupt Countries." World Policy Journal, Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she made an early case for a preemptive restructuring and write-down of Greek sovereign debt.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronicle of a Debt Foretold." New America Foundation, May 2, 2011 https://www.newamerica.org/economic-growth/chronicle-of-a-debt-foretold/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States immigration policy ===
In her second book, ''Lockout: Why America Keeps Getting Immigration Wrong When Our Prosperity Depends on Getting It Right'', Wucker details the economic impact of the breakdown of the US visa bureaucracy after 9/11. She flags the widespread American misconception that earlier generations of immigrants were more likely to stay than more recent arrivals, and warns that the United States is failing to capitalize on its greatest strength.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Tamar. "Coming to America," Washington Post, May 28, 2006. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/26/AR2006052601662.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her policy recommendations have been controversial, such as a 2007 ''New York Times'' op-ed that proposed reducing family preference visas for adult siblings of US citizens in return for increases in employment-related visas.&lt;ref&gt;Wucker, Michele. "Family Second," The New York Times. February 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite writing on controversial issues, she has been recognized for making her case "clearly and deliberately" and for a voice that is "wise and reasonable" and "ethical".&lt;ref&gt;Soles, Derek. The Essentials of Academic Writing. Second edition. Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009. https://books.google.com/books?id=e8lXwQUIoTQC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;lpg=PA405&amp;dq=michele+wucker+fixing+the+border&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pf1yZ2hGYX&amp;sig=2EChbNBfvNAxQoR4Ailrhbrb-o0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQwpb6lPHLAhXikoMKHWhKC3QQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=michele%20wucker&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variability of citizenship ===
Wucker was an early commentator on the economic impact of migrant worker remittances and drew attention to the ways in which countries were changing their conceptions of citizenship and political power to attract the funds workers sent home to their families.&lt;ref&gt;Wucker, Michele. "Remittances: The Perpetual Migration Machine." World Policy Journal, Summer 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She has challenged traditional ways of thinking about citizenship, arguing that dual citizenship and other expanded definitions benefit both sending countries and host countries.&lt;ref&gt;Wucker, Michele. "Political Power in the Perpetual Migration Machine." World Policy Journal, Fall 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Wucker has argued that non-citizen voting, also known as resident voting or municipal voting because it is limited to residents of cities in city elections, prepares people for US citizenship and helps their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wucker, Michele. "Civics Lessons from Immigrants," The American Prospect, July 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican-Haitian relations ===
The ''New York Times Book Review'' described Wucker’s 1999 book, ''Why the Cocks Fight: Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for Hispaniola'', as "a complex exploration of the cultural divide between Haiti and the Dominican Republic." The book addresses historical, economic, political and social dimensions of the relationship between the two countries sharing the island of Hispaniola, viewing conflicts over culture as the symptoms rather than the root cause of the tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Markee, Patrick. The New York Times. May 2, 1999. https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/02/reviews/990502.02markeet.html&lt;/ref&gt; She is a recognized expert on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/06/17/415274544/haitians-face-deportation-from-dominican-republic-as-deadline-nears&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/haiti-us-occupation-hundred-year-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://prospect.org/article/culture-fear-fueling-dominican-deportation-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/20/1246815/-If-you-are-black-get-out-The-crisis-of-statelessness-in-the-Dominican-Republic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/reasons-behind-haitis-poverty-70801&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/01/23/this_little_creole_piggy_once_stood_for_haitian_pride.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niue''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|eɪ}} {{respell|NEW|ay}}; {{lang-niu|Niuē}}) is an [[island country]] in the [[South Pacific Ocean]], {{convert|2400|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Zealand]], east of [[Tonga]], south of [[Samoa]], and west of the [[Cook Islands]]. Niue's land area is about {{convert|261|km2|mi2}}&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; and its population, predominantly [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], was about 1,600 in 2016.{{UN Population|ref}} The island is commonly referred to as "The Rock", which comes from the traditional name "Rock of [[Polynesia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/niue/introduction |title=Introducing Niue |website=[[Lonely Planet]] |access-date=2016-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue is one of the world's largest [[coral]] islands. The [[terrain]] of the island has two noticeable levels. The higher level is made up of a [[limestone]] [[cliff]] running along the coast, with a plateau in the centre of the island reaching approximately 60 metres (200 feet) high above sea level. The lower level is a coastal terrace approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;km (0.3 miles) wide and about 25–27 metres (80–90 feet) high, which slopes down and meets the sea in small cliffs. A [[coral reef]] surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to Alofi. A notable feature are the many limestone [[caves]] near the coast.

Niue, whose capital is the village of [[Alofi, Niue|Alofi]], is a self-governing state in [[associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]; and New Zealand conducts most diplomatic relations ([[foreign relations of Niue|though not all]]) on its behalf. Niueans are citizens of New Zealand, and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]] in her capacity as [[Queen of New Zealand]]. Between 90–95% of Niuean people live in New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/pacific-peoples/pacific-people-population.aspx |title=QuickStats About Pacific Peoples |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |year=2006 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119141308/http://stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/pacific-peoples/pacific-people-population.aspx# |archive-date=19 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with about 70% of the speakers of the [[Niuean language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Moseley |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2=R. E. Asher |title=Atlas of the World's Languages |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue is a [[bilingual country]], with 30% of the population speaking both Niuean and [[English language|English]], though the percentage of monolingual English-speaking people is only 11%, while 46% are monolingual Niuean speakers.

Niue is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN), but UN organisations have accepted its status as a freely-associated state as equivalent to independence for the purposes of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2000/pacific-peoples-constitution-report-september-2000/documents/Bibliography.doc |title=Find a publication |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Justice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Niue is a member of some [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN specialised agencies]] (such as [[UNESCO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/en/worldwide/unesco-regions/asia-and-the-pacific/niue.html |title=Niue |publisher=UNESCO International Bureau of Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[WHO]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countries/en/ |title=List of member countries |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is invited, alongside the other non-UN member state, the [[Cook Islands]], to attend United Nations conferences open to "all states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climatepasifika.blogspot.com.br/2011/12/niue-urges-world-leaders-to-leave.html |title=Pacific Climate Change: Niue urges world leaders to leave legacy of action at climate conference |work=climatepasifika.blogspot.com.br }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue is [[list of villages in Niue|subdivided into 14 ''villages'']] ([[municipalities]]).

In January 2004, Niue was hit by [[Cyclone Heta]], which caused extensive damage to the island, including wiping out most of the south of the capital, [[Alofi]]. The disaster set the island back about two years from its planned timeline to implement the ''[[Niue Integrated Strategic Plan]]'' (NISP), since national efforts concentrated on recovery.

==History==
{{Main|History of Niue}}
[[Polynesia]]ns from [[Samoa]] settled Niue around 900 AD. Further settlers arrived from [[Tonga]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/place/Niue|publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title= Niue|date= 10 August 2015|access-date= 17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the beginning of the 18th century, Niue appears to have had no national government or national [[leader]]; chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over segments of the population. Around 1700 the concept and practice of [[kingship]] appears to have originated through contact with the Tongans who settled around the 1600s.{{citation needed|date= August 2016}} [[List of Niuean monarchs|A succession of ''patu-iki'' (kings) ruled]], beginning with Puni-mata. Tui-toga, who reigned from 1875 to 1887, was the first [[Christian]] king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = S Percy | last = Smith | url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-SmiNiu.html | title = Niuē-fekai (or Savage) Island and its People | year = 1903 | pages = 36–44 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Europeans to sight Niue sailed under Captain [[James Cook]] in 1774. Cook made three attempts to land, but the inhabitants refused to grant permission to do so. He named the island "Savage Island" because, as legend has it, the natives who "greeted" him were painted in what appeared to be blood. The substance on their teeth was hulahula, a native red [[fe'i banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Anthony 'Tony' | last = Horowitz | title = Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before | year = 2002 | chapter = 8 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next couple of centuries, Niue was known as Savage Island until its original name, Niuē, which translates as "behold the coconut",&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news |first= Kathy|last= Marks|title= World's smallest state aims to become the first smoke-free paradise island |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/worlds-smallest-state-aims-to-become-the-first-smokefree-paradise-island-862977.html|work= [[The Independent]] | date= 9 July 2008 |accessdate= 21 July 2008 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; regained use.

The next notable European visitors represented the [[London Missionary Society]]; they arrived on the ''Messenger of Peace''. After many years of trying to land a European missionary, a Niuean named [[Nukai Peniamina]] went with his friend, Niumaga, to Samoa and trained as a [[pastor]] at the [[Malua]] Theological College.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Peniamina returned in 1846 on the ''[[John Williams (ship)|John Williams]]'' as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua. He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi [[Mutalau]] after a number of attempts in other villages had failed. The chiefs of Mutalau village allowed him to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu.
[[File:Inside.Church,Niue,Thomas Andrew 1896.jpg|thumb| Photo by [[Thomas Andrew (photographer)|Thomas Andrew]] of the interior of church building in [[Alofi]], 1896.]]

In July 1849 [[John Erskine (Royal Navy officer)|Captain John Erskine]] visited the island in [[HMS Havannah (1811)|HMS ''Havannah'']].&lt;ref name="Oct1853"&gt;{{cite web |first =| last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, October 1853 |work= Savage Island |accessdate= 18 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1853_10/5 | publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it spread to all the villages. Originally other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina. The people from the village of Hakupu, although the last village to receive Christianity, came and asked for a "word of God"; hence, their village was renamed "Ha Kupu Atua" meaning "any word of God", or "Hakupu" for short.

In 1889 the chiefs and rulers of Niue, in a letter to [[Queen Victoria]], asked her "to stretch out towards us your mighty hand, that Niue may hide herself in it and be safe".&lt;ref name="Colonial Law' 1966. P. 897"&gt;''Commonwealth and Colonial Law'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. p. 897&lt;/ref&gt; After expressing anxiety lest some other nation should take possession of the island, the letter continued: "We leave it with you to do as seems best to you. If you send the flag of Britain that is well; or if you send a Commissioner to reside among us, that will be well".&lt;ref name="Colonial Law' 1966. P. 897"/&gt; The British did not initially take up the offer. In 1900 a petition by the Cook Islanders asking for annexation included Niue "if possible".&lt;ref name="Colonial Law' 1966. P. 897"/&gt; In a document dated 19 October 1901, the "King" and Chiefs of Niue consented to "Queen Victoria taking possession of this island". A despatch to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] from the [[Governor of New Zealand]] referred to the views expressed by the Chiefs in favour of "annexation" and to this document as "the deed of cession". A British Protectorate was declared, but it remained short-lived. Niue was brought within the boundaries of New Zealand on 11 June 1901 by the same Order and Proclamation as the Cook Islands. The Order limited the islands to which it related by reference to an area in the Pacific described by co-ordinates, and Niue, at 19.02 S., 169.55 W, lies within that area.&lt;ref name="Colonial Law' 1966. P. 897"/&gt;

The [[New Zealand Parliament]] restored self-government in Niue with the 1974 [[Niue Constitution Act 1974 (NZ)|constitution]], following [[Niuean constitutional referendum, 1974|a referendum]] in 1974 in which Niueans had three options: independence, self-government or continuation as a New Zealand territory. The majority selected self-government, and Niue's written constitution&lt;ref&gt;

was promulgated as supreme law. [[Robert Rex]], ethnically part European, part native, was appointed{{by whom|date=April 2017}} the first [[Premier of Niue|premier]], a position he held until his death 18 years later. Rex became the first Niuean to receive a knighthood &amp;ndash; in 1984.

In January 2004 [[Cyclone Heta]] hit Niue, killing two people and causing extensive damage to the entire island, including wiping out most of the south of the capital, Alofi.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Niue}}
The [[Niue Constitution Act 1974 (NZ)|Niue Constitution Act]] vests executive authority in [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand]] and the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]]. The Constitution specifies that in everyday practice sovereignty is exercised by the [[Niue Cabinet of Ministers]], composed of the [[Premier of Niue|premier]] and three other ministers. The premier and ministers are members of the [[Niue Assembly|Niue Legislative Assembly]], the nation's parliament.

The assembly consists of 20 elected members, 14 of whom are elected by the electors of each village [[constituency]], six by all registered voters in all constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niuegov.com/ |title=Niue's Government and Politics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=www.niuegov.com |publisher=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=19 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electors must be New Zealand citizens, resident for at least three months, and candidates must be electors and resident for 12 months. Everyone born in Niue must register on the electoral roll.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

There are no [[Politics of Niue#Political parties and elections|political parties in Niue]]; all assembly members are [[Non-partisan|independents]]. The last and only [[Politics of Niue#Political parties and elections|Niuean political party]] to have ever existed, the [[Niue People's Party]] (1987–2003), [[Niuean general election, 2002|won once]] (in 2002) before being disbanded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?id=5526&amp;op=read|title=Niue's only party dissolved|date=21 July 2003|website=Rnzi.com|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speaker is elected by the assembly and is the first official to be elected in the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly following an election. The Speaker calls for nominations for premier; the candidate with the most votes from the 20 members is elected. The premier selects three other members to form the Cabinet of Ministers, the executive arm of government. The other two organs of government, following the [[Westminster model]], are the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary. [[Niuean general election, 2017|General elections]] take place every three years, most recently on 6 May 2017.

The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. There are a High Court and a Court of Appeal, with appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London.&lt;ref name="Niue criminal court system"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acclawyers.org/resources/niue/ |title=Niuean criminal court system |publisher=Association of Commonwealth Criminal Lawyers |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue is a {{Convert|269|km2|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[raised coral atoll]] in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of Tonga. The [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic co-ordinates]] are {{Coord|19|03|48|S|169|52|11|W|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson G, Hill PJ (1980) Hydrogeology of a raised coral atoll, Niue Island, South Pacific Ocean. ''Journal of Australian Geology and Geophysics'', '''5''' 271–278.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three outlying [[coral]] [[reef]]s within the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]], with no land area:
#[[Beveridge Reef]], at 20°00′S, 167°48′W, {{Convert|240|km|abbr=on}} southeast, submerged [[atoll]] drying during low tide, {{Convert|9.5|km|abbr=on}} north-south, {{Convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}} East-West, total area&amp;nbsp;{{Convert|56|km2|abbr=on}}, no land area, lagoon {{Convert|11|m}} deep.
#Antiope Reef, at 18°15′S, 168°24′W, {{Convert|180|km|abbr=on}} northeast, a circular plateau approximately {{Convert|400|m}} in diameter, with a least depth of {{Convert|9.5|m}}.
#Haran Reef (Harans Reef), at 21°33′S, 168°55′W, reported to break furiously, {{Convert|294|km|abbr=on}} southeast,

Besides these, Albert Meyer Reef, (20°53′S, 172°19′W, almost {{Convert|5|km|abbr=on}} long and wide, least depth {{Convert|3|m|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|326|km|abbr=on}} southwest) is not officially claimed by Niue, and the existence of [[Haymet Rocks]] (26°S, 160°W, {{Convert|1273|km|abbr=on}} [[East-southeast|ESE]]) is in doubt.

Niue is one of the world's largest [[coral]] islands. The terrain consists of steep [[limestone]] cliffs along the coast with a central [[plateau]] rising to about {{Convert|60|m}} above sea level. A [[coral reef]] surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, Alofi. A notable feature is the number of limestone caves near the coast.

The island is roughly oval in shape (with a [[diameter]] of about {{Convert|18|km}}), with two large bays indenting the western coast, Alofi Bay in the centre and [[Avatele]] Bay in the south. Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point. A small peninsula, TePā Point (Blowhole Point), is close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest. Most of the population resides close to the west coast, around the capital, and in the northwest.

Some of the soils are geochemically very unusual. They are extremely weathered tropical soils, with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides ([[oxisol]]) and mercury, and they contain high levels of [[Background radiation|natural radioactivity]]. There is almost no [[uranium]], but the radionucleides [[thorium|Th-230]] and [[protoactinium|Pa-231]] head the [[decay chain]]s. This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme [[weathering]] of coral and brief sea submergence [[Pleistocene|120,000 years ago]]. Endothermal upwelling, by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral, may also contribute.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

No adverse health effects from the radioactivity or the other trace elements have been demonstrated, and calculations show that the level of radioactivity is probably much too low to be detected in the population. These unusual soils are very rich in [[phosphate]], but it is not accessible to plants, being in the very insoluble form of [[iron phosphate]], or crandallite. It is thought that similar radioactive soils may exist on [[Lifou]] and [[Mare (island)|Mare]] near [[New Caledonia]], and [[Rennell Island|Rennell]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], but no other locations are known.

According to the World Health Organization, residents are evidently very susceptible to skin cancer. In 2002 Niue reported 2,482 deaths per 100,000 people – far higher than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository|title=UV radiation: Burden of disease by country |year=2002|url= http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.165?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue is separated from New Zealand by the [[International Date Line]]. The time difference is 23 hours during the Southern Hemisphere winter and 24 hours when New Zealand uses Daylight Saving Time.

==Defence and foreign affairs==
{{main|Foreign relations of Niue}}
[[File:Toke Talagi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Premier of Niue|Premier]] Sir [[Toke Talagi]] in Hawaii in 2011.]]

Niue has been [[Self-governance|self-governing]] in free association with New Zealand since 3 September 1974 when the people endorsed the Constitution in a plebiscite.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Igarashi, ''Associated Statehood in International Law'', p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs. Niue's position concerning its external relations is less clear cut. Section 6 of the [[Niue Constitution Act]] provides that: "Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue." Section 8 elaborates but still leaves the position unclear: &lt;blockquote&gt;Effect shall be given to the provisions of sections 6 and 7 [concerning external affairs and defence and economic and administrative assistance respectively] of this Act, and to any other aspect of the relationship between New Zealand and Niue which may from time to time call for positive co-operation between New Zealand and Niue after consultation between the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the [[Premier of Niue]], and in accordance with the policies of their respective Governments; and, if it appears desirable that any provision be made in the law of Niue to carry out these policies, that provision may be made in the manner prescribed in the Constitution, but not otherwise."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Niue has a representative mission in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. It is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and a number of regional and international agencies. It is not a member of the United Nations, but is a state party to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], the [[Ottawa Treaty]] and the [[Treaty of Rarotonga]]. The country is a member state of [[UNESCO]] since 26 October 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erc.unesco.org/portal/UNESCOMemberStates.asp?language=en |title=UNESCO.ORG &amp;#124; Communities &amp;#124; Member States |publisher=Erc.unesco.org |accessdate=20 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/618josO9b?url=http://erc.unesco.org/portal/UNESCOMemberStates.asp?language=en |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Niue's foreign relations and defence have been regarded as the responsibility of New Zealand. However, in recent years Niue has begun to follow its own foreign relations, independent of New Zealand, in some spheres. It established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on 12 December 2007.&lt;ref name=xinhua2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7236560.htm|title=Full text of joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Niue|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=6 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212547/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7236560.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint communique signed by Niue and China is different in its treatment of the Taiwan question from that agreed by New Zealand and China. New Zealand "acknowledged" China's position on [[Taiwan]] but has never expressly agreed with it, but Niue "recognises that there is only one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of China."&lt;ref name=xinhua2007/&gt; Niue established diplomatic relations with [[India]] on 30 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=190019985|title=India establishes Diplomatic Relations with Niue|publisher=Ministry of External Affairs of India|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2014 the Government of Niue announced that Niue had established diplomatic relations with Turkey. The Honourable Minister of Infrastructure [[Dalton Tagelagi]] formalised the agreement at the Pacific Small Island States Foreign Ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. The Memorandum of Understanding with Turkey is part of increasing Niue's foreign relationship with countries including the People's Republic of China, India, Australia, Thailand, Samoa, Cook Islands and Singapore.

The people of Niue have fought as part of the New Zealand military. In [[World War I]], Niue sent about 200 soldiers as part of the [[Māori Battalion]] in the New Zealand forces.&lt;ref name=Tagi_tote&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qDVcnZUCZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Tagi tote e loto haaku – My Heart is Crying a Little: Niue Involvement in the Great War 1914–1918|year=2000|author=Margaret Pointer|isbn=978-982-02-0157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niue is not a republic but its full name was listed as "the Republic of Niue" for a number of years on the ISO list of country names (ISO-[[3166-1]]). In its newsletter of 14 July 2011, the ISO acknowledged that this was a mistake and the words "the Republic of" were deleted from the ISO list of country names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_vi-9_fiji-myanmar_and_other_minor_corrections-incl_bulgaria_corrected_2011-07-14_e_.pdf |title=ISO 3166-1 Newsletter VI-9 "Name changes for Fiji, Myanmar as well as other minor corrections" (Published 14 July 2011) |format=PDF |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Niue}}
[[File:Alofi.jpg|thumb|[[Alofi]], the capital of Niue.]]

Niue's economy is small. Its gross domestic product (GDP) was NZ$17 million in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Niue.php |title=Country Information Paper - Niue |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or US$10 million at [[purchasing power parity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ne.html#Econ|title= Niue |publisher=CIA |work=World Factbook|accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue uses the New Zealand dollar.

The [[Niue Integrated Strategic Plan]] (NISP) is the national development plan, setting national priorities for development. [[Cyclone Heta]] set the island back about two years from its planned timeline to implement the NISP, since national efforts concentrated on recovery efforts. In 2008, Niue had yet to fully recover. After Heta the government made a major commitment to rehabilitate and develop the private sector.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} The government allocated $1 million{{when|date=May 2016}} for the private sector, and spent it on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone, and on construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park. This [[industrial park]] is now completed and some businesses are already operating from there. The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Chamber of Commerce, a not-for-profit organisation providing advisory services to businesses.

'''Joint ventures'''

The government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 to develop fisheries and a 120-hectare [[noni]] juice operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Reef Group looks to NZ for help Niue projects

|accessdate=May 18, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noni fruit comes from ''Morinda citrifolia'' a small tree with edible fruit. Niue Fish Processors Ltd (NFP) is a joint venture company processing fresh fish, mainly tuna (yellow fin, big eye and albacore), for export to overseas markets. NFP operates out of a state-of-the-art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South, completed and opened in October 2004.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

'''Trade'''

Niue is negotiating [[free trade agreements]] with other Pacific countries, [[PICTA]] Trade in Services ([[PICTA TIS]]), [[Economic Partnership Agreements]] with the [[European Union]], and [[PACERPlus]] with Australia and New Zealand. The [[Office of the Chief Trade Adviser]] (OCTA) has been set up to assist Niue and other Pacific countries in the negotiation of the PACERPlus.

'''Mining'''

In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, suggested that Niue might have the world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/yamarna-loses-passion-for-niues-uranium/2005/09/05/1125772467540.html

===Revenue===
[[Remittance]]s from expatriates were a major source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s. Continuous [[Human migration|migration]] to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and [[Extended family|extended families]] there, removing the need to send remittances back home. In the late 1990s, PFTAC conducted studies on the [[balance of payments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pftac.org |title=Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre |publisher=PFTAC |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed that Niueans are receiving few remittances but are sending more money overseas.

'''Foreign aid'''

Foreign aid has been Niue's principal source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aid.govt.nz/programmes/c-niue.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721005022/http://www.aid.govt.nz/programmes/c-niue.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most aid comes from New Zealand, this is currently being phased out with reductions of NZ$250,000 each year. The country will need to rely more upon its own economy. The government generates some revenue, mainly from [[income tax]], [[Import tariff|import tax]] and the lease of phone lines. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''Offshore banking'''

The government briefly considered offshore banking. Under pressure from the [[US Treasury]], Niue agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimise tax in countries like New Zealand. Niue provides automated Companies Registration, administered by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development]]. The [[Niue Legislative Assembly]] passed the [[Niue Consumption Tax]] Act in the first week of February 2009, and the 12.5% tax on goods and services was expected to take effect on 1 April 2009. Income tax has been lowered, and import tax may be reset to zero except for "sin" items like tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks. Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35% to 10%, with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ezPJua5q?url=http://www.niuebusinessnews.com/|archivedate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.niuebusinessnews.com/|title=12.5% Niue Consumption Tax from 1 April|date=26 February 2009|publisher=Niue Business News|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet'''

In 1997, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), under contract with the US Department of Commerce, assigned the Internet Users Society-Niue (IUS-N), a private nonprofit, as manager of the [[.nu]] [[top-level domain]] on the Internet. IUS-N's charitable purpose was – and continues to be – to use revenue from the registration of .nu domain names to fund low-cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue. In a letter to [[ICANN]] in 2007, IUS-N's independent auditors reported IUS-N had invested US$3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from .nu domain name registration revenue during that period. In 1999, IUS-N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognised that IUS-N managed the .nu ccTLD under IANA's authority and IUS-N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue's private citizens. A newly elected government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name, including a requirement for IUS-N to make direct payments of compensation to the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06088/677770-96.stm |title=On a tiny island, catchy Web name sparks a battle |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Rhoads}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a Government-appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report, which found no merit in the government's claims; the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=36393 |title=Niue government criticised over internet stance |publisher=RNZI |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2003, IUS-N began installing [[WiFi]] connections throughout the capital village of [[Alofi]] and in several nearby villages and schools, and has been expanding WiFi coverage into the outer villages since then, making Niue the first WiFi Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wifination.org/ |title=WiFi Nation |publisher=WiFi Nation |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assure security for Government departments, IUS-N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS-N's satellite Internet link, at no cost.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is very important to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy, and around 204 square kilometres of the land area are available for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPC/doc/Counprof/southpacific/niue.htm Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles: Niue], United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subsistence agriculture]] is very much part of Niue's culture, where nearly all the households have plantations of [[taro]].&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollock |first1=Nancy J. |year=1979 |title=Work, wages, and shifting cultivation on Niue |journal=Journal of Pacific Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=132–43 |publisher=Pacific Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taro is a [[staple food]], and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia is an intellectual property of Niue. This is one of the naturally occurring taro varieties on Niue, and has a strong resistance to pests. The Niue [[taro]] is known in Samoa as "talo Niue" and in international markets as pink taro. Niue exports taro to New Zealand.
[[Tapioca]] or cassava, [[yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[sweet potato|kumara]] also grow very well,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2052.html Agriculture Products], ''CIA World Factbook'', Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; as do different varieties of bananas. [[Copra|Coconut meat]], [[passionfruit]] and [[lime (fruit)|limes]] dominated exports in the 1970s, but in 2008 [[vanilla]], [[Morinda citrifolia|noni]] and taro were the main export crops.

Most families grow their own food crops for subsistence and sell their surplus at the Niue Makete in Alofi, or export to their families in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}
[[Coconut crab]], or uga, is also part of the [[food chain]]; it lives in the forest and coastal areas.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10675036"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=10675036 |title=Niue: Hunting the uga |author=Eagles, Jim |date=23 September 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the government made a commitment to develop and expand [[vanilla]] production with the support of [[NZAID]]. Vanilla has grown wild on Niue for a long time. Despite the setback caused by the devastating [[Cyclone Heta]] in early 2004, work on vanilla production continues. The expansion plan started with the employment of the unemployed or underemployed [[Labor force|labour force]] to help clear land, plant supporting trees and plant vanilla vines. The approach to accessing land includes planning to have each household plant a small plot of around half to {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} to be cleared and planted with vanilla vines. There are a lot of planting materials for supporting trees to meet demand for the expansion of vanilla plantations, but a severe shortage of vanilla vines for planting stock. There are the existing vanilla vines, but cutting them for planting stock will reduce or stop the vanilla from producing beans. At the moment, the focus is in the areas of harvesting and marketing.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The last agricultural census was in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/world_census_of_agriculture/main_results_by_country/Niue_1989.pdf Niue Agricultural Census 1989 – Main Results], United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Avatele Beach.JPG|thumb|[[Avatele]] Beach]]

Tourism is one of the three priority [[Economy (activity)|economic sectors]] (the other two are fisheries and agriculture) for economic development. In 2006, estimated visitor expenditure reached $1.6 million making tourism a major industry for Niue. Niue will continue to receive direct support from the government and overseas donor agencies. The only airport is [[Niue International Airport]]. [[Air New Zealand]] is the sole airline, flying twice a week from [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niue Tourism – Official Website|url=http://www.niueisland.com/getting-niue|accessdate=4 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824231422/http://www.niueisland.com/getting-niue|archivedate=24 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s Niue International Airport was served by a local airline, [[Niue Airlines]], but it closed in 1992.

There is a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to tourists at a sustainable level. Niue is trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives. New Zealand businessman Earl Hagaman, founder of Scenic Hotel Group, was awarded a contract in 2014 to manage the Matavai Resort in Niue after he made a $101,000 political donation to the National Party, which at that time led a minority government in New Zealand. The resort is subsidized by New Zealand, which wants to bolster tourism there. In 2015 NZ announced $7.5m in additional funding for expansion of the resort. The selection of the Matavai contractor was made by the Niue Tourism Property Trust, whose trustees are appointed by NZ Foreign Affairs minister [[Murray McCully]]. Prime Minister John Key said he did not handle campaign donations, and that Niue premier [[Toke Talagi]] has long pursued tourism as a growth strategy. McCully denied any link between the donation, the foreign aid and the contractor selection.&lt;ref&gt;

====Sailing====
The sailing season begins in May. Alofi Bay has many mooring buoys and yacht crews can lodge at Niue Backpackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niueisland.com/content/sailing-season-commences-niue|title=Sailing Season Commences on Niue - Niue|website=Niueisland.com|accessdate=2017-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828050155/http://www.niueisland.com/content/sailing-season-commences-niue#|archive-date=28 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anchorage in Niue is one of the least protected in the South Pacific, so much that cruise ship tenders are often unable to risk landing passengers due to weather or sea conditions, as well as the associated risk of having them stranded ashore.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Other challenges of the anchorage are a primarily coral bottom and many deep spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailwhisper.com/logs/news_20040913.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035724/http://www.sailwhisper.com/logs/news_20040913.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 November 2008|title=The Rock of the Pacific - Niue|date=20 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mooring buoys are attached to seine floats that support the mooring lines away from seabed obstructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyc.nu/wp/2013/damage-nyc-mooring-10#more-241|title=Niue Yacht Club – Damage NYC Mooring #10|website=Nyc.nu|accessdate=2017-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710011446/http://nyc.nu/wp/2013/damage-nyc-mooring-10#more-241#more-241|archive-date=10 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt===
On 27 October 2016, Niue officially declared that all its [[national debt]] was paid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/land-that-debt-forgot-tiny-pacific-country-of-niue-has-no-interest-in-loans|title=Land that debt forgot: tiny Pacific country of Niue has no interest in loans|first=Eleanor Ainge|last=Roy|date=27 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government plans to spend money saved from servicing loans on increasing pensions, and offering incentives to lure expatriates back home. However, Niue isn't entirely independent. New Zealand pays $14 million in aid each year and Niue still depends on New Zealand. Premier Toke Talagi said Niue managed to pay off US$4 million of debt and had "no interest" in borrowing again, particularly from huge powers such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/land-that-debt-forgot-tiny-pacific-country-of-niue-has-no-interest-in-loans|title=Land that debt forgot: tiny Pacific country of Niue has no interest in loans|last=Roy|first=Eleanor Ainge|date=2016-10-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Niue has two broadcast outlets, [[Television Niue]] and [[Radio Sunshine]], managed and operated by the [[Broadcasting Corporation of Niue]], and one newspaper, the ''[[Niue Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/fr/news/2002/020118_pina.shtml "Le Programme international pour le développement de la communication de l'UNESCO soutient le journal de Niue"], [[UNESCO]], 16 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology==
[[File:Children in playground.jpg|thumb|Students using their [[OLPC XO-1|OLPC]] laptops in the school yard.]]

The first computers were [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] machines brought in by the [[University of the South Pacific]] Extension Centre around the early 1980s. The Treasury Department computerised its general ledger in 1986 using [[NEC]] personal computers that were IBM PC XT compatible. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Census of Households and Population in 1986 was the first to be processed using a personal computer with the assistance of [[David Marshall (statistician)|David Marshall]], FAO Adviser on Agricultural Statistics, advising [[UNFPA]] Demographer Dr Lawrence Lewis and Niue Government Statistician [[Bill Vakaafi Motufoou]] to switch from using manual tabulation cards. In 1987 Statistics Niue got its new personal computer NEC PC AT use for processing the 1986 census data; personnel were sent on training in Japan and New Zealand to use the new computer. The first Computer Policy was developed and adopted in 1988. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In August 2008 it has been reported that all school students have what is known as the [[OLPC XO-1]], a specialised laptop by the [[One Laptop per Child]] project designed for children in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7576573.stm | work=BBC News | title=One laptop for every Niuean child | date=22 August 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niue was also a location of tests for the [[OpenBTS]] project, which aims to deliver low-cost [[GSM]] [[base stations]] built with [[open source software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openbts.sourceforge.net/NiuePilot/ |title=Niue Pilot System |publisher=Openbts.sourceforge.net |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2011, Telecom Niue launched pre-paid mobile services (Voice/EDGE – 2.5G) as Rokcell Mobile based on the commercial GSM product of vendor Lemko. Three BTS sites will cover the nation. International roaming is not currently available. The fibre optic cable ring is now completed around the island (FTTC), Internet/ADSL services were rolled out towards the end of 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In January 2015 Telecom Niue completed the laying of the fibre optic cable around Niue connecting all the 14 villages, making land line phones and ADSL internet connection available to households.

==Renewable energy==
The [[European Union]] is helping Niue convert to [[renewable energy]]. In July 2009 a [[solar panel]] system was installed, injecting about 50&amp;nbsp;kW into the Niue national power grid. This is nominally 6% of the average 833&amp;nbsp;kW electricity production. The solar panels are at [[Niue High School]] (20&amp;nbsp;kW), [[Niue Power Corporation]] office (1.7&amp;nbsp;kW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sunnyportal.com/Templates/PublicPageOverview.aspx?plant=08532994-451b-4b3b-a530-ca48b6ea4537&amp;splang=en-US |title=Niue – Tuila Office – Tuila overview |publisher=Sunny Portal |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Niue Foou Hospital]] (30&amp;nbsp;kW). The EU-funded grid-connected PV systems are supplied under the REP-5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs of the high school and the power station office and on ground-mounted support structures in front of the hospital. They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.delfji.ec.europa.eu/en/achievements/niue.htm |title=Achievements for Niue|publisher=The European Commission's Delegation to the Pacific|accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 two additional solar power installations were added to the Niue national power grid, one funded under [[PALM5]] of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this has battery storage, the other under European Union funding is located opposite the [[Niue International Airport]] Terminal.

==Sport==
{{See also|Rugby union in Niue}}
[[File:Niuean haka.jpg|thumb|The Niue sevens team performing a [[takalo]]]]

Despite being a small country, a number of sports are popular. [[Rugby union]] is the most popular sport, played by both men and women; Niue were the 2008 [[FORU Oceania Cup]] champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2352343.htm?tab=sport |title=Niue take Oceania Cup rugby union final |publisher=Radio Australia |date=1 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916221921/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2352343.htm?tab=sport |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netball]] is played only by women. There is a nine-hole [[golf course]] at Fonuakula. There is a lawn [[bowling green]] under construction.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Association Football is a popular sport, as evidenced by the [[Niue Soccer Tournament]], though the [[Niue national football team]] has played only [[Football at the 1983 South Pacific Games#Group B|two matches]]. [[Rugby league]] is also a popular sport. Niue Rugby League have only started making strides within the international arena since their first ever test match against Vanuatu, going down 22–20 in 2013. On 4 October 2014, the Niue rugby league team record their first ever international test match win defeating the Philippines 36–22. In May 2015, Niue Rugby League recorded their second international test match win against the South African Rugby League side, 48–4. Niue now sit 31st in the Rugby League World Rankings.

'''Orbit Communications Company''' was a privately owned [[Pay TV]] network, operating in the [[Middle East]], [[Africa|North Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Owned by [[Saudi Arabia]]-based [[Mawarid Holding]] (via Digital Media Systems),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm?companyid=1000189 Zawya - Mawarid Holding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid1001503/ Zawya - Orbit Satellite Television and Radio Network]&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first fully [[Digital data|digital]], multi-channel, multi-lingual, [[pay television]] service in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] and was also the world's first fully digital TV network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telecompaper.com/news/orbit-plans-tv-service--13295&lt;/ref&gt; Orbit broadcast in several languages around the world including [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]]  and [[Filipino language|Filipino]].

Some of Orbit's Arabic channels including Bahrain TV, Al Safwa, Fann, Al Yawm, Cinema 1, Cinema 2, Mousalsalat and Mousalsalat +2 are available throughout North and South America through [[myTV (Arabic)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.my-tv.us/PackagesListing.aspx?pageid=29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company merged with [[Showtime Arabia]] to form [[OSN]], which is currently the biggest pay-TV provider in the MENA region.

==Orbit ESPN's disappearance==
On 1 April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newlywedindubai.com/year2/2008/04/where-hell-is-orbit-espn.html Newlywed in Dubai]&lt;/ref&gt; after being on the air since 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/29104.html Orbit and ESPN International renew programming distribution agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415081545/http://www.ameinfo.com/29104.html |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbit ESPN]] disappeared from the Orbit lineup. This left Orbit without coverage of the [[NCAA]], [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Soccer]], the [[National Football League]], [[NASCAR]], major golf and tennis tournaments, and the premier action sports franchise in the world, ESPN's [[X Games]].

[[Fox Sports International|Fox Sports]] replaced [[Orbit ESPN]] on 13 January 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One of the reasons that break the contract with ESPN is the severe financial problems happened at that time, since 1999-2000 the production graph line has been moved down. In 2009, a major delay in paying salaries for orbit employees in Egypt, Lebanon and KSA for more than 4 months.

==BBC Arabic Television==
[[BBC Arabic Television]] was originally transmitted via Orbit from 1994 until April 21, 1996, when it was taken off air by Orbit after the channel broadcast an episode of the BBC ''Panorama'' program critical of the Saudi Arabian government. Many of the BBC Arabic Television staff then went to work for Al Jazeera.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preddonlee.com/al_jazeera_origins.html&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC has since relaunched the channel autonomously in 2008.

==Showtime Arabia merger==
On 12 July 2009 ''[[Showtime Arabia]]'' and ''Orbit Communications Company'' announced a merger that created the “biggest Pay-TV platform” in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=chiba&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Comparative Study on the Pan-Arab Media Strategies: The Cases of Egypt and Saudi Arabia|date=February 2012|volume=5|issue=1&amp;2|url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb5_1and2/07chiba.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2014|author=Chiba Yushi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly formed company, which is called OSN,&lt;ref name=chiba/&gt; is an equal partnership that would offer 70 exclusive channels featuring new [[movies]], [[sports]], [[Television program|series]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] content and [[international]] shows.

New customers can subscribe to packages featuring [[Showtime Arabia|Showtime Arabia's]] and ''Orbit Communications Company'''s  programs, while existing subscribers will be able to either retain or upgrade their content. The company will offer [[High-definition television|HD]] channels, [[video on demand]] and other [[Interactive television|interactive]] services.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the northeast of the island of [[Ireland]], it shares a [[Republic of Ireland-United Kingdom border|border]] with the [[Republic of Ireland]] to the south and west. At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]], its population was 1,685,000, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the [[population of the United Kingdom]].

Northern Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|created]] as a distinct [[Administrative geography of the United Kingdom|division of the United Kingdom]] on 3 May 1921 under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]],&lt;ref&gt;Statutory Rules &amp; Orders published by authority, 1921 (No. 533); Additional source for 3 May 1921 date: Alvin Jackson, ''Home Rule – An Irish History'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p198.&lt;/ref&gt; although its constitutional roots lie in the 1800 [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] between [[Great Britain]] and Ireland.

Northern Ireland was for many years the site of a violent and bitter ethno-political conflict — [[the Troubles]] — which was caused by divisions between [[Nationalists (Ireland)|Irish nationalists]], who are predominantly [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]], who are predominantly [[Protestant]]. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uup.org/policy/standing-up-for-northern-ireland/index.php Standing up for Northern Ireland] www.uup.org. Retrieved 2 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while nationalists wish it to be [[United Ireland|politically reunited]] with the rest of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jenkin, 1997, ''Rethinking ethnicity: arguments and explorations'', SAGE Publications: London: "In Northern Ireland the objectives of contemporary nationalists are the reunification of Ireland and the removal of British government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dorey, 1995, ''British politics since 1945'', Blackwell Publishers: Oxford: "Just as some Nationalists have been prepared to use violence in order to secure Irish reunification, so some Unionists have been prepared to use violence in order to oppose it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/policies/document/155 |title=Strategy Framework Document: Reunification through Planned Integration: Sinn Féin’s All Ireland Agenda |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716075752/http://www.sinnfein.ie/policies/document/155 |archivedate=16 July 2006}} Sinn Féin.

This is a survey of the '''[[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of [[Luxembourg]]'''.

Luxembourg is a landlocked country in western Europe, bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany. Luxembourg has a population of over half a million people in an area of approximately 2,586 square kilometres (999 sq mi).

== First stamps ==
Luxembourg issued its first stamps on 15 September 1852. The stamps were issued in both Belgian and Prussian currency but later issues were issued only in Belgian currency.&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[[Stuart Rossiter|Rossiter, Stuart]] &amp; John Flower. ''The Stamp Atlas''. London: Macdonald, 1986, p. 60. {{ISBN|0-356-10862-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Orchestre Rock-a-Mambo''' was an African [[jazz band]] from [[Brazzaville]] of the 1950s. It was a [[studio band]] of the [[Esengo (label)|Esengo]] [[music studio]].&lt;ref name=rotr&gt;Rumba on the River: A History of the Popular Music of the Two Congos By Gary Stewart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKEHO1z413EC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22rock+a+mambo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JtEDTMLNFpS2NpWPlTs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rock%20a%20mambo%22&amp;f=false Chapter 5: "A Change in Mentality"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band name is a pun with the [[Kongolese language|Kongolese]] word ''rocamambu'' "the one who looks for problems". In a Kongolese folk tale, Rocamambu is a kind of [[prodigal son]], who runs from home and comes back rich.&lt;ref name=rotr/&gt;

The band ofnen merged with the musicians from the [[Le Grand Kallé et l'African Jazz|African Jazz]] band and sometimes produced recordings under the title ""African Rock".&lt;ref name=rotr/&gt;

Rock-a-Mambo music appears on the following albums and compilations.&lt;ref name=fan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzikifan.com/rockamambo.html |title=Rockamambo |publisher=Muzikifan.com |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Malakand''''' was a 7,653-[[gross register ton]] [[cargo liner]] built by [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] in 1905 for the [[Brocklebank Line|Brocklebank shipping line]], the first of two Brocklebank Line ships named after the [[Malakand Agency|Malakand]] area of the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=liverpoolmuseums &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/agents/access/case3_moreinfo.html |title=More information on the SS Malakand model |website=Liverpool Museums |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725215117/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/agents/access/case3_moreinfo.html |archivedate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Malakand'' operated on a regular service between [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and [[Calcutta]], [[India]]. During [[World War I]],  she was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] {{convert|145|nmi|km}} west of [[Bishop Rock, Isles of Scilly|Bishop Rock]], [[Isles of Scilly]] ({{coord|49|20|N|10|00|W}}), on 20 April 1917 by the [[Imperial German Navy]] [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-84||2}} with the loss of one crew member.&lt;ref name=liverpoolmuseums /&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1LossesBrMS1917.htm |title= BRITISH MERCHANT SHIPS LOST to ENEMY ACTION Part 2 of 3 - January-August 1917 in date order |publisher=Naval History |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malakand &gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/3844.html |title=Malakand |publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky Direct''' is a [[direct-broadcast satellite]] subscription television service in the [[Philippines]] owned and operated by [[Sky (cable company)|Sky]], a subsidiary of [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]]. Sky Cable has been eyeing for a DBS service and considered on acquiring [[Dream Satellite TV]] from Antonio O. Cojuangco, Jr. The acquisition of Dream was reported to have reached an advanced stage but for some undisclosed reasons, the deal was not sealed. Sky's entry to the DBS market was hindered by various oppositions from the industry, citing legal issues and the slow growth of the pay TV market in the country. On December 23, 2015, Sky was granted by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|NTC]] a provisional authority to operate and maintain a DBS service in 251 cities and municipalities in the country for a period of 18 months. Sky Direct offers both prepaid and postpaid packages with exclusive channels from [[ABS-CBN]] and [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels|Creative Programs]]  such as [[ABS-CBN HD]], [[ABS-CBN News Channel]], [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD]], [[Cinema One]], [[Jeepney TV]], [[Metro Channel]], [[Liga (TV channel)|Liga]], and [[Myx]]. As of the end of 2017, Sky Direct has over 399,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Darwin G. Amojelar|title=ABS-CBN posts 10% income drop|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/business/corporate/260701/abs-cbn-posts-10-income-drop.html|date=11 March 2018|publisher=[[Manila Standard|Manilastandard.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In May 2015, Sky Cable Corporation applied with the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]] for the roll-out of its DBS service with plans of spending at least 252 million [[Philippine Peso|pesos]] for the purchase of equipment (₱122 million) and working capital (₱130 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/business/111162/abs-cbns-sky-cable-venturing-into-satellite-tv-service|title=ABS-CBN's Sky Cable venturing into satellite TV service|work=InterAksyon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, 2015, Sky Cable was granted a provisional authority by the NTC to operate and maintain a DBS service in 251 cities and municipalities for 18 months.&lt;ref name="manilastandardtoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/business/196457/skycable-expanding-to-satellite-television.html|title=SkyCable expanding to satellite television|work=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky Cable plans to get 49,500 subscribers in the first year of operations and increase it to 864,600 subscribers in 10 years.&lt;ref name="manilastandardtoday.com"/&gt; NTC approved the application of Sky Cable to offer DBS services despite opposition from 14 companies from the cable and television industry.&lt;ref name="malaya.com.ph"/&gt;

In January 2016, Sky Direct began the trial period for its prepaid service in three (3) areas through authorized dealers in [[Metro Manila]], province of [[Cavite]] and [[Quezon]].

Sky Direct had a soft launching on March 18, 2016 by releasing the television commercial advertisement with endorser [[Kris Aquino]]. 

The Sky Direct prepaid subscription package includes a [[satellite]] [[dish antenna]], set top box (Integrated Receiver-Decoder) and remote control.
Sky Direct uses the [[DVB-S2]] digital television broadcast standard in the [[Ku band]] to provide standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) TV broadcasts. For the [[conditional access]], it uses the Verimatrix encryption system to scramble the data and protect its content from signal piracy.

On May 24, 2016, [[Luxembourg]]-based satellite owner [[SES S.A.|SES]] announced a multi-year, multi-[[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]] capacity agreement with Sky Cable, Sky Direct's parent, to broadcast DTH television channels via the [[SES-9]] and New Skies NSS-11 satellites at 108.2 degrees East. SES-9 is expected to be operational middle of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sky-cable-signs-deal-ses-071500540.html|title=Sky Cable signs deal with SES|publisher=[[Yahoo News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sky Direct broadcast==
Last December 2015, Sky Direct began its test broadcast using SES [[SES World Skies|NSS-11]] satellite. But last May 2016, Sky Direct moved its full broadcast using [[SES-9]] Satellite.

==Competition==
The Sky Direct service will directly compete with [[Cignal|Cignal TV]], the leading DTH provider with more than one million subscribers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/cignal-tv-celebrates-1-million-subscriber-base-with-thanksgiving-party/|title=Cignal TV celebrates 1 million subscriber base with thanksgiving party|work=InterAksyon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and [[TV5 Network Inc.]], [[Dream Satellite TV]] (now defunct) owned by Philippine Multi-media System Inc. (PMSI) and [[G Sat|GSat]] owned by Global Broadcasting and Multi-Media Inc.

==Oppositions==
The entry of Sky Direct in the DTH service is being opposed by various groups citing violation of the anti-monopoly law.&lt;ref name="manilastandardtoday.com"/&gt; Oppositors include [[Cignal|Cignal TV]] and sister company [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc]] under the PLDT group, [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite]] and the Philippine Cable Television Association. In a filing with the NTC, PMSI said the DTH players in the Philippines are expected to continue incur losses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/pay-tv-market-slow-to-grow-faces-tough-competition/197793/|title=Pay TV market slow to grow, faces tough competition - The Manila Times Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to tougher competition with the entry of Sky Cable in the DTH business. From 2009 to 2013, Cignal TV incurred an accumulated deficit of 5 billion pesos, Dream with 1.1 billion pesos and GSat with 173 million pesos.

On February 2016, [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc]] formally filed a motion for reconsideration with the NTC asking the regulator to dismiss Sky Cable's application to offer DBS and reverse its order last December 2015 that allows Sky Cable to offer both wired and wireless cable network services nationwide.&lt;ref name="malaya.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malaya.com.ph/business-news/business/tv5-bucks-sky-cable%E2%80%99s-direct-broadcast-plans|title=TV5 bucks Sky Cable's Direct Broadcast Plans|publisher=''Malaya''|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV5 argued that DBS or wireless cable service is beyond the scope of Sky Cable’s franchise and articles of incorporation. According to TV5, Sky Cable's amended articles of incorporation states that it can establish and operate a [[Cable television|Community Antennae Television (CATV) System]] which is wired in nature and not a wireless service like DBS.

The regulator emphasized in its December 2015 order that DBS service is within the scope of Sky Cable's congressional franchise.&lt;ref name="malaya.com.ph"/&gt;

'''Slavery in Bhutan''' was a common&lt;ref name=Risley/&gt;&lt;ref name=White/&gt; legal, economic, and social institution until its abolition in 1958. In historical records, [[unfree labour]]ers in Bhutan were referred to as [[slave]]s, [[coolie]]s, and [[serf]]s. These labourers originated mostly in and around [[Bhutan]], [[Assam]], and [[Sikkim]], and were the backbone of Bhutan's pre-money feudal economy.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSss&gt;{{country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Social System |author=Worden, Robert L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan abolished [[slavery]] as part of modernization reforms at the behest of the Third [[Druk Gyalpo]] [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], who ascended to the throne in 1952 at the age of 25. In breaking with slavery and feudalism, King Jigme Dorji enacted legal reforms, awarding citizenship and outright ownership of land to former slaves.&lt;ref name=BBCtl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1171693.stm |title=Timeline: Bhutan |date=2010-05-05 |publisher=BBC News online |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the introduction of a [[money]] economy in the 19th century and modernization programs in the mid-20th century, the [[economy of Bhutan]] was based entirely on payment [[in kind]] and in labour, including [[unfree labour]]. In the feudal [[land tenure]] system, in which all land was held by the sovereign and populated by tenants, serfdom and service to [[mesne lord]]s was commonplace. Ordinary citizens, for their part, were bound by the [[driglam namzha]] to [[corvée|do work]] such as [[dzong]] construction as part of their tax obligation to the state. The gradual transition to a feudal money economy was prompted by Bhutanese military and territorial losses to the [[British India|British]], which resulted in annual cash subsidies to the Bhutanese government. These money revenues eventually replaced [[unfree labour]] as the backbone of the [[economy of Bhutan|Bhutanese economy]].&lt;ref name=Risley/&gt;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSss/&gt;

[[Bhutan]] had an [[underclass]] of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and their descendants, who were generally treated as serfs or even as slaves. This class of slave was the most common, however many others were aboriginal or indigenous tribal peoples originally living in scattered villages throughout Bhutan. [[Criminal]] freemen facing [[capital punishment in Bhutan|capital punishment]] were sometimes spared and made slaves for life. Slave status was inherited, and the value of slaves varied according to age, [[caste]], and sex; an adult high-caste male cost about 20 [[Rupee]]s at market, while a low-caste female could sell for 3 Rupees. During the 18th century, hundreds of [[Brahmin]]s were imported as slaves into Bhutan every year.&lt;ref name=CSss/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSeg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Assam&gt;{{cite book|title=Agrarian system of medieval Assam |first=Jahnabi |last=Gogoi |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=2002 |isbn=81-7022-967-7 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTvmPLv5_V0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, [[Bhutan]] had developed a [[slave trade]] with [[Sikkim]] and [[Tibet]]. During this time, the kidnapping of British subjects as slaves, as well as the repatriation of escaped Bhutanese slaves, became major points of contention amid rising hostilities between [[Bhutan]] and [[British India]]. The British position was to allow slaves to return of their own will, but not to repatriate them to Bhutan. (Cf. [[non-refoulement]])&lt;ref name=Risley/&gt;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=Assam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta/&gt;

During the 19th century, the British also grappled with slavery in neighboring [[Sikkim]] and [[Cooch Behar]]. By 1877, slaves from Bhutan were regarded by the British as [[Bhutanese refugees]]. Meanwhile, the slave trade remained a lucrative source of profit to local Bhutanese officials near the Indian border.&lt;ref name=Risley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gazetteer of Sikhim |first=Sir Herbert Hope |last=Risley |authorlink=Herbert Hope Risley |year=1894 |pages=14, 20 |chapter=History of Sikkim and Its Rulers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesaAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book|title=British relations with Bhutan |first=Shantiswarup |last=Gupta |publisher=Panchsheel Prakashan |year=1974 |pages=79, 205–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7cBAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Labh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan triangle: a historical survey of British India's relations with Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan, 1765-1950 |first=Amar Kaur Jasbir |last=Singh |publisher=British Library |year=1988 |pages=183, 279, 317 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dq1AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Bhutan limited the slave trade as it developed laws reflecting the [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] nature of slaves. King [[Ugyen Wangchuck]]'s 1916 reforms of the [[Tsa Yig]] legal code prohibited the sale and purchase of [[slavery|slaves]], and limited the use of [[coolie]]s by state officers to occasions where the health of the officer required such. Otherwise, the institution of slavery was left intact despite reform: slaves attempting to escape were to be detained, and anyone who harbored an escaped slave was to "[[damages|make good]] the slave." However, if one returned an escaped slave, the owner faced a legal obligation to compensate him for his time and effort.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White |first=J.

===Slave demography===
Slaves originated from multiple sources, both inside and outside Bhutan. Tribal areas of central, southern, and eastern Bhutan (e.g., [[Lhop people|Lhop]], [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], and [[Monpa people|Monpa]]) as well as prisons in [[Ngalop]] areas of western Bhutan were domestic sources of slaves. Outside Bhutan proper, various ethnic groups of the [[Assam]] [[Duars]] including the [[Mech tribe|Mechi]] were subject to taxation and slaving such that entire villages were abandoned when the British examined the region in 1865. Slaves acquired from Indian Assam, where slaves constituted 5–9% of the total population, were often born slaves or already enslaved as condemned criminals.&lt;ref name=Labh&gt;{{cite book|title=India and Bhutan |volume=1 |series=Studies in Asian history and politics |first=Kapileshwar |last=Labh |publisher=Sindhu Publications |year=1974 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA4hAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karlsson&gt;{{cite book|title=Contested belonging: an indigenous people's struggle for forest and identity in sub-Himalayan Bengal |first=B.

Culturally and linguistically part of the populations of [[West Bengal]] or [[Assam]], these slaves were mostly [[caste]] [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and practiced wet-rice and dry-rice agriculture. Indian slaves were generally brought to [[Bhutan]] from tribal areas.&lt;ref name=CSeg&gt;{{country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Ethnic Groups |author=Worden, Robert L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves who arrived since the 1800s were the forefathers of modern [[Lhotshampa]], a heterogeneous community of [[Nepal]]ese origin in southern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt;

As slaves of the state, many slave communities were concentrated in traditional population centers such as [[Thimphu]] and [[Punakha]].&lt;ref name=CSeg/&gt;

===Treatment of slaves===
The majority of slaves in Bhutan were bound to government service. Others cleared the humid [[malaria]]l jungles of south Bhutan to develop the nation's agricultural lands. Foremost, slaves were the primary source of government [[unfree labour|labour]] in and around [[dzong]]s, which served as administrative centers.&lt;ref name=Sinha/&gt; Although slaves had no personal or professional liberty, they filled military and administrative ranks within the government, including high posts, a silver lining of [[upward mobility]]. The [[government of Bhutan|Royal Government]] placed male youths in the service of the [[Tashichho Dzong|palace]] and in provincial administrative centers. This provided generations of technically competent, politically dependable cadres serving lifelong roles. Female slaves, however, were used mainly as [[sex slave]]s in [[brothel]]s.&lt;ref name=CSeg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Assam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The politics of aristocratic empires |first=John |last=Kautsky |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1997 |isbn=1-56000-913-6 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDwJEZGTpVkC}} citing {{cite book|last=Rose |first=Leo E |title=The Politics of Bhutan |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=[[Ithaca, New York]] |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no substantial difference between the state and treatment of feudal [[serf]]s and chattel [[slave]]s in pre-modern Bhutan.&lt;ref name=CSss/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSmjd&gt;{{country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Modernization under Jigme Dorji, 1952–72 |author=Worden, Robert L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves and servile classes attached to land grants were regularly traded as a showing of goodwill among rulers of neighboring states.&lt;ref name=Assam/&gt;

==Abolition and legacy==
As part of King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]]'s modernization efforts, land reform was accompanied by the abolition of slavery and serfdom.&lt;ref name=CSmjd/&gt; After abolition, many ex-slave communities were near traditional population centers because it was there that they had been pressed into service to the state. Many of these former slaves and their descendants have remained in urban centers, supporting and joining an emerging [[rentier capitalism|rentier]] class.&lt;ref name=CSeg/&gt;

Rural slaves including many [[Lhotshampa]], who had developed [[malaria]]l jungles into productive agricultural lands, feared eviction and deportation. With the enactment of land reform and the [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958|Nationality Act of 1958]], they were granted citizenship and began to prosper. In part because the manumission of slaves and serfs was accompanied by land redistribution awarding them outright ownership, slavery left no legacy in Bhutan comparable to that of [[African Americans]] in the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=Sinha&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan kingdom Bhutan: tradition, transition, and transformation |first=Awadhesh Coomar |last=Sinha |publisher=Indus Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=81-7387-119-1 |pages=25, 183, 215 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDxx_ibIwZ0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/a-king%E2%80%99s-tea-cup/ |title=A King's Tea Cup |date=2009-07-20 |first=Tshering |last=Tashi |publisher=Bhutan Observer online |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nationality Act of 1958 was repealed by the Citizenship Act of 1985. After this the first nationwide census was implemented from 1988. The largest group within the country affected by the enforcement of the Citizenship Act were the Lhotshampa people; this group, a generalized term for those of Nepalese descent, comprised 43% of the total population of Bhutan in 1988, including all illegal aliens. Bhutanese security forces moved through the southern regions of the country, home to most of the [[Lhotshampa]], forcing them from their homes and across the southern borders into Nepal. Because most of the people exiled did not speak Dzongkha, they were classified as illegal aliens, thus able to be removed from the country. In total, between 100,000 and 150,000, 1/6 of Bhutan's population in 1988, ended up in Nepalese refugee camps. By 2015 over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in Nepal were settled in third nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unhcr.org/564dded46.html|title = Resettlement of Bhutanese refugees surpasses 100,000 mark|last = Refugees|first = United Nations High Commissioner for|website = UNHCR|access-date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karte havellandzaucheteltow.png|thumb|Lands of the Sprevane and Hevelli, about 1150 AD.]]
The '''Sprevane''' or '''Sprevani''' ({{Lang-de|Sprewanen}}; [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Sprevjane'') were a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe who lived around the river [[Spree]], where [[Berlin]] is now, in the [[Brandenburg]] area of eastern [[Germany]]. They were first recorded in 948 and again in 965 as living in the territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Archaeological finds point to them coming to the area in the 8th century, and by 825 they started to build a settlement in today's [[Köpenick]], a district of Berlin.

Their name is from ''Sprevja'' (the local Slavonic form of the river name [[Spree]], meaning "to the right side") plus the Slavonic ethnic suffix ''-an'' (= the one living in that area) and "-e" meaning plural. The Germanized form, ''Sprewanen'', may have been influenced by the German verb ''wohnen'' (in [[Old High German]], ''wonen''), meaning "to dwell", but is also correct German plural of singular Sprevan.

[[File:1805 cary.jpg|thumb|The "Great Desert of Zaara" is shown on this 1805 map of Africa.]]
'''Zaara''' is an archaic variant of [[Sahara]], both being [[English (language)|English]] transliterations of the original [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] word for ''desert''.  It is an [[Africa]]n region famed for its arid, barren characteristics, and was used by contemporary writers not just as a geographic reference, but also to illustrate the epitome of a dismal wasteland. Modern references to the Sahara as Zaara are very sparse.  It generally cannot be found in online dictionaries or encyclopedias, not even as a footnote under the standard spelling.  However, a few references can be found in antique books, particularly those regarding the animals of the region and travelogues; and on antique maps, some as recent as 1834.

From the chapter on lions in [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]'s 1781 English translation of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]'s [[Histoire Naturelle]] [http://faculty.njcu.edu/fmoran/lion.htm]:
:The lions of Mount Atlas, the summit of which is sometimes covered with snow, have neither the courage, the strength, nor the ferocity of the lions of [[Biledulgerid]] or of '''Zaara, whose plains are covered with burning sands.''' It is chiefly in these fervid deserts that we meet with those terrible lions, who are the dread of travellers, and the scourge of the neighbouring provinces.

:In the '''vast deserts of Zaara,''' in those that seem to separate two very different races of men, the Negroes and the Moors, in the unpeopled regions that lie about the territories of the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentos]] &lt;!-- misspelling in the original --&gt;, and, in general, in all those southern parts of Africa and Asia, which man has disdained to inhabit, the lions are still very numerous, and continue in their natural state.

This is a description of the [[English Mastiff]] from the [[Cynographia Britannica]], published in 1800.  The reference to attacking "the lord of the savage tribes" means the breed's use as [[lion]]-hunters.  At the time this was written, lions were commonly referred to as the "king of the beasts" [http://www.doralpub.com/doral/mastiffxcrp.html]:

:This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the [[leopard|pard]], and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the '''deserts of Zaara''' or the plains of [[Numidia]].

This is an early 19th-century complaint about a 1788 American law that made it easier to market fraudulent land grants.  It cites the poor quality of Zaara's land as an example of deceptive marketing.  This commentary appears in ''Blackstone's Commentaries: with Notes of Reference'', annotated by [[St. George Tucker]] of the [[College of William and Mary]] and published in 1803 [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/tucker/tuck-3d.htm] : 

:The evil has not rested here; emissaries have been dispatched to every part of Europe with bales of these patents; fictitious plats, and maps of the country, have been offered to the public's eye; rivers and streams have been made to flow where nature has denied water; mountains have been sunk into meadows, and '''rocks as barren as the sandy deserts of Zaara''', have been represented as possessing the fertility of the banks of the Nile.  Thousands of ignorant and innocent persons have been defrauded, and, with their families, plunged into irretrievable ruin by these nefarious practices.

The ''Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816'' by Corréard and Savigny, carries this lengthy subtitle [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11772]:

:Undertaken by Order of the French Government, Comprising an Account of the Shipwreck of the [[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Medusa]], the Sufferings of the Crew, and the Various Occurrences on Board the Raft, '''in the Desert of Zaara''', at St. Louis, and at the Camp of Daccard. To Which Are Subjoined Observations Respecting the Agriculture of the Western Coast of Africa, from Cape Blanco to the Mouth of the Gambia.

'''''¡Adiós, Cordera!''''' (1892) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[short story]] written by [[Leopoldo Alas]] (also known as ''Clarín''). Although the author's works are considered examples of [[Literary realism|realism]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], many consider him a harbinger of [[modernism]]. The story is a [[dystopia]]n work that deals with the rise of [[industrialization]] and [[modernity]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=AGS CLASSICS SHORT STORIES: LEOPOLDO ALAS: DONA BERTA, ADIOS, CORDERA (Ags Classic Short Stories)|url=https://www.amazon.com/AGS-CLASSICS-SHORT-STORIES-LEOPOLDO/dp/0785406468|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nineteenth-century Spanish Story: Textual Strategies of a ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHduVXA7ptIC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=adios+cordera+english+summary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D2E-oXHG2Z&amp;sig=G4RyyQbpwIqgnQn9d7azS7f6ib8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0YygUvKUBoK4rAeJt4GgDw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adios%20cordera%20english%20summary&amp;f=false|publisher=books.google.com.np|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The tale centers upon a poor family in rural Spain and the gradual [[mechanization]] of their environment. Widower Antón de Chinta and his two young children (Pinín and Rosa) own a cow. The animal, which serves as a representation of the family's deteriorating economic situation, is affectionately called Cordera or lamb, and has become a family pet.&lt;ref name=reference&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation in English of Adios Cordera|url=http://www.reference.com/motif/language/translation-in-english-of-adios-cordera|publisher=reference.com|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story begins in a [[pastoral]] setting interrupted by a telegraph pole. Soon after, a [[railway]] is put through the field, which further ruptures the tranquility of the bucolic countryside and foreshadows the ending of the tale. Eventually the family's economic situation forces the father to sell the cow, which is taken away on the train for slaughter and gives the work its name.

Years later, Pinín is drafted to fight in the war and departs on the same train as the cow, an act that implies his future death. At the same time, it implies that the slaughter of innocents is a result of modernity and the city's expansion into rural areas.
