      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">'''AIDS fatigue''' is a phenomenon wherein individuals or societies who had been concerned about the impact of [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]] become [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to the having a strong emotional response to HIV issues after receiving continual messages about the danger over a long period of time.

==Causes==
[[Anthony Fauci]], director of the United States' [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) said that one of the causes of AIDS fatigue are huge successes in treatment which subsequently have made some people perceive the disease as less concerning.  Fauci noted that whereas in the 1980s in America "we had 30-40 percent of the hospital wards in inner-city hospitals occupied by people with advanced HIV disease, now because of the success of the therapies - which is great news - we don't have that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707200846/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Fauci: Despite 'AIDS fatigue,' Americans should care |author=[[Anthony Fauci]] |work=cnn.com |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Some of the consequences of AIDS fatigue include the following:&lt;ref name="endofstory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mg.co.za/article/2003-11-27-end-of-the-aids-story |title=End of the Aids story? |first=Guy |last=Berger |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
HIV infection is increasing at a rate of 12% annually among 13–24-year-old American men who have sex with men.&lt;ref name=HIVrising&gt;{{cite news

The increase may also be because of new treatments.&lt;ref name=HIVrising /&gt;

'''Advanced Placement [[Music theory|Music Theory]]''' (also known as '''AP Music Theory''', '''AP Jams''', '''AP Music''', or '''Music AP''') is a course and examination offered in the [[United States]] by the [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to [[high school]] students who wish to earn credit for a college level [[music theory]] course.

==The course==
Some of the material covered in the course involves low [[sight reading]], in-depth terminology, [[musical phrasing]] and composition, [[music history]], [[chord structure]] and [[Cadence (music)|cadence]]s, and other areas of music theory. This course is recommended for students with particularly strong abilities in music and college music majors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_music.html AP: Music Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exam==
The exam itself is divided into two broad sections: Section I, the multiple-choice section, and Section II, the free-response section. In turn, each section is divided into parts.

===Section I - multiple choice===
Section I of the exam consists of four-choice multiple choice questions; the total amount varies each year. The first half of the section is listening-based; the proctor will begin playing a provided CD, and the exam will begin. Each question or group of questions is based on a musical selection or an auditory stimulus. The selection or stimulus is played, and the student must answer as many of the questions as possible. Each musical selection or auditory stimulus is usually played two or three times for each question or group of questions, though the exact number differs from question to question.

===Section II - free response===
Section II of the exam consists of three parts, all of which require student-produced responses. One part of the section is listening-based, one part is part-writing, and one part is sight-singing.

The listening-based part of the section contains two types of questions: melodic dictation, in which a one-part [[melody]] is played two or three times, a starting pitch, [[time signature]], and [[Key (music)|key]] are given on the answer sheet, and the student must accurately record both the pitch and length of the played notes. The student must record two melodies; generally, one melody is in a [[major key]] and in a [[compound meter (music)|compound meter]] while the other melody is in a [[minor key]] and in a [[simple meter]]. One melody is written in the [[treble clef]] and the other is in the [[bass clef]]. The first melodic dictation question is in simple meter, while the second melodic question is in compound time. The reason for this is to test candidate AP Music Theory students in their ability to distinguish between simple and [[Compound (music)|compound]] time signatures as well as being able to read bass clef and treble clef.

The second type of listening-based question is harmonic dictation. A four-part texture, traditional [[SATB]], is played four times. The key, starting pitch for each part, and time signature are given on the answer sheet. The student must accurately notate only the bass and soprano lines, though the bass, tenor, alto, and soprano parts are played on the recording. The student must also provide a Roman numeral analysis of the chords in the progression with correct chord inversions.

The part-writing part of section II requires that the student, using knowledge of "eighteenth century composition guidelines" (as indicated on CollegeBoard's latest rubric and on the released 2003-2006 exams on [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com AP Central]), "standard" [[chord progressions]], cadences, [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and part ranges, write a short (usually two or four measure) two- or four-part texture given starting pitches, a key, time signature, and another piece of information that varies with each question: [[figured bass]] notation and completed bass part, [[Roman numeral notation]], or a completed soprano line.

For the question with the supplied figured bass notation and completed bass line, the student must write the Roman numeral notation of each chord and fill in the remaining tenor, alto, and soprano lines. For the question with the supplied Roman numeral notation, the student must write all four parts of the texture. For the question with the supplied soprano line, the student must develop a chord progression based on the given soprano line and write only an accompanying bass part.

The sight-singing part of the exam requires the student to analyze a given melodic line and perform the line as accurately as possible. Students perform two melodies one at a time; the written starting pitch will be played, and the student will have 75 seconds to practice aloud any parts he or she desires. Once the 75 seconds have ended, the starting pitch will be played again, and the student will have 30 seconds to perform the piece. Transposition of the key is allowed for voice comfortas stated on each year's directions. As with the melodic dictation part of the exam, one piece will generally be compound in meter and major in key, while the other will be simple in meter and minor in key. Students may sing the melody using [[solfège]] syllables, numbers, or a random syllable (la, la, la... ta, ta, ta etc...)

'''Allen Kaeja''' (born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]) is a [[Gemini award]]-nominated [[film director]] and [[choreographer]]. He entered the field of [[dance]] after nine years of [[wrestling]] and [[Judo]],&lt;ref&gt;http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=12&lt;/ref&gt; and has created over 90 dance pieces since 1981 and choreographed for 26 films. Allen is co-artistic director of Kaeja d'Dance with his [[wife]] Karen Kaeja &lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0010441&lt;/ref&gt; and has completed an MA dance degree at [[York University]]. He is co-founder of the [[CanAsian International Dance Festival]].

== Work ==

Allen's most recent dance film, ''Of the Heart'' (2008), co-directed with Douglas Rosenberg,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvpg.net/OfTheHeart.html&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated for the Jury Prize in [[New York City]] and [[Barcelona]], 2009. The Kaeja films have been screened all across the globe and have been nominated for the [[American Choreography Awards]] ([[Los Angeles]]) and the [[Banff World Television Festival Awards]] ([[Canada]]). They have received special 'Jury Mentions' from IMZ (Europe) and [[American Dance Festival]] (USA). The Kaeja films are also a part of the permanent collection at the [[MoMA]] and [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York and [[Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial]] in Israel.

Allen and Karen Kaeja teach master classes in Kaeja Partnering and Dance Film. Allen is currently on faculty at the School of the Toronto Dance Theatre and [[Ryerson University]]. He also taught Canada's first "hands-on" university dance film course in Canadian history at Ryerson. They developed the express dance approach, now integrated into the education system through a partnership with the Toronto District School Board. They provide subsidized workshops, dance enrichment opportunities and performances to underserved communities in Canada and abroad. They have worked with over 20,000 learners worldwide. Allen has also just published his second book, ''Transcending Media'', while adapting the dance production ''Asylum of Spoons'' from stage to film.

Allen recently performed as Pushkin in [[Moze Mossanen]]'s ''Nureyev'', premiered on [[Bravo!]]. Also, Ut i Scenekunsten (Oslo, Norway) has commissioned a new creation from Allen set to premiere in 2011 in Norway, then to have its North American premiere during the 20th anniversary concert of Kaeja d'Dance, April 12–16, 2011 at the Enwave Theatre, Harbourfront, Toronto.

ASAS and its family schools, Avondale Elementary School and Avondale Alternative Elementary School, are part of the [[Toronto District School Board]]. Prior to 1998, the schools were part of the [[North York Board of Education]]. The school is temporarily housed (as of {{currentyear}}) in the former Silverview Public School building on 24 Silverview Drive.

==History==
Avondale's predecessor, Alternative Independent Study Program (known by the acronym AISP), was the first Board of Education operated alternative school in North York and one of the first such high schools in Toronto. AISP was founded in 1971 to meet the increasing demand of the students of North York for alternative education. Following the apparent success of Shared Experience Exploration and Discovery (known as SEED) in the City of Toronto, the North York Board of Education agreed to create an alternative program which began in September 1971 with admission of the first Grade 11, 12 and 13 students. Attendance of the first 160 was determined by lottery of the students who wished to attend, and whose numbers exceeded the allotted amount. The school had a full complement of teachers and a Programme Director instead of a Principal. The founding Programme Director was the Board's former history co-ordinator Jack Gillette.  Catalysts were qualified volunteers engaged to assist with teaching specialized courses designed by the students and given Ontario Ministry of Education approval. A reunion of the original 160 students and teachers took place in a private home in Toronto on November 5, 2011. Many of the original students, now in their mid to late fifties, and most of the original teachers including Jack Gillette were in attendance. AISP changed with the times and became Avondale Alternative School in the 80s. An earlier reunion of the students of AISP took place at the school on May 27, 2010.

To allow construction of the new Avondale School building, the schools were temporarily relocated in the former Silverview Public School on 24 Silverview Drive on Yonge/Finch corridor. The new school will open in 2017 although Avondale Secondary will be potentially be built on 25 Oakburn Drive, the site of Oakburn Centre.

==Curriculum==
In addition to teaching all necessary courses required to earn an [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]], Avondale offers classes in [[guitar]], [[drama]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]] and [[painting]], [[photography]], [[French language|French]], business technology, [[law]], [[philosophy]], advanced [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[calculus]] and [[Linear algebra|vectors]], [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], an introduction to [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]; [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physical education]], [[queer studies|gay and lesbian studies]], and [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. All classes are in the academic stream; applied and workplace classes must be taken via [[E-learning|e-school]] or independent study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdsb.on.ca/choices/3409.pdf "Avondale Secondary Alternative School's TDSB Profile"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics, photography, and painting and drawing are all taught by professionals in their respective fields contracted independently to teach at Avondale once a week. These teachers are known as 'catalysts'.

Great emphasis is placed on dialog-based learning within classes, particularly humanities. Examples of this include informal lectures open to questioning and criticism, class discussion on texts and ideas, and structured debates and discussions as formal evaluations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28031">'''Buffy studies''' (or '''Buffyology''') is the study of [[Joss Whedon]]'s popular television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and, to a lesser extent, its spin-off program ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.  It explores issues related to gender and other philosophical issues as expressed through the content of these shows in the fictional [[Buffyverse]].

[[Neda Ulaby]] of [[NPR]] describes ''Buffy'' as having a "special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Neda |last=Ulaby |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1262180 |title='Buffy Studies' |work= National Public Radio |date= May 13, 2003 |accessdate= February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term "Buffy studies" is commonly used amongst the academic ''Buffy''-related writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Marianne |last= Cantwell |url= http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2004/02/03/collapsing-the-extratextualpassions-and-intensities-of-knowledge-in-buffy-the-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-online-fan-communities-marianne-cantwell |title=Collapsing the Extra/Textual: Passions and Intensities of Knowledge in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Online Fan Communities|work=''Refractory: a Journal of Entertainment Media''|volume=5|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development as academic field==
[[Image:Slayage (Buffyverse).jpg|thumb|Slayage logo]]
The debut of ''Buffy'' (1997–2003) eventually led to the publication of a number of books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]] and [[women's studies]]. Since January 2001 ''Slayage: The Online Journal of Buffy Studies'' has published essays on the topic quarterly, and it continues to do so. ''[[Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' was published in 2002, and since then many more ''Buffy'' books have been published by academic book publishers. There have also been a number of international conferences on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;See: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20030421112944/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/2340659.stm Boffins get their teeth into Buffy]", ''BBC'' (18 October 2002). "[http://www.wickedness.net/v1cfp.htm Vampires: Myths and Metaphors of Enduring Evil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215093849/http://www.wickedness.net/v1cfp.htm |date=2005-12-15 }}" ''Wickedness.net'' (2002). "[http://www.slayage.tv/SCBtVS_Archive/index.htm The Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Paper Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622232427/http://www.slayage.tv/SCBtVS_Archive/index.htm |date=2006-06-22 }}", ''Slayage.tv'' (2004). These sources report on three conferences respectively: "Blood, Text and Fears" (University of East Anglia, UK, 2002), ''Myths and Metaphors of Enduring Evil'' (Budapest, Hungary, 2003), and "The Slayage Conference" (Nashville, USA, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; "College courses across the globe are devoted to the show, and secondary schools in Australia and New Zealand also provide Buffy classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529?s_name=&amp;no_ads= Scholars lecture on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314015546/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |date=March 14, 2007 }}, ''Ctv.ca'' (May 29, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The topic can even be undertaken as part of a [[Master's degree]] in Cult Film &amp; TV at [[Brunel University]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=13473&amp;in_page_id=2|title=Study Buffy at university|work=Metro.co.uk|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, ''Angel'' is being analyzed alongside its predecessor, e.g. in the 2005 publication, [[Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul|''Reading Angel'']].

The creator of ''Buffy'', [[Joss Whedon]], has responded to the scholarly reaction to his series: "I think it's great that the academic community has taken an interest in the show. I think it's always important for academics to study popular culture, even if the thing they are studying is idiotic. If it's successful or made a dent in culture, then it is worthy of study to find out why. Buffy, on the other hand is, I hope, not idiotic. We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/16/readersopinions/16WHED.html?ex=1198213200&amp;en=292c3c27d77f61ac&amp;ei=5070 |title=10 Questions for... Joss Whedon |work=''[[The New York Times]]''|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third International Slayage Conference on the Whedonverses was held June 5–8, 2008 at [[Henderson State University]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsu.edu/philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610010223/http://www.hsu.edu/philosophy/ |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to this scholarly attention has had its critics.  Jes Battis, who authored ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"|Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel]]'', has stated that study of the Buffyverse "invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire", and meets "a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jes|last=Battis|title=''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"]]''|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company''|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=June 2005|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of explored themes==

===Gender studies===
*Lorna Jowett, 2005: Sex and The Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan.
*:In this paper, published by Wesleyan University Press, Jowett, senior lecturer in American Studies at The University of Northampton and  Buffy fan, states that ‘Buffy may be “Barbie with a kung-fu grip”, but she is still Barbie’ (p.&amp;nbsp;197).  Jowett identifies the show as being “post-feminist”, while arguing that it fails to challenge gender stereotypes in meaningful ways.  Jowetts book’s first 3 chapters are entitled: Girl Power, Good Girls and Bad Girls, in which Jowett dissects the stereotypes within the female characters that, she argues, are reinforced by the show. The next three chapters are broken into the male stereotypes: Tough men, New Men and Dead Boys. Jowett states that reinforcement of stereotypes exists within the show for male characters as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annie|last=Potts|url=http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/3/415|title=Review: Lorna Jowett: Sex and the Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan|work=''Feminism &amp; Psychology''|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lorna|last=Jowett|url=http://www.upne.com/0-8195-6757-4.html|title=''Sex and The Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan''|publisher=Wesleyan University|location=Middletown, Connecticut|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop culture studies===
*Dee Amy-Chinn and Milly Williamson, 2005: The Vampire Spike in text and fandom: Unsettling oppositions in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
*:Amy-Chinn, senior lecturer at Oxford Brookes University and Williamson, of Brunel University, focus on a specific character in this paper, Spike, who as argued by the authors, embodies “the simultaneous expression of erotic repulsion and attraction” and a “fear of and desire for the ‘other’”. The authors compare and contrast the character of Spike to the show’s general treatment of sexuality and self.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media studies===
*Rhonda Wilcox, 2005: Why Buffy Matters: The Art of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
*:Why does Buffy Matter?  In this paper Wilcox makes the attempt to bring this television show into perspective for us.  Wilcox says, “It matters because it shows that television can be art, and deserves to be so studied…the depth of the characters, the truth of the stories, the profundity of the themes, and their precise incarnation in language, sound and image – all of these matter.” (Wilcox 419).  While giving in depth details of all of these elements and also drawing on other academic articles about Buffy, Wilcox helps to bring this television series to the same page for all fans interested in Buffy; from those who are a bit unsure about the series all the way to those die hard fans.
*Wilcox, Rhonda &amp; Lavery, David, 2002.  “Fighting the Forces: What’s at Stake for Buffy The Vampire Slayer.”
*:"Fighting the Forces” explores the struggle to create meaning in an impressive example of popular culture, the television series phenomenon “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. These essays analyze the social and cultural issues implicit in the series and place it in its literary context.  Editors Wilcox and Lavery have opened an intriguing doorway to fans of this show, “Issues of gender, generations, race, class, and violence are treated seriously, through an in-depth analysis of both main characters and sidekicks. Class and race are discussed through a study of Buffy’s and her friends’ relationship with the two "other" slayers, American white trash Faith and Jamaican Kendra.”  Wilcox and Lavery analyze these many concepts while critiquing other scholarly essays such as “God, New Religious Movements, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Everything Philosophical About Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”&lt;ref&gt;http://you.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/3/269&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family studies===
* Burr, Vivien., and Jarvis, C. Sept. 2007. “Imagining the Family Representations of Alternative Lifestyles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
*:This paper offers studies of the family and how media families affect the views of young people.  Through the television show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Burr explores the dangers and advantages of non-normative family forms, especially the non-genetic or ‘chosen’ families. (Burr) There is also a focus that Buffy “endorses a non-hierarchical, ‘democratic vision’ of the family. (Giddens, 1992) Also, Buffy can generate ‘interactive social worlds’ that are a main focus of the spreading of new social, familial practices (Plummer, 1995).  Family is viewed in a new and different way through Buffy that leads to such innovations as well in practice and research on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://qsw.sagepub.com/content/vol6/issue3/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics===
* Kociemba, David, 2006: “Actually, it explains a ''lot''": Reading the Opening Title Sequences in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
*:This paper examines the opening title sequences of the television series in detail, looking at the use of imagery, color, editing, logo, credits, title, and scoring. The opening title sequences of Buffy the Vampire Slayer function as a microcosm of the series itself. They reveal the influence of the creators’ perception of their audience and their own work, the medium’s narrative and artistic conventions, and the media industry’s own practices. They construct the series’ past, shape the viewer’s present experience of the episode, and prepare the way for future narratives. This article won the "Short Mr. Pointy" award for excellence in scholarship in Buffy Studies from the Whedon Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slayageonline.com/essays/slayage22/Kociemba.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025074345/http://www.slayageonline.com/essays/slayage22/Kociemba.htm |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5874">The '''directed listening and thinking activity''' (DLTA) is a strategy that was first identified by Stauffer (1980). It is used with [[early childhood]] students or students who are not yet successful [[independent reading|independent readers]]. Teachers use this strategy to establish a purpose for reading with their students. With the use of this strategy students can become engaged in a text that they could not otherwise read on their own. Students are prepared to listen to a story that will be read by their teacher by being given specific information that they are to focus on as they listen. The strategy utilizes pre-reading, reading, and post-reading questions and discussions. Teachers use this strategy in an attempt to build on the knowledge that students already know and apply it to new information and situations. Students are provided with a framework to organize and recall information from storybooks. The directed reading and thinking activity is a very similar strategy that can be applied once this strategy is mastered and students become more advanced, independent readers.

==Purpose==
Students need to be explicitly taught strategies for the [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] of a story. The purpose of this strategy is to give the students skills so that they can eventually internalize reading skills such as, setting purposes for reading and [[:wikt:summarize|summarizing]] what they have read. As a result of continuously using this strategy in the classroom students should develop [[metacognition]] of their own reading abilities and as a result a better comprehension, understanding, and connections to texts.

==Procedure==
===Preparing for reading===

===Reading the story===
The teacher now begins to read the story. It is important to make sure that students can see all of the [[Book illustration|illustrations]]. The teacher should stop one or two times to discuss the story and to ask the students which previous predictions were correct. Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.

===Discussion after reading===
This is the final part of the directed listening and thinking activity. At this time there should be a discussion between the students and the teacher that is connected to the objectives and purposes for reading that were originally established. For example, if the skill that was established was sequencing the students will need to recall information about the order of the events in the story. The end is a way to tie together the skills that the students were focusing on and to summarize what they have learned as a result of listening to the story. If the students do not respond to particular questions that are asked about the story it is the teacher’s responsibility to model or scaffold their responses. This can be done by asking a question in a different or simpler way or by giving the student more information. This should also be a time to go back to the predictions that were initially listed and revise and discuss them. After the teacher has discussed the story and the objectives as a group an independent activity can be done to assess what the students have learned.

==Reading objectives==
There are a wide range of objectives that you can use with this strategy. Basically any skill that pertains to the text can be employed. Examples of the different types of skills that the directed listening activity can be used to enhance are: literal information such as, sequencing and recalling facts, inferential responses such as, interpreting the feelings of characters, making predictions, relating story events to real-life experiences and visualizing, or critical responses such as, evaluating and problem solving. The strategy can also be used with various genres and story structures. However, it is important to remember that the three steps to using this strategy are always the same:

#preparation for reading
#reading
#discussion after reading.

==Conclusion==
In a study conducted by Morrow (1984) children scored higher on comprehension tests when this strategy was utilized in the classroom because of its focus on many skills that are important to good readers. The study also proved that the modeling and scaffolding used by the teacher during this technique better prepared students to understand unfamiliar texts. When this strategy is used in classrooms it will allow students to better comprehend and connect with the texts that are being read to them. If this strategy is done correctly and frequently it will bring students more independence and [[reading readiness]]. It will lead to the creation of more engaged and skilled readers who possess the ability to [[critical thinking|think critically]] and analyze the texts that they have read.

'''eCOTOOL''' (e-competences tools) was an international project undertaken through the [[European Union|European Union's]] [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013|Lifelong Learning Programme]], specifically the [[Leonardo da Vinci programme]]. As such, the eCOTOOL project primarily dealt with initial and continuing [[vocational education and training]] (VET) in the European Union. 

The objective of eCOTOOL was to improve the development, exchange, and maintenance of VET certificates and their accessibility and transparency by harmonizing [[Europass]] with other European instruments ([[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]], ECVET&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/vocational-policy/ecvet_en ECVET]&lt;/ref&gt;) and e‐competences. This aimed to increase European mobility and the transparency of VET systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eCOTOOL Project Website|url=http://www.ecompetence.eu/|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

eCOTOOL focused on:

(1) the improvement of the development, exchange, and maintenance of vocational
education and training (VET) certificates and their accessibility and transparency and

(2) increasing European mobility and transparency in general.

In an attempt to achieve these objectives eCOTOOL developed the adaptable [[Europass CS]] eco‐tools based on the European policies Europass Certificate Supplement (CS), EQF, ECVET, and PAS 1093. The Europass CS eco‐tools were first tested and evaluated in the agricultural sector. Finally the eCOTOOL results were submitted to the [[European Committee for Standardization|European Standardization Committees]] (CEN/TC 353) to contribute to a European consensus and standard for VET competences.

== Overview ==

The overall objective of the eCOTOOL project was to improve the development, exchange, and maintenance of VET certificates and their accessibility and transparency by harmonizing Europass with other European instruments (EQF, ECVET) and e‐competences. This attempted to increase the European mobility and transparency of VET systems through:

1. The development of an Application Profile and Technical Tools based on the Europass
Certificate Supplement (CS) under the Brand "Europass CS eco‐tools"

2. The Adaptation of all Europass CS eco‐tools to the [[Agricultural Sector]] and their Pilot
Testing and Optimization

The eCOTOOL project attempted to provide advanced and sustainable instruments and tools for the
Europass CS:

First an application profile was developed as an information model from the European
instruments to become the European standard for certificate repositories based on the
Europass CS specification.

== Project Outcome ==

The main benefits of the Europass CS eco‐tools are:
* '''Better accessibility to existing Europass Certificate Supplements (CS) by ensuring full interoperability amongst any given IT system'''
* '''Easier development and maintenance of further Europass Certificate Supplements'''
* '''Simple exchange of Europass Certificate Supplements between any online platforms and repositories'''
* '''Enhancing European mobility by improving comparisons of VET solutions and their certificates'''&lt;ref&gt;ADAM Database entry for eCOTOOL&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief description of the eCOTOOL products ==

First an application profile was developed as an information model from the European
instruments to become the European standard for certificate repositories based on the
Europass CS specification. This information model was delivered with a full XML binding to
complete the Europass CS eco‐tools and to support and facilitate their dissemination to and
application in all European countries.

'''The application profile:'''

The application profile was disseminated and populated at the website and was freely
accessible, applicable and adaptable for all interested European stakeholders. It attempted to facilitate
the further development, the maintenance of existing, and the harmonization of all future
Europass Certificate Supplements within Europe by this information model which is adaptable
and applicable within any branch or sector.
The application profile is information model that is needed for the development of
the technical tools (WP2). It retains full interoperability with Europass CS and integrate
the models and taxonomies of EQF, ECVET and e‐competences.

'''The technical tools:'''

The technical tools ([[XML data binding|XML bindings]]) attempted to facilitate the exchange of VET certificates between
any information systems, databases, online platforms, and repositories for easier and better
accessibility, development, and maintenance.
The Europass CS Technical Tools are data models as complete [[XML data binding|XML bindings]] including a [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML
Schema Description (XSD)]] for the implementation within different IT systems and
repositories.

'''The adaptation of the Europass CS eco‐tools to the agricultural sector:'''

The Europass CS eco‐tools consist of both: the adapted Europass CS application profile
and the adapted Europass CS technical tools in six languages.
Freely available on the online platform, the adapted Europass CS eco‐tools attempted to facilitate the
implementation, maintenance, exchange, and harmonization of Certificate Supplements
within the agricultural sector.

The adaptation of the Europass CS eco‐tools includes the application profile as well as the
technical tools by adding and integrating specific requirements of the agricultural sector.
That covers agricultural terminology, [[metadata]], and taxonomies as well as methodologies,
settings, and didactical principles that are typical for the agricultural sector. The adaptation
includes the translations for the user countries of pilot testing.

A summary and comparison of all identified VET requirements and needs is also available as
one main input for the adaptation of the Europass CS eco‐tools to the agricultural sector.

The results of the eCOTOOL Project are being used by other current European research projects, including the [[AGRICOM Project]] and the [[Compat.egov|Compat.egov Project]].

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8439">In 1996 [[Gregory Stanton]], the president of [[Genocide Watch]], presented a briefing paper called "'''The 8 Stages of [[Genocide]]'''" at the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref name=GSGW-1996&gt;[[Gregory Stanton]]. [http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide.html The 8 Stages of Genocide], [[Genocide Watch]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In it he suggested that genocide develops in eight stages that are "predictable but not inexorable".&lt;ref name=GSGW-1996/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[FBI]] has found somewhat similar stages for [[Hate groups#Psychopathology of hate groups|hate groups]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Stanton paper was presented at the State Department, shortly after the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda genocide]] and much of the analysis is based on why that genocide occurred. The preventive measures suggested, given the original target audience, were those that the United States could implement directly or use their influence on other governments to have implemented.

! 1.&lt;br /&gt;Classification
| People are divided into "them and us".
| "The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that [[Racial integration|transcend]]... divisions."
|-
! 2.&lt;br /&gt;Symbolization
| "When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups..."
| "To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden as can [[hate speech]]".

| "One group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects,  or diseases."
| "Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen."

| "It is 'extermination' to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human".

|-
! 8.&lt;br /&gt;[[Genocide denial|Denial]]
| "The perpetrators... deny that they committed any crimes..."
| "The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts"
|}

In April 2012, it was reported that Stanton would soon be officially adding two new stages, Discrimination and Persecution, to his original theory, which would make for a 10-stage theory of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aipr.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/genprev-in-the-news-19-april-2012/|title=GenPrev in the News|date=19 April 2012|work=Auschwitz Institute Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper for the [[Social Science Research Council]] Dirk Moses criticises the Stanton approach concluding:

{{quotation|In view of this rather poor record of ending genocide, the question needs to be asked why the "genocide studies" paradigm cannot predict and prevent genocides with any accuracy and reliability. The paradigm of "genocide studies," as currently constituted in North America in particular, has both strengths and limitations. While the moral fervor and public activism is admirable and salutary, the paradigm appears blind to its own implication in imperial projects that are themselves as much part of the problem as they are part of the solution. The US government called Darfur a genocide to appease domestic lobbies, and because the statement cost it nothing. Darfur will end when it suits the great powers that have a stake in the region.|Dirk Moses&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Moses [http://howgenocidesend.ssrc.org/Moses/ Why the Discipline of "Genocide Studies" Has Trouble Explaining How Genocides End?], [[Social Science Research Council]], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Helen Fein&lt;ref&gt;Fein, H. (1979). Accounting for genocide: Victims and survivors of the Holocaust. New York: Fre Press {{Page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that pre-existing anti-Semitism and systems that maintained anti-Semitic policies was related to the number of Jews killed in different European countries during the Holocaust. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external  (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Staub, E (1989). The roots of evil: The origins of genocide and other group violence. New York: Cambridge University Press.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ervinstaub.com Staub, E. (2011) ''Overcoming evil: Genocide, violent conflict and terrorism'' New York: Oxford University Press.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FreeBYU''' is an advocacy organization dedicated to changing [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) policies such that students can have an environment of religious and academic freedom. These policies mean that students who enroll in the university as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |LDS Church]]) are not able to express a change in religious beliefs or express their lack thereof without risk of being evicted from their student homes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Byu A Conversation About Religious Freedom Among The Cougars|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/free-byu-a-conversation-about-religious-freedom-among-the-cougars/|website=sunstonemagazine.com|publisher=Sunstone Education Foundation, Inc.|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fired from their campus jobs,&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fletcher Stack|first1=Peggy|title=National If you leave Mormonism, you have to leave BYU.

'''Gish Jen''', born '''Lillian Jen''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:任|任]][[wikt:璧|璧]][[wikt:蓮|蓮]]}}) August 12, 1955, is a contemporary American writer and speaker.&lt;ref name="MELUS"&gt;Matsukawa, Yuko, [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LLzTh2QS9LgN11Nx4mPc6Q4b91T6phMtJHzSSkFQWhwp7TLyLs5H!-1778128411!1581092936?docId=5001675556 "MELUS interview: Gish Jen"], ''[[MELUS]]'', Vol. 18, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Gish Jen is a second generation Chinese American. Her parents emigrated from China in the 1940s, her mother was from Shanghai and her father was from [[Yixing]]. Born in [[Long Island]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Heath Anthology of American Literature, Fifth Edition | editor = Lauter, Paul | title = Gish Jen (b. 1955) | url = http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/contemporary/jen_gi.html | accessdate = March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she grew up in [[Queens]], then [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], then [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]]. Her birth name is Lillian, but during her high school years she acquired the nickname Gish, named for actress [[Lillian Gish]].&lt;ref name="MELUS" /&gt;

She graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1977&lt;ref name="thecrimson.harvard.edu"&gt;Ganguli, Ishani, [http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article/2002/6/4/novelist-gish-jen-finds-literary-voice/ "Novelist Gish Jen Finds Literary Voice Outside Harvard Identity"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', Tuesday, June 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; with a BA in [[English major|English]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/fellowships/fellows_2002gjen.aspx "2001–2002 Radcliffe Institute Fellows: Gish Jen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814002145/http://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/fellowships/fellows_2002gjen.aspx |date=August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later attended [[Stanford Business School]] (1979–1980), but dropped out in favor of the [[University of Iowa]] [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|Writers' Workshop]], where she earned her [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in fiction in 1983.&lt;ref name="thecrimson.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==Fiction==
Several of her short stories have been reprinted in ''[[Best American Short Stories|The Best American Short Stories]]''. Her piece "Birthmates", was selected as one of ''The Best American Short Stories of The Century'' by [[John Updike]]. Her works include four novels: ''Typical American'', ''Mona in the Promised Land'', ''The Love Wife'', and ''[[World and Town]]''. She has also written a collection of short fiction, ''[[Who's Irish? (short story)|Who's Irish?]]''.

Her first novel, ''Typical American,'' was nominated for a National Books Critics' Circle Award. Her second novel, ''Mona in the Promised Land''  features a Chinese-American adolescent who converts to Judaism. ''The Love Wife'', her third novel, portrays an Asian American family with [[interracial marriage|interracial]] parents and both biological and adopted children.

Her fourth novel, ''World and Town,'' portrays a fragile America, its small towns challenged by globalization, development, fundamentalism, and immigration, as well as the ripples sent out by 9/11.&lt;ref name="Library Journal"&gt;Andersen, Beth E., [https://archive.is/20130128032000/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/ljinprint/currentissue/886728-403/fiction_reviews_oct_1_2010.html.csp "Review: World and Town"], ''Library Journal'', October 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''World and Town'' won the 2011 Massachusetts Book Prize in fiction and was nominated for the 2012 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublinliteraryaward.ie/2012-longlist/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonfiction==
In 2013 Jen published her first non-fiction book, entitled ''Tiger Writing:  Art, Culture, and the Interdependent Self''. Based on the Massey Lectures that Jen delivered at Harvard in 2012, ''Tiger Writing'' explores East-West differences in self construction, and how these affect art and especially literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu |title=Home &amp;#124; Harvard University Press |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jen's second work of non-fiction is "The Girl at the Baggage Claim: Explaining the East-West Culture Gap," to be published in February 2017.  This is a provocative study of the different ideas Easterners and Westerners have about the self and society and what this means for current debates in art, education, geopolitics, and business.  Drawing on stories and personal anecdotes, as well as recent research in cultural psychology, Jen reveals how this difference shapes what we perceive, remember, say, do, and make – in short, how it shapes everything from our ideas about copying and talking in class to the difference between Apple and Alibaba.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/537621/the-girl-at-the-baggage-claim-by-gish-jen&lt;/ref&gt;

Jen has also published numerous pieces in the New York Times, The New Republic, and in other venues.&lt;ref&gt;gishjen.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 2009, Princeton's [[Elaine Showalter]] devoted much attention to Jen in her survey of American women writers, "A Jury of Her Peers:  American Women Writers From [[Anne Bradstreet]] to [[Annie Proulx]]."  In an article in ''The Guardian'', Showalter elaborated, including Jen in a list of eight top authors, and pointing out that Jen's "vision of a multicultural America goes well beyond the angry rants or despairing projections of Roth, DeLillo, McCarthy or other finalists in the [[Great American Novel]] competition." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Showalter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/09/female-novelists-usa |title=Elaine Showalter chooses the best novelists writing in the US today &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-05-09 |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Junot Diaz concurred, calling Jen "the Great American Novelist we're always hearing about."  And in 2000, in a millennial edition of ''The Times Magazine'' in the UK, in which figures were asked to name their successors in the 21st century, John Updike picked Jen.&lt;ref&gt;Updike Remembered, The New Republic, https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/updike-remembered&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Higher Education Act of 1965''' ('''HEA''') ({{USPL|89|329}}) was legislation signed into [[Law of the United States|United States law]] on November 8, 1965, as part of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] domestic agenda. Johnson chose [[Texas State University]] (then called "[[Texas State University#Name changes|Southwest Texas State College]]"), his [[alma mater]], as the signing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Johnson signs legislation into law |publisher=LBJ Library and Museum |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was intended "to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education". It increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans for students, and established a National Teachers Corps.  The "financial assistance for students" is covered in [[Title IV]] of the HEA.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008. Current authorization for the programs in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of 2013, but has been extended through 2015 while Congress prepares changes and amendments. Before each re-authorization, Congress amends additional programs, changes the language and policies of existing programs, or makes other changes.

== 1965 Act ==
In January 1965, Representative [[Edith Green]] of Oregon introduced H. R. 3220 as a bill to "strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary education."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/higher-education-act|title=Higher Education Act|last=|first=|date=|website=The Great Society Congress|publisher=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Wayne Morse]] of Oregon introduced the Senate version of the bill, S. 600.  The bills sought to create an advisor council to review teacher training programs and to create a [[National Teachers Corps|National Teacher Corps]], which would recruit teachers to serve in low-income areas and train teachers through internships.  Other provisions of the bills included financial aid, scholarships, work study, and library enhancements.  Throughout 1965 numerous hearings were held by Special Subcommittee on Education and the Education Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held numerous hearings.  Based on the recommendations of University administrators, educators and student aid officers, a new bill was introduced:  H. R. 9567.  It was passed by the House of Representatives on August 26 and the Senate passed the bill on September 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 into law, President Johnson said that the act, along with the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] as "keystones of the great, fabulous 89th Congress" that would spread "the roots of change and reform" throughout the nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Changes in 1998==
The [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]] (GEAR UP) was first authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.  Also in the amendments of 1998 is the Aid Elimination Provision, which prevents students with drug charges from receiving federal aid for colleges and universities.  This is where question 31 on the [[FAFSA]] forms originates. The question asks whether the student has ever been convicted of a [[drug-related crime|drug crime]] while receiving federal financial aid. This statutory provision was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in the face of a constitutional challenge by the [[ACLU]] in the case of ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source | case = ''Students for Sensible Drug Policy v. Spellings'', 523 F.3d 896 (8th cir., 2008) | findlaw = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1386070.html | other_source1 = LexisOne | other_url1 = http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=gdjc&amp;searchTerm=eTEf.HLZa.UYGY.Cdfb&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW | other_source2 = Law.com | other_url2 = http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421214044&amp;slreturn=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I think this information works better in its own section, because it is not a summary of the article, where it used to be --&gt;

The amendments also included a provision [HEA Section 487(a)(23)] requiring universities to make a good faith effort to encourage voter registration of students on their campuses. This requirement applies only to institutions located in states that require voter registration prior to election day and do not allow registration the day of the election. Institutions receive registration forms from the state after requesting them at least 120 days prior to the voter registration deadline, and must make them "widely available" to students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rit.edu/fa/grms/compliance/statutes/Voter_Registration_Provision_in_Higher_Education_Amendments_of_1998.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in 2003==
&lt;!-- None of the links in these references work!--&gt;In 2003, much of the Higher Education Act was set to expire. As a result, a number of minority groups united to ask for certain changes. Calling themselves the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, this group was made up of "the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]], the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an advocacy group for [[historically black colleges and universities]], [and they] presented their joint recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act."&lt;ref name="burd"&gt;Stephen Burd, "Institutions Serving Minority Students Propose Changes to Higher Education Act," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 49, no. 26 (2003), http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance aimed to help minority students enter fields where they seemed to be underrepresented and to give incentives to minorities to enter these programs. These incentives included more lenience on loan collection and full government funding for minority education. The Alliance also called for the government to create funding for students in graduate programs of universities serving the minority population.&lt;ref name="burd"/&gt;

Even though the Alliance's request to change the Higher Education Act was heard, significant parts were denied. In 2003, the request for increasing the amount offered in a [[Pell Grant]], to better cover a student's expenses, was denied by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital briefs," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, other issues were corrected. There was a section passed, by the House, that did allow more funds to go to institutions, in order to keep them current; and a grace period for colleges asking for more loans was eliminated. So, if more funding were needed, minority institutions would not have to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Lane, "Bill Would Expand Higher Ed. Access for Minorities, Low-Income Students," ''Community College Week'' 16, no. 4 (2003): 3, http://web.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 reauthorization==
{{US student loans}}
With the changes proposed in 2003, the actual Higher Education Act was not reauthorized. Instead, many of its sections were renewed, with little radical change. Numerous extensions have followed, with the most recent extension lasting through August 15, 2008. The Senate passed an HEA reauthorization bill in July 2007, as did the House of Representatives in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Strong Step for Students: House Higher Education Bill Promotes Innovation and Student Success|publisher=[[Center for Law and Social Policy]]|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0401.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2008, the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]] (Public Law 110-315) (HEOA) was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Expands Basic Aid and Supports Innovation in Student Success, Basic Skills, and Workforce Partnerships|publisher=Center for Law and Social Policy|url=http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/0430.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reauthorized the amended version of the Higher Education Act of 1965.&lt;ref name="ED.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act - 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act made major changes in student loan discharges for disabled people. Previously, to qualify for a discharge, a disabled person could have no income. This has been changed to a no "substantial gainful activity" test, which is the same standard used by the [[Social Security Administration]] in determining eligibility for [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI). The changes took effect on July 1, 2010.

Also included in the 2008 revision of the HEOA were provisions requiring action by U.S. colleges and universities to combat illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name="Educause.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/higher-education-opportunity-act-heoa|title=Higher Education Opportunity Act Anti-P2P provisions - 2008|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following significant lobbying by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the additions to the HEOA of 2008 included requirements that all U.S. colleges and universities (1) release and annual disclosure to students regarding copyright laws and associated campus policies, (2) a written plan, submitted to the Department of Education, to combat copyright abuse using one or more technology-based deterrents, and (3) an offer to students of alternatives to illegal downloading.&lt;ref name="Law Offices of Zick Rubin Memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EPO0938.pdf|title=Dealing With the Higher Education Opportunity Act's New Copyright Protection Requirement|publisher=Law Offices of Zick Rubin|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant controversy surrounded the inclusion of anti-P2P legislation into HEOA of 2008, resulting in a letter from a number of leaders in higher education.&lt;ref name="Opposing Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/CSD5226.pdf|title=Letter Opposing The Inclusion Of The Entertainment Industry Proposal On Illegal File Sharing In The HEA Sent By The Higher Education Members Of The Joint Committee|publisher=Educause|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[College Cost Reduction and Access Act]] (CCRA), a budget reconciliation bill signed into law in September 2007, made significant changes to federal financial aid programs included in HEA. In addition to increasing the maximum [[Pell Grant]] award and reducing interest rates on subsidized student loans, this bill capped loan repayment at 15% of an individual’s [[discretionary income]], raised the income protection allowance, enacted loan forgiveness for public servants in the Direct Loan program, set publicly funded student loans to fixed rates from variable rate loans, and took actions to address problematic practices in the lending industry. Most CCRA provisions took effect on October 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Association of University Women]]. ''Increasing Access to Higher Education''. January 2008. [http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/issue_advocacy/actionpages/upload/higherEdAct.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law for the first time also required post-secondary institutions be more transparent about costs and required the nearly 7,000 post-secondary institutions that receive federal financial aid funds (Title IV) to post net price calculators on their websites as well as security and copyright policies by October 29, 2011.

As defined in HEOA, the net price calculator's purpose is "to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The [net price] calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student’s individual net price at a particular institution."

The law defines "estimated net price" as the difference between an institution's average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for a first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution's median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.

Elise Miller, program director for the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] ([[IPEDS]]), stated the idea behind the requirement: "We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not [necessarily] be paying that full price."&lt;ref&gt;U''niversity Business: Preparing for the Net Price Calculator: Avoid Potential Pitfalls by Taking These Steps Today'' By Haley Chitty, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The template was developed based on the suggestions of the IPEDS' Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel's chair. She described the mandate's goal "to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution's sticker price and the price they will end up paying".

The TRP faced the difficult challenge of creating one tool that could be used by a wide variety of institutions – from small, for-profit career schools to major research universities – while balancing simplicity for users.

To meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose either a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternate net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements required by law.

As part of its cost-transparency measures, HEOA of 2008 requires also on the College Navigator Web site a report giving the average institutional net price of attendance for first-time, full-time students who receive financial aid. This also forms the basis for transparency lists; a report on the College Navigator Web site the institutional net price of attendance for Title IV aid recipients by income categories; and for the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to develop a multi-year tuition and required-fees calculator for undergraduate programs for the College Navigator Web site.

The HEA has been criticized for establishing statutory pricing of federal student loans based on political considerations rather than pricing based on risk.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act also maintained the requirement that universities must make an effort to register students to vote. A 2013 Dear Colleague letter from the U.S. Department of Education stated that universities “must make the voter registration forms widely available to [their] students and distribute the forms individually to [their] degree or certificate program students who are physically in attendance at [their] institution. Distribution by regular or electronic mail is permitted.”&lt;ref&gt;https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1317.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VI==

During this reform period of 2008, Title VI of the HEA was reviewed.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"&gt;Hegji, Alexandra. 2014. The Higher Education Act (HEA): A Primer. Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title VI provides federal funds to 129 international studies and foreign language centers at universities nationwide.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"&gt;Brandeis Center 2014- http://brandeiscenter.com/publications/research_opinion_full/joint_statement_on_the_misuse_of_federal_funds_under_title_vi&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this act is to ensure and encourage diverse perspectives in order to enhance national security. As such, Title VI supplies grants for international language studies, business and international education programs as well as international policy.&lt;ref name="Hegji, Alexandra 2014"/&gt; Moreover, the recipients of these funds are required to engage in ‘public outreach’ for K-12, teachers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref name="brandeiscenter.com"/&gt;

Over the past decade concerns have been raised over these title VI funded programs. Conservative critics have emphasized that many of the international programs funded engage in biased, anti-American and anti-Israel rhetoric, with no offers of counterbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kurtz 2007- the national review -taking sides on title VI- http://www.nationalreview.com/article/223078/taking-sides-title-vi-stanley-kurtz&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, a 2006 review mandated by Congress found that the programs were not reaching their goals. Seeking to rectify this, Congress expressed the need for greater oversight by the Department of Education, as well as an investigation to ensure these programs reflected "diverse perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;U.S Department of Education- http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea08/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, the issues within Title VI have been deemed endemic. Writing in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', [[Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law|Louis D. Brandeis Center]] Founder [[Kenneth L. Marcus]] argued that "title VI doesn’t need to be tweaked-it needs to be overhauled".&lt;ref name="The Hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/218110-title-vi-and-campus-bias | title=Title VI and campus bias | work=The Hill | date=September 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017 | author=[[Marcus, Kenneth L.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration followed a joint statement released by 10 groups on September 17, 2014, which the Brandeis Center coordinated.

This joint statement expressed the deep concerns over the misuse of tax payer money, arguing that "these outreach programs, which have no congressional oversight, often disseminate anti-American and anti-Israel falsehoods."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;Peter Schmidt, 2014, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/supporters-of-israel-say-programs-in-middle-east-studies-misuse-u-s-funds/86245 Supporters of Israel Say Programs in Middle East Studies Misuse U.S. Funds]
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the groups voiced the opinion that " too often exclude scholars with diverse perspectives while stifling discourse on critical issues. The biased learning environment that results suppresses the academic freedom of students and faculty with different views. At some institutions, students are afraid to disagree with their professors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/news/jointstatement.pdf Joint Statement on the Misuse of Federal Funds Under Title VI, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This statement was accompanied by a white paper published by the Brandeis Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/practices/antisemitism_whitepaper.pdf | title=The Morass of Middle East Studies: Title VI of the Higher Education Act and Federally Funded Area Studies (Rev. Ed.) | publisher=Louis D. Brandeis Center | date=November 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a report by the [[AMCHA Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CNES-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the negative effects this biased perspective produces on campuses, UCLA specifically.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;Inside Higher ED- Pro-Israel Groups Question Federal Funds for Middle East Centers https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/18/pro-israel-groups-question-federal-funds-middle-east-centers&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCHA study found that "any time UCLA’s center sponsored or co-sponsored an event mentioning Israel from Fall 2010 to Spring 2013, 93% of the time the mention was negative and critical – as if Israel is a blight on the planet."&lt;ref name="The Hill"/&gt;

UCLA's media relations office issued a statement saying that the university "remains dedicated to complying with all federal laws and respecting the free and open exchange of ideas representing diverse viewpoints." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In light of such issues, the joint statement calls for changes in the Title VI program which would 1) "[r]equire recipients of Title VI funds to establish grievance procedures to address complaints that programs are not reflecting diverse perspectives and a wide range of views" and 2) "[r]equire the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to establish a formal complaint-resolution process similar to that in use to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." &lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

Responding to this statement Amy W. Newhall, executive director of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA), asserted that MESA "resolutely opposes all forms of hate speech and discrimination, including anti-Semitism," but "is concerned that some of the reports issued by partisan political groups based outside academia may actually weaken efforts to combat anti-Semitism by portraying all criticism of Israeli policies as a form of anti-Semitism or as ‘anti-Israel.’" &lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;

However, as Kenneth L. Marcus asserts in a letter to the editor of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' the co-signatories of the joint statement " urge the opposite: accountability systems to ensure that these programs offer the diversity of perspectives that existing law requires."&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/blogs/letters/our-goal-is-not-to-shut-down-open-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt;
As said statement concludes: "Arguably, Title VI programs no longer serve a legitimate purpose...  In 2011, Congress reduced Title VI funding nationwide by 40 percent, from $34 million to $18 million.  Unless effective and necessary reforms can be enacted, Congress may have to consider reducing or eliminating Title VI funding from Middle East studies centers." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Extension of HEA==
After being reauthorized in 2008, the Higher Education Act was set to expire in 2013, but was re-extended to allow Congress time to work on the next reauthorization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acenet.edu/advocacy/Pages/Higher-Education-Act.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, House Republicans announced that they had finalized an overhaul of the act, authored primarily by Representative Virginia Foxx of (R - N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The new bill is called the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. The act aims to simplify the federal financial aid process and expand federal work study programs. It would also repeal two Obama-era programs -  “gainful employment” and “borrower defense” - aimed at preventing financial exploitation of undergraduates, as well as bar their readoption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/house-republican-higher-education-bill-obama.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Committee spokesman Michael Woeste, “the reforms within the PROSPER Act are necessary to provide students with a high-quality education, and fix a system that has not been serving their needs.”&lt;ref&gt; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/07/cbo-estimates-show-house-higher-ed-bill-could-hit-student-loan-borrowers-hard/?utm_term=.7595e5ca5cba &lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerns have been raised by advocacy groups about how the PROSPER Act would affect LGBTQ students. According to the Human Rights Campaign, “The PROSPER Act contains several provisions that would allow for the use of religion to justify otherwise prohibited discrimination that could negatively impact LGBTQ students.”&lt;ref&gt;http://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/press-releases/the-prosper-act-what-people-are-really-saying-continued_&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the PROSPER Act includes a weaker version of the provision requiring universities to increase student voter registration, a requirement present in the Higher Education Act since 1998. Critics worry that this change will lead to lower youth turnout in elections, as voter turnout is already historically lowest among young voters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6089">In [[scientific journal|scientific publishing]], the 1969 '''Ingelfinger rule''' originally stipulated that ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (''NEJM'') would not publish findings that had been published elsewhere, in other media or in other journals. The rule was subsequently adopted by several other scientific journals, and has shaped scientific publishing ever since.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1126/science.282.5390.861
 |doi-access=free
 |pmid=9841429
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically it has also helped to ensure that the journal's content is fresh and does not duplicate content previously reported elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to protect the scientific embargo system.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ingelfinger rule has been seen as having the aim of preventing authors from performing [[duplicate publication]]s which would unduly inflate their publication record.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite arxiv
 |last1=Lariviere |first1=V

 |eprint=0906.4019
 |class=physics.soc-ph
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it has also been stated that the real reason for the Ingelfinger rule is to protect the journals' revenue stream, and with the increase in popularity of [[preprint server]]s such as [[arXiv]], [[figshare]], [[bioRxiv]], and [[PeerJ|PeerJPrePrints]] many journals have loosened their requirements concerning the Ingelfinger rule.&lt;ref&gt;

 |page=99
 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-262-02619-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a defense of the policy, the journal said in an editorial that the practice discouraged scientists from talking to the media before their work was peer reviewed.&lt;ref name="editorial"&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi-access=free
 |pmid=1669838
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is named for [[Franz J. Ingelfinger]], the ''NEJM'' editor-in-chief who enunciated it in 1969. An earlier version of the policy had been expressed in 1960 by [[Samuel Goudsmit]], editor of the ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', but did not become as well known.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''International Council for Film, Television and Audiovisual Communication''' (ICFT) is the [[UNESCO]] advisory body on all matters concerned with film, television and new media. Located at UNESCO HQ's in Paris, France, was founded in UNESCO's 10th session of General Conference in 1958.

==History==
Under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Rivet, in 1955, UNESCO organized a series of consultations to further the work of the International Institute of Educational Cinema, which was previously affiliated to the League of Nations.

On the occasion of the General Conference of UNESCO, held in New Delhi in 1958, the project of establishing an International Institute of Cinema and Television was presented by Professor Mario Verdone, Head of the Italian Delegation, and approved. The study was entrusted to Jean Benoit-Levy, filmmaker, honorary director of the United Nations Cinema, assisted by a group of twelve international experts.

The Constitutional Charter of ICFT was signed on 23 October 1958. The most important federations and associations working in the field of audiovisuals and media became the founding members of the ICFT.

In 1980, with the emergence of new technologies, Professor Enrico Fulchignoni, Director of Artistic and Literary Creation at UNESCO and President of the ICFT, decided to add audiovisual communication to the missions of the counsel.

Since the creation of the ICFT, the presidency has been succeeded by: John Maddison (ISFA), Jean d'Arcy (RTF-UN), Raymond Ravar (CILECT), Mario Verdone (CIDALC), Fred Orain (Production), Enrico Fulchignoni (UNESCO), Gérard Bolla (UNESCO) Christopher Roads (British Library), Jean Rouch (CIFES), Daniel Van Espen (Signis), Pierpaolo Saporito (OCCAM), Jean-Michel Arnold (Camera), Hisanori Isomura (NHK) and Inoussa Ousseini (UNESCO).

==Mission==

The aim of the ICFT is to:
* stimulate the creation and promote the production and distribution of high standard audiovisual works;
* advise international organizations and States on the implementation of artistic, educational and industrial policies; 
* create a synergy among creators, professionals and media executives by developing collaboration within its members, especially in the service of the broad orientations of UNESCO; 
* set up an arena where different professionals in the field of audiovisual, especially the young people can present their views and suggestions to an international audience;
* encourage training and research in all audiovisual areas, including media education, and offer a space for reflection on the development of technologies in the service of creation, education and culture; 
* contribute to the efforts of development of communication, especially in the field of free flow of information.

The ICFT celebrated its 50th birthday at UNESCO on 23 October 2008.

'''Judy Malloy''' (born '''Judith Ann Powers''' January 9, 1942) is a poet whose works embrace the intersection of hypernarrative, [[magic realism]], and [[information art]]. Beginning with ''Uncle Roger'' in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo.info/rolodex/malloy.judy.html|title=Judy Malloy|date=February 25, 2005|work=Leonardo Online|publisher=The International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malloy has composed works in both [[new media]] literature and [[hypertext fiction]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Born in Boston a month after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Malloy was raised in Massachusetts. Her mother was a journalist and newspaper editor, and her father, a [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] veteran, worked as an assistant district attorney in two Massachusetts counties and then as [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Chief Assistant US Attorney for Massachusetts]]. Malloy skied and played tennis, summering in New Hampshire, [[Cape Cod]], and the [[Berkshires]]. Malloy felt an early calling to the visual arts and began painting and sketching as a child.

===Career===
After graduating from [[Middlebury College]] with a degree in literature and work in [[studio art]] and [[art history]], Malloy took a job at the [[Library of Congress]]; she also traveled in Europe.&lt;ref name="MalloyBio"&gt;[http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/mybio.html#mylife Judy Malloy website. ''My Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years, while writing and making art, Malloy worked as a technical information specialist at the [[NASA]] contractor [[Ball Corporation|Ball Brothers Research Corporation]], running their technical library and learning [[FORTRAN]] programming in order to identify relevant content for research.&lt;ref name="MalloyBio"/&gt;  Malloy moved to the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] in the mid 1970s and lived in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] where, in addition to installations and performances, she developed a series of artist's books that incorporated non-sequential narratives driven by words and images.&lt;ref name="MalloyBio"/&gt;

Her papers are currently being collected by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/malloyjudy/|title=Guide to the Judy Malloy Papers, 1956-2010|website=David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online==
In 1986, Malloy wrote and programmed ''Uncle Roger'', the first online [[Hypertext fiction|hyperfiction]] project with links that took the narrative in different directions depending on the reader's choice. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' mentioned ''Uncle Roger'' as the start of a future art form in their 1989 centennial publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Miller | first =Michael W. | year =1989 | title =A Brave New World: Streams of 1s and 0s | periodical =Wall Street Journal | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uncle Roger'' was a three-part hypertextual "narrabase" (narrative database) that used keyword searching (including Boolean operators) and appeared on Art Com Electronic Network on the WELL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastgate.com/people/Malloy.html|title=Judy Malloy|work=People|publisher=Eastgate Systems|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Malloy became the coordinating editor of FineArt Forum, under the [[Leonardo/ISAST|Leonardo]] publishing umbrella, and developed F.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;T. (Fine Art Science and Technology), a resource on the [[The WELL|Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (The WELL)]] bulletin board.&lt;ref name=LEA&gt;Leonardo on-line. About LEA: History. [http://leoalmanac.org/about/history.asp ''Leonardo Electronic Almanac'' (LEA)], Retrieved on May 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Malloy was the initial editor of ''Leonardo Electronic News'', 1991–1993, now ''[[Leonardo Electronic Almanac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Art California''. [http://www.artcalifornia.net/about_calart.html ''About'']. Retrieved on May 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For Leonardo, she worked to make the work of new media artists more visible, creating the artists' "Words on Works" (WOW) Project, published in ''Leonardo Electronic News'' and ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]''.

Malloy's hyperfiction work ''[http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Penelope.html its name was Penelope]'' was exhibited in 1989 at the Richmond Art Center and published in 1993 by [[Eastgate Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Penelope.html|title=its Name Was Penelope|website=www.eastgate.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1993, Malloy was invited to [[PARC (company)|XEROX PARC]] as an artist-in-residence, where she developed ''Brown House Kitchen'', an online narrative written in [[LambdaMOO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/moopap.html Judy Malloy. ''Public Literature: Narratives and Narrative Structures in Lambda MOO'']&lt;/ref&gt; Malloy then wrote ''l0ve0ne'', published in 1994 by Eastgate Web Workshop as their first work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastgate.com/malloy/ Eastgate.

Between 1993 and 1996, while working with PARC, Malloy and [[Cathy Marshall (hypertext developer)]] collaborated on "Closure Was Never a Goal in this Piece", an article published in the book ''Wired Women'' which documented their experiences working on their other project, ''[[Forward Anywhere]]: Notes on an Exchange between Intersecting Lives'', a hypernarrative work based on electronic communication that passed between the two in which they sought "to exchange the remembered and day-to-day substance of our lives".&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, 6 April 1997.

Malloy worked for Arts Wire, a program of the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] (NYFA) from its early origins in 1993. She began serving as editor of the online periodical ''Arts Wire Current'' in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artswire.org/current/1996/cur030596.html |title=Artswire.org.

Malloy is the editor of ''Women, Art &amp; Technology'' (MIT Press, 2003), a documentation of the central role of female artists in the development of new media.

'''Katharine Ellis Coman''' ({{Birth date |1857|11|23}} – {{death date |1915|01|11}}) was an American historian, economist, sociologist, educator, and social activist. Coman worked at [[Wellesley College]] for 35 years as an instructor, professor, and dean.  Believing that the discipline of political economy could be harnessed to solve the pressing social problems of the day, Coman created new courses in the discipline. She specialized in research and teaching about the development of the [[American West]], and British and American industrialism. In her work, she criticized [[capitalism]] and was supportive of the [[labor movement]]. She was the only woman co-founder of the American Economics Association, the author of the first important history of industry in the US, and the first female statistics professor in America. Throughout her life, she traveled widely to conduct her economics research. A social activist, Coman supported the [[settlement movement]] and the [[labor movement]]. She shared a home with poet [[Katharine Lee Bates]] for 25 years, and the two women often traveled together. Coman died of breast cancer in 1915. Wellesley College created the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History in her honor.

== Early life ==
Coman was born on November 23, 1857, to Martha Ann Seymour Coman (1826–1911) and Levi Parsons Coman (1826–1889) in [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/naming-project/people/coman/|title=Katharine Coman |website=sites.lsa.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Norley, Katharine.

Thoemmes Continuum: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her birth, Coman's father reportedly said that he would show educators how a girl should be educated.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4569/Coman-Katharine-1857-1915.html|title=Coman, Katharine (1857–1915) – Economic History|last=|first=|date=|website=encyclopedia.jrank.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had graduated from an Ohio [[female seminary]], and her father had been educated at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], and thus Coman's received much of her early education at home. She attended the [[University of Michigan]] for two years, left college to teach in [[Ottawa, Illinois]] for two years, and then returned to university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; She earned the Bachelor of Philosophy (PhB) degree in 1880, one of only a handful of women to do so.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=Gerald F. |title=Katharine Coman: America's First Woman Institutional Economist and a Champion of Education for Citizenship |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |date=2016 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=989–1002 |doi=10.1080/00213624.2004.11506753}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was heavily influenced by the work of [[John Stuart Mill]], which is evident in her later work as economist and historian.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Coman attended lectures about socialism while traveling in London.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{Rp|111}} Later in her career, she became influenced by [[Alfred Marshall]] (1890), [[Francis Amasa Walker]] (1883), and [[social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While at the University of Michigan, Coman studied under Professors [[Charles Kendall Adams]] of the [[German Historical School]]; [[James Burrill Angell]], then president of the university; and [[Henry Carter Adams]], a renowned [[statistician]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After graduating with her PhB, she joined the faculty at Wellesley College, a newly established private college for women.

== Wellesley College ==
[[File:Wellesley College 1881.JPG|alt=An etching of Wellesley College circa 1881.|thumb|Etching of Wellesley College circa 1881]]
Coman was recruited to Wellesley College by [[Alice Freeman Palmer|Alice Freeman]], Wellesley's president, whose goal was to attract idealistic women faculty members to teach young women how to rebuild American society after the economic and social ravages of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ponder, Melinda M. (2017). ''From Sea to Shining Sea: Katharine Lee Bates''. Chicago, IL: Windy City Press. {{ISBN|9781941478486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting her talent for teaching, the president of the University of Michigan, James Burrill Angell, recommended Coman.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She first taught English rhetoric,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and in 1881 became an instructor in history.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Bates, Katharine Lee. (1922). ''Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance.'' New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, she was promoted to full professor of history.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because Coman believed that economics could address social problems, she urged the Wellesley College administration to offer courses in economics, and in 1883, she taught Wellesley's first [[political economy]] class.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To teach students about the practicality of applying economic theory to real world economic and social problems, Coman escorted her students on field trips to Boston's tenement houses, labor union meetings, factories, and sweatshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newarkadvocate.newspapers.com/image/35997882/?terms=Katharine%2BComan|title=Learning to be statesmen|last=|first=|date=5 October 1893|work=The Newark Daily Advocate|access-date=2 September 2018|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, at the age of 28, she became professor of history and economics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; That same year, she turned down the offer of a position as dean of women at the University of Michigan, stating that she preferred to remain at Wellesley and continue teaching.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She was acting dean of Wellesley College from 1899 to 1900; during that period she established a new department of economics&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and sociology, becoming its head in 1900.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She retired from full-time teaching at Wellesley in 1913,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/05/04/100617439.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=93|title=Farewell dinner to Miss Coman|last=|first=|date=4 May 1913|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 September 2018|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming [[professor emeritus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1913/03/30/archives/new-wellesley-dean-miss-alice-vinton-walte-chosen-by-the-board-of.html|title=New Wellesley dean|last=|first=|date=30 March 1913|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 September 2018|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the farewell dinner held in her honor, the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Miss Coman has been so closely associated with the history and development of Wellesley for so long a time that her loss is felt very deeply by the whole college."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Coman continued to research and write until her death in 1915.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

She developed and taught new courses in economics, history, and rhetoric at Wellesley, including Statistical Study of Economic Problems, Industrial History of the United States, and Conservation of Our Natural Resources, all framed by sociological insights related to [[social justice]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Coman was the first American woman to teach statistics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Paul J.|date=1955|title=The Early Teaching of Statistics in American Colleges and Universities|jstor=2685503|journal=The American Statistician|volume=9|issue=5|pages=12–18|doi=10.2307/2685503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wellesley was the only American women's college to offer statistics courses before 1900.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to historian Melinda Ponder, Coman was a popular teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|66}} Two of her students, Helen Frances Page Bates and Helen Laura Sumner Woodbury, were among the first American women to earn PhDs in economics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|994}} Woodbury is recognized as an important historian of labor and a noted economist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Laura-Sumner-Woodbury|title=Helen Laura Sumner Woodbury {{!}} American economist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Helen Bates became a noted social worker.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Coman's papers are held by the Wellesley College Archives.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Wellesley College Archives|url=https://www.wellesley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/departments/libraryandtechnology/files/archives/3p_coman_katharine.pdf|title=Katharine Coman papers|date=August 31, 2017| access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Wellesley College established the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History to honor her service to the College.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|1001}}

== Notable works ==
Coman and Elizabeth Kendall coauthored the 1902 book ''A Short History of England for School Use'' based on research that Coman had conducted in England between the years 1886 and 1894. Coman published ''The Industrial History of the United States''&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; in 1910. Considered the first industrial history of the United States,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; the book was reprinted nine times before 1915.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Her 1911 article, "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation," was the first article published in the newly formed journal''[[American Economic Review]].''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

Her 1912 work ''Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi''&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{Rp|xi}} was considered by contemporaneous scholars to be Coman's ''[[magnum opus]],''&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;{{Rp|166}}{{efn|According to [[Katharine Lee Bates]], the book "best expresses [Coman's] vigorous and adventurous personality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{Rp|xi}}}} and "one of the most important fruits of the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/11/17/issue.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article|title=Two notable books published recently by members of faculty|last=|first=|date=17 November 1912|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 September 2018|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book outlined the economic history of the [[American West]].{{efn|It included chapters on the [[Spanish exploration of the Pacific Northwest|early Spanish explorers]], [[Spanish missions in California]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico|Santa Fe trade]], the [[Russian exploration of the Pacific Northwest]], the beaver fur trade, the [[Mexican–American War]] and subsequent [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of what became the [[American Southwest]], the [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon migration]] to [[Utah]], early explorers of the West, and the creation of the states of [[Kansas]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;}} In this work, Coman describes the historical economic processes that led to the Far West coming under the control of [[settlers]]. She found that settlers were more economically successful than [[Exploration of North America|explorers]], [[North American fur trade|traders]], trappers, and [[North American Indians|indigenous peoples]] because the settlers built permanent settlements, reproduced at a higher rate, and established [[social networks|networks of collaboration]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|354}}

Settlement movement activist [[Jane Addams]], a close friend, urged Coman to research social insurance programs in Europe in order to establish similar programs in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Coman studied social insurance in England, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden, but poor health prevented her from continuing her research.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Her manuscript, "Unemployment Insurance: A Summary of European Systems" was published after her death in 1915.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{efn|Coman's notes from the study of old age pensions and unemployment social insurance in Europe are housed at Wellesley in the Katharine Coman Papers Collection.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;}}

== Social activism ==
Coman was passionate about social and economic issues,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; especially women's education, poverty, immigration, and labor.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Throughout her life, she was active in social reform movements, especially the labor movement and the settlement movement.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She served as the president of the electoral board and chair of the standing committee of the [[National College Settlements Association]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Coman organized a group of immigrant women who worked in Boston sweatshops,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;{{Rp|166}} naming the group an "Evening Club for Tailoresses,"&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and attempted to found a tailor shop that could have been an alternative to sweatshops.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; She assisted in organizing the [[1910 Chicago garment workers' strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/immstrike/doclist.htm|title=The 1910 Chicago Garment Workers' Strike, Document List|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involved 40,000 factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-06-12/features/8801070825_1_strike-spread-shops-immigrant-workers|title=The Strike That Shook Up An Entire Industry|last=Sawyers|first=June|date=June 12, 1988|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coman also worked with the [[Women's Trade Union League]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;{{Rp|166}} Working with her economist and sociologist friend [[Emily Greene Balch]] and other women, Coman co-founded Denison House,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;{{Rp|166}}&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; a college women's [[settlement house]] located in Boston in 1892, serving as its first chair. Denison House provided a center for Boston's labor activists,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and is thought to be the first settlement house on the East Coast.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Katherine Lee Bates.jpg|alt=a middle aged woman wearing glasses|thumb|[[Katharine Lee Bates]], author of the words to "[[America the Beautiful]]"]]

For 25 years, Coman lived in a "[[Boston marriage]]"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Faderman, Lillian. (1999). ''To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done for America--A History.'' Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. {{ISBN|039585010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|192}} with Wellesley professor and poet [[Katharine Lee Bates]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;D'Emilio, John, and Estelle Freedman.

Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|9780226923802}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|190}} the author of "[[America the Beautiful]]". Such partnerships were so common among Wellesley faculty that they were called "Wellesley marriages".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;{{Rp|185; 191–2}} Coman and Bates shared a house they named "the Scarab" with Bates' mother, Cornelia, and her sister, Jeannie.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{Rp|153}} The women reportedly enjoyed life together as family.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Burgess, Dorothy. (1952). ''Dream and Deed: The Story of Katharine Lee Bates.'' Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|176}} Coman frequently traveled for her research on economic history;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; she visited Europe, the American West, Scandinavia, and Egypt. Bates accompanied her on many of these trips.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some scholars believe the two women were a lesbian couple.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;{{Rp|196}}{{efn|Writing in 1952, Burgess wrote that Coman was Bates' "dearest companion of her life."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{Rp|209}}}}

== Breast cancer and death ==
Coman first discovered a lump in her left breast in the fall of 1911 and underwent two surgeries in the following months. At the time, medical doctors did not understand the nature of breast cancer, its causes or its treatments, so the prognosis for Coman was poor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leopold|first=Ellen|date=|year=2006|title=My soul is among lions: Katharine Lee Bates' account of the illness and death of Katharine Coman|url=|journal=[[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=60–73|doi=10.1353/leg.2006.0008|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coman died at home in January 1915 at the age of 58.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|62}} She died in a room the family had named Bohemia, as it looked out over the trees and gardens below.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{Rp|176}} At the time of her death, Coman was working on an industrial history of New England.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|1001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/01/12/105034927.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=9|title=Woman historian dead|last=|first=|date=12 January 1915|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 September 2018|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Coman's illness, Coman and Bates' women friends—many of them also in Wellesley marriages—took Coman out for walks and visits, and invited her to stay at their country homes. They prepared meals for Coman and Bates, brought flowers and fresh vegetables, and performed tasks and services to keep Coman's spirits up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bates chronicled Coman's illness in her diary, noting hospital visits, surgical procedures, and details about Coman's pain and suffering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to cancer historian Ellen Leopold, in the days after Coman's death, Bates wrote a memorial to Coman that was designed to be circulated privately among the women's close friends and family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|61}}&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Katharine Lee |title=For Katharine Coman's Family and Innermost Circle of Friends.

Your beautiful and tranquil sepulture?&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{Rp|41}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}} The book's title emerged from the fact that the "two Katharines," as the women were known, would send each other sprigs of yellow clover as tokens of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/250340881|title=Life of song's author reveals a profile in literary courage|last=Watson|first=Catherine|date=15 December 2002|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2 September 2018|page=G7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Coman's book ''Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi'' (1912) in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated that "the author is one of those new women who have shown what may be accomplished in the way of research by method and industry and a great deal of enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/27421244|title=Beginnings of Far West: An Elaborate Work in Two Volumes by Katharine Coman|last=|first=|date=10 November 1912|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2 September 2018|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1913 review of her book, economist [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] praises Coman's narrative style and lively prose.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carver |first1=T. N. |title=Review of ''Economic Beginnings of the Far West.

Paxson does credit Coman with having prepared an extensive bibliography and for providing extensive notes for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Paxson, Frederic L. (1913). Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land beyond the Mississippi [by] Katharine Coman. ''The American Historical Review''. 4, 821. {{ISSN|0002-8762}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This two-volume book, is today hailed as a classic&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and was reprinted twice; Macmillan in 1925, and Kelly in 1969.

In 2011, the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' commemorated its first hundred years by publishing a list of the top twenty articles in the journal's history. Coman's 1911 article "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation," published in 1911, was the first article published by the journal&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Libecap |first1=Gary D |title=Institutional Path Dependence in Climate Adaptation: Coman's "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation" |journal=American Economic Review |date=2011 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=64–80 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.1.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted in the 2011 issue. The article analyzed [[Water resources law|water rights]], access, and availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arrow |first1=Kenneth J |last2=Bernheim |first2=B.

Libecap noted that Coman's work continues to be relevant today, particularly for scholars interested in the economics of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American political economist, believes that Coman's article continues to provide "insight into the problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1=Elinor |title=Reflections on "Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation" |journal=American Economic Review |date=2011 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=49–63 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|49}}

Gerald F. Vaughn, a contemporary economist writing in 2004, proposes that Coman was America's first female [[Institutional economics|institutional economist]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Vaughn notes other important facts about Coman that frame her as a pioneer for women academics, including the fact that at the time, the discipline and profession of economics was dominated by men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|989}} She was the only woman among the group of economists who founded the [[American Economic Association]] in 1885&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and she was the first American woman to become a statistics professor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Vaughn notes that her contributions to economics and social history went beyond being the "first woman," and included being the author of the first article to be published in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' in 1911, and the writer of the first industrial history of the US.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|989}} The University of Michigan "Naming Project" notes that she was one of the first historians to use local newspaper articles and government documents as [[primary source]]s in her teaching and writing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Vaughn highlights the fact that she traveled and interviewed widely to gather the data for her work.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to Vaughn, Coman's extensive work on the processes of institutional change in the American West made her an influential industrial historian.  Her text, ''The Industrial History of the United States''  (1905; revised 1910; republished by Arno Press 1973) was widely used as a textbook for decades.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6215">'''Katherine "Katy" Lederer''' is an American poet and author of the memoir ''Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers''.

==Early life and education==
Lederer is the daughter of bestselling non-fiction author [[Richard Lederer]] and Rhoda (née Spangenberg) Lederer. Her father was [[American Jews|Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Px1Ruu-62jIC&amp;pg=PA88 Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers by Katy Lederer] p.88 | ''"Our grandmother had objected to our mother marrying a Jew"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishJournal&gt;[http://sdjewishjournal.com/site/725/hungry-for-words/ San Diego Jewish Journal: "Hungry for Words" by Karen Pearlman] June 2010 | ''"His children were not raised Jewish, as Lederer’s first wife was not Jewish, nor is van Egeren"''&lt;/ref&gt; while her mother was a [[gentile]].&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt; She was not raised Jewish.&lt;ref name="JewishJournal"/&gt;
Her siblings are world-class poker players [[Howard Lederer]] and [[Annie Duke]].&lt;ref name = "Matt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.identitytheory.com/interviews/lederer_interview.php|title=Katy Lederer|last=Borondy|first=Matt|date=12 Feb 2005|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She graduated from [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]], where her father was on the English faculty.&lt;ref name = "Matt" /&gt;

Lederer later attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]], from which she received her BA in English and anthropology. After graduating in 1995, Lederer moved to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] to study poker with her siblings, and was subsequently accepted to the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] on an Iowa Arts Fellowship. While at Iowa, Lederer founded the [[zine]] ''Explosive'', which was published in a limited edition of 300 with hand-printed covers by the artist and writer David Larsen. The tenth and final issue of ''Explosive'' was published in 2006.

==Career==
After completing her studies at Iowa in 1998, Lederer moved to [[New York City]], where she worked for psychoanalyst [[Arnold Cooper]]. After this, she worked as a coordinator of the Barnard New Women Poets program. From 1998-1999, she was the editor of the Poetry Project Newsletter out of the Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church in the [[Bowery]]. Lederer continues to publish limited-edition books and chapbooks under the Spectacular Books imprint, and also serves as a Poetry Editor of [[Fence magazine]]. In 1999, she signed a contract with [[Crown Books]] to write a memoir about her family’s life in gambling, Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers.

Lederer made her poetry debut in 2002 with the collection ''Winter Sex''. Poet [[D. A. Powell]] described the poems in the collection “as leaps of faith, fibrillating in the dark world with a kinetic energy that rises out of erotic desire.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklyngardenparty.com/winter-sex|title=Winter Sex|publisher=Brooklyngardenparty.com|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her memoir, ''Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers'' was published in 2003. It was chosen as a [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Discover Great New Writers selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=9780609608982|title=Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers Synopsis|publisher=Barnes and Noble|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named a Best Nonfiction Book of the Year by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and one of eight Best Books of the Year by ''[[Esquire Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandpattern.org/poems/katy_lederer01.shtml|title=Katy Lederer|publisher=Woodland Pattern|accessdate=9 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129222132/http://woodlandpattern.org/poems/katy_lederer01.shtml|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2008, Lederer worked at a quantitative hedge fund in midtown Manhattan, which provided much of the inspiration for the pieces in her most recent poetry collection, ''The Heaven-Sent Leaf''. The title of both the book and the opening poem is taken from the second half of Goethe’s [[Faust]] and describes paper money. Other poems in the collection reference the works of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]],  [[Nietzsche]], and [[Edith Wharton]].

'''Lan Samantha Chang''' (張嵐; [[pinyin]]: Zhāng Lán), born 1965, is an American [[novelist|writer of novels]] and [[short story|short stories]]. She is Professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]] and Director of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].

== Life and career ==
Samantha Chang was born in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], the daughter of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] parents who survived the [[World War II]] [[Japanese occupation of China]] and later emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name="BIRNBAUM"/&gt; Chang has received fellowships from [[Stanford University]] (the [[Stegner Fellowship]]) and [[Princeton University]]. She served as the Briggs-Copeland Lecturer of Creative Writing at [[Harvard University]]. Chang received an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] in Creative Writing from the [[University of Iowa]], an [[Master of Public Administration|M.P.A.]] from Harvard University, and a BA in East Asian Studies from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="PENGUIN"&gt;[http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/hunger.html Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328195543/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/hunger.html |date=March 28, 2007 }} – Penguin Publishing website
&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale, she served as managing editor of the [[Yale Daily News]], and at Harvard, she received a fellowship from the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].

Chang is a Professor of English at the University of Iowa and the Director of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] — the first female, and the first Asian American, to hold that position.  She also teaches in the [[Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers]].  In 2008 she received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and in the fall of 2015 she accepted a fellowship at the [[American Library in Paris]].

The five stories in ''Hunger'' (1998) deal mainly with the position of [[Chinese American|Chinese in America]], though the last of them is set in pre-Communist Shanghai.  ''Inheritance'' (2004) is the story of a wealthy but declining family in [[Republican China]], beginning in 1925 and extending through the period of the Japanese invasion and the post-war flight to [[Taiwan]] and then the United States. Chang received the 2005 [[PEN/Beyond Margins Award]] for ''Inheritance''. Her essay "The Perfect Gift" appears in the anthology ''Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting'', published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] in November 2013.

'''Louise Southgate''' (February 20, 1857 – August 14, 1941)&lt;ref name="Kenton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southgate, Louise (Dr.) |url=http://www.kentonlibrary.org/2013/southgate-louise-dr|website=Kenton County Public Library|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first women physicians in Northern Kentucky where she advocated for girls in the juvenile court system and was an early proponent of [[birth control]]. Besides her medical practice and outreach, she led many efforts for the American [[women's suffrage]] movement through her local clubs and the [[Kentucky Equal Rights Association]].

==Early life==
The eldest of the eight living children of Bernard and Eleanor Flemming Southgate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Eleanor Flemming (1833-1871) |url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Flemming-196 | website=WikiTree | accessdate=11 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Southgate was born February 20, 1857, in [[Walton, Kentucky]]. She was educated at Western College in [[Oxford, Ohio]], then graduated with a medical degree from Laura Memorial College in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Leonard|editor1-first=John William|title=Woman's Who's Who of America: A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporary Women of the United States and Canada, Volume 1|date=1914|publisher=The American Commonwealth Co.|location=New York|page=767|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COsLAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA767&amp;dq=Louise%20Southgate&amp;pg=PA767#v=snippet&amp;q=southgate&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016|chapter=Southgate, Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then spent two years studying in hospitals in New York and Europe, traveling as far as to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France for advanced work.&lt;ref name="Suite"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Linda Vaccariello | title=Suite Dreams | journal=Cincinnati Magazine | date = April 1993 | issue = 26 | page = 58 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=fx4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=louise+southgate+kentucky#v=onepage&amp;q=louise%20southgate%20kentucky&amp;f=false | accessdate= 11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her younger sister Virginia and never married.

==Professional career==
Dr. Southgate started practicing medicine at the Presbyterian Hospital in Cincinnati in 1893 and also taught at the Laura Memorial College in 1894. She then left for Europe where she practiced medicine for two years. Returning to the U.S. she took up as a clinician again at the Presbyterian Hospital and to the Laura Memorial College where she taught surgical pathology in 1897.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt; She became a member of the [[American Medical Association]], Cincinnati chapter. In 1910 she purchased her maternal grandmother's ancestral home, (the old Thomas Kennedy Home at 124 Garrard Street) and used it also for her private practice.&lt;ref name="Kenton" /&gt; Later, she also worked at the Booth Memorial Hospital as well as its auxiliary.&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | entry= Southgate, Louise | title = The Encyclopedia of Northern Kentucky | editor1 = Paul A. Tenkotte | editor2 = James C. Claypool | publisher = University Press of Kentucky | place = Lexington, Kentucky | date = 2015 | page = 843}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote scholarly articles, including for the State Medical Journal of Kentucky.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

===Community medicine outreach===
Dr. Southgate was part of the growing movement in women's reproductive health and family planning of the time. She spoke on hygiene ("Care of the Growing Girl"), birth control and eugenics ("Sociological Status of Women"), connecting this with women's rights (e.g., "Women's Duties in Civil Affairs") for women's clubs, Mothers' meetings, as well as for the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]].&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt; Her work with schools and local clinics helped start the requirements for physical examinations for schoolchildren in Covington.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

In 1905, Dr. Southgate spent some time at the [[Hindman Settlement School]] in Knott County, eastern Kentucky, where she taught classes and practiced medicine.&lt;ref name="Kenton" /&gt; She was advocating for women's health concerns there long before the more famous [[Mary Carson Breckinridge]] of the [[Frontier Nursing Service]] or Jean Tachau&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=CcceBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA866&amp;dq=appalachia%20kentucky%20birth%20control&amp;pg=PA866#v=onepage&amp;q=tachau&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; worked in this area.

===Women's clubs and suffrage organizations===
Her work with women's clubs and suffrage organizations was extensive. A partial list of her memberships follows:
* Emergency Association of Covington, president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Official Register and Directory of Women's Clubs in America | first = Helen M. | last = Winslow| publisher = J.B. Pond Lyceum Bureau | place = New York | volume = XXI | date = 1919 | page = 129 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pX0fAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=louise+southgate+kentucky#v=onepage&amp;q=louise%20southgate&amp;f=false |accessdate = 11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* General Federation of Women's Clubs
* Kentucky Equal Rights Association, served as KERA press superintendent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Lynn E. | last = niedermeier | title = Eliza Calvert Hall: Kentucky Author and Suffragist | publisher = University Press of Kentucky | place = Lexington | date = 2015 | page = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and State Historian
* Kentucky State Federation of Women's Clubs
* National Equal Rights Association
* Ohio State Federation of Women's Clubs
* Woman's Club of Cincinnati

In 1910 she spoke at the 21st [[Kentucky Equal Rights Association]] (KERA) state convention in Covington on the "Sisterhood of Women." She offered a resolution at that meeting that the KERA "extend cordial greetings to the Ky. State Federations of Colored Women's Clubs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reports of the Twenty-First and Twenty-Second Annual Meetings of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association Held at Covington, November 14-15-16, 1910 and Louisville, October 25, 1911. | place = Newport | publisher = The Newport Printing Co. | pages = 6–7 | url = https://archive.org/stream/minutesofannualc7913kent#page/6/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Southgate's influence was revealed in that it was also resolved at that convention that KERA formally requested that the State Board of Charitable Institutions appoint a woman physician at the state asylum for the Insane at Hopkinsville and that each local chapter would begin lobbying for establishing a juvenile court if there wasn't one already in that county.

In 1912 she spoke for suffrage in Cincinnati during the campaign for a suffrage amendment of the Ohio Constitution.&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt;

==Hobbies==
Dr. Southgate was an avid Egyptologist and collected many artifacts that decorated her historic home in Covington (now known as the Kennedy-Southgate House).&lt;ref name="Suite" /&gt;

==Death==
After her sister Virginia died in September 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Virginia Southgate | website = WikiTree | url = https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Southgate-80 | accessdate = 11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Southgate retired from medical practice. After a long illness and at 84 years old, she died on August 14, 1941, at the home of her sister Eleanor Green in Walton, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; She was buried in Linden Grove Cemetery in Covington.&lt;ref&gt;https://networks.h-net.org/dr-louise-southgate&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Luke Hospitals named their Women's Center after her in 1990; and her legacy was honored by an entry in the [[Kentucky Women Remembered]] collection by the Kentucky Commission on Women in 2000.

==Biography==
Marianella Machado was born in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], and studied at the Conservatorio de Musica [[Jose Angel Lamas]]. She later continued her studies in composition with William Banch, and in 1981 she attended [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] on a Venezuenlan government scholarship, graduating with bachelor's and master's degrees in composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The new Grove dictionary of music and musicians|volume=15|editor=Tyrrell, John|author=Téllez, Carmen Helena|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchado returned to Venezuela, where she began work as a music teacher and composer. From 1987-88 she was a research assistant at the [[Rómulo Gallegos Center for Latin American Studies]] in Caracas. From 1989-93 she attended the [[University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music]], working as a teaching assistant, and graduated with a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in 1993.&lt;ref name="composers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.composersforum.org/members/directory/marianella-machado |title=Marianella Machado Biography |publisher=[[American Composers' Forum]] |accessdate=February 8, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark F. Jarman'''  (born 1952 in [[Mount Sterling, Kentucky]]) is an American poet and critic often identified with the New Narrative branch of the [[New Formalism]]; he was co-editor with Robert McDowell of ''[[The Reaper (magazine)|The Reaper]]'' throughout the 1980s.  Centennial Professor of English at [[Vanderbilt University]], he is the author of eleven books of poetry, two books of essays, and a book of essays co-authored with Robert McDowell.  He co-edited the anthology ''[[Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New Formalism]]'' with David Mason.

Jarman's awards for poetry include a Joseph Henry Jackson Award, three grants from the NEA, and a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.  His book ''The Black Riviera'' won the 1991 [[Poets' Prize]].  ''Questions for Ecclesiastes'' was a finalist for the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry and won the 1998 [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]] from the Academy of American Poets and ''The Nation'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/english/faculty/publications|title=English Department, faculty publications|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=2007-05-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521064606/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/english/faculty/publications|archivedate=2007-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Bone Fires: New and Selected Poems'' won the 2013 [[Balcones Prize]].

==Biography==
Mark Jarman was born while his father, Donald R. Jarman, was in seminary in Lexington, Kentucky. His parents, both Californians, moved back to California in 1954 and settled in Santa Maria, where his father served First Christian Church.  In 1958, responding to a call from his denomination, Mark's father moved his wife Bo Dee, his son, and daughter Katie, to Scotland to serve a small church in [[Kirkcaldy, Fife]], a linoleum factory town on the Firth of Forth across from [[Edinburgh]].  The three years he spent there were formative ones for the poet.  The family returned to California in 1961, where his father served South Bay Christian Church in Redondo Beach and his sister Luanne was born.  In 1970, Jarman entered the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] and earned a B.A. with highest honors in English literature in 1974.  There he met his wife, soprano Amy Kane Jarman&lt;ref&gt;http://blair.vanderbilt.edu/bio/amy-jarman&lt;/ref&gt; and his friend and long-time collaborator, Robert McDowell.  While at U.C.S.C., he studied with the poet and editor [[George Hitchcock (poet)]] and the short story writer and poet [[Raymond Carver]].    In 1974, Jarman entered the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] and earned an M.F.A. in poetry in 1976. At Iowa he studied with [[Donald Justice]], [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], [[Stanley Plumly]], and [[Sandra McPherson]].  His classmates included poets [[Chase Twichell]], [[Brenda Hillman]], [[James Galvin (poet)|James Galvin]], and [[Rita Dove]].  In 1976, he was hired to teach creative writing at [[University of Southern Indiana|Indiana State University]] in Evansville.  In 1978, a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] allowed him to quit his job and live in Italy where Amy studied singing at the [[University of Perugia]].  Returning to California in 1979, he was hired as a visiting writer at the [[University of California at Irvine]].  Mark and Amy's oldest daughter was born in Mission Viejo in 1980.  That same year, Jarman took a position teaching creative writing at [[Murray State University]] in Kentucky.  Two years later the couple's second daughter was born in Murray.  In 1983, he left Murray State to teach at [[Vanderbilt University]], where he has been since.  Amy joined the voice faculty at the [[Blair School of Music]] in 1986.  Since 2007, Jarman has been Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt and was Director of Creative Writing until 2013.

Jarman's early poetry reflects the influence of living by the Pacific and the North Sea at important times in his life, along with growing up in a strongly religious family.  As he has matured, his poetry has remained invested in family experience, a sense of place, and the presence of God in everyday life.  Though he is associated with the [[New Formalism]], his poetry has always ranged widely in form and style, from narrative to lyric, free to metrical verse, verse to prose poetry.

A '''Master of Science degree in engineering''' (abbreviated '''MSE''', '''M.Sc.Eng.''' or '''MScEng''') is a type of [[Master of Science degree]] awarded by [[universities]] in many countries. It is an [[academic degree]] to be differentiated from a [[Master of Engineering degree]].

A Master of Science degree in engineering can require completion of a [[thesis]] and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] (often abbreviated Ph.D. or D.Phil) in engineering while a [[Master of Engineering]] degree can require completion of a project rather than [[thesis]] and usually does not qualify its holder to apply for a [[Ph.D]] or [[D.Phil]] in engineering. The Master of Science in engineering is considered equivalent to [[diplom]] degree in engineering in the countries that haven't a specific distinction between M.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng.

Equivalent degrees are:

* Dipl. ing. (''[[Diplôme d'ingénieur]]'') before name, France;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Austria;
* Dipl.-Ing. (''Diplom-Ingenieur'') before name, Germany &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Phased out due to [[Bologna process]]; not to be confused with Dipl.-Ing. degrees with additions such as "FH", "DA" or "DH" which are considered as Bachelor's degrees)&lt;/small&gt;;
* Ir (''burgerlijk ingenieur'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, The Netherlands/Belgium (NL);
* Ir (''Ingénieur Civil'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]) before name, Belgium (FR);
* Civ.ing. (''Civilingenjör'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Sweden;
* Cand.polyt. (''Civilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Denmark;
* Siv.ing. (''sivilingeniør'', not to be confused with [[civil engineering]]), Norway;
* DI (''[[Diplomi-insinööri]]''), Finland;
* mgr inż. (''magister inżynier'') before name, Poland;
* okl. mérnök (''okleveles mérnök''), Hungary;
* Ing. (''Ingegnere'') before name, Italy;
* Ing. (''Inženýr'') before name, Czech Republic;
* Ing. (''Inžinier'') before name, Slovakia;
* Yük. Müh. (''Yüksek Mühendis'') before name, Turkey.

'''Michigan Technological University''' ('''Michigan Tech''', '''MTU''', or simply '''Tech''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Houghton, Michigan]]. Its main campus sits on {{convert|925|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} on a bluff overlooking [[Keweenaw Waterway|Portage Lake]]. Michigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the first post-secondary institution in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] and was created to train mining engineers to operate the [[Copper mining in Michigan|local copper mines]]. Science, technology, forestry and business have been added to the numerous engineering disciplines, and Michigan Tech now offers more than 130&amp;nbsp;degree programs through its five colleges and schools.

Michigan Tech's athletic teams are nicknamed the [[Michigan Tech Huskies|Huskies]] and compete primarily in the [[NCAA Division II]] [[Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (GLIAC). The men's [[College ice hockey|hockey]] team competes in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] as a member of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA), and has won three national championships. The women's basketball team were national runners-up in 2011.

==History==
[[Image:Michigan Mining School 1895 advertisement.jpg|thumb|175px|1895 advertisement for the Michigan Mining School]]
Michigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the '''Michigan Mining School'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Technological University History |url=http://www.mtu.edu/mtuinfo/history.html |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024704/http://www.mtu.edu/mtuinfo/history.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much agitation by [[Jay Abel Hubbell]], the state legislature established the school to train mining engineers.  Hubbell donated land for the school's first buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Willis F. Dunbar and George S. May, ''Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdman's, 1995), 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school started with four faculty members and twenty-three students.  It was housed in the [[Houghton Fire Hall]] from 1886 through 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Houghton Fire Hall |url=http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/5884.htm |work=State Historic Preservation Office |publisher=Michigan State Housing Development Authority |accessdate=January 13, 2012 |author=Staff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617141027/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/5884.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after the school's creation, enrollment grew to such a point that its name no longer reflected its purpose. The name was then changed to the '''Michigan College of Mines''' in 1897.&lt;ref name=eckert&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The sandstone architecture of the Lake Superior region|last=Eckert|first=Kathryn Bishop|authorlink=|coauthors=|year=2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=|isbn=978-0-8143-2807-1|page=280|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b68xzUc0y3IC&amp;pg=PA280|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519182356/https://books.google.com/books?id=b68xzUc0y3IC&amp;pg=PA280|archivedate=May 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name lasted through World War I until 1925, but by this time the school had begun offering a wider variety of degrees and once again decided to change its name to the '''Michigan College of Mining and Technology''' in 1927.&lt;ref name=eckert/&gt;

By 1931 enrollment had reached nearly 600. During the next few years, due to the Great Depression, money was scarce, causing department heads and even the president of the university, [[William O. Hotchkiss|William Hotchkiss]], to take pay cuts.

Grover C. Dillman was president from 1935 to 1956. During this time, the school underwent many notable changes, including the construction of the Memorial Union Building and purchase of an ice rink and golf course.

Around 1948, enrollment passed 2000 students total.

In 1956, J. Robert Van Pelt became the new president of the university. He restarted many PhD programs and created a focus on research.  This included the school's first analog computation class in 1956–1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waltman|first=Gene L.|title=Black Magic and Gremlins: Analog Flight Simulations at NASA's Flight Research Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20010011952|work=NASA SP-2000-4520|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final years of his presidency, the school changed from a college to a university, changing its name a final time to ''Michigan Technological University''. The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons, according to Van Pelt. First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title. Also, including "mining" in the name of the college was misleading.&lt;ref name=MTU_History&gt;{{cite web | title = Michigan Technological University: A History | url = http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/urel/welcome/history.html | accessdate = 2010-03-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120305135105/http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/urel/welcome/history.html | archivedate = March 5, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Michigan Technological University" was chosen in order to retain the nickname "Michigan Tech" that had already been in use since 1927.

Although engineering still accounts for some 59 percent of all enrollment as of fall 2010, the university now offers more than 130 degree programs.

Along with its new name, the school also gained new constitutional status in 1964. This gave responsibility for control of the university to its Board of Control rather than the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;"Why a New Name and Constitutional Status for Michigan College of Mining and Technology" Vertical File: History- MTU-Name Change from MCMT to MTU.

The Portage Lake Golf Course opened for play in April 1902. In 1945 the members could no longer support the needs of the course and sold it to Michigan Tech for one dollar. Since then many improvements have been made such as the addition of another nine holes in 1969. Then in 1984 the new clubhouse was constructed. In 1996 a sprinkler system was installed to modernize the course and keep it playable. The Portage Lake Golf Course is located two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of campus.

===Student body===
The student body consists of more than 7,000 graduate and undergraduate students (Fall 2017)&lt;ref name=enrollment/&gt; and more than 470 academic faculty (Fall 2017).&lt;ref name="enrollment"/&gt; As is historically true of engineering institutions, female enrollment at Michigan Tech is low. The male to female student ratio was 22:1 in 1960; since 1980 it has remained around 3:1. Michigan Tech's admissions office has enlisted female students and faculty to contact every admitted female applicant via telephone or personal letter in an attempt to increase female enrollment. The Fall 2010 freshman class had a ratio of 3.1:1.&lt;ref name=enrollment/&gt; In the Fall 2012 semester,&lt;ref name=enrollment /&gt; female enrollment rose for the 6th straight year to reach a then all-time high of 1,837 students (26.1%).&lt;ref name="MTM"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goodrich, Marcia |date=Fall 2009 |title=Where the Boys Are |magazine=Michigan Tech Magazine |volume=46 |issue=2 |publisher=Michigan Technological University |location=Houghton, MI |url=http://www.mtu.edu/umc/services/pr-news/magazine/fall09/stories/where-the-boys-are/ |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60LQeQqHh?url=http://www.mtu.edu/umc/services/pr-news/magazine/fall09/stories/where-the-boys-are/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female enrollment for the 2017-2018 academic year is 27.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2017/september/tech-marks-fifth-straight-year-enrollment-increases.html|title=Tech Marks Fifth Straight Year of Enrollment Increases|work=Michigan Technological University|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan Tech students are primarily from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois. The student body is approximately 75.4% European-American/Non-Hispanic, 14.2% International, 1.6% Hispanic, 1.5% percent African American, 1.0% Asian, 0.6% Native American, 1.0% Multiracial, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and the remaining 4.5% was not supplied.&lt;ref name=enrollment/&gt; The university has recently focused on achieving a more diverse student body, in terms of ethnicity, gender, and areas of study. A key step in this effort was the recent introduction of several new [[academic major]]s, including psychology, biochemistry and molecular biology, [[cheminformatics]], communication and culture studies, pharmaceutical chemistry, exercise science, sound design, audio production, and theater and entertainment technology.

Students attending Michigan Technological University have a wide range of activities to participate in, whether or not they are living in the [[residence halls]]. In addition to the various small interest groups which form throughout the year, they participate in [[Greek Life]], Student Organizations, and the Enterprise Program; many organize and attend campus traditions, such as K-Day, the Parade of Nations, and the Winter Carnival (which also attracts alumni from across the country); furthermore, there are motivational drives to raise student activity levels and involvement in the school community, typically for those without membership in a student organization.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Michigan Tech Huskies}}
[[File:Hockey at Michigan Tech.jpg|alt=Michigan Tech hockey|thumb|300x300px|Michigan Tech hockey]]
As the school mascot is the [[husky]] (specifically, [[Blizzard T. Husky]]), the school's sports teams are known as the "Huskies". Michigan Tech competes in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] [[Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]]. The men's [[ice hockey|hockey]] team competes in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] as a member of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]. Michigan Tech owns a downhill [[skiing|ski]]/[[snowboarding|snowboard]] hill, [[Mont Ripley]], just across [[Keweenaw Waterway|Portage Lake]] from campus, and maintains extensive [[cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] trails (used for mountain biking in summer).

The men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA), and has won three national championships. The women's basketball team were national runners-up in 2014-2015 season.

====School songs====
Michigan Tech has both an official fight song and an official Alma Mater. At most sporting events, however, both the "[[Engineer's Song]]" and "[[In Heaven There Is No Beer]]" are played by the [[Huskies Pep Band]], and many students consider these to be the unofficial school songs. The "Blue Skirt Waltz" is played at home ice hockey games and is called the "Copper Country Anthem." During the song, the fans join arms and swing back and forth to the music.

===Special events===
* The first Friday of the fall term is K-Day (Keweenaw Day), a university-sponsored, half-day holiday hosted by Greek Life. It is primarily celebrated at nearby [[McLain State Park]]. Activities include a student organizations fair, games, swimming, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/student-activities/traditions/k-day/|title=K-Day|website=www.mtu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology'''|文部科学省|Monbu-kagaku-shō}}, also known as '''MEXT''', '''Monka-shō''', and formerly the {{Nihongo|'''Ministry of Education, Science and Culture'''|文部省|Monbu-shō}}, is one of the ministries of the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]].

The [[Meiji period|Meiji]] government created the first Ministry of Education in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, Edwin O. ''et al.'' (2005), ''The Japanese Today'',  p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese government centralises education, and it is managed by a state [[bureaucracy]] that regulates almost every aspect of the [[Education in Japan|education process]]. The School Education Law requires schools around the country to use textbooks that follow the [[curriculum guideline]] set by the ministry, although there are some exceptions.

In January 2001, the former ''Monbu-shō'' and the former {{nihongo|Science and Technology Agency|科学技術庁|Kagaku-gijutsu-chō}} merged to become the present MEXT.

MEXT is led by the [[Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]], who is a member of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] and is chosen by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]], typically from the members of the [[National Diet|Diet]].

MEXT is one of three ministries that run the [[JET Programme]]. It also offers the [[Monbukagakusho Scholarship]], also known as the MEXT or Monbu-shō scholarship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3189">[[Image:Muzimei.jpg|thumb|Muzi Mei]]
'''Muzi Mei''' ({{zh|c=木子美|p=Mùzǐ Měi}}; born 1978) is a journalist and blogger from [[Guangzhou]], China, who became an Internet celebrity in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-incredible-story-of-chinas-sexual-revolution-2012-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Her blog contained frank descriptions of her sexual encounters with various men, which is believed to be a first for China.

Her real name is '''Li Li''' (李麗 ''Lǐ Lì'') -- "Muzi" (木子) becomes "Li" (李) when the characters are arranged vertically, and "Mei" (美) and "Li" (麗) are synonyms (both mean "beautiful"). She studied in the Department of Philosophy in [[Sun Yat-sen University]] in Guangzhou, and graduated in 2001.

In 2003 she was the topic of heated discussion and controversy in print media, bulletin boards and Internet chatrooms across China, and was even mentioned in stories in the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[TIME]]'' (December 12, 2005, European edition. Vol. 166, No. 24, page 31)  and ''[[Washington Post]]'' and other international media. Her name was often mentioned together with [[Tang Jiali]], a dancer who was the first to publish a book of nude artistic photographs of herself.  This reflected a partial liberalization of restrictions on sexual material and nudity in Chinese publications beginning in 2003.

Portions of her blog have now been translated into [[French language|French]] and published as a book with the title ''Journal sexuel d'une jeune Chinoise sur le net'' ([[Éditions Albin Michel]], 2005, {{ISBN|2-226-15980-0}}). A German translation is published as ''Mein intimes Tagebuch'' ([[Aufbau-Verlag]], Jan. 2007, {{ISBN|3-7466-2306-5}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070330113414/http://www.aufbau-verlag.de/index.php4?page=28&amp;show=16550&amp;avsess=a2680aa70e293d098083eebcf0e1407c www.aufbau-verlag.de/index.php4?page=28&amp;show=16550&amp;avsess=a2680aa70e293d098083eebcf0e1407c]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muzi Mei was featured in an article in the December 12, 2005 issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' entitled "Sex, Please—We're Young and Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137697,00.html Sex and the Single Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bokee.com has hired her to promote the concept of [[blog]]ging. She has shifted to [[podcasting]]. "One recent podcast was an hour-long sound track of an amorous encounter, starting with 'Please come in' and finishing in climactic groans, panting and shrieking. It gets about 10,000 visits a day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/chinas-web-censors-struggle-to-muzzle-freespirited-bloggers/2005/12/22/1135032135897.html www.smh.com.au/news/technology/chinas-web-censors-struggle-to-muzzle-freespirited-bloggers/2005/12/22/1135032135897.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from the Jamaica School of Music, Kingston, she was invited to join the staff there, working as a teacher and Junior Choir director (1980–81), before returning to Dominica.&lt;ref name=Life /&gt; In 1981 she was appointed Cultural Officer in the Government of Dominica's Division of Culture, working in a senior position there until she retired in 2015.&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;Ian Jackson, [http://sundominica.com/articles/a-pearl-in-dominicas-culture-cultural-stalwart-pea-2317/ "A "Pearl" in Dominica's culture: cultural stalwart Pearle Christian"], ''The Sun'' (Dominica), 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly involved with choral music over the years, she was the founding member and manager of the National Chorale for two decades, and sings with the Dominica Folk Singers, as well as with her church choir, the St Alphonsus Folk Choir, since her teens. She is also a flute teacher, director of the Junior Choir at Kairi School of Music, Roseau, and the director of the acclaimed Sixth Form Sisserou Singers,&lt;ref name=Life /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/entertainment/sisserou-singers-another-amazing-production/ "Sisserou Singers: Another 'amazing' production"], Dominica News Online, 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leandra Lander, [http://wp-content/uploads/2014/01/January-Publication-0010.pdf "Sixth Form Sisserou Singers Humanitarian Tour 2013"], ''Our Catholic Community'', Volume 3, No. 3, January 2014, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/entertainment/sixth-form-sisserou-singers-celebrate-20-years/ "Sixth Form Sisserou Singers celebrate 20 years"], Dominica News Online, 11 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1994 as a collaborative project between the Division of Culture and the then Sixth Form College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repeatingislands.com/2012/08/07/dominica-golden-drum-2012-awards-recognizes-cultural-promoters/ "Dominica: Golden Drum 2012 Awards Recognizes Cultural Promoters"], ''Repeating Islands'', 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has composed and staged several children's musicals, and has trained scores of students at the Kairi School of Music, where for 17 years she was a principal tutor.&lt;ref name=Sun /&gt;
 
In 2000 she initiated the founding of the Dominica Association of Music Educators,&lt;ref name=Life /&gt; which is "committed to advocating for every Dominican child regardless of race, colour, creed or economic status, to have an opportunity to participate fully in the beauty of music not simply as a listener, but also as a creator and performer of the art form."&lt;ref&gt;Pearle Christian, [http://www.767news.dm/news-2/story_feature/music-matters-by-pearle-christian/ "Music Matters"], ''767 News'', 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 she earned a Master’s degree in Music Education (General Music) from the [[Texas State University|University of Texas]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Life /&gt;

On her retirement in 2015, she said that her greatest achievement through the medium of music, choral and instrumental, was that she had been able to provide a "platform for the holistic development of many young people from diverse backgrounds".&lt;ref name=Sun /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15077">'''Personalized learning''', '''individualized instruction''', '''personal learning environment''' and '''direct instruction''' all refer to efforts to tailor education to meet the different needs of students.

==History==
The use of the term "personalized learning" dates back to at least the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Sam |last2=Epstein |first2=Beryl |date=1961 |title=The First Book of Teaching Machines |location=Danbury, CT |publisher=Franklin Watts, Inc. |quote="Programs can only be designed by highly trained human beings who, through the teaching machine, can reach countless students and enable each to take an active role in a highly personalized learning environment."}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no widespread agreement on the definition and components of a personal [[learning environment]].&lt;ref name=Fiedler&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220066333_Personal_Learning_Environments_Concept_or_Technology| title = Personal learning environments: concept or technology?|author1=Fiedler, Sebastian. |author2=Väljataga, Terje | year = 2011
| format = | work =  International Journal of Virtual and Personal Learning Environments 2(4)| publisher = | pages = 1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even enthusiasts for the concept admit that personal learning is an evolving term and doesn't have any widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=educause&gt;{{cite web | title=7 Things You Should Know About Personal Learning Environments | url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eli7049.pdf | publisher=EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative | year=2009 | accessdate=Apr 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dan Buckley defined two ends of the personalized learning spectrum: "personalization for the learner", in which the teacher tailors the learning, and "personalization by the learner", in which the learner develops skills to tailor his own learning. This spectrum was adopted by the (2006) Microsoft's Practical Guide to Envisioning and Transforming Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Personalisation by Pieces Framework: A Framework for the Incremental Transformation of Pedagogy Towards Greater Learner Empowerment in Schools|isbn= 0954314743 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The United States National Education Technology Plan 2017 defines personalized learning as follows:
{{Quote|Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized for the needs of each learner. Learning objectives, instructional approaches, and instructional content (and its sequencing) may all vary based on learner needs. In addition, learning activities are meaningful and relevant to learners, driven by their interests, and often self-initiated.&lt;ref name="United States Department of Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reimagining the Role of Technology in Education: 2017 National Education Technology Plan Update|url=https://tech.ed.gov/netp/ |accessdate=Jan 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Typically technology is used to try to facilitate personalized learning environments.&lt;ref name=Al-Zoube&gt;{{cite journal |last=Al-Zoube |first=Mohammed | title =E-Learning on the Cloud | url =http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.662.3204&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal=International Arab Journal of e-Technology |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=58–64 |accessdate=Apr 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researcher Eduard Pogorskiy:
{{Quote|[[Information and communications technology|ICT]] and [[communications technology]] can be a powerful tool for personalized learning as it allows learners access to research and information, and provides a mechanism for communication, debate, and recording learning achievements. However, personalized learning is not exclusive to digital technologies or environments.  In the rhetoric around 21st Century Skills, personalized learning is often equated with 'customization' (as found in the business world), with digital personalization used to the frame the learning experience as highly efficient.  Problematic in this is the discounting of the highly relational and [[socially constructed]] space well defined in the research on learning.  Narrowing personalized learning to its digital form also raises the concern of the [[echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]] effect emerging in (hyper)personalized online experiences.&lt;ref name=Pogorskiy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pogorskiy |first=E. |title=Using personalisation to improve the effectiveness of global educational projects |url=http://ldm.sagepub.com/content/12/1/57 |journal=E-Learning and Digital Media |year=2015 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–67 |accessdate=Mar 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Instructional design ==
Proponents of personalized learning say that many elements of curriculum, assessment and [[instructional design]] must be present in classrooms for students to succeed and often use [[learning relationship management|software systems]] to manage and facilitate student-led instruction. Proponents argue that classroom learning activities must build upon students' prior knowledge and teachers need to allocate time for practice. Advocates argue that teachers must continuously assess student learning against clearly defined standards and goals and student input into the assessment process is integral.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Patrick |first=Susan |last2=Kennedy |first2=Kathryn |last3=Powell |first3=Allison |date=Oct 2013 |title=Mean what you say: Defining and integrating personalized, blended and competency education |url=http://www.inacol.org/resource/mean-what-you-say-defining-and-integrating-personalized-blended-and-competency-education/ |publisher=International Association for K-12 Online Learning |accessdate=Mar 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lindgren, R., &amp; McDaniel, R. (2012). Transforming Online Learning through
Narrative and Student Agency. Journal of Educational Technology &amp;
Society, 15(4), 344–355.

== Conferring ==
As stated above by the 2017 United States National Education Technology Plan, "Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized the needs for each learner." Conferring is a process in which this can be accomplished. Conferring, as defined by Julie Kallio, is a "regular, goal-oriented meeting between the teacher and student(s) where they talk about learning progress, process, and/or products." Conferring, more simply, is a way to provide more personalized feedback. 

Learning, in any context, requires some form of feedback. In schools, this feedback is almost entirely thought of as the teacher providing feedback to the student. The idea of providing feedback to advance student learning is best understood in the framework of the "zone of proximal development" or ZPD.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes|last=Vygotsky|first=Lev|publisher=Harvard Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky|Lev Vygotski]] has defined the ZPD as "the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; More plainly, a student has a certain level they can achieve by themselves and with support they are able to achieve a higher level of learning. However, there is still some level in which the student is incapable of reaching, no matter what support is provided. For example, a student may be working on double digit addition. Their current knowledge may already provide them with the skills to move on to triple digit addition without any help. If the student is introduced to multiplication, however, they will need help to understand that multiplication is a quicker way to represent the same number being added onto itself a defined number of times. Where this help occurs is the student's ZPD. Even with help though, it is not reasonable to expect the student to learn how to solve a calculus problem. The struggle for teachers is how to provide the right amount of help to each student. If a teacher provides information to the whole class too quickly, some students are left behind trying to figure out the first step. Conversely, if a teacher provides information to the whole class too slowly, some students will finish rapidly and be left with nothing to do. Conferring is a tool that teachers have used to help mitigate that issue.

Conferring first gained prominence in the book ''One to one: the art of art of conferring with young writers'' by Lucy Calkins, Amanda Hartman, and Zoe Ryder White.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=One to one: the art of conferring with young writers|last=Calkins|first=Lucy|last2=Hartman|first2=A|last3=White|first3=Z|publisher=Heinemann|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work, Calkins and her co-writers describe how effective writing workshops for students included individual writing conferences (conferring), where teachers would sit and talk with their students about their writing. Per the book, "Conferring can give us the force that makes our mini-lessons and curriculum development and assessment and everything else more powerful. It gives us an endless resource of teaching wisdom, an endless source of accountability, a system of checks and balances. And, it gives us laughter and human connection-the understanding of our children that gives spirit to our teaching."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Calkins believed that there were three main components to every conferring session: Research, Decide and Teach. Research focused on where the student was in their current writing, decide would help the teacher choose what to teach the student, and teach would use modeling and guiding practice to further advance student learning. In their book ''The Writing Workshop'', Katie Wood Ray and Lester L. Laminack added a fourth component in where after the teaching portion the student and/or the teacher would "Make a Record".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Writing workshop: working through the hard parts (and they're all hard parts)|last=Ray|first=Katie Wood|last2=Laminack|first2=Lester L.|publisher=National Council of Teachers|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modified model can be thought in the terms of: research, decide, teach, record. The benefits of using conferring have been documented in a couple of studies.

Using a mix method case study approach in observing a group of 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students, Javaye Devette Stubbs posed the question: "How does the implementation of one-on-one conferring promote higher order thinking skills in students with difficulties in reading?"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stubbs|first=Javaye Devette|date=|title=The benefit of conferring|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1858793307?pq-origsite=gscholar|journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from her pre and post-test found that "even those with reading difficulties did show a significant gain in higher order thinking skills".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a separate study, the educator Antony Smith examined the effectiveness of using teacher-student writing conference for English language learners (ELLs).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/literacy/articles/conferring-with-young-second/|title=School of Education at Johns Hopkins University-Conferring with Young Second-Language Writers: Keys to Success|last=Smith|first=Antony|date=|website=education.jhu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing two students who were ELLs in a second-grade classroom working on a book project, Smith found that the work produced "looks similar to what is produced by native English speakers".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Smith later suggests that the success of the two students were largely tied to the writing conferences, and goes on to state that writing conferences are the "heart of the writing process, and with this in mind, the potential of the teacher-student writing conference becomes clear".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The information can be summarized into three main takeaways. First, building student knowledge is dependent on the current level of knowledge the student has and what kind of support they are provided. Second, conferring is a model that can provide student support through a structured four-part process. Third, conferring has been shown to increase student learning in both reading and writing.

==Debate==
[[Andy Hargreaves (academic)|Andy Hargreaves]] and Dennis Shirley write that while there are advantages in students being able to access information instantly on-line, one should not mistake such processes for "something deeper, more challenging, and more connected to compelling issues in their world and their lives".&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Andy, and Shirley, Dennis.  ''The Fourth Way:  The Inspiring Future for Educational Change''.  Corwin, 2009, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfie Kohn]] wrote that while personalized learning may sound like a useful strategy for education, in practice it's mostly just about selling technology products. Personalized learning promises a strategy to specifically adjust education to the unique needs and skills of individual children, he argued, but really it means merely "adjusting the difficulty level of prefabricated skills-based exercises based on students' test scores... [and] requires the purchase of software from one of those companies that can afford full-page ads in ''[[Education Week]]''".  While "certain forms of technology can be used to support progressive education", Kohn wrote, "...meaningful (and truly personal) learning never ''requires'' technology. Therefore, if an idea like personalization is presented from the start as entailing software or a screen, we ought to be extremely skeptical about who really benefits."&lt;ref name="PT022415"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-homework-myth/201502/four-reasons-worry-about-personalized-learning|title=Four Reasons to Worry About 'Personalized Learning'|date=Feb 24, 2015|work=Psychology Today|author=Alfie Kohn|accessdate=Apr 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harlow-Isolationchamber.gif|thumb|180px|A [[rhesus monkey]] infant in one of Harlow's isolation chambers. The photograph was taken when the chamber door was raised for the first time after six months of total isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens 1986, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Pit of despair''' was a name used by American [[Comparative psychology|comparative psychologist]] [[Harry Harlow]] for a device he designed, technically called a '''vertical chamber apparatus''', that he used in experiments on [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Blum 1994, p. 95, Blum 2002, pp. 218-219. Blum 1994, p. 95: "... the most controversial experiment to come out of the Wisconsin laboratory, a device that Harlow insisted on calling the "Pit of despair."&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the research was to produce an [[Animal model of depression|animal model of clinical depression]]. Researcher [[Stephen Suomi]] described the device as "little more than a stainless-steel trough with sides that sloped to a rounded bottom":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A {{frac|3|8}}&amp;nbsp;in. wire mesh floor 1&amp;nbsp;in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop through the drain and out of holes drilled in the stainless-steel. The chamber was equipped with a food box and a [[Sipper water bottle|water-bottle]] holder, and was covered with a pyramid top [removed in the accompanying photograph], designed to discourage incarcerated subjects from hanging from the upper part of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Suomi1971/33"&gt;Suomi 1971, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harlow had already placed newly born monkeys in isolation chambers for up to one year. With the "Pit of despair", he placed monkeys between three months and three years old in the chamber alone, after they had bonded with their mothers, for up to ten weeks.&lt;ref&gt;McKinney, Suomi, and Harlow 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, they had stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner.

==Background==
Much of Harlow's scientific career was spent studying [[maternal bond]]ing, what he described as the "nature of love". These experiments involved rearing newborn "total isolates" and monkeys with surrogate mothers, ranging from toweling-covered cones to a machine that modeled abusive mothers by assaulting the baby monkeys with cold air or spikes.&lt;ref name=Slater136&gt;Slater, Lauren. ''Opening Skinner's box: great psychological experiments of the twentieth century'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005,  {{ISBN|0-393-32655-1}}, pp.136-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of the experiments was to pinpoint the basis of the mother-child relationship, namely whether the infant primarily sought food or affection. Harlow concluded it was the latter.&lt;!--will find source and say more--&gt;

In 1971, Harlow's wife died of cancer and he began to suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]]. He was treated and returned to work but, as [[Lauren Slater]] writes, his colleagues noticed a difference in his demeanor.&lt;ref name=Slater251&gt;Slater 2005, pp. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned his research into maternal attachment and developed an interest in [[Solitude|isolation]] and depression.

Harlow's first experiments involved isolating a monkey in a cage surrounded by steel walls with a small [[one-way mirror]], so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey could not look out. The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year.

After 30 days, the "total isolates", as they were called, were found to be "enormously disturbed". After being isolated for a year, they barely moved, did not explore or play, and were incapable of having sexual relations. When placed with other monkeys for a daily play session, they were badly [[Bullying|bullied]]. Two of them refused to eat and starved themselves to death.&lt;ref name="Blum2002/216"&gt;Blum 2002, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harlow also wanted to test how isolation would affect parenting skills, but the isolates were unable to mate. [[Artificial insemination]] had not then been developed; instead, Harlow devised what he called a "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. He found that, just as they were incapable of having sexual relations, they were also unable to parent their offspring, either abusing or neglecting them. "Not even in our most devious dreams could we have designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were", he wrote.&lt;ref name="Blum2002/217"&gt;Blum 2002, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Having no social experience themselves, they were incapable of appropriate social interaction. One mother held her baby's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers. Another crushed her baby's head. Most of them simply ignored their offspring.&lt;ref name="Blum2002/217"/&gt;

These experiments showed Harlow what total and partial isolation did to developing monkeys, but he felt he had not captured the essence of depression, which he believed was characterized by feelings of loneliness, helplessness, and a sense of being trapped, or being "sunk in a well of despair", he said.&lt;ref name="Blum2002/217"/&gt;

The technical name for the new depression chamber was "vertical chamber apparatus", though Harlow himself insisted on calling it the "pit of despair". He had at first wanted to call it the "dungeon of despair", and also used terms like "well of despair", and "well of loneliness". Blum writes that his colleagues tried to persuade him not to use such descriptive terms, that a less visual name would be easier, politically speaking. Gene Sackett of the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, one of Harlow's doctoral students who went on to conduct additional deprivation studies, said, "He first wanted to call it a dungeon of despair. Can you imagine the reaction to that?"&lt;ref&gt;Blum 1994, p. 95; Blum 2002, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the monkeys placed inside it were at least three months old and had already bonded with others. The point of the experiment was to break those bonds in order to create the symptoms of depression. The chamber was a small, metal, inverted pyramid, with slippery sides, slanting down to a point. The monkey was placed in the point. The opening was covered with mesh. The monkeys would spend the first day or two trying to climb up the slippery sides. After a few days, they gave up. Harlow wrote, "most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus. One might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless."&lt;ref name="Blum1994/218"&gt;Blum 1994, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen J. Suomi, another of Harlow's doctoral students, placed some monkeys in the chamber in 1970 for his PhD. He wrote that he could find no monkey who had any defense against it. Even the happiest monkeys came out damaged. He concluded that even a happy, normal childhood was no defense against depression.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2018}}

The experiments delivered what science writer [[Deborah Blum]] has called "common sense results", namely, that monkeys, normally very social animals in nature, emerge from isolation badly damaged, and that some recover while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;Blum 2002, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments were condemned, both at the time and later, from within the scientific community and elsewhere in academia. In 1974, American literary critic [[Wayne C. Booth]] wrote that "Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance&amp;mdash;that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties." He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Wayne C. ''Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent'', Volume 5, of University of Notre Dame, Ward-Phillips lectures in English language and literature, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 114. Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment. His next sentence is, "His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in "solitary" for twenty days&amp;mdash;what he calls a "vertical chamber apparatus ... designed on an intuitive basis" to produce "a state of helplessness and hopelessness, sunken in a well of despair".&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Snowdon, a junior member of the faculty at the time, who became head of psychology at Wisconsin, said that Harlow had himself been very depressed by his wife's cancer. Snowdon was appalled by the design of the vertical chambers. He asked Suomi why they were using them, and Harlow replied, "Because that's how it feels when you're depressed."&lt;ref&gt;Blum 2002, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Rosenblum, who studied under Harlow, told Lauren Slater that Harlow enjoyed using shocking terms for his apparatus because "he always wanted to get a rise out of people".&lt;ref name=Slater148&gt;Slater 2005, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Harlow's students, William Mason, who also conducted deprivation experiments elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;Capitanio and Mason 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; said that Harlow "kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive. It's as if he sat down and said, 'I'm only going to be around another ten years. What I'd like to do, then, is leave a great big mess behind.' If that was his aim, he did a perfect job."&lt;ref name="Blum1994/96"&gt;Blum 1994, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">The '''quadrivium''' (plural: quadrivia&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14950-wisdom |title=Wisdom |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The word is [[Latin]], meaning ''four ways'', and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to [[Boethius]] or [[Cassiodorus]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Part I: The Age of Augustine". ND.edu. 2010. [http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp205.htm ND205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrivium (education)". ''[[Britannica Online]]''. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485943/quadrivium EB].
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the [[trivium]] and the quadrivium comprised the seven [[liberal arts]] (based on thinking skills),&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Quadrivium|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished from the practical arts (such as [[medicine]] and [[architecture]]).

The quadrivium consisted of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]]. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of [[philosophy]] (sometimes called the "liberal art ''par excellence''")&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman, Daniel Coit]], et al. (1905). ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''. Lemma "Arts, Liberal".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). &lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
The quadrivium is implicit in early [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] writings and in the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], although the term ''quadrivium'' was not used until [[Boethius]], early in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les Arts Libéraux dans l'Antiquité Classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts Libéraux et Philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Proclus]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold.  A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion.  Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus. ''A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements'', xii. trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-691-02090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of [[Master of Arts]] (after the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil]] and [[British degree abbreviations|B.Litt.]] degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by [[Proclus]] (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig (2001). ''The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology, and Music''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geometry and cosmology on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, Laura Ackerman (1994). ''History, Prophecy and the Stars: Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350–1420. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of [[harmonic]]s, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a [[monochord]]. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of [[number]] and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in [[space]], music was number in [[time]], and astronomy was number in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Morris Kline]] classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Morris (1953). "The Sine of G Major". In ''Mathematics in Western Culture''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This schema is sometimes referred to as "classical education", but it is more accurately a [[Renaissance of the 12th century|development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance]] with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the [[Classical education movement]] and at the independent [[Oundle School]], in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge |title=Oundle School – Improving Intellectual Challenge |date=27 October 2014 |website=The Boarding Schools' Association}}&lt;br /&gt;Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at [[King's College London]] on "[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx The Future of Liberal Arts]" at schools and universities.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Stavanger Museum was founded in 1877, and was first located in a small wooden house in [[Gamle Stavanger]]. The museum got its own building, Muségata 3, in 1893, designed by architect [[Hartvig Sverdrup Eckhoff]]. The building was extended in 1930, and again in 1964. A major restoration and technical upgrade was performed in 1995.&lt;ref name=byleks-stavangermuseum/&gt;

[[Ledaal]], the summer house of the Kielland family built by [[Gabriel Schanche Kielland]], was bought by Stavanger Museum in 1936, and opened as a royal residence in 1949.&lt;ref name=ledaal&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Ledaal |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Ledaal |language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal residence Ledaal dates from around 1800. Breidablikk villa is a well-preserved mansion which was built in 1881-1882 for the merchant and ship owner [[Lars Berentsen]] (1838-1896) . The villa was designed by architect [[Henrik Nissen]]. Breidablikk villa is situated on [[Eiganes]] in Stavanger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/breidablikk/about-breidablikk/ ''Breidablikk'' (Museum Stavanger)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The archeological department was split out in 1975, as the new institution ''Arkeologisk museum i Stavanger''. The Maritime Museum was included in 1979.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The Graphical museum was established in 1991, and included in Stavanger Museum in 2006. The Children's Museum was established in 2000, and incorporated as a department of Stavanger Museum in 2007. The school museum was established in 1925, and incorporated into Stavanger Museum in 2008. 
The department also incorporates ''Den Kombinerede Indretning'', a collection of local medical history established in 1989, and a part of Stavanger Museum from 2006.&lt;ref name=byleks-stavangermuseum/&gt;

==Stavanger Museum of Natural History==
Stavanger Museum of Natural History  (''Stavanger naturhistoriske museum'') was formerly the Department of Zoology at the Stavanger Museum. The department of zoology was central to the establishing of the museum in 1877, assigned the task of collecting local fauna, and also "exotic" mammals and birds donated by sailors and travelers. From 1918 the museum specialized in ornithological research. Revtangen Ornithological Station is located in an area known for its rich and varied bird life. Stavanger Museum has a station here where migratory birds are tagged or ringed each year.  The ornithological station for [[bird ringing]]  was established in 1937 and is operated by the museum.&lt;ref name=byleks-stavangermuseum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/stavanger-museum-natural-history-/bird-ringing-centre/ ''Revtangen Ringing Centre'' (Museum Stavanger)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017055040/http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/stavanger-museum-natural-history-/bird-ringing-centre/ |date=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stavanger Maritime Museum==
The Maritime Museum was established in 1926 and included as a department of Stavanger Museum from 1979. Until 1984 the exhibitions were at Stavanger Museum's main building in Muségata 16, and were moved to historical locations at the port of Stavanger (Nedre Strandgate 17 and 19) in 1985. The buildings are from the period 1770 to 1840. The exhibition displays the development of the shipping and fishing industry over the last 200 years. The museum owns and operates two older sailboats, ''Anna af Sand'' from 1848 and ''[[Wyvern (vessel)|Wyvern]]'' from 1896.&lt;ref name=byleks-maritime&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008 |title=Stavanger Sjøfartsmuseum |encyclopedia=Stavanger byleksikon |publisher=Wigestrand |location=Stavanger |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5001">'''Student teaching''' is a college-supervised instructional experience; usually the culminating course in a university or college [[undergraduate education]] or [[graduate school]] program leading to [[teacher education]] and certification.  Examples of programs include Early Childhood (Birth-Grade 3), Middle Childhood (Grades 4-9), and Adolescence to Young Adult (Grades 7-12).  It is required by those earning either a [[Bachelor of Education]] or [[Master of Education]] degree, as well as liberal arts [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees with a major in education.

Student teaching is required for students who are not yet certified to teach.  It is different from a [[practicum]], which is required when a student ''already'' holds certification to teach, yet wants a certificate extension to teach another area of specialization; they are both college-supervised field-based experiences.

The student teaching experience lasts about the length of a semester or quarter; long enough to fulfill the college’s assigned tasks. It is an unpaid [[internship]]. This experience gives the prospective teaching professional an opportunity to teach under the supervision of a permanently certified master teacher (see [[schoolmaster]]).

The student teacher is usually placed in a neighboring or participating school.  The student teacher is monitored by the cooperating teacher from the school, as well as a supervisor through the college.  The supervisor acts as a liaison between the cooperating teacher and the head of the college’s student teaching department.

The student teacher normally shadows the cooperating teacher for about one week, eventually gaining more responsibility in teaching the class as the days and weeks progress. Eventually, the student teacher will assume most of the teaching responsibilities for the class including class management, lesson planning, assessment, and grading. Thus, the student teacher is able to more fully experience the role of the teacher as the classroom teacher takes on the observation role in the class. There is sometimes a "phasing out" week when the student teacher returns the teaching role back to the regular teacher.

The supervisor, as well as cooperating teacher, monitor the progress of the student teacher throughout the experience, ensuring ''satisfactory'' work.  A grade of ''Pass'' or ''Fail'' in student teaching, as well as satisfactory completion of a school's education program, is an indication as to whether the college recommends the student for certification to teach.

==Student teaching as a learning challenge==
Student teaching has been used as a  challenge to foreign language learners to facilitate the integration of their language skills by placing them at the center of classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Ogawa-StudentsTeach.html Ogawa &amp; Wilkinson - Let Your Students Teach Their Class (I-TESL-J)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Student teaching philosophy has proven to be a decisive between the newer cohort of teachers, and older educators. Trained under differing teaching philosophies, both groups have a difference of opinion on instructional methodology. The two most prevalent teaching philosophies in America are called Modern teaching philosophy and Traditional teaching philosophy respectively. The former relies on inquiry-based instruction, while the later relies heavily on lecture-based teaching. The differing of philosophies is being seen at every rung of the educational ladder, from Pre-K to Collegiate instruction.

In describing the difference between the two methodologies, one can note characteristics that define them. In traditional teaching methods, there is a high emphasis on attending lectures, reading texts, and solving problems. In modern teaching approaches, there is a high premium put on developing one's unique knowledge through the pursuit of the scientific method, using such didactic methods as observation and hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/download/1885/1827 Traditional Teaching Methods Vs. Teaching through the Application of Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hallmark of the modern teaching approach is the incorporation of technology, a highly useful skill that is required of most who intend on entering the job market in future years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.muni.cz/th/86952/ff_m_b1/MgrDiplomkaBoumova.pdf Traditional Vs. Modern Teaching Methods: Advantages and Disadvantages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of technological inclusion within the classroom has become supported in many counties through the United States. Most schools are equipped with smart boards and include roaming laptop carts that allow all students, regardless of financial ability, gain experience with the technology that will make them successful in the next steps of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.mit.edu/papers/GamesSimsSocNets_EdArcade.pdf Using the Technology of Today, in the Classroom of Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10689">'''The Chartered College of Teaching''', is the recognised professional body for the teaching profession. The college was founded in 1846 and incorporated by [[royal charter]] as '''The College of Preceptors''' in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-09-20-Record-of-Charters-Granted.xlsx|title=Privy Council: Record of Charters Granted 20th September 2018.|last=|first=|date=20 Sep 2018|website=Privy Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supplemental charter was granted in 1998 changing the College's name to '''The College of Teachers'''.

==History==
The college was founded in 1846 by a group of private schoolmasters from [[Brighton]] who were concerned about standards within their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160324095730/http://www.collegeofteachers.ac.uk/about/history Archive|Our history The College of Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt; A provisional committee was set up in early 1846 under the chairmanship of Henry Stein Turrell (1815–1863), principal of the Montpelier House School in Brighton. After meetings in London and Brighton a general meeting was called for 20 June 1846 at the Freemason's Tavern in Great Queen Street. Some 300 schoolmasters attended, some 60 members enrolled and founding resolutions passed, including:

:That in the opinion of this meeting, it is desirable for the protection of the interests of both the scholastic profession and the public, that some proof of qualification, both as to the amount of knowledge and the art of conveying it to others, should be required, from and after a certain time to be hereinafter specified, of all persons who may be desirous of entering the profession; and that the test, in the first instance, should be applied to Assistant Masters only.
:That in the opinion of this meeting, the test of qualification should be referred to a legally authorised or corporate body, or college, consisting of persons engaged in tuition.
:That for the purpose of effecting this object – viz., the formation of a corporate body – the members of the profession who enrol their names at this meeting, do resolve themselves, and are hereby resolved, into the College of Preceptors; and that those persons now enrolled, shall incur no liability beyond the amount of their respective annual subscriptions.
:That a Council, consisting of the members of the Provisional Committee, with power to add to their number, be now appointed for the purpose of conducting the business of the institution, and that Mr Turrell be appointed President of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aldrich|first1=Richard|title=School and Society in Victorian Britain: Joseph Payne and the New World of Education|date=16 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415686532|pages=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College of Preceptors|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/institutions/college_preceptors.htm|website=UCL Bloomsbury Project|publisher=UCL|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashton|first1=Rosemary|title=Victorian Bloomsbury|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300154474|pages=454-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college created a system for the formal examination and qualification of secondary school teachers. It was also one of the first bodies to examine and provide certificates for secondary school pupils of both sexes, from all over [[England]] and [[Wales]], in a wide variety of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the 1870s, the college helped to establish education as a subject worthy of study at [[university]] level, resulting in the appointment of [[Joseph Payne]] as the first [[Professor]] of [[Education]] in 1873. The power to appoint [[Professor|Professors]] of [[Education]] is recognised in the college's current [[royal charter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[Frances Mary Buss|Frances Buss]] (1827–1894) and [[Sir John Adams]] (1857–1934) were also connected to the College. During the 1950s the college pioneered [[management]] training schemes for teachers (at the time these were known as school administration courses).

On 21 February 1981, the College was granted armorial bearings. Until 2016, the college awarded a range of professional qualifications for teachers aligned to university qualifications up to and including Doctoral Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chartered.college/legal|title=Regulations - The Chartered College of Teaching|last=|first=|date=|work=The Chartered College of Teaching|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theme Hospital''''' is a [[business simulation game]] developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1997 for the PC in which players design and operate a privately owned [[hospital]] with the goal of curing patients of fictitious comical ailments. The game is the thematic successor to ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their ''Theme'' series, and part of their ''Designer Series''. The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture.

[[Peter Molyneux]] and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a ''Theme'' game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. ''Theme Hospital'' was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1998. A [[Sega Saturn]] version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on [[GOG.com]] in 2012 and [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]] in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of [[open source video game|open-source]] remakes such as ''CorsixTH''.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:ThemeHospital.gif|thumb|left|A typical hospital.]]

The player is required to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat [[black comedy|dark sense of humour]], similar to that of its predecessor, ''Theme Park''.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate [[Elvis Presley]]), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

Starting with an empty hospital,&lt;ref name="TokyoRetro"&gt;{{cite web|title=東京レトロゲームショウ2015：第12回 「テーマホスピタル」で人間のドラマがあちこちで繰り広げられる病院経営に挑みたい|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/301/G030139/20150729045/|website=4Gamer.net|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=Japanese|date=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009121745/http://www.4gamer.net/games/301/G030139/20150729045/|archive-date=9 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the player must build rooms and hire [[medical doctor|doctors]], [[nurse]]s, [[Janitor|handymen]] and [[receptionist]]s.&lt;ref name="Quick PlayGuide 9 11"&gt;Quick PlayGuide, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 11,27,28.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies,&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt; and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The player is given time to build the hospital at the start of each level before patients start coming.&lt;ref name=PCZone&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[PC Zone]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=50|date=May 1997|page=7|ISSN=0967-8220|title=Theme Hospital|url=https://archive.org/details/PC_Zone_Issue_050_1997-05_Dennis_Publishing_GB|accessdate=6 October 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quick PlayGuide, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment.&lt;ref name="Quick PlayGuide 9 11" /&gt; While a few rooms are available at the start of the game, the rest must be researched.&lt;ref name="Manual 10"&gt;Manual, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 32,33.&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Training room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 10,11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis and treatment cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount of diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms,&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 23,24.&lt;/ref&gt; and loans can be taken out.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 24,25.&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt to cover it up by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 34,35.&lt;/ref&gt; a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 35,36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.&lt;ref name=PCZoneGuide&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=PC Zone|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=52|date=July 1997|title=Everything you wanted to know about Theme Hospital but were too afraid to ask...|pages=126, 127|ISSN=0967-8220|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the player has no direct control over the patients, they have some influence over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do with them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 25–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient),&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and rearrange queues.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 25,26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The player competes against computer rivals named after famous computers, real and fictional: these include [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] from ''[[Red Dwarf (TV series)|Red Dwarf]]'' and [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Deep Thought]] from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Langshaw|title=Theme Hospital retrospective: Just what the doctor ordered|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/retro-corner/feature/a623869/theme-hospital-retrospective-just-what-the-doctor-ordered/|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=6 October 2016|date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006175554/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/retro-corner/feature/a623869/theme-hospital-retrospective-just-what-the-doctor-ordered/|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is timed with days of the year,&lt;ref name=PCZone /&gt; and at the end of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 37,38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level has set goals in the fields of financial attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.&lt;ref name=PCZoneGuide /&gt;

A [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was released that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, Modem, and [[IPX/SPX]] network gaming (with up to four players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EA's Darklight Conflict and Theme Hospital|url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/previews/ea_preview.asp|website=Gamezilla|accessdate=6 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990225072027/http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/previews/ea_preview.asp|archivedate=25 February 1999|date=24 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt;&lt;ref name=NetPlay&gt;{{cite av media notes|title=Theme Hospital Netplay|year=1997|author=Bullfrog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media notes|title=Theme Hospital ReadMe.txt|year=1997|author=Bullfrog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. "Litter Bombs" are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players' hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are "Mini Missions", with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.&lt;ref name=NetPlay /&gt;

== Development ==
''Theme Hospital'' took over two years to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=Revisiting Bullfrog: 25 Years On|pages=60–67|issue=110|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came from [[Peter Molyneux]] and journalist James Leach, who explored the possibility of other ''Theme'' games while discussing ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]''. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer [[Mark Webley]] selected ''Theme Hospital'' from a list of possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]], visited the [[Royal Surrey County Hospital]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], and [[Frimley Park Hospital]] for research and inspiration.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name="BTSExtra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theme Hospital Behind The Scenes - DVD Extras|url=https://forum.gamestm.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17641|website=[[GamesTM]]|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=8 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106173202/https://forum.gamestm.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17641|archive-date=6 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on ''Theme Hospital'': he had previously left Bullfrog to work for [[The Bitmap Brothers]] because he did not have faith in ''Theme Park''. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]'', which he was eager to do. Initially, ''Theme Hospital'' was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic:&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are "colourful" compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does.&lt;ref name=GamesN&gt;{{cite web|author1=Julian Benson|title=How the makers of Theme Hospital made hospital wards and diseases funny|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/theme-hospital/theme-hospital-peter-molyneux-making-of|website=PCGamesN|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731233711/https://www.pcgamesn.com/theme-hospital/theme-hospital-peter-molyneux-making-of|archive-date=31 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during a hospital visit (after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting the surgeon&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt;) that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death "quite sad" and believed that illness was not a popular subject.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them "creative freedom", which he believed was essential.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful.&lt;ref name=BTS&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[GamesTM]]|issue=113|date=September 2011|pages=128–131|title=Behind The Scenes Theme Hospital|ISSN=1478-5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore.&lt;ref name=Patients&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|title=Trying Your Patients...|pages=8, 9|issue=2|date=1995|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on ''Dungeon Keeper''.&lt;ref name=Making&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=The Making of Theme Hospital|pages=46–51|issue=130|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons,&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; and a goal was to have two thousand character animations.&lt;ref name=Update&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|issue=3|date=1996|title=Hospital Update|page=11|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time,&lt;ref name=Update /&gt; and the team ultimately ended up with four.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Manual, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the [[Kit-Kat]] graphics correct.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; He said they did not have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using [[Deluxe Paint]].&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and [[cutscene]]s were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished.&lt;ref name=Update /&gt; By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.&lt;ref name=TH /&gt;

The game deviates from the [[National Health Service|NHS]] model; Webley and Carr decided that players should think of the hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from ''Theme Park'' and borrowed a great deal of code.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Webley explained that this was an "obvious starting point" as he had been a programmer on ''Theme Park'', and that the systems had been rewritten by the time ''Theme Hospital'' was complete.&lt;ref name=BTSExtra /&gt; A program which facilitated animation was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done, effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis's estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an "alarming size".&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

According to Leach, the volume of work was small. A big problem was that the team had too many ideas, and insufficient time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Theme Hospital|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|page=91|quote=To start, players choose between one of four different time periods, the Middle Ages, the Victorian Era, 1970s-1980s, and of course, the future.|ISSN=1078-9693}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval&lt;!-- This article uses British English, in which this is not an incorrect spelling.

Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

''Theme Hospital'' was released in March 1997 (although it was previously due for release in November 1996&lt;ref name=EdgePrev&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issue=36|date=September 1996|page=36|ISSN=1350-1593|title=Theme Hospital|department=Prescreen|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|issue=4|date=1997|title=Theme Hospital|pages=4–6|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of Bullfrog's ''Designer Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Theme Hospital|developer=Bullfrog|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=1997|platform=PC|scene=Intro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EdgeBullfrog95&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issue=22|date=July 1995|pages=25–27|ISSN=1350-1593|title=Bullfrog|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the [[Houses of Parliament]], and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', who published an article criticising the game as "sick" and said that the [[British Medical Association]] was using it to train management staff.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to make light of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. ''Theme Hospital'' was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described ''Theme Hospital'' as "a great game that I and many people remember".&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

Original releases' cover art used a green cross on a white background, which Bullfrog did not have the right to use.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white, and had to be recalled.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; Later releases changed the cross to a star.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; Despite its rejection, the cross version is available in more recent formats.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt;

=== Sound ===

The music and sound effects were produced by [[Russell Shaw (composer)|Russell Shaw]] and Adrian Moore.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moore used [[Sound Forge]] to develop the sound effects.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Some (such as the snooker balls) were taken directly from its library, and others (including the treatment machines) were created by mixing sounds together.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Some machine sounds were created by mixing the sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; The farting sounds were recorded when Moore was working with bands including [[T'Pau (band)|T'Pau]], [[Prefab Sprout]], and [[Seal (band)|Seal]] at a recording studio: he did so as a joke, but they were useful for ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

''Theme Hospital'' received positive reviews. Critics noted the strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.

The British magazine ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'s}} Steve Owen praised the game's challenge and "cute" graphics, but criticised the interface.&lt;ref name=PCGamer /&gt; Frederick Claude of ''Coming Soon Magazine'' also complimented the graphics as "highly detailed", and the "very simple" user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness and lack of multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch.&lt;ref name=CSoon /&gt; [[GameSpot]]{{'s}} Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as "fantastic", and also complimented the "realistic" voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] as "flawed". His conclusion was that the game "just doesn't fly".&lt;ref name=GSpotPC /&gt; Bonnie James of [[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]] also liked the graphics, as well as the "lovely" opening sequence, but found the music "horrible".&lt;ref name=EP /&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''{{'s}} Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as "large and colourful", but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt it is good to begin with.&lt;ref name=CVG /&gt;

Another reviewer who liked the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', who also praised the humour, especially the "wackiness" of the illnesses, and described the game as "delightful and absorbing".&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; The humour was also approved by a reviewer of [[Jeuxvideo.com]], who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful.&lt;ref name=Jeuxvideo /&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'s}} reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing it as something they had come to except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support.&lt;ref name=NGRev /&gt; The humour was again praised by a reviewer of ''PC Power'', who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have "hilarious" cures. The "thoroughly engrossing" gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a "cheerful look". ''Theme Hospital'' was described as a "fantastic title".&lt;ref name=PCPRev /&gt; Other comments from critics included ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''{{'s}} reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre,&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; and ''[[PC Zone]]''{{'s}} reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players "helplessly immersed", and the game was awarded the ''PC Zone'' Classic accolade.&lt;ref name=PCZoneRev /&gt; Éric Ernaux of ''[[:fr:Gen4|Génération 4]]'' said the quality is "remarkable for a game of its genre".&lt;ref name=G4Rev /&gt;

The PlayStation version's main problem, as noted by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot,&lt;ref name=GSpotPS /&gt; [[IGN]],&lt;ref name=IGNPS /&gt; Eurogamer,&lt;ref name=Eurogamer /&gt; and ''Edge'' as a major downside.&lt;ref name=EdgePS /&gt; Its reception was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the addictiveness, and described the port as "almost completely intact".&lt;ref name=GSpotPS /&gt; IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as "wonderfully sick". It was further commented that the game's "brilliance" made it a "must-have".&lt;ref name=IGNPS /&gt; The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]], who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer /&gt; Absolute PlayStation's reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites. The user interface was criticised as being reminiscent of a [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit game]]. Despite the criticisms, they agreed with others about the humour, and described the game as "a blast to play".&lt;ref name=Absolute /&gt;

In 1997, ''Theme Hospital'' appeared alongside ''Theme Park'' at #61 on ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s list of top 100 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The PC Gamer Top 100|issue=45|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|date=July 1997|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issn=1470-1693|page=61|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named in April as a Game of Distinction.&lt;ref name=PCGamer /&gt;

'''''Ticket to Ride''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]], based upon [[Alan R. Moon]]'s [[German-style board game]] [[Ticket to Ride (board game)|of the same name]], developed by [[Next Level Games]] and published by Playful Entertainment, Inc. The title was released on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;[http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/06/23/559646.aspx Happy Tree Friends False Alarm and Ticket to Ride - This Week - XBLA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626073958/http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/06/23/559646.aspx |date=2008-06-26 }} from GamerScoreBlog.com&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 Days of wonder abandoned Linux support.&lt;ref name="Linux"&gt;[https://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/133256959377980187/ Dropped Linux support] from steamcommunity.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Tickettoride ss.jpg|left|thumb|Gameplay screenshot.]]
Gameplay is identical to the board game: there are two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo (e.g., black represents [[Tender locomotive|coal cars]]), and destination cards which feature two city destinations (e.g., [[Chicago]] to [[Miami]]). Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them. They are also dealt six train cards.

Players may draw train cards, a new destination card, or claim a colored route on their turn. To claim a route, a player must pay with a combination of same-colored cards including [[locomotives]] which serve as wild cards. Once a route is claimed, no other player may claim it; some routes feature double routes which allow up to two players to claim it, but only if four or five players are playing. In two or three-player games, the double routes can only be claimed by one person. The players immediately earn points for each successful route they claim. At the end of the game, players earn the points listed on the destination card. If a player decides to pick a new destination card, he draws three cards and may choose any of the cards; however, the player ''must'' pick at least one destination.

The game ends when at least one of the players has expended their trains. Players are given bonuses for completed destinations, and penalized for unrealized destinations. The player with the longest contiguous route earns an additional bonus.

===Multiplayer===
''Ticket to Ride'' supports play with up to five people on [[Xbox Live]] or four people on the same console, and supports the [[Xbox Live Vision|Xbox Live Vision cam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Ticket to Ride Headed to XBLA| url= http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/05/12/559073.aspx | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517020846/http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/05/12/559073.aspx | archivedate= 2008-05-17| work= GamerScoreBlog| date= May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations University Institute on Computing and Society''' ('''UNU-CS'''; {{zh|c=聯合國大學計算與社會研究所}}) is an institute of the [[United Nations University|United Nations University (UNU)]], located in [[São Lázaro]], [[Macau]], [[China]]. Established in 2015, UNU-CS intends to assist the UN to achieve its agenda by working as a bridge between the UN and the international academic and public policy communities, training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists in computing, social sciences and design for international development.&lt;ref name="Ponto Final"&gt;{{cite news|language=pt|newspaper=Ponto Final | date=June 26, 2015|title=UNU-CS: a ONU em Macau, com novo projecto e novo director|author=John Pauleneses|url=https://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/unu-cs-a-onu-em-macau-com-novo-projecto-e-novo-director/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNU-CS succeeds the United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST), which was created by the United Nations University in Macau in 1991 following the agreement between the UN, the governments of Macao, Portugal and China. After the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau]], UNU-IIST lost some level of visibility.&lt;ref name="Ponto Final"/&gt; In 2015, the UNU-CS director Professor [[Michael L. Best]] was in charge of building the new succeeding institute “from scratch.”&lt;ref name="Global Atlanta"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Global Atlanta|title=UN taps Georgia Tech Prof to launch Macau Program/|author=Phil Bolton|date=February 12, 2015|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/27436/un-taps-georgia-tech-prof-to-launch-macau-program/|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811200209/http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/27436/un-taps-georgia-tech-prof-to-launch-macau-program/|archive-date=11 August 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
The goal of UNU-CS is "to nurture the next generation of computer and social scientists with the ability to participate in, shape and benefit from the rapid development of the global information society."&lt;ref name="UNU-PR"&gt;{{cite press release |author=UNU|title= Prof. Michael Best Appointed Director of UNU Institute on Computing and Society, Macao, China|url=http://unu.edu/media-relations/releases/prof-michael-best-appointed-director-of-unu-institute-on-computing-and-society-macao-china.html |location= Macau|publisher= UNU|agency= UNU|date=2015-01-21   |access-date=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research start-up, UNU-CS aims to do the following:&lt;ref name="UNU-CS-about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.unu.edu/about/ |title=About |author=UNU-CS |year= 2015|website=UNU-CS Official Website |publisher= UNU-CS |access-date= 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''VAE''' or '''Validation des Acquis de l'Expérience''' is a procedure that allows any [[France|French]] educational institution to grant [[academic degree|degree]]s partly or completely based on work experience.  A portfolio of the applicant's achievements and work experience is presented to a committee at the educational institution.  The committee will then decide if the documents presented in the portfolio show work that merits partial credit towards a particular degree.

== History ==

A French law, passed August 23, 1985, authorized people with work experience to ask for a Diploma equivalence. This was mostly for vocational degrees. A significant change came with the ''Loi de Modernisation Sociale'' (Law of Social Modernization) dated January 17, 2002, that specifically authorizes universities and other "''établissements d'Enseignemernt supérieurs''" ([[Education in France#Higher%20education|higher education institutions]]) to grant the standard degrees (''[[Brevet de technicien supérieur|BTS]], [[Diplôme d'études universitaires générales|DEUG]], [[Education in France#Higher education|Licence]], [[Education in France#Higher education|Maîtrise]], DES, [[Master of Advanced Studies#France and francophone countries|DESS]], Master, Mastaire, [[Doctorate#France|Doctorat]], etc.'') based only on the work experience of the candidate. The required minimum of work experience was also lowered from five to three years.

== Legal background ==

The VAE is now included in the French Code of Education ([http://legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/RechercheSimplePartieCode?commun=CEDUCA&amp;code=CEDUCATL.rcv code l' Education de la République Française]) at Part legislative, Third part, Book VI, Title Ier, Chapter III, Section 2, Art. L613-3 to L613-6.

It is important to note that ([http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=E77F40F3FBBF70520B1B0471A95A37B6.tpdjo12v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525197&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;dateTexte=20140703&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;oldAction=&amp;nbResultRech= Art L- 613-4]) states: "The validation produces the same effects as the knowledge or aptitude testing process that it replaces." The degrees and diplomas obtained through the VAE process are exactly the same and any mention of the VAE is prohibited in order to fight possible unlawful discrimination.

The VAE decision is done on file after interview (electronic or physical) by a VAE Jury made of professors belonging to the university.

== Recognition ==

At first, French professors and universities were reluctant to apply the VAE or were extremely difficult for the equivalences. {{Fact|reason=July 8, 2007|date=July 2007}} However the VAE is the law and all universities must apply it if asked. In 2005 21,379 applied for the VAE, 61% of them women. 59% received a full degree. Among those, 10% received a degree equivalent or superior to the bachelor degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/18/1/3181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1250 bachelor's or higher degrees were granted through the VAE in 2005 in France (+50%).

In France the VAE is, according to the government website, in full expansion and universally accepted.
Internationally, the countries that ratified the [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/165.htm Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region] recognize it.

In the US, credentials evaluators, universities, federal and state governments also recognize the VAE degrees with the notable exception of the state of Oregon.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

== Non-French speaking students ==

The VAE works like the European [[Erasmus Programme]] and the [[Bologna declaration|Bologna declaration on harmonization of European degrees]] that allows international students to attend French universities. In 2004 [[The Sorbonne]] started VAE in foreign languages ( English, Spanish &amp; Italian) and was followed by several other universities. The validation documents provided to the committee at the university deciding the validation must be in a language that the committee members can read and understand if not in French.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23263">The '''worked-example effect''' is a learning effect predicted by [[cognitive load|cognitive load theory]] (Sweller, 1988). Specifically, it refers to the learning effect observed when worked-examples are used as part of instruction, compared to other instructional techniques such as problem-solving (Renkl, 2005) and discovery learning (Mayer, 2004). According to Sweller: "The worked example effect is the best known and most widely studied of the cognitive load effects" (Sweller, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;165).

Worked-examples improve learning by reducing cognitive load during skill acquisition, and "is one of the earliest and probably the best known cognitive load reducing technique" (Paas et al., 2003). In particular, worked-examples provide instructions to reduce [[Cognitive load#Intrinsic|intrinsic cognitive load]] for the learner initially when few [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] are available. [[Cognitive load#Extraneous|Extraneous load]] is reduced by scaffolding of worked-examples at the beginning of skill acquisition. Finally, worked-examples can increase [[Cognitive load#Germane|germane load]] when prompts for [[Worked-example effect#Self-explanations|self-explanations]] are used (Paas et al., 2003).

Renkl (2005) suggests that worked-examples are best used in "sequences of [[Worked-example effect#Faded worked examples|faded examples]] for certain problem types in order to foster understanding in skill acquisition," and that prompts, help system, and/or training be used to facilitate the learners' self-explanations. This view is supported by experimental findings comparing a faded worked-example procedure and a well-supported problem solving approach (Schwonke et al., 2009).

"However, it is important to note that studying [worked-examples] loses its effectiveness with increasing expertise" (Renkl, 2005), an effect known as the [[expertise reversal effect]] (Kalyuga, 2007). Further limitations of the classical worked-example method include "focusing on one single correct solution and on algorithmic skill domains" (Renkl, 2005). Addressing such restrictions in multimedia learning environments remains an area of active research (Renkl, 2005).

==Definitions==

===Worked example===
"A '''worked example''' is a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task or how to solve a problem" (Clark, Nguyen, Sweller, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;190). Worked-examples are designed to support initial acquisition of cognitive skills through introducing a formulated problem, solution steps and the final solution (Renkl, 2005).  Studying worked-examples is an effective instructional strategy to teach complex problem-solving skills (van Merriënboer, 1997). This is because example-based instruction provides expert mental models, to explain the steps of a solution for novices.

[[File:Worked Example.jpg|framed|center|A geometry worked-example using the tangent-radius property.]]

Worked examples, like the example above, are commonly found in mathematics or geometry textbooks, but they are also used in other fields. Worked-examples had been developed for music, chess, athletics, and computer programming (Atkinson, Derry, Renkl, &amp; Wortham, 2000).

===Faded worked examples===
{{See also|Expertise reversal effect#Addressing|l1=Addressing Expertise Reversal Effect}}

"In order to facilitate the transition from learning from worked examples in earlier stages of skill acquisition to problem solving in later stages, it is effective to successively fade out worked solution steps" (Renkl et al., 2004). Fading out steps in worked-example triggers self-explanation activities, which consists of the learners' own explanations to the reasons for the given solution steps (Renkl et al., 2004).

As learners gain expertise in the subject area of interest, worked-examples lose their effectiveness due to the expertise reversal effect. Using fade worked-examples addresses this effect by structuring the learners' transition from studying worked-example to learning with problem-solving. (Salden et al., 2008)

===Self-explanations===
According to Renkl (2005), self-explanations are "explanations provided by learners and mainly directed to themselves. They contain information that is not directly given in the learning materials and that refer to solution steps and the reasons for them. They can also refer to structural and surface features of problems or problem types."

"Self-explanations are important and necessary" (Chi et al., 1989) when working with worked-example as "successful learners studied the examples for longer periods and explained them more actively to themselves" (Chi et al., 1989). However, as most learners are passive and superficial self-explainers (Renkl, 1997), they "should be guided to actively self-explain worked-out examples" (Renkl, 2005).

==Evidence for==
The worked-example effect suggests that learning by studying worked examples is more effective than problem solving, and a number of research studies have demonstrated this effect. 

Sweller and Cooper were not the first to use this form of instruction, but certainly they were the first to describe it from a [[cognitive load]] perspective (Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985; Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987; Sweller, 1988). While studying problem-solving tactics, Sweller and Cooper used worked examples as a substitute for conventional problem-solving for those learning algebra. They found that learners who studied worked examples, performed significantly better than learners who actively solved problems (Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985; Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987). Sweller and Cooper (1985) had developed worked examples as a means of limiting problem solving search. It is important to note, that Sweller &amp; Cooper (1985) used worked-out example-problem pairs as opposed to individual worked examples.
Renkl (2005) suggests learning from worked-out examples is more effective when a series is used.  Pillay (1994) found that worked examples showing 3 intermediate problem stages were more effective than showing only one but suggested that the distance between stages needs to be small enough to allow students to connect them without having to create their own linkages.

Schwonke et al. (2009), in two experiments with Cognitive Tutors investigated the worked example effect. In one experiment, students used Geometry [[Cognitive Tutor]] which differed by the presentation of worked examples or not. In the experiment, students that were presented with worked examples needed less learning time to obtain the procedural skill and conceptual understanding of Geometry. In the second experiment, the authors aimed at avoiding the negative effects that occurred due to the lack of understanding of the purpose of worked examples, replicate the positive effects obtained in the first experiment and investigate the underlying learning approaches that explain why worked examples had greater efficiency effects. To achieve these objectives, the students were asked to think aloud, using the [[think aloud protocol]]. The results showed that the efficiency effect obtained in the first experiment was also replicated in the second experiment and the students had a deeper conceptual understanding (Schwonke et al., 2009).

Gog, Kester and Paas (2011) investigated the effectiveness of three strategies of example-based learning to problem solving on novices' cognitive load and learning; using electrical circuits troubleshooting tasks. The three strategies used are: worked example only, example-problem pairs and problem-example pairs. The results of the study showed that students in the worked example only and example-problems pair's conditions significantly outperformed students in the problem-example pair and problems solving conditions. It was also observed that higher performance was reached with significantly lower investment of mental efforts during the training (Gog, Kester and Paas, 2011).

===Expertise reversal effect===
Although a number of research studies have shown that worked-examples have positive effects on learners, Kalyuga et al. (2000, 2001a, b) showed that the worked-example effect is related to the expertise level of a learner, referred to as [[expertise reversal effect]]. In three studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) used worked examples in different experiments, on-screen diagrams in mechanical engineering, examples with explanatory based instruction on writing circuits for relay circuits and programming logic. In the different studies, (Kalyuga et al. 2000, 2001a, b) showed that the efficiency effect of worked examples became ineffective and often resulted in negative effects for more knowledgeable learners (Kalyuga, 2007).
However, Nievelstein et al. (2013) argues that both the worked-example effect and the expertise reversal effect that have been previously studied were based on well-structured cognitive tasks such as mechanics (Kalyuga et al. 2000). In a study using less-structured task, using legal cases, Nievelstein et al. (2013) investigates worked example effect and expertise reversal effects on both novice and advanced law students. The results of the study indicate that worked examples had efficiency effect for both the novice students and advanced law students, even though the advanced students had significantly more prior knowledge.

Another issue regarding worked examples was observed by Quilici &amp; Mayer (1996), who found that providing learners with three examples of each problem type, as opposed to one, did not result in any differences in students' ability to sort subsequent problems into the appropriate types.  As Wise &amp; O'Neill, pointed out, this is not to say additional guidance will never lead to learning gains; we just cannot assume it always will.

There is also some debate as to how complete the worked example needs to be.  Paas (1992) found that learners in a "completion" condition, who were given a problem only halfway worked out, performed just as well on test problems as those given the problems fully worked.

==Developing effective worked examples==
Ward and Sweller (1990) suggested that under some conditions "worked examples are no more effective, and possibly less effective, than solving problems" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). Thus it is important that worked examples be structured effectively, so that extraneous cognitive load does not impact learners. Chandler and Sweller (1992) suggested an important way to structure worked examples. They found that the integration of text and diagrams (within worked examples) reduces [[extraneous cognitive load]]. They referred to this single modality, attention learning effect as the [[split-attention effect]] (Chandler and Sweller, 1992). Tabbers, Martens, &amp; Van Merriënboer (2000) proposed that one may prevent split-attention by presenting text as audio.

Renkl (2005) suggests that students only gain deep understanding through worked-out examples when the examples:  
(1) are self-explanatory, 
(2) provide principle-based, minimalist, and example-relation instructional explanations as help
(3) show relations between different representations
(4) highlight structural features that are relevant for selecting the correct solution procedure
(5) isolate meaningful building blocks.

Not all worked examples are print-based as those in the Tarmizi and Sweller study. [http://www.davidlewisphd.com/publications/dlewis_aect2005paper.pdf Lewis (2005)] for instance, proposed animated demonstrations are a form of worked example. Animated demonstrations are useful because this multimedia presentation combines the worked example, and modality effects within a single instructional strategy.

==Audience==

===Novice learners===
As it turns out, worked examples are not appropriate for all learners. Learners with prior knowledge of the subject find this form of instruction redundant, and may suffer the consequences of this redundancy. This has been described as the [[expertise reversal effect]] (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 2003). It is suggested that worked examples be faded over time to be replaced with problems for practice [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.23.6816&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf (Renkl, Atkinson &amp; Maier, 2000)]. Thus it is important to consider the learner as well as the media while developing worked examples, else learners may not perform as expected.

Since worked-out examples include the steps toward reaching the solution; they can only be used in skill domains where algorithms can be applied (mathematics, physics, programming, etc.)(Renkl, 2005).  For creative pursuits such as interpreting poems, or learning contexts when there is an infinite number of potential confounding factors such as conflict resolution, effective leadership, or multicultural communication, solution steps are more difficult to describe and worked-out examples may not be the most effective instructional method.
Worked-out example approach is considered one of the best multimedia principles of learning mathematics. Worked examples helps to direct the learner's attention to what needs to be studied as well as developing literacy skills. It serves as a guide to preparing novice learners for effective problem solving after gaining an understanding of any concept under consideration.  Renkl (2005) argues that learners have a very restricted understanding of the domain when they try to solve problems without any worked examples. Thus, learners gain deep understanding of a skill domain when they receive worked-out examples in the beginning of cognitive skill acquisition. The examples give learners a clue on the right steps to solving the problem.

A recent research (Rourke, 2006) found that novice learners can still have difficulty understanding concepts if the given examples with incomplete or somewhat inaccurate information (known as faded examples) prior to acquiring basic domain knowledge or literacy skills in the subject matter. This is based on how novice and expert learner structure his or her learning schemas - knowing the appropriate procedure/approach to use in retrieving and interpreting the problem. On the other hand, worked out examples may constitute cognitive load and causing redundancy to learners with prior knowledge (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, &amp; Sweller, 2003), in contrast with novice learners in which worked out examples rather serve as a compass that provides direct guides to solving similar problems (Rourke, 2006). This also apply when novice learners evaluate prototypes, which embody the main characteristics of a work, worked examples. This can also assist the novice learner with the semantic processing needed to fully comprehend a work of art or design (Rourke, 2006).

Worked examples model is one of several strong cognitive-instruction techniques with great importance that help teachers foster learning. It is an application  principle that significantly enhances novice learners' patterns of knowledge acquisition in the contexts of authentic problem solving. Reed &amp; Bolstad (1991) indicate that one example may be insufficient for helping a student induce a usable idea and that the incorporation of a second example illustrating the idea, especially one that is more complex than the first, garners significant benefits for transfer performance. So, "at least add a second example" appears to be a basic rule for worked-examples instructional design. In addition, Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, &amp; Coulson (1991) affirmed that providing a wide range of examples (and having students emulate examples) that illustrate multiple strategies and approaches to similar problems help foster broad knowledge transfer and "cognitive flexibility".

The instructional model of example-based learning by Renkl and Atkinson (2007) suggests that students gain a deeper understanding of domain principles when they receive worked examples at the beginning of cognitive skill acquisition.

The words derive from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ξένος (''xenos''), "foreigner" and γλῶσσα (''glōssa''), "tongue" or "language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dglw%3Dssa γλῶσσα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The term xenoglossy was ostensibly coined by French [[parapsychologist]] [[Charles Richet]] in 1905. Stories of xenoglossy are found in the Bible, and contemporary claims of xenoglossy have been made by parapsychologists and [[reincarnation]] researchers such as [[Ian Stevenson]]. There is no scientific evidence that xenoglossy is an actual phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''.

==History==
Stories of the [[miracle|miraculous]] abilities of certain individuals to read, write, speak, or understand a foreign language that appear in the Bible and other Christian religious literature went on to inspire similar accounts and stories during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Cooper-Rompato2011"&gt;{{citation|author=Christine F.

More recent claims of xenoglossy have come from reincarnation researchers who have alleged that individuals were able to recall a language spoken in a past life.&lt;ref name=Gordon /&gt; Some reports of xenoglossy have surfaced in the popular press, such as Czech speedway rider [[Matěj Kůs]] who in September 2007 supposedly awoke after a crash and was able to converse in perfect English; however press reports of his fluency in English were based entirely on anecdotal stories told by his Czech teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=481651&amp;in_page_id=1770 Czech speedway rider knocked out in crash wakes up speaking perfect English | the Daily Mail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,91059-1284155,00.html Crash Victim Wakes Up Speaking English]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable claims==

===Ian Stevenson===
[[Parapsychologist]] and psychiatrist at the University of Virginia [[Ian Stevenson]] claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of xenoglossy. These included two where a subject under hypnosis could allegedly converse with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy".&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich.edu"/&gt;

*When Stevenson investigated an American housewife known as "T. E" who exhibited the male personality of a Swedish farmer named "Jensen Jacoby" while under hypnosis, he reported that the subject was able to converse in Swedish, albeit not fluently. However, Thomason's reanalysis concluded that "Jensen" could not convincingly be claimed to speak Swedish; writing that though "Jensen" had a total vocabulary of about 100 words, "this is not very impressive when compared with the thousands of words known by any native speaker of any natural language, even taking into account the limited contexts in which Jensen spoke Swedish."&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich.edu"/&gt; Thomason found that "Jensen" gave no complex sentences, mostly giving one or two word answers, and concluded, "[Stevenson's] demonstration that there was no fraud in the case is convincing, but his claim that Jensen had the capacity to speak Swedish is not."&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich.edu"/&gt; Linguist William Samarin drew the same conclusion as Thomason.&lt;ref&gt;Samarin, William J. (1976). ''Review of Ian Stevenson Xenoglossy: A Review and Report of a Case''. ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'' 52: 270-274.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stevenson also investigated another American woman named Dolores Jay who exhibited the personality of a German teenage girl named "Gretchen" while hypnotized. He claimed that the subject was able to converse in German. Thomason's reanalysis, while acknowledging that the evidence against fraud was convincing, concluded that "Gretchen" could not converse fluently in German and that her speech was largely the repetition of German questions with different intonation, or [[utterance]]s of one or two words. Thomason found that the German vocabulary of "Gretchen" was "minute" and her pronunciation was "spotty", adding that Dolores Jay had some previous exposure to German in TV programs and had looked at a German book.&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich.edu"/&gt;

William J. Samarin, a linguist from the [[University of Toronto]] has written that Stevenson had chosen to correspond with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He noted that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist for a period of six years "without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know." He also wrote that most of Stevenson's collaborators were "fellow believers" in the paranormal, starting with a preconceived notion.&lt;ref&gt;Samarin, William J. (1976). ''Xenoglossy: A Review and Report of a Case by Ian Stevenson''. ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]''. Vol. 52, No. 1. pp. 270-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. William Frawley in a review for Stevenson's ''Unlearned Language: New Studies in Xenoglossy'' (1984) wrote that he was too uncritically accepting of a paranormal interpretation of the cases. In one case a female subject could only answer yes or no questions in German which Frawley found unimpressive. In another, the female subject could speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]] with a poor pronunciation. Frawley noted that she was raised on the language of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (related to Bengali), had studied [[Sanskrit]] from which both Marathi and Bengali derive and was living in a town with thousands of [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]. He concluded "Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, William. (1985). ''Unlearned Language: New Studies in Xenoglossy by Ian Stevenson''. ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]''. Vol. 61, No. 3. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist David Lester also evaluated Stevenson's cases and wrote the subjects made grammatical mistakes, mispronounced words and did not show a wide vocabulary of words in foreign language, thus they cannot be considered evidence for xenoglossy.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, David. (2005). ''Is There Life After Death? An Examination of the Empirical Evidence''. McFarland. pp. 123-131. {{ISBN|978-0786421169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alfred Hulme===

In the early 20th century Alfred Hulme, a self-proclaimed [[Egyptologist]], investigated a young girl named Ivy Carter Beaumont also known as "Rosemary" from [[Blackpool]], [[England]] who claimed to be under the influence of the personality of a Babylonian princess. Hulme was convinced she spoke in an [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] dialect. However, according to linguist [[Karen Stollznow]] "Several scholars examined the data independently and concluded that Hulme's analyses were grossly inaccurate. Hulme had confused Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian [...] they also found evidence that he had falsified many results."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Stollznow|Stollznow, Karen]]. (2014).

'''Yale World Fellows''' is an international fellowship program at [[Yale University]] for mid-career emerging leaders who have distinguished themselves in their profession, discipline, or geographic region. Each year, between fifteen and twenty participants, known as World Fellows, reside at Yale for the fall academic term.

World Fellows are selected from a wide range of fields and disciplines including government, business, nongovernmental organizations, religion, military, media, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Yale World Fellows Program |author=U.S. Embassy, Seoul, Korea |publisher =U.S. Department of State |url = http://seoul.usembassy.gov/p_an_111708.html | year =2008 |accessdate =19 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Yale, World Fellows participate in a global affairs seminar, leadership workshops, and Yale courses.

The program's main facilities are located in [[Betts House (Yale University)|Betts House]], a university-owned mansion in the [[Prospect Hill Historic District (New Haven, Connecticut)|Prospect Hill Historic District]] of [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Origin==
In November 2000, University President [[Rick Levin]] announced several internationalization initiatives, including the World Fellows program, in conjunction with the university's tercentenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Folk |first=Elyssa |title=Yale To Go Global in Its Fourth Century |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=20 April 2001 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2001/04/20/yale-to-go-global-in-its-fourth-century/ |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and [[White House]] aide [[Brooke Shearer]] was appointed its founding director, and [[Dan Esty]] its first program director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n11/story1.html |accessdate=25 April 2014 |title=Strobe Talbott to head Center for Study of Globalization |magazine=Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar |volume=29 |number=11 |date=17 November 2011 |publisher=Yale Office of Public Affairs &amp; Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program moved into Betts House, restored in 2001 to house new international initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v30.n7/story1.html |accessdate=24 April 2014 |title=Davies Mansion To Be Renovated, Renamed |journal=Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar |publisher=Yale Office of Public Affairs &amp; Communications |volume=30 |number=7 |date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first class of fellows was admitted in 2002.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Sarah |title=First batch of World Fellows selected |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=24 April 2002 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2002/04/24/first-batch-of-world-fellows-selected/ |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Class |last=Shufro |first=Kathy |magazine=[[Yale Alumni Magazine]] |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2005_05/fellows.html |date=May–June 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the program's establishment, 257 World Fellows have been selected for the program, representing 83 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramiah |first=Uma | title=Sixteen global leaders named 2014 Yale World Fellows |website=Yale News |publisher=Yale Office of Public Affairs &amp; Communications |url=http://news.yale.edu/2014/04/07/sixteen-global-leaders-named-2014-yale-world-fellows |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
[[File:Betts House horizontal Highsmith.jpg|thumb|right|[[Betts House (Yale University)|Betts House]], the program's administrative building]]
The center of the Yale World Fellows Program is a 15-week global affairs [[seminar]] taught by distinguished Yale faculty. Each class of World Fellows is exposed to both classical philosophical texts and current academic research.&lt;ref name="ARMACAD"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale World Fellows Program 2014| author=Armenian Association for Academic Partnership and Support (ARMACAD) |publisher=ARMACAD |url=http://armacad.blogspot.com/2013/08/2014-yale-world-fellows-program-is-now.html |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions are facilitated by [[Yale School of Management]] faculty in entrepreneurship and innovation. They also receive individualized coaching in public speaking.&lt;ref name="Zelizer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Call for Applications: Yale World Fellows Program, Yale University |last=Zelizer |first=Craig |publisher=Alliance for Peacebuilding |url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/10/call-for-applications-yale-world-fellows-program-yale-university/ |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an off-the-record conversation series, Fellows have the opportunity to ask questions of global practitioners(?). The program has hosted leaders like [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], former heads of state [[Ernesto Zedillo]] and [[Tony Blair]], [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justices]] [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and writers [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] and [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]].&lt;ref name="Zelizer" /&gt;

Fellows can audit almost any course offered at Yale University with the opportunity to develop individual or collaborative research projects. They also spend time with Yale faculty and students, giving lectures and engaging in informal dialogue.&lt;ref name="ARMACAD" /&gt; While most program activities take place on campus in New Haven, the program sponsors trips to New York City and Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Yale World Fellows Program 2014 |last=Omolayo |first=Louis | publisher=International Youth Council |url=http://internationalyouthcouncil.com/forum/topics/yale-world-fellows-program |date =30 October 2013 | accessdate =19 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The program sponsors a variety of events every year, including global conferences, multimedia exhibitions, and panel discussions on current events. World Fellows often initiate their own collaborative projects while at Yale, such as the Seven Billionth Person Project, an international multimedia effort that invites people to share through writings and art what they would say to the world's seven billionth baby, expected to be born sometime in 2011. In the same year, the Yale World Fellows hosted Yale University's first [[TED (conference)|TEDx]] event, "TEDx Yale World Fellows". The Return to Yale Forum is held every other year, and brings together current and former World Fellows to meet and engage in debates about contemporary issues. The most recent Forum was held in October 2013 and included discussions on social entrepreneurship, corporate thinking, activism, art and culture and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =World Fellows Forum encourages rethinking of ideas |last=Salam |first=Akash |newspaper =[[Yale Daily News]] |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/10/15/world-fellows-forum-encourages-rethinking-of-ideas/ |date=15 October 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Fellows Program also sponsors an annual Global Leadership Series conference. At these conferences held in cities internationally, World Fellows alumni, leaders in the region, prospective World Fellows nominees, and others debate selected global topics. Past conferences have addressed issues such as the United Nations Global Compact's contribution for addressing corporate social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Yale Convenes Conference on Occasion of Global Compact's 10th Anniversary| author=Deniz Ozturk |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/35-05-28-2010 |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate =24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Candidates for the program must be:
:*a citizen of a country other than the United States;
:*fluent in English;
:*in their early mid-career, roughly 5–20 years into their professional lives.

Approximately 15–20 World Fellows are selected for the program each year. World Fellows are selected for their work accomplishments and indications of future contributions and leadership. They are required to reside full-time at Yale and participate in university life. In 2013, approximately 2,500 candidates applied for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Powell |first=Leslie |title=Yale selects its 2013 World Fellows |url=http://news.yale.edu/2013/04/02/yale-selects-its-2013-world-fellows |date=2 April 2013 |website=Yale News |publisher=Yale Office of Public Affairs and Communications |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates can be nominated by anyone, or can apply of their own initiative. Regional panels review semifinalist candidates, and a final selection committee aims to assemble a class of fellows that is diverse, geographically balanced, and representative of a wide range of professions, talents, and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Yale World Fellows Program for Mid-Career Leaders |author=mladi info |publisher =mladi info |url=http://www.mladiinfo.eu/blog/2013/11/13/yale-world-fellows-program-for-mid-career-leaders/ |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate =19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
