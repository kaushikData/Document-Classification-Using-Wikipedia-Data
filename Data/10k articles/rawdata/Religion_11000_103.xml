'''Abel Clarin de la Rive''' (1855, [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], France – 1914, Chalon-sur-Saône) was a French historian, essayist, journalist, and anti-[[Masonic]] writer.

Clarin de la Rive became a notable writer within the US, due to his direct involvement in the [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic movement]] within the US, and due to his involvement with [[Léo Taxil]] (pseudonym of Marie-Joseph Gabriel-Antoine Jogand-Pages), the author of the [[Taxil hoax]], along with Clarin de la Rive's unbeknown fictitious writing about [[Albert Pike]], who had become the [[Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA)|Sovereign Grand Commander]] of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction of the US in 1859, which is an appendant body of [[Freemasonry]].

In the April, 1897 issue of the magazine, ''Freemasonry Unmasked'', Clarin de la Rive wrote an article about [[Léo Taxil]], after Taxil revealed his anti-Masonic writings to be a hoax, which became known as the [[Taxil hoax]], on April 19, 1897. A. C. de la Rive recanted much of what he wrote about Freemasonry, since he used the writings and correspondence of Taxil as his source for the 'official documents of the sect', especially in his book, ''Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry''.&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry?

His published works have been quoted and cited by many conspiracy theorists, anti-Masons, and mystics in the US and elsewhere, such as [[Edith Starr Miller]] and [[William Guy Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception-Freemason_Lucifer_Albert_Pike Lucifer is the god of Freemasonry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lady Queenborough (Edith Starr Miller), Occult Theocrasy, p. 220-223 Abbeville, France: F.

Kolko-Rivera Ph.D]], ''Freemasonry: An Introduction '', Published, 2011, Penguin Group, USA, Inc., Chap. 6 {{ISBN|1585428531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, when de la Rive's book, ''Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry'', became available, numerous anti-Masons and religious leaders, both [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]], used the work to denounce Freemasonry and Albert Pike throughout the US, and to show that Freemasonry "Palladism" was actually a religion of [[Satanism]], even though no such thing as Palladism existed. Taxil and his hoax are mentioned in the [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], under the article on impostors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07698b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia on Impostors&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After de la Rive studied at a Dominican college, he became a journalist in 1873; first with ''Courrier de Saône-et-Loire'', then with ''La Belgique''. From 1879 to 1886, he was a senior journalist for various newspapers: ''La Côte d'Or'', ''La Gazette du Centre'', and ''Le Franc-Bourguignon''. de la Rive was a publishing friend of [[Léo Taxil]], and succeeded him as the manager of the weekly magazine, ''Christian Antimasonic France'', in January 1896, a position he held until his death in July 1914. Under de la Rive, the magazine changed its name to ''The Antimasonic France'', and the publication ended with him. Clarin de la Rive ran the Antimasonic Council of France, of which ''The Antimasonic France'' was a publication thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Chaboud]], ''La Franc-maçonnerie, histoire, mythes et réalité'', Librio, 2004, p.33 {{ISBN|2290349089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Waterfield]], ''Rene Guenon and the Future of the West'', Published, 1987, p.32-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freemasonry Unmasked==
[[Albert Pike]] had written his book, [[Morals and Dogma]], which spoke about the definition of the word "[[Lucifer]]", that Taxil used for his hoax. Next, while de la Rive was working under Taxil, at the magazine ''Christian Antimasonic France'', Taxil convinced him that Diana Vaughan, a fictitious character in his writing, was real, and that she was admitted into [[Freemasonry]], where she supposedly saw Satanism within the Scottish Rite building firsthand, at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Taxil then gave de la Rive, what was supposed to be an encyclical written by Albert Pike, which he subsequently used as source material for his book, ''Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry''.

However, Diana Vaughan being the name of Taxil's typist, she never had been a Freemason, nor did she experience any of the purported rituals described in said text. Taxil admitted to these being false, in his confession about the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36 &amp; 195-228, Chap. 3, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry, and Appendix 1, The Confession of Leo Taxil {{ISBN|1590771532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have never been allowed to join a [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]] of regular Freemasonry. In de la Rive's book, he wrote that Pikes [[encyclical]], which Diana supposedly brought to France, claimed that Freemasonry had a secret group known as the Palladium, that [[God]] and Lucifer were one and the same, and that Freemasonry was a religion, to which the membership of Freemasonry, under the 30th degree in the Scottish Rite, were kept ignorant of.

After Taxil admitted to the hoax, in April, 1897, Clarin de la Rive recanted what he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo  and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry {{ISBN|1590771532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting A. C. de la Rive in ''Freemasonry Unmasked'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;With frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here, [Taxil], declared before an assembly, especially convened for him, that for twelve years, he had prepared and carried out to the end, the most extraordinary and most sacrilegious of hoaxes. We have always been careful to publish special articles concerning Palladism and Diana Vaughan. We are now giving, in this issue, a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, in his book, ''Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry'', de la Rive wrote three paragraphs that he laid to [[Albert Pike]], which he sourced in a footnote to Diana Vaughn, Léo Taxil's fictitious creation. This writing is part of the texts that Clarin de la Rive recanted, and said that they should not be considered to have ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo  and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry {{ISBN|1590771532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text in mention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which we must say to the world is that we worship a god, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the higher degrees, maintained in the Purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?

Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods; darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive....

Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy, and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Footnote in ''Woman and child in Universal Freemasonry'':&lt;ref&gt;Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo  and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry {{ISBN|1590771532}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;*It was the Sister Diana Vaughan that Albert Pike,--in order to give her the greatest mark of confidence,--charged to carry his luciferian encyclical, to Paris, during the Universal Exposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley''' refers to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] military conquest and occupation for about two centuries of territories of the North-western regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The conquest of the areas as far as the [[Indus river]] is often dated to the time of [[Cyrus the Great]], in the period between 550-539 BCE.{{sfn|Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization|1999|pages=116-117}} The first secure epigraphic evidence, given by the [[Behistun Inscription]] inscription, gives a date before or about 518 BCE. Achaemenid penetration into the area of the Indian subcontinent occurred in stages, starting from northern parts of the [[River Indus]] and moving southward.&lt;ref&gt;(Fussman, 1993, p. 84).{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} "This is inferred from the fact that Gandhara (OPers. Gandāra) is already mentioned at [[Behistun Inscription|Bisotun]], while the toponym Hinduš ([[History of Sindh|Sindhu]]) is added only in later inscriptions."&lt;/ref&gt; These areas of the Indus valley became formal Achaemenid satrapies as mentioned in several Achaemenid inscriptions. The Achaemenid occupation of the Indus Valley ended with the [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great]] circa 323 BCE.{{sfn|Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization|1999|pages=116-117}} The Achaemenid occupation, although less successful than that of the later [[Indo-Greeks|Greeks]], [[Indo-Scythians|Saka]]s or [[Kushans]], had the effect of acquainting India to the outer world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=Sailendra Nath |title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization |date=1999 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=9788122411980 |pages=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA118 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Achaemenid Empire]] underwent a considerable expansion, both east and west, during the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]] (c.600–530 BC), leading the dynasty to take an interest into the region of northwestern India.{{sfn|Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization|1999|pages=116-117}}

According to Herodotus, Darius I sent the Greek explorer [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to sail down the [[Indus river]], heading a team of spies, in order to explore the course of the Indus river.

Also according to Herodotus, the territories of Gandhara, Sattagydia, Dadicae and Aparytae formed the 7th province of the Achaemenid Empire for tax-payment purposes, while ''Indus'' (called ''Ἰνδός'', "Indos" in Greek sources) formed the 20th tax region.

These events were recorded in the imperial inscriptions of the Achaemenids (the Behistun inscription and the Naqsh-i-Rustam inscription, as well as the accounts of [[Herodotus]] (483–431 BCE), and of the Hellenistic accounts of the [[Greek conquests in India]] (circa 320 BCE). The Greek Scylax of Caryanda, who had been appointed by Darius I to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to Suez left an account, the ''Periplous'', of which fragments from secondary sources have survived. [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (circa 500 BCE) also wrote about the "Indus Satrapies" of the Achaemenids.

When [[Wars of Alexander the Great|Alexander invaded the region]], he did not encounter Achaemenid satraps in the Indian provinces, but local Indian rulers referred to as ''hyparchs'' ("Vice-Regents"), a term that connotes subordination to the Achaemenid rulers.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}} The local rulers may have reported to the satraps of Bactria and Arachosia.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}

Herodotus (III-91 and III-94), gives a list with a slightly different structure, as some province which are presented separately in the Achaemenid inscriptions are grouped together by Herodotus when he described the tribute paid by each territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire|1948|pp=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html Herodotus III 91], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html Herodotus III 94]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mitchiner, The Ancient &amp; Classical World|1978|p=44}} Herodotus presents ''Indos'' ([[:Wikt:Ἰνδός|Ἰνδός]]) as "the 20th province", while "the Sattagydae, Gandarii, [[Dadicae]], and [[Aparytae]]" together form "the 7th Province".{{sfn|Mitchiner, The Ancient &amp; Classical World|1978|p=44}} According to historian A.&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;Olmstead, the fact that some Achaemenid regions are grouped together in this list may have represented some loss of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire|1948|pp=291–292}}: "...the official tribute list incorporated by Herodotus shows decided administrative change. As under Cyrus, there were again twenty satrapies, but the larger number of Darius had been reduced by the union of some hitherto separate. This process, already to be detected in the army list of Xerxes, but accelerated in the tribute list of Artaxerxes, again suggests actual loss of territory. ''(25 lines later)''.... Two satrapies are united in the case of the Sattagydians, Gandarians, Dadicae, and Aparytae, whose tribute was 170 talents."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Hindūš'' province, remained loyal till Alexander's invasion.{{sfn|Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire|1948|pp=291–292}} Circa 400 BC, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]] related that the Persian king was receiving numerous gifts from the kings of "India" (''Hindūš'').&lt;ref name="Iranica - Achaemenid Relations"&gt;{{cite web |title=INDIA  RELATIONS: ACHAEMENID PERIOD – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/india-iii-relations-achaemenid-period |website=www.iranicaonline.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ctesias: "The Indians also include this substance among their most precious gifts for the Persian king who receives it as a prize revered above all others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Fragments of Ctesias of Cnidus |pages=120-121 |url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0022521/00001 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ctesias also reported Indian elephants and Indian [[mahouts]] making demonstrations of the elephant's strength at the Achaemenid court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Fragments of Ctesias of Cnidus |page=Page 116 Fragment F45bα) and Page 219 Note F45bα) |url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0022521/00001 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 380 BC, the Persian hold on the region was weakening, but the area continued to be a part of the Achaemenid Empire until [[Alexander's invasion of India|Alexander's invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;The hypothesis that the region had already become independent by the end of the reign of Darius I or during the reign of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (Chattopadhyaya, 1974, pp. 25-26) appears to be contradicted by Ctesias’s reference to gifts received from the kings of India and by the fact that even Darius III still had some Indian units in his army (Briant, 1996, pp. 699, 774). At the time of the arrival of the [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] Macedonian army in the Indus Valley, there is no mention of officers of the Persian kings in India; but this does not mean (Dittmann, 1984, p. 185) that the Achaemenids had no power there. Other data indicate that they still exercised control over the area, although in ways that differed from those of Darius I’s time (Briant, 1996, pp. 776-78).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darius III]] (c. 380 – July 330 BC) still had Indian units in his army.&lt;ref name="Iranica - Achaemenid Relations"/&gt; In particular he had 15 [[war elephants]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] for his fight against [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kistler |first1=John M. |title=War Elephants |date=2007 |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |isbn=0803260040 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5RHK4Ol15QC&amp;pg=PA29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliefs at the [[Apadana Palace]] in [[Persepolis]] describe tribute bearers from 23 satrapies visiting the Achaemenid court. These are located at the southern end of the Apadana Staircase. Among the foreigners the Arabs, the Thracians, the Bactrians, the Indians (from the Indus valley area), the Parthians, the Cappadocians, the Elamites or the Medians.

The conquered area was the most fertile and populous region of the Achaemenid Empire. An amount of tribute was fixed according to the richness of each territory.{{sfn|Archibald, Davies &amp; Gabrielsen, The Economies of Hellenistic Societies|2011|p=404}}&lt;ref name="Herodotus III.89-95"/&gt; India was already fabled for its gold.

[[Herodotus]] (who makes [[India (Herodotus)|several comments on India]]) published [[Districts of the Achaemenid Empire|a list of tribute-paying nations]], classifying them in 20 Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html#ref6 III, 89]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mitchiner, The Ancient &amp; Classical World|1978|p=44}} The Province of ''Indos'' ([[:Wikt:Ἰνδός|Ἰνδός]], the [[Indus valley]]) formed the 20th Province, and was the richest and most populous of the Achaemenid Provinces.

{{quote|''The Indians ( Ἰνδῶν) made up the twentieth province. These are more in number than any nation known to me, and they paid a greater tribute than any other province, namely three hundred and sixty talents of gold dust.''|[[Herodotus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html III 94].{{sfn|Mitchiner, The Ancient &amp; Classical World|1978|p=44}}}}

According to Herodotus, the "Indians" ('Ινδοι, ''Indoi''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*%29indoi%2F&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*%29indoi%2F0&amp;prior=oi( 'Ινδοι], Greek Word Study Tool, Tufts University&lt;/ref&gt;), as separate from the Gandarei and the Sattagydians, formed the 20th taxation Province, and were required to supply gold dust in tribute to the Achaemenid central government for an amount of 360 Euboean [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] (equivalent to about 8300kg or 8.3 tons of gold annually, a volume of gold that would fit in a cube of side 75cm).{{sfn|Archibald, Davies &amp; Gabrielsen, The Economies of Hellenistic Societies|2011|p=404}}&lt;ref name="Herodotus III.89-95"/&gt; The exchange rate between gold and silver at the time of Herodotus being 13 to 1, this was equal in value to the very large amount of 4680 Euboean talents of silver, equivalent to 3600 Babylonian talents of silver (equivalent in value to about 108 tons of silver annually).{{sfn|Archibald, Davies &amp; Gabrielsen, The Economies of Hellenistic Societies|2011|p=404}}&lt;ref name="Herodotus III.89-95"/&gt; The country of the "Indians" ('Ινδοι, ''Indoi'') was the Achaemenid district paying the largest tribute, and alone represented 32% of the total tribute revenues of the whole Achaemenid Empire.{{sfn|Archibald, Davies &amp; Gabrielsen, The Economies of Hellenistic Societies|2011|p=404}}&lt;ref name="Herodotus III.89-95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica - Achaemenid Relations"/&gt; It also means that ''Indos'' was the richest Achaemenid region in the subcontinent, much richer than Gandara or Sattagydia.&lt;ref name="Iranica - Achaemenid Relations"/&gt; However the amount of gold in question is quite enormous, so there is a possibility that Herodotus was mistaken and that his own sources actually only meant something like the gold equivalent of 360 Babylonian talents of silver.&lt;ref name="CAH"/&gt; 

[[File:Apadana Palace Gandharans.jpg |thumb|right|upright=1.6|Gandaran delegation at [[Apadana Palace]].]]
The territories of [[Gandara (Achaemenid province)|Gandara]], [[Sattagydia]], [[Dadicae]] (north-west of the [[Kashmir valley]]) and the [[Aparytae]] ([[Afridi]]s) are named separately, and were aggregated together for taxation purposes, forming the 7th Achaemenid Province, and paying overall a much lower tribute of 170 talents together (about 5151kg, or 5.1 tons of silver), hence only about 1.5% of the total revenues of the Achaemenid Empire:{{sfn|Archibald, Davies &amp; Gabrielsen, The Economies of Hellenistic Societies|2011|p=404}}&lt;ref name="Herodotus III.89-95"&gt;Herodotus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html Book III, 89-95]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contribution to Achaemenid war efforts===
Indians were employed in the Achaemenid army of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] (480-479 BCE), and "Indian troops marched with Xerxes's army across the [[Hellespont]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=FLEMING |first1=DAVID |title=Where was Achaemenid India? |date=1993 |page=70 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24048427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CB7"/&gt; Herodotus, in his description of the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army invading Greece, described the equipment of the Indians:&lt;ref name="CB7"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beckwith |first1=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400866328 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlCUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus also explains that the Indian cavalry under the Achaemenids had an equipment similar that of their foot soldiers:

{{quote|''The Indians were armed in like manner as their foot; they rode swift horses and drove chariots drawn by horses and wild asses.''|Herodotus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7B*.html VII 86]}}

The Gandharis had a different equipment, akin to that of the Bactrians:

{{quote|''The Bactrians in the army wore a headgear most like to the Median, carrying their native bows of reed, and short spears. (...) The Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, Gandarians, and Dadicae in the army had the same equipment as the Bactrians. The Parthians and Chorasmians had for their commander Artabazus son of Pharnaces, the Sogdians Azanes son of Artaeus, the Gandarians and Dadicae Artyphius son of Artabanus.''|Herodotus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7B*.html VII 64-66]}}

Indian soldiers of the three territories of Gandara, Sattagydia (Tathagatus) and Hindush are shown, together with soldiers of all the other nations, supporting the throne of their Achaemenid ruler, at Naqsh-e Rostam on the tombs of Darius I, [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]] and [[Darius II]], and at [[Persepolis]] on the tombs of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] and [[Artaxerxes III]]. The last Achaemenid ruler [[Darius III]] never had time to finish his own tomb due to his hasty defeat by [[Alexander the Great]], and therefore does not have such depictions.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}&lt;ref name="Iranica Naqsh-e Rostam"&gt;{{cite book |title=NAQŠ-E ROSTAM – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/naqs-e-rostam |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers from India are characterized by their particular clothing, only composed of a loin cloth and sandals, with bare upper body, in contrast to all the other ethnicities of the Achaemenid army, who are fully clothed, and in contrast also to the neighbouring provinces of [[Bactria]] or [[Arachosia]], who are also fully clothed.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}

[[File:Artaxerxes III Soldiers of the Empire.jpg|thumb|300px|The three types of Indian soldiers still appear (upper right corner) among the soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire on the tomb of [[Artaxerxes III]] (who died in 338 BCE).{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}&lt;ref name="Iranica Naqsh-e Rostam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heckel |first1=Waldemar |last2=Tritle |first2=Lawrence A. |title=Alexander the Great: A New History |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444360158 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZPcdr5yYs0C&amp;pg=PA164 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The presence of the three ethnicities of Indian soldiers on the all the tombs of the Achaemenid rulers after [[Darius I|Darius]], except for the last ruler [[Darius III]] who was vanquished by Alexander at Gaugamela, suggest that the Indians were under Achaemenid dominion at least until 338 BCE, date of the end of the reign of [[Artaxerxes III]], before the accession of Darius III, that is, less than 10 years before the campaigns of Alexander in the East and his victory at [[Gaugamela]].{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}

;Indians at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE)
According to [[Arrian]], Indian troops were still deployed under Darius III at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BCE). He explains that Darius III "obtained the help of those Indians who bordered on the Bactrians, together with the Bactrians and Sogdianians themselves, all under the command of Bessus, the Satrap of Bactria".{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}} The Indians in questions were probably from the area of Gandara.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}} Indian "hill-men" are also said by Arrian to have joined the [[Arachosia|Arachotian]]s under Satrap Barsentes, and are thought to have been either the Sattagydians or the Hindush.{{sfn|Magee et al., The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations|2005|pp=713-714}}

Coin finds in the [[Chaman Hazouri hoard]] in [[Kabul]],  or the Shaikhan Dehri hoard in [[Pushkalavati]] in Gandhara, near [[Charsadda]], as well as in the [[Bhir Mound]] hoard in Taxila, have revealed numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE which circulated in the area, at least as far as the [[Indus]] during the reign of the Achaemenids, who were in control of the areas as far as Gandhara.{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pp=300-301}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/afgh05-106.html US Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JC/&gt;{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pp=308-}}

===Kabul and Bhir Mound hoards===
{{see also|Kabul hoard}}
The [[Kabul hoard]], also called the Chaman Hazouri, Chaman Hazouri or Tchamani-i Hazouri hoard,{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pp=300-301}} is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. The hoard, discovered in 1933, contained numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name=JC/&gt; Approximately one thousand coins were in the hoard.{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pp=300-301}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/afgh05-106.html US Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard is dated to approximately 380 BCE as no coins in the hoard were later than that date.{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|p=308}}

This numismatic discovery has been very important in studying and dating the history of [[coinage of India]], since it is one of the very rare instances when punch-marked coins can actually be dated, due to their association with known and dated Greek and Achaemenid coins in the hoard.{{sfn|Cribb, Investigating the introduction of coinage in India|1983|pp=85-86}} The hoard supports the view that punch-marked coins existed in 360 BCE, as suggested by literary evidence.{{sfn|Cribb, Investigating the introduction of coinage in India|1983|pp=85-86}}

[[Daniel Schlumberger]] also considers that punch-marked bars, similar to the many punch-marked bars found in north-western India, initially originated in the Achaemenid Empire, rather than in the Indian heartland:

{{quote|“The punch-marked bars were up to now considered to be Indian (...) However the weight standard is considered by some expert to be Persian, and now that we see them also being uncovered in the soil of Afghanistan, we must take into account the possibility that their country of origin should not be sought beyond the Indus, but rather in the oriental provinces of the Achaemenid Empire"|[[Daniel Schlumberger]], quoted from Trésors Monétaires, p.42.{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pp=308-}}}}

Modern numismatists now tend to consider the Achaemenid punch-marked coins as the precursors of the Indian [[punch-marked coins]].&lt;ref&gt;"the local coins of the Achaemenid era (...) were the precursors of the bent and punch-marked bars" in {{cite book |last1=Bopearachchi |first1=Osmund |title=“Coin Production and Circulation in Central Asia and North-West India (Before and after Alexander’s Conquest)” |pages=311 |url=https://www.academia.edu/15798938/_Coin_Production_and_Circulation_in_Central_Asia_and_North-West_India_Before_and_after_Alexander_s_Conquest_ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;About the hoard in Kabul: "In the same hoard there were also discovered two series of local silver coins which appear to be the product of local Achaemenid administration. One series (...) was made in a new way, which relates it to the punch-marked silver coins of India. It appears that it was these local coins, using technology adapted from Greek coins, which provided the prototypes for punch-marked coins made in India." p.57 "In the territories to the south of the Hindu Kush the punch-marked coins, descendants of the local coins of the Achaemenid administration in the same area, were issued by the Mauryan kings of India for local circulation." in {{cite book |last1=Errington |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Trust |first2=Ancient India and Iran |last3=Museum |first3=Fitzwilliam |title=The Crossroads of Asia: transformation in image and symbol in the art of ancient Afghanistan and Pakistan |date=1992 |publisher=Ancient India and Iran Trust |isbn=9780951839911 |pages=57-59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfLpAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pushkalavati hoard===
{{see also|Shaikhan Dehri hoard}}
In 2007 a small coin hoard was discovered at the site of ancient [[Pushkalavati]] (the [[Shaikhan Dehri hoard]]) near [[Charsada]] in [[Pakistan]]. The hoard contained a [[tetradrachm]] minted in [[Athens]] circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots. The hoard contained a [[tetradrachm]] minted in [[Athens]] circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, typically used as a currency for trade in the Achaemenid Empire, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots. The Athens coin is the earliest known example of its type to be found so far to the east.&lt;ref&gt;O. Bopearachchi, “Premières frappes locales de l’Inde du Nord-Ouest: nouvelles données,” in Trésors d’Orient: Mélanges offerts à Rika Gyselen, Fig. 1 (this coin) [https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=199773 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|p=309}}

According to [[Joe Cribb]], these early Greek coins were at the origin of Indian [[punch-marked coins]], the earliest coins developed in India, which used minting technology derived from Greek coinage.&lt;ref name=JC /&gt;

===Aramaic language and script===
[[File:Sirkap_Aramaic_inscription_4th_century_BC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|The [[Aramaic Inscription of Taxila]].]]
The [[Aramaic]] language, official language of the Achaemenid Empire, started to be used in the Indian territories.&lt;ref name=JM&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=A Guide to Taxila |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107615441 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEMbH2aDO0UC&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] in the north-western areas of Ashoka's territory, in modern [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], used [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (the official language of the former Achaemenid Empire), together with [[Prakrit]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (the language of the neighbouring [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom and the Greek communities in Ashoka's realm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |pages=73-76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian [[Kharosthi script]] shows a clear dependency on the [[Aramaic alphabet]] but with extensive modifications to support the sounds found in Indic languages.{{sfn|Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization|1999|pages=116-117}} One model is that the Aramaic script arrived with the Achaemenid Empire's conquest of the [[Indus River]] (modern Pakistan) in 500&amp;nbsp;BCE and evolved over the next 200+ years, reaching its final form by the 3rd century BCE where it appears in some of the Edicts of Ashoka.&lt;ref name=JM/&gt;{{sfn|Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization|1999|pages=116-117}}

====Edicts of Ashoka====
The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (circa 250 BCE) may show Achaemenid influences, including formulaic parallels with Achaemenid inscriptions, presence of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] loanwords (in [[Official Aramaic|Aramaic]] inscriptions), and the very act of engraving edicts on rocks and mountains (compare for example Behistun inscription).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sagar |first1=Krishna Chandra |title=Foreign Influence on Ancient India |date=1992 |publisher=Northern Book Centre |isbn=9788172110284 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA39 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asoka-mauryan-emperor "Ashoka"] in ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; To describe his own edicts, Ashoka used the word ''[[Lipī]]'' ([[wikt:𑀮𑀺𑀧𑀺|𑀮𑀺𑀧𑀺]]), now generally simply translated as "writing" or "inscription". It is thought the word "lipi", which is also orthographed "dipi" (𐨡𐨁𐨤𐨁‎) in the two [[Kharosthi]] versions of the rock edicts,{{efn|For example, according to Hultzsch, the first line of the First Edict at [[Shahbazgarhi]] (or at [[Mansehra]]) reads: ''"(Ayam) [[Dharma|Dhrama]]-[[lipi|dipi]] Devanapriyasa Raño likhapitu"'' ("This Dharma-Edicts was written by King [[Devanampriya]]" {{cite book |title=Inscriptions of Asoka.

==Religion==
Historically, the life of the [[Buddha]] also coincided with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley.&lt;ref name=CIB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beckwith |first1=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400866328 |page=7-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlCUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achaemenid occupation of the areas of Gandara and Hinduš, which was to last for about two centuries, was accompanied by the introduction of Achaemenid religions, reformed [[Mazdaism]] or early [[Zoroastrianism]], to which Buddhism might have in part reacted.&lt;ref name=CIB/&gt; In particular, the ideas of the Buddha may have partly consisted in a rejection of the "absolutist" or "perfectionist" ideas contained in these Achaemenid religions.&lt;ref name=CIB/&gt;

Still, according to [[Christopher I. Beckwith]], commenting on the content of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the early Buddhist concepts of [[karma]], rebirth, and affirming that good deeds with be rewarded in this life and the next, in [[Heaven]], probably find their origin in Achaemenid [[Mazdaism]], which had been introduced in India from the time of the Achaemenid conquest of Gandara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beckwith |first1=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400866328 |page=132-133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlCUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was [[Zoram]], a "chief captain" of the Nephite armies.

'''Amedeo Clemente Modigliani''' ({{IPA-it|ameˈdɛːo modiʎˈʎaːni}}; 12 July 1884 – 24 January 1920) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Jewish]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]] who worked mainly in France. He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].
 
Modigliani's œuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died at age 35 in Paris of [[tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]].

==Family and early life==
[[File:Modigliani Birthplace Livorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani's birthplace in [[Livorno]]]]

Modigliani was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Livorno]], [[Italy]]. A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community]]. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 13| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani's mother, Eugénie Garsin, born and raised in [[Marseille]], was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Myth"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani’s father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

A reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani’s mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Amedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.

Modigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H. Allen | page = 316| isbn = 0-491-02164-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Diehl | first = Gaston | date = Jul 1989|edition=Reissue | title = Modigliani | publisher = Crown Pub | page = 96| isbn = 0-517-50798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Soby | first = James Thrall | date = Sep 1977 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = New York | publisher = Arno P | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his ability to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson | page = 14| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art student years==
Modigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself "already a painter", his mother wrote,&lt;ref name="Mann 1980 12"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.

At the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].

===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===

[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]
Modigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been [[Llewelyn Lloyd (painter)|Llewelyn Lloyd]], [[Giulio Cesare Vinzio]], [[Manlio Martinelli]], [[Gino Romiti]], [[Renato Natali]], and [[Oscar Ghiglia]]. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was shaped as much by such artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] as by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].

Modigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.

In 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title "the [[Macchiaioli]]" (from ''macchia''&amp;nbsp;—"dash of colour", or, more derogatively, "stain"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.

Modigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[Cézanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.

While with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.&lt;ref name="Mann 1980 12" /&gt;

Despite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as "Superman", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.&lt;ref name="Mann-1980-16"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or "Free School of Nude Studies", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].
It is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].

===Early literary influences===
Having been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosuè Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautréamont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.

Letters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work of [[Lautréamont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.&lt;ref name="Mann-1980-16" /&gt; The poetry of Lautréamont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.

Modigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself. I am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate ... A [[bourgeois]] told me today–insulted me–that I or at least my brain was lazy. It did me good. I should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Paris==

=== Arrival ===
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Portrait of Juan Gris.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Juan Gris]]'', 1915]]

In 1906, Modigliani moved to Paris, then the focal point of the [[avant-garde]]. In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].

He later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for ‘The Pillars of Tenderness’ which would support the imagined temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]
Modigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt;

When he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Académie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt; He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 17" /&gt;

===Transformation===
Within a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.

The poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.

Not only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as "Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois".&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 19"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couché au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couché au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

He sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 19" /&gt; Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]]. While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings.&lt;ref name="werner-24"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1985 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = New York | publisher = Harry N. Abrams, Inc. | isbn = 0-8109-1416-6 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of [[Vincent van Gogh]].

During the 1920s, in the wake of Modigliani's career and spurred on by comments by [[André Salmon]] crediting hashish and absinthe with the genesis of Modigliani's style, many hopefuls tried to emulate his "success" by embarking on a path of substance abuse and bohemian excess. Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, "...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art."&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 20"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 20| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some art historians suggest&lt;ref name="Werner 1967 20" /&gt; that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.

===Output===
During his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost—destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.&lt;ref name="werner-24" /&gt;

He was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul Cézanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.

He met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html "Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him"] Retrieved 21 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=wycoiv9BJ0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secrest,+Meryle,+Modigliani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj93sOdgdfYAhWCVBQKHZDCDGoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Secrest%2C%20Meryle%2C%20Modigliani&amp;f=false Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani''], Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011, p. 136, {{ISBN|0307595471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Modigliani returned home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. Soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a [[studio]] in [[Montparnasse]]. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after [[Paul Guillaume]], an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He was Constantin Brâncuși's disciple for one year.

Although a series of Modigliani's sculptures were exhibited in the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912, by 1914 he abandoned sculpting and focused solely on his painting, a move precipitated by the difficulty in acquiring sculptural materials due to the [[World War I|outbreak of war]], and by Modigliani's physical debilitation.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Myth" /&gt;

In June 2010 Modigliani's ''[[Tête (sculpture)|Tête]]'', a limestone carving of a woman's head, became the [[List of most expensive sculptures|third most expensive sculpture ever sold]].

===Friends and influences===
Modigliani painted a series of portraits of contemporary artists and friends in Montparnasse: [[Chaim Soutine]], [[Moïse Kisling]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Marie Vorobieff|Marie "Marevna" Vorobyev-Stebeslka]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], all sat for stylized renditions.

==The war years==
[[File:Modigliani, Picasso and André Salmon.jpg|thumb|left|Modigliani, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[André Salmon]], 1916]]

At the outset of [[World War I]], Modigliani tried to enlist in the army but was refused because of his poor health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=080219740X Dan Franck, ''Bohemian Paris: Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, and the Birth of Modern Art''], Open Road, Grove/Atlantic, 2007, {{ISBN|080219740X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as ''Modì'' (which plays on the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as ''Dedo'' to his family and friends, Modigliani was a handsome man, and attracted much female attention.&lt;ref name="Modigliani"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=8809042077 Fiorella Nicosia, Amedeo Modigliani, ''Modigliani''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, pp. 38, 74, {{ISBN|8809042077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women came and went until [[Beatrice Hastings]] entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including ''Madame Pompadour'', and the object of much of his drunken wrath.&lt;ref name="Modigliani" /&gt;

When the British painter [[Nina Hamnett]] arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the café introduced himself as "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became great friends.

In 1916, Modigliani befriended the [[Poland|Polish]] poet and art dealer [[Léopold Zborowski]] and his wife Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani's primary art dealer and friend during the artist's final years, helping him financially, and also organizing his show in Paris in 1917.

== Patronage of Léopold Zborowski ==
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 042.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Léopold Zborowski]],'' 1918]]

===The 1917 Paris Show===
The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Léopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their "commercial potential", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is "notorious" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity.&lt;ref name="K2"&gt;Klein, Mason, et al., 56&lt;/ref&gt; The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.&lt;ref name="K2"/&gt;

''[[Nude Sitting on a Divan]]'' is one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale of the painting at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show.

''[[Nu couché]]'' realized $170,405,000 at a [[Christie's]], New York, sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robin Pgrebin and Scott Reyburn|title=With $170.4 Million Sale at Auction, Modigliani Work Joins Rarefied Nine-Figure Club|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/arts/with-170-4-million-sale-at-auction-modigliani-work-joins-rarefied-nine-figure-club.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
On a trip to [[Nice]] which had been conceived and organized by Zborowski, Modigliani, Foujita and other artists tried to sell their works to rich tourists. Modigliani managed to sell a few pictures, but only for a few francs each. Despite this, during this time he produced most of the paintings that later became his most popular and valued works.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During his lifetime, he sold a number of his works, but never for any great amount of money. What funds he did receive soon vanished for his habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-modigliani-amedeo.htm|title=Amedeo Modigliani Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|newspaper=The Art Story|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeanne Hébuterne==
[[File:Jeanne Hebuterne seated.jpg|thumb|[[Jeanne Hébuterne]]]]
In the spring of 1917, the Russian sculptor [[Chana Orloff]] introduced him to a beautiful 19-year-old art student named [[Jeanne Hébuterne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen/exposiciones/WebExposiciones/2008/modigliani/fundacion/fundacion9_ing.html|title=Photo|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Museo Thyssen – Bornemisza|accessdate=June 8, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229014847/http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen/exposiciones/WebExposiciones/2008/modigliani/fundacion/fundacion9_ing.html|archivedate=February 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had posed for [[Tsuguharu Foujita]]. From a conservative [[bourgeois]] background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.

Modigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings and a short time later Hébuterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumière. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne Hébuterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.

[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, Jeanne Hébuterne, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, ''Jeanne Hébuterne'', oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
On December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened at the [[Berthe Weill]] Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.

Towards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with Hébuterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[André Derain]]. [[File:Porträt der Jeanne Hébuterne, Amedeo Modigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Jeanne Hébuterne]], 1918]] After he and Hébuterne moved to Nice on November 29, 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918–1984). In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumière.
 
Hébuterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.

==Death and funeral==

Although he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.

In 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto Hébuterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, [[tubercular meningitis]]. He died on January 24, 1920, at the Hôpital de la Charité.

There was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old Hébuterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.

A day later, Hébuterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, a day after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Hébuterne was buried at the [[Cimetière de Bagneux]] near [[Paris]], and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: "Struck down by death at the moment of glory". Her's reads: "Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice".&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Lappin |authorlink=Linda Lappin |date=June 22, 2002 |title=Missing person in Montparnasse: The case of Jeanne Hebuterne |journal=Literary Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=785–811 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.

===Influences===

The linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painters]] informed his work. Working during that fertile period of “isms,” [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, “This is what I see.”

More appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]’s proclamation: “Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde” (“Don’t wait for the avant-garde”).&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, pp. 346–47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-goitre]], a medical condition is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burch M|first1=Warner|title=100 Questions and Answers about thyroid disorders|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X1xT4XZWfkC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=modigliani+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MP_REcQ-OR&amp;sig=wx7zNemiqME6mEU__5pcCawzLok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=modigliani%20syndrome&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Modigliani-fake.jpg|thumb|An [[Elmyr de Hory]]'s Modigliani painting]] --&gt;
Since his death, Modigliani's reputation has soared. Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani's sister in Florence adopted his daughter, [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918–1984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled ''Modigliani: Man and Myth''.

===Catalogue raisonnés===
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 056.jpg|thumb|Nude]]
The Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world. There are at least five [[catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] of the artist’s work including two volumes by [[Ambrogio Ceroni]], last updated in 1972. [[Arthur Pfannstiel]] (1929 and 1956) and [[Joseph Lanthemann]]'s (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar [[Osvaldo Patani]] produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the [[Paul Alexandre]] period (1994), while [[Christian Parisot]] has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné.&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Adam (May 15, 2002), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Pushkin-accused-of-displaying-a-fake/25016 Pushkin accused of displaying a fake] ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to be the only ones existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Légales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Kishkovsky (November 10, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Pushkin-accused-of-displaying-a-fake/25016 Pushkin accused of displaying a fake] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian art forgery unit after a two-year investigation; the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (January 24, 2013), [https://www.forbes.com/2002/05/15/0515hot.html Fake Modiglianis Poison Art Market] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art market===
In November 2010, a painting of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (£42.7m) at an auction in New York—a record for the artist's work. Bidding for ''La Belle Romaine'' pushed its price well past its $40m (£24.8m) estimate. Modigliani's previous auction record was 43.2m euros (£35.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist—[[Jeanne Hébuterne]] (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover—sold for $19.1m (£11.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9–12m (£5.6–7.4m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11682850 | work=BBC News | title=Modigliani nude sells for a record $68.9m | date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2015 the 1917 painting ''[[Nu couché]]'', sold at [[Christie's]] in New York for US$170.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/arts/with-170-4-million-sale-at-auction-modigliani-work-joins-rarefied-nine-figure-club.html|title=With $170.4 Million Sale at Auction, Modigliani Work Joins Rarefied Nine-Figure Club|first1=Robin|last1=Pogrebin|first2=Scott|last2=Reyburn|date=9 November 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2018 the 1917 painting ''Nu couché (sur le côté gauche)'' sold at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for $157.2 million. This was the highest auction price in Sotheby's history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/arts/design/modigliani-sothebys-auction-picasso.html ''$157 Million for a Modigliani Raises Hardly Any Eyebrows''], ''The New York Times'', May 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
Two films have been made about Modigliani: ''[[Les Amants de Montparnasse]]'' (1958), directed by [[Jacques Becker]] and starring [[Gérard Philipe]] as Modigliani; and ''[[Modigliani (film)|Modigliani]]'' (2004), directed by [[Mick Davis (director)|Mick Davis]] and starring [[Andy García]] as Modigliani.

Modigliani's art was an influence on director [[Andy Muschetti]], who found his works frightening as a child. Creatures based on Modigliani's style have appeared in his films ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' and ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3458110/muschietti-talks-paintings-inspired-nightmarish-new-creature/|title=Muschietti Talks Paintings that Inspired Nightmarish New ‘IT’ Creature|last=Squires|first=John|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In 1987 the U.S. [[synth-pop]] band [[Book of Love (band)|Book of Love]] released the single "[[Modigliani (Lost In Your Eyes)]]".

In 1991 the Italian singer-songwriter [[Vinicio Capossela]], released his second album titled ''Modi''' which is also the title of the album's first track. The song's title recalls the French term "Maudit" (cursed) and gives an almost impressionist depiction of Modigliani's troubled soul, embracing in its lyrics the painter's well known love of poetry.

In 2015 Italian jazz player [[Claudio Ottaviano]] released the composition "Modigliani", opening track for the album ''Aurora'' on NuomRecords.

''Modi'Tango'' (Giovanna Pieri Buti, violin - Emiliano Degl'Innocenti, doublebass - Alessandro Ottaviani, accordion) is a musical band based in Livorno, that honours Modigliani taking inspiration from an oneiric meeting in [[Montparnasse]] between Modigliani and [[Carlos Gardel]] in front of a [[Milonga (place)|Milonga]]

==Critical reactions==
In 2011 [[Peter Schjeldahl]], reviewing [[Meryle Secrest]]'s book ''Modigliani: A Life'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, to one of his long-necked women, with their piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the succulent color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.&lt;ref name=PSrev&gt;Peter Schjeldahl, Book review of Meryle Secrest's "Modigliani: A Life", [[The New Yorker]], March 7, 2011 [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2011/03/07/110307crbo_books_schjeldahl Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schjeldahl reports Secrest’s speculation that Modigliani was happy to let people consider him an alcoholic and drug addict, "and thus to mistake the symptoms of his [[tuberculosis]], which he kept a secret. Drunks were tolerated; carriers of infectious diseases were not."&lt;ref name=PSrev/&gt;

'''Amir Kulal''' (1278–1370), {{lang-fa|امیر کلال}}, {{lang-ar|امیر کلال}}, birth name '''[[Shams ud-Dīn]]''' ({{lang-fa|شمس الدین}}, {{lang-ar|شمس الدین}}), was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] [[Islamic]] scholar, widely considered to be one of the most influential in history. He was a member of a [[Sufi]] order, the [[Naqshbandi]]. His father was the [[Sufi]] scholar [[Saif ud-Dīn Hamza]] ({{lang|ar|سیف الدین حمزہ}}), a descendant of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was Amir ([[chieftain]]) of the Tribe of Kulal, his full title being ''Amir-i-Kulal''. After his father's death, Shams ud-Dīn became the Amir and head of the tribe. By this time his reputation as a scholar and religious figure had spread through [[Turkistan]] and the title ''Amir-i-Kulal'', had become his common name.
Kulal was named for his grandfather, also known as Shams ud-Dīn, the spiritual mentor of the Barlas Tribe and Turghai (father of [[Amir Timur]]).

Kulal had a number of students who later became prominent figures in history, including [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha-ud-Dīn Naqshband]] and the [[Mongol]] conqueror [[Amir Timur]]. After rise of the [[Timurid Dynasty]], a close relationship began between the houses of Amir Timur and Amir Kulal and continued through the Mughal line in [[India]]. Kulal is buried at Sokhar, near [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]].

==Family lineage and Kulal tribe==
Amir Kulal's father, Amir Saif ud-Dīn Hamza, was a direct descendant of [[Husain ibn Ali]], grandson of Muhammad. The entire tribe of Kulal were descended from Muhammad.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The Kulal tribe settled in the area of modern-day [[Vabkent]] near the end of the twelfth century. Around 1340, the city was visited by [[Ibn Battuta]] who spent a night there as a guest. Battuta described it as beautiful, saying that it had "... many gardens and rivers".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Battuta]]: ''Travels in Asia and Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe's date of settlement can be approximated with the remains of the madrasa (a form of [[Mosque]]) which was constructed at Vabkent in 1198 under the patronage of Burhan ud-Din Abdul Aziz II (whose name adorns the Madrasa's minaret, the only surviving segment of the building). The builders of the madrasa were members of the Kulal tribe and copied the Kalyan mosque ([[Po-i-Kalyan]]) style, making upgrades in the design and technology. This made the Vabkent madrasa a more refined form of Kalyan mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikimir.com/amir-kulal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126045938/http://www.wikimir.com/amir-kulal |archivedate=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribe quickly established a small industrial base at the central market of Vabkent and built [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s in the surrounding areas, which continued to operate well into the sixteenth century. The city's main industries were [[coin]] [[minting]]; alloying of [[steel]]; creating [[pottery]]; and [[milling (grinding)|milling]]. Their highly glazed pottery and tiles, unmatched in quality and quantity, were their main export. This earned the tribe the title of Kulal (potter) and gave them their name. Their [[kiln]] designs were highly efficient and were able to produce up to 1500 pots in each batch. Utilizing wind and water resources for milling and industrial processes coupled with efficient kiln designs resulted in considerably higher earnings per [[capita]], leading to a healthy lifestyle for the entire tribe.

Despite a history of [[wars]] and conflict in the area, the Kulal tribe was not once attacked. There are three main reasons for this:
*The tribe was famous as being entirely composed of descendants of Muhammad, gaining them considerable respect from the neighboring tribes; this was a considerable advantage in a Muslim dominated country.
*The city was surrounded by a terrain of gardens and greenery criss-crossed by numerous rivers and streams at one side and an endless desert at the other, which was barren and uninhabited. This, coupled with the lack of substantial material value in the small city, was a big enough deterrent for any invading army which would have to travel at least one day to reach the city which lied at the boundary of the [[Kyzyl Kum]] desert.
*The social system was devised into three sections—the political system, monetary system, and publicity system. Their political system was simple. The most learned of the tribe was chosen as the head. The goal of the head, other than being the qazi and administrator was to represent the tribe and politically maneuver through times of war. Also, the post was not hereditary. No hereditary claim to the "throne" meant there wasn't one family in the tribe which would grow up to have amassed huge portions of tribe wealth in a couple of generations, in case the head turned out to be corrupt. Also, this avoided any mutual tussles between heirs of any deceased chieftain, as there was nothing to fight for. Their monetary system was even more advanced (for their time) than the political system. All of the mills and manufacturing plants were owned in essence by the community. Anyone willing and skilled was allowed to operate and earn a living as long as he kept the structure maintained and donated for construction of newer structures. The system worked superbly well and at least at a smaller scale of a couple of thousand individuals proved could be sustained for a number of centuries. Strict codes of intermarriages within the tribe, relatively small birthrates (compared to the one prevalent at the times), single marriages and continuous outward migration meant the population stayed nearly constant throughout the time period.

By the time of Amir Kulal wrestling had become a Kulal trademark sport. The tribe held regular contests both at Vabkent and Bukhara in which outsiders also competed. The Kulal youth were almost always successful, instilling the idea of the Kulal tribe as superior and fierce warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackston|first1=Wheeler M.|title=The Baburnama: memoirs of Babur, prince and emperor|date=2002|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=9780375761379|edition=Modern Library pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name of Amir Kulal is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amir Kulal ibn Hamzah ibn Ibraheem ibn Muhammad ibn (Muhammad) Hasan ibn Abdullah AlShaheed ibn Jafar ibn Husain ibn Ali ibn Hasan AlQayem ibn (Muhammad) Husain ibn (Ahmad) Husain ibn (Muhammad) Ali AlDaynori ibn Moussa AbuSobha Moussa AlThani ibn Ibraheem AlMurtdha ibn Moussa AlKadhim ibn Jafar AlSadiq ibn Muhammad AlBaqir ibn Ali Zainualabdeen ibn AlHusain AlSebit, son of Fatimah ibnt Muhammad, ibn AlImam Ali ibn AbiTalib AlHashemi AlQurashi{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Shams ud-Dīn Amir Kulal was born at [[Bukhara]]. His father Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was head of the Kulal tribe and a renowned scholar. As head of the tribe, Saif ud-Dīn Hamza was titled ''Amir-i-Kulal'' (Leader of Kulal tribe). Shams ud-Dīn was educated in his childhood and early in his life took the position of head of the madrasa at Vabkent. He was also known as a great wrestler. By the time he became the head of Kulal tribe his fame as a scholar and religious figure had spread through the surrounding region with many noble and powerful families sending their children to study under him, most notably from the [[Barlas]] Tribe.

==''Amir-i-Kulal''==
Shams ud-Dīn Kulal was elected as tribe's head after his father's death. Although all the heads of Kulal were titled ''Amir-i-Kulal'', it was Shams ud-Dīn whose name has become synonymous with the title-name. Today, he is mostly remembered as Amir Kulal, rather than his birth name.

Kulal continued to teach at the madrasa, even when he was head of the tribe. One of his most famous disciples was [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]], who used to work as an executioner in [[Bukhara]] under the rule of [[Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur]]. Legend says that Baha ud-Dīn was ordered to execute a man who had angered the king, but right before his execution the accused called upon Amir Kulal, identifying him as his teacher. Amir Kulal intervened and the accused was set free on his intercession. This was [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha ud-Dīn]]'s first encounter with Amir Kulal. Impressed by him, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Baha ud-Dīn]] became his student.

Amir Kulal also had a sizable following of spiritual protégés. Of these the most prominent was Turghai who had previously been influenced by Amir Kulal's grandfather. After Turghai's death his son [[Timur]] held Amir Kulal in the same esteem, holding him as his spiritual guide.

Around the year 1340, Ibn Battuta made a day stop at Vabkent who later described the city as beautiful with many rivers and gardens. He was Amir's guest at the city and was guided towards Bukhara, then at a day's travel from Vabkent.

In the year 1357, Timur approached Amir Kulal for his advice on strategic maneuvers for attacking [[Uzbeks]]. It was under his advice that [[Timur]] changed his attack plan.

Amir Kulal died in 770/1370 and was buried in Sukhar (Sokhar) near Bukhara. Sometimes Amir Kulal's tomb is confused with the tomb of his grandfather (also Shams ud-Dīn Kulal). It is Shams ud-Dīn Kulal (Amir Kulal's grandfather) who is buried at [[Shahrisabz]](Kesh); the Green City. Amir Kulal's grandfather had constructed the madrasa Dor-i-Tilavat/[[Dorut Tilavat]] (House of Mediation) and was buried here after his death. Later, Timur transferred the body of his father Turghai, to be near the grave of Shams ud-[[Dīn]] (Amir Kulal's grandfather). Amir Kulal's grandfather was Turghai and Barlas Tribe's spiritual mentor. Majority of Timur's family is also buried at the same place. Recently, his tomb had been renovated under the orders of Uzbekistan's President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2004.press-service.uz/eng/novosti_eng/n10162002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816035459/http://2004.press-service.uz/eng/novosti_eng/n10162002.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the books written by Amir Kulal still exist, although some excerpts and essays have survived in the family library. Three copies of a biography of Amir Kulal "Maqamat-i-Amir Kulal" written by his great grandson Shihab ul-[[Dīn]] have survived.

==Descendants==
After Amir Kulal's death his descendants, propagated from his four sons (Burhanudeen, Shah, Hamzah, and Omar), continued to assosciate with the Timurid and then Mughal dynasty kings and princes as their friends and teachers. Amir Kulal's grandson Amir Kalan (''Muhammad ibn Shah ibn Amir Kulal'') was entrusted with the education of young [[Ulugh Beg]]. Although Amir Kalan is renowned for his religious scholarship he was also well versed in mathematics and astronomy, and introduced these sciences to the young prince. At Ulugh Beg's madrasa Amir Kalan was considered one of the top ten teachers with unparalleled proficiency in ''ulum-i-yaainia'', ''dinia'' and ''ulum-i-shariat.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Husain|first1=S.M. Azizuddin|title=Madrasa education in India: eleventh to twenty first century|date=2005|publisher=Kanishka Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788173917417|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amir Sultan]] (''Muhammad Shmsudeen ibn Ali ibn Burhanudeen ibn Amir Kulal''), another grandson of Amir Kulal married [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Bayezid I]]'s daughter. After [[Babur]] established the [[Mughal Empire]] in India many of Amir Kulal's descendants moved there and continued to enjoy an influence in the [[Mughal dynasty]]. They remained as teachers and mentors of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] princes and kings or their close friends. Last of these was Shah Abbas, tutor of Mughal King [[Farrukhsiyar]]. By the time Farrukhsiyar was enthroned, the family had parted ways from the Mughals. After about one hundred years the family comes to prominence with Sheikh Samad Ali, one of the prominent students of [[Shah Abdul Aziz]]. Although his exploits as an engineering entrepreneur overshadows his scholarly work, his son Hakim Qadir Ali earned fame both as a scholar and doctor. His great grandson Shah Altaf was renowned as a scholar and scientist in the area around Delhi, and his school attracted many students from this area. After its founding, the majority of Amir Kulal's descendants emigrated to Pakistan.

===Shaykhan family===
The Shaykhan [[family]] claims [[ancestry]] from the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi saint of Bukhara Shaykh Shams ud-[[Dīn]] Muhammad Amir Kulal. During the early period of Islamic history the ancestors of Amir Kulal migrated from [[Al Madinah]] and settled in Shaykhan [[Ninawa]], [[Iraq]] where successive generations lived for over five [[century|centuries]]. The entire family later emigrated to [[Janah]], [[Iraq]] and thereafter to [[Bukhara]] in modern Uzbekistan.

The generations following Amir Kulal lived in [[Bukhara]] for more than a [[century]]. Some notable descendants included: Amir Hamzah Ibn Amir Kulal (d800H), known as ''Baba Mir'', a leading Naqshbandi Sufi saint with large following of spiritual protégés; Amir Hasan Zaman Ibn Amir Hamzah (d 825H), buried in Sokhar near Bukhara. Amir Masud Zaman Ibn Amir Hasan Zaman (d 875H), buried in Samarkand; and Amir Muhammad Arifullah Ibn Amir Masud Zaman
(847-909H), fourth in descent from Amir Kulal, a prominent Naqshbandi [[Sufi]] saint and a [[spiritual mentor]] of Umar Shaykh Mirza (1456-1494AD), ruler of the province of Fergana and father of Zahir ud-[[Dīn]] Muhammad Babur (1483-1530AD), founder of the Mughal empire in India.

Emperor Babur, fifth in descent from Amir Timur and founder of the [[Timurid dynasty]] which ruled northern [[India]] for nearly four centuries, was mindful of his [[Central Asia]]n origin and, following in the steps of Timur, gave extensive patronage to descendants of Amir Kulal.

Shaykh Sayyid Zain ud-[[Dīn]] Ibn Amir Muhammad Arifullah (d.940H/1533AD) was a writer, a poet and belonged to Naqshbandi Sufi Order. Translated memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babur into Persian and was author of the book Tabaqat-e-Baburi. Shaykh Zain ud-[[Dīn]] was part of Babur's entourage when he occupied Kabul in 910H/1504AD and later in 932H/1525AD in his fifth expedition to Hindustan accompanied him to India. In his memoirs Babur writes that on entering Dehli after the victorious battle of Panipat in 932H/1526AD against Sultan Ibrahim Lodi he asked Shaykh Zain ud-[[Dīn]] to lead the Friday prayers and recite the Khutba (proclamation) in his name. Decrees of the Emperor announcing victories at the battle of Panipat and against Rana Sanga and the Rajput coalition at the battle of Khanua 933H/March 17, 1527AD were composed by Shaykh Zain ud-[[Dīn]] which were copied and dispatched to the entire realm.

Shaykh Zain ud-[[Dīn]] was "Sadr-us-Sudur" responsible for the judicial administration and religious affairs of the Mughal Empire and also for drafting and issuing emperors decrees in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. He died in Agra, India and was buried in the courtyard of a Madrasa built by him. Khwaja Sultan Ali Ibn Shaykh Zain ud-[[Dīn]] (d. 970H) was a minister with second Mughal emperor Humayun (1508-1556AD) and later ambassador to Iran during the reign of emperor Akbar (1556-1605AD). Amir Mansoor Khan Ibn Khawaja Sultan Ali (d. 982H) was a senior general in the Mughal [[army]]. He died while hunting near Hyderabad Deccan. Shaykh Sayyid Muhammad Adil Khan Ibn Amir Mansoor Khan (d. 1019H) served as a Mughal high-ranking military official in the provinces of Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and Kabul. Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Mohammad Adil Khan (d.1043H) was a general in emperor Jahangir's (1569-1627AD) army and later performed important [[Minister (government)|ministerial]] duties at Jehangir's [[court]]. Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan Ibn Shaykh Sayyid Abu Saeed (d. 1089H) rose to the illustrious position of the Captain of the Mughal Red Fort at Shahjahanabad in emperor Shah jahan's reign (1627-1659AD) Amir Shah Sajawal Ibn Amir Shaykh Farrukh Zaman Khan (d. 1120H) eleventh in direct descent from Amir Kulal was a Naqshbandi Sufi saint and a tutor to Mughal princes during the reign of emperor Awrangzeb (1659-1707AD) apart from being officer in charge of administration of Mughal court.

Amir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi Ibn Amir Shah Sajawal was a leading noble of Sikandrabad (Bulandshahr / India). He lived in the reign of [[emperor]] Muhammad Shah (1719-1748AD) and was awarded with an estate at Akbarpur, Salarpur near Dehli.This was a time when the Mughal empire was under severe decline. Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali had sacked [[Dehli]] and many noble Muslim families were facing severe economic decline and disorder. However, Amir Shaykh Muhammad Zaman Sikandrabadi's descendants preserved the family traditions of Sufism and were notable sadaats (descendants of Muhammad) of Chehel Amiran (later Koocha Chelan) in Dehli.

During the later Mughal period, the family continued to produce eminent men of learning who distinguished themselves in various walks of life. Shaykh Samad Ali ibn Amir Shaykh Mohammad Zaman an accomplished religious scholar and graduate of Rahimiya college (Dehli), a centre of Islamic Renaissance in the subcontinent under Shah Abdul Aziz Ibn Shah Waliullah (1746-1828 AD). Shaykh Mohammad Ali Ibn Shaykh Samad Ali a prominent Naqshbandi Sufi saint of Sikandarabad (Bulandshahr) India. Shaykh Karamat Hussain Ibn Shaykh Mohammad Ali (d. 1898AD) was Kotwal (Chief of Police) in Gwalior the capital of Gwalior State. Another elder of the family Shaykh Nabi Buksh a tutor to Mughal princes was awarded an estate near Dehli in the reign of last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah (1837-1857).

During the traumatic year of 1857 AD when the War of Independence started, the family played a significant role against the [[United Kingdom|British]]. Many lost their lives, others fled Dehli and took refuge in small towns / villages namely lncholi, Hapur, Danpur, Aounla, Sambhal, Amroha, Badarpur, Malyana and Jalali. Shaykh Karamat Hussain along with his entire family including his eldest son Shaykh Altaf Hussain (d. 1956AD) and buried in grave yard Bibi Pak Daman, Lahore, Pakistan who was barely seven years old proceeded to Sikandarabad but feeling unsafe due to close proximity of Bulandshahr settled in his ancestor's maternal town Dibai. Shaykh Karamat Hussain died in 1898 and was buried in family graveyard Gulabi Bagh (Dibai). The family lived in Mohalla Shaykhan (Dibai) and later also in Sikandarabad till 1947 AD when on founding of Pakistan migrated to Karachi.

In memory of their ancestor Amir Kulal, the family's farm located near the village Sarhali Kalan, 37 kilometers south of Lahore, Pakistan, is named Kulal Bagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Vincent A.|title=Oxford history of India|date=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198215387|edition=3d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''archbishop of Uppsala''' (spelled '''Upsala''' until the early 20th century) has been the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] in Sweden in an unbroken succession since 1164, first during the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] era, and from the 1530s and onward under the [[Lutheran]] church.

== Historical overview ==
[[File:Archbishop's palace in Uppsala.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Archbishop's Palace, Uppsala|Archbishop's Palace in Uppsala]], designed in the 18th century by the architect [[Carl Hårleman]], but built on older foundations.]]
{{details|Archdiocese of Uppsala}}
There have been bishops in [[Uppsala]] from the time of Swedish King [[Ingold I|Ingold the Elder]] in the 11th century. They were governed by the archbishop of [[Hamburg-Bremen]] until Uppsala was made an archbishopric in 1164. The [[archbishop in Lund]] (which at that time belonged to Denmark) was declared [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Sweden, meaning it was his right to select and ordain the Uppsala archbishop by handing him the [[pallium]]. To gain independence, [[Folke Johansson Ängel]] in 1274 went to Rome and was ordained directly by the pope. This practice was increasing, so that no Uppsala archbishop was in Lund after Olov Björnsson, in 1318. In 1457, the archbishop [[Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna)]] was allowed by the pope to declare himself primate of Sweden.

Uppsala (then a village) was originally located a couple of miles to the north of the present city, in what is today known as ''[[Gamla Uppsala]]'' (''Old Uppsala''). In 1273, the [[archbishopric]], together with the relics of King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric the Saint]], was moved to the market town of [[Östra Aros]], which from then on is named ''Uppsala''.
[[File:Uppsala domkyrka view01sml.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Uppsala Cathedral]], seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala.]]

In 1531, [[Laurentius Petri]] was chosen by King [[Gustav I of Sweden]] (Vasa) to be archbishop, taking that privilege from the pope and in effect making Sweden Protestant. The archbishop was then declared ''[[primus inter pares]]'' i.e. first among equals. The archbishop is both bishop of his diocese and Primate of Sweden; he has however no more authority than other bishops, although in effect his statements have a more widespread effect. In 2000, the Archbishop of Uppsala was aided in the diocese by a [[bishop of Uppsala]], currently [[Ragnar Persenius]].

==Notable archbishops==
The labours of the archbishops extended in all directions. Some were zealous pastors of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished canonists, such as Birger Gregerson (1367–83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson Örnfot, who was distinguished as a prince of the Church, royal councillor, patron of art and learning, founder of the University of Upsala and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into Sweden. There were also scholars, such as Johannes Magnus (died 1544), who wrote the "Historia de omnibus Gothorum sueonumque regibus" and the "Historia metropolitanæ ecclesiæ Upsaliensis", and his brother Olaus Magnus (d. 1588), who wrote the "Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus" and who was the last Catholic Archbishop of Upsala.&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15207a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Upsala]&lt;/ref&gt;

The archbishops and secular clergy found active co-workers among the regular clergy (i.e. religious orders). Among the orders represented in Sweden were the Benedictines, Cistercians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Brigittines (with the mother-house at Wadstena) and Carthusians. A Swedish Protestant investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, wrote: "The monks were almost the sole bond of union in the Middle Ages between the civilization of the north and that of southern Europe, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our monasteries and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country."&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt;

(1805–19), [[Johan Olof Wallin]] (1837–39; beloved poet and hymnist), Karl Fredrik af Wingård (1839–51; politician), Henrik Reuterdahl (1856–70) Anton Niklas Sundberg (1870–1900; outspoken and controversial) and [[Nathan Söderblom]] (1914–1931; Nobel Prize winner).&lt;ref&gt;The list is inspired by a similar list in [[Nordisk familjebok]], ''Uppsala stift''. Has external link below.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earliest bishops  ==

The first written mention of a bishop at Uppsala is from [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum'' that records in passing [[Adalvard the Younger]] appointed as the bishop for ''Sictunam et Ubsalam'' in the 1060s.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207105412/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm |date=7 February 2005 }}, online text in Latin; scholia 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish sources never mention him either in Sigtuna or Uppsala.

The medieval ''Annales Suecici Medii Aevi''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paulsson|1974|pp=}}. The ''Annales'' were written in the Sigtuna Abbey. See [http://www.foteviken.se/Utblick/Art_utblick/utb006.htm an article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227091518/http://www.foteviken.se/Utblick/Art_utblick/utb006.htm |date=27 December 2007 }} by the [[Foteviken Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the 13th century legend of [[Saint Botvid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd01391.htm Saint Botvid in the New Catholic Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119035041/http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd01391.htm |date=19 November 2008 }}. Botvid had been converted to Christianity in England. He was martyred around 1100 in Sweden. [http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/dailysaint/july/0728.asp Some sources] claim that he was murdered by a Finnish slave. See also [http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1950talet/1952_178.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (''Henricus scilicet Upsalensis'') in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://runeberg.org/nfbi/0366.html]. In Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the [[Battle of Fotevik]] in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' written soon after his death and from [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from [[Sigtuna]]. Also he is omitted from, or at least redated in, the first list of bishops made in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Heikkilä, Tuomas (2005), Pyhän Henrikin Legenda, SKS, {{ISBN|951-746-738-9}}. Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In this list, the first bishop at Uppsala was Sverinius ([[Bishop Siwardus|Siwardus]]?), succeeded by Nicolaus, Sveno, [[Henry, Bishop of Uppsala|Henricus]] and Kopmannus. With the exception of Henricus, the list only mentions their names.&lt;ref&gt;Article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbi/0366.html Gamla Uppsala]'', Nordisk Familjebok, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Sweden/Uppsala1/ups1.html].

{{see also|List of Archbishops of Uppsala#Before the Reformation}}

=== 12th century ===
* 1164&amp;ndash;1185 '''[[Stefan (archbishop of Uppsala)|Stefan]]'''
* 1185&amp;ndash;1187 '''[[Johannes (archbishop of Uppsala)|Johannes]]'''.
Johannes was ordained by the Archbishop of [[Lund]], [[Absalon]] by November 1185. In 1187, a ship from the [[paganism|pagan]] Estonia entered Mälaren, a lake close to Uppsala, on a plundering expedition. It sailed to [[Sigtuna]], a prosperous city at that time, and plundered it. On its way back, barricades were set up at the only exit point at [[Almarestäket]] to prevent the ship from escaping. Johannes was there also. As the ship struggled to pass through, Johannes were among those killed.
* 1187&amp;ndash;1197 '''[[Petrus (archbishop of Uppsala)|Petrus]]'''.
He was ordained by Absalon. Sweden got a new king, [[Sverker II of Sweden]] in 1196, who was related to the Danish Royal Court, whereby Absalon extended his authority over Sweden. When Petrus in 1196 elected three bishops, Absalon requested that the pope decide since the bishops were the sons of other priests, and this was not allowed by papal decree. He also mentioned that several Swedish bishops refused to travel to his [[synod]]s. Absalon was an authoritative person whom the pope trusted and gave him rights, but by the time the message reached Uppsala Petrus had already died.

=== 13th century===
* 1198&amp;ndash;1206 '''[[Olov Lambatunga]]'''.
In 1200, [[Pope Innocent III]] demanded that Church estate be free from the king's taxes and that clerics be judged only by bishops and prelates, and not civil courts and judges. This was a step in the separation between worldly and spiritual matters, which the Swedish Church had not yet taken. Innocent also demanded that Olov dismiss the two bishops ordained by Petrus.

When Uppsala burnt in 1204, Olov's pallium was burnt and he sent a request to Innocent III for a new one to be made.
* 1207&amp;ndash;1219 '''[[Valerius (Archbishop of Uppsala)|Valerius]]'''.
Valerius was most likely the son of a church man &amp;ndash; and the Archbishop of Lund appealed the election to Rome. The pope allowed a dispensation for Valerius on the grounds that there was no other suitable candidate and because Valierus was known as a learned man with good customs and virtues.

Valerius joined sides with the King [[Sverker II of Sweden]] who belonged to the House of Sverker. The House of Sverker was one of the antagonists in a civil war that had been going on and off since 1130. In 1208 the opposing side, the [[House of Eric]], besieged the capital Stockholm; Sverker and Valierus fled to Denmark.

Sverker gathered a small army in Denmark and tried to conquer Sweden but was killed. Valerius then decided to accept King [[Eric X]]'s authority, and as a result was allowed to return to Uppsala, where he crowned Eric X in 1210. [[Pope Innocent III]] sent a letter to Valerius where he proclaimed the procedure to be unauthorised and unlawful, but it seems to have had little impact.
* 1219(1224)-1234 '''Olov Basatömer'''. N/A
* 1236&amp;ndash;1255 '''[[Jarler]]'''
He was one of the first known Swedish students at the [[University of Paris]]. As archbishop, he established several clerical regulations.

* 1255&amp;ndash;1267 '''[[Lars (archbishop of Uppsala)|Lars]]''' (''Laurentius'').
Lars was recruited from the recently established [[Franciscan]] monastery in [[Enköping]] and was most likely a foreigner. The Pope expressed trust in the recently crowned Swedish monarch [[Birger Jarl]] who, unlike his predecessors, had promised to support the Church by granting it freedom from taxes and establish [[missionary|missionaries]] to yet un-Christianised parts &amp;ndash; or parts who had returned to paganim &amp;ndash; specifically [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states]].

But this promise was not realised because of the shaky political situation in Sweden. There was an ongoing struggle for power, which eventually forced the antagonists to tax Church property in order to support the war.

Lars tried to impose [[clerical celibacy]], which still had not been enforced in Sweden because the low population figures in Sweden required priests to marry and have children. In 1258 Lars sent [[Pope Alexander IV]] a request that married clergy not be [[excommunicated]], a request which indicates married clergy were not uncommon.

Also in 1258 the move of the archdiocese to its present location was decided, but it would not take effect for another decade.
* 1267&amp;ndash;1277 '''Folke Johansson Ängel''' (''Fulco Angelus'').
Folke belonged to the influential family Ängel, which used the [[Archangel Gabriel]] as a heraldic charge.

He was, for unclear reasons, not ordained until 1274. Civil disturbances may have been a cause, but also the reluctance of the cathedral chapter to be under the authority of Lund. In 1274, Folke ignored the Primate of Lund by travelling to Rome and getting ordained by [[Pope Gregory X]] himself.

Folke's most important contribution was to commission the moving of the episcopal see from its [[Old Uppsala|old location]] to its present location. At his death he was one of the first to be buried in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfar/0266.html "Ängel"], in NF (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1277&amp;ndash;1281 '''Jakob Israelsson'''
Was from the same family as his predecessor. Little else is known about him.

* 1281&amp;ndash;1284 '''Johan Odulfsson'''
Not ordained. Little is known about him.

* 1285&amp;ndash;1289 '''Magnus Bosson'''.
Little is known about him.

* 1289&amp;ndash;1291 '''[[Johan (Archbishop of Uppsala)|Johan]]'''.
Had served as [[prior]] at the [[Sigtuna]] monastery and Bishop of [[Åbo]]. Died in [[Avignon]] while travelling to Rome to receive the [[pallium]].

=== 14th century===
* 1292&amp;ndash;1305 '''[[Nils Allesson]]''' (''Nicolaus Allonius'').
He studied at the [[University of Paris]] in 1278. After returning to Sweden, he became deacon in Uppsala in 1286 and was elected archbishop in 1292. As Nils Allesson was the son of a priest, the cathedral chapter in Lund, Denmark - the primate over Uppsala - appealed the election to the pope. Nils travelled to Rome in 1295 to meet the Pope [[Boniface VIII]] and defend his case, which was eventually accepted.

Nils was known as a vigorous archbishop. He founded and supervised institutions for safety and order around the archdiocese, such as accommodations for travellers.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfak/0570.html Nils Alleson] in [[Nordisk Familjebok]], 1887&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1308&amp;ndash;1314 '''Nils Kettilsson'''
Little is known about him.
* 1315&amp;ndash;1332 '''Olov Björnsson''' (''Olov the Wise''; ''Olavus sapiens'').
Under his time the chapter in Uppsala stopped accepting Archbishop of [[Lund]] as primate, and Olov was to be the last Uppsala archbishop to be ordained there.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfal/0111.html Olov Björnsson] in Nordisk Familjebok, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1332&amp;ndash;1341 '''[[Petrus Filipsson]]''' (''Petrus Philippi'').
He came from a smaller town in Uppland, the son of the knight Filip Finnvedson, one of the most important men in [[Uppland]] (the land of Uppsala). Petrus held various clerical offices until he was elected archbishop. Following the election he travelled to [[Avignon]], the residence of [[Pope John XXII]], to be ordained as bishop.

He had a strained relationship with the [[Franciscan order]]. At the request of [[Pope Benedict XII]], [[Paul, Archbishop of Nidaros]] (now Trondheim) in Norway, was to make a judgement on the matter, and this led to a settlement between the two parties in 1339.

In 1341 Petrus died and was buried in Sigtuna's [[Dominican order]] church which today is called [[Mariakyrkan]].&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfca/0409.html Petrus] in [[Nordisk Familjebok]], 1915&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1341&amp;ndash;1351 '''Hemming Nilsson'''.
At the death of Petrus, Pope Benedict XII wished to occupy the archbishop's seat through commission, but following Hemming's election by the cathedral chapter, Hemming travelled to Avignon and persuaded Benedict to ordain him bishop.

During his time, he helped in the political world, made a visitation through [[Norway]] and established Uppsala [[ecclesiastical]] records. His last will shows that he was also quite wealthy. [http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0219.html]
* 1351&amp;ndash;1366 '''[[Petrus Torkilsson]]''' (''Petrus Tyrgilli''; died 19 October 1366).
The first mention of him is from 1320, when he was vicar in [[Färentuna]]. He was chancellor of the King [[Magnus II of Sweden]] in 1340 and continued to support him during through the 1360s when Sweden was in a civil war.

In 1342 he was appointed Bishop of Linköping, where he assisted the building of the [[Linköping Cathedral]]. He was assessor during King Magnus monetary transactions, among them the repayment of a loan Magnus hade made from the Church. After the new King [[Albert of Sweden]] took power, Petrus supported him as well.
* 1366&amp;ndash;1383 '''[[Birger Gregersson]]'''.
Was known as a vigorous archbishop. He was also a supporter of the Swedish, highly revered, [[Saint Birgitta]] (1303&amp;ndash;1373), and wrote a biography of her. He also wrote in honour of her and of [[Saint Botvid]], another Swedish saint. As a writer, he has a prominent place in [[early Swedish literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0257.html Birger Gregersson], in [[Nordisk Familjebok]], 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1383&amp;ndash;1408 '''Henrik Karlsson''' (''Henricus Caroli'').
Was also friends with Saint Birgitta, in [[Rome]] and took part in the important political decisions during his years as archbishop, such as the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397.

Had a good economical skill, was a wealthy man, and acquired many farms for the Church. At his death, he left them to the cathedral chapter, but [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret]] is said to have taken them in possession instead, which marked the beginning of disputes between the chapter and the states in the union (which lasted until 1520).&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0248.html Henrik Karlsson] in [[Nordisk Familjebok]], 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 15th century===
* 1408&amp;ndash;1421 '''[[Jöns Gerekesson]]''' (''Johannes Gerechini'')

Jöns originated the influential Danish family Lodehat. His uncle was [[bishop of Roskilde]] and a former chancellor of the Queen. Jöns himself became, thanks to his family's Royal connection, chancellor to the King of [[Scandinavia]], [[Eric of Pomerania]].

At the death of the Archbishop Henrik, King Eric appointed Jöns, who had no connection to Uppsala, as new archbishop without regards to the candidates of the chapter.

During his time, Jöns paid little respect to the duties of archbishop. He embessled Church property and mistreated Church officials. Eventually, the chapter complained to the Pope, who conducted an investigation and dismissed Jöns Gereksson in 1421.
* 1421&amp;ndash;1432 '''[[Johan Håkansson]]''' (''Johannes Haquini'')
Was originally a monk at [[Vadstena]] monastery. As archbishop, he freed [[clergy|clerical]]s of taxation, and built a permanent house for the archbishop.
* 1432&amp;ndash;1438 '''[[Olaus Laurentii|Olov Larsson]]''' (''Olaus Laurentii'')
* 1433&amp;ndash;1434 '''[[Arnold of Bergen]]''' (unofficial) (''Arend'' in Norwegian; died 1434) was bishop of [[Bergen, Norway]], and was never ordained as archbishop.
When Olaus Laurentii was elected by the Chapter to become Archbishop of Uppsala and Sweden, the Swedish King [[Eric of Pomerania]] was displeased because he was not consulted and therefore decided that Arnold of Bergen should become archbishop in 1433 while Olaus Laurentii was in Rome to be ordained. Arnold moved into the archbishopseat in Uppsala despite protests from the chapter.

The quarrels were resolved when Arnold died in 1434; then the king decided to accept Olaus Laurentii who had just returned from Rome. [http://runeberg.org/nfal/0090.html]
* 1438&amp;ndash;1448 '''[[Nils Ragvaldsson]]''' (''Nicolaus Ragvaldi'')
* 1448&amp;ndash;1467 '''[[Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna)]]'''
* 1468&amp;ndash;1469 '''[[Tord Pedersson (Bonde)]]''' (not ordained)
* 1469&amp;ndash;1515 '''[[Jakob Ulvsson]]'''
* 1515&amp;ndash;1517 and 1520&amp;ndash;1521 '''[[Gustav Trolle]] '''
Gustav Eriksson Trolle (1488–1533) was a controversial person. He was in dispute with the king, since he was a supporter of the Danish King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]]. In 1515 he was removed from office, but barricaded himself in the archbishop's mansion/fortress at [[Almarestäket]], until an assembly of chancellors ordered its destruction in 1517. In 1520, Danish King Christian conquered Swedish territory, and Gustav was reinstated. However, King Christian's reign in Sweden lasted but one year, and in 1521 Gustav was forced to flee to Denmark to seek refuge.

When the Pope months later received news of the deposition of Trolle, he ordered the reigning Swedish King [[Gustav Vasa]] to reinstate Trolle, not realizing the severity of the matter. Not being allowed to have his selected archbishop consecrated, King Gustav Vasa in effect broke away from the Catholic tradition, making Sweden a Lutheran nation starting 1531.

==Archbishops during the Reformation==
[[File:Johannes Magnus sigill, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|Seal of Johannes Magnus]]
* 1523&amp;ndash;1544 '''[[Johannes Magnus]]'''
Magnus was the last Catholic archbishop. He was selected to be archbishop in 1523, but the Pope deemed the disposal of Gustav Trolle unlawful, and demanded he should be reinstated. [[Gustav Vasa]] then broke with the Church, and ordained Johannes Magnus in his own ceremony. But before long, Magnus expressed his disapproval of Lutheran teachings, and Gustav Vasa sent him to Russia as a diplomat in 1526.

Gustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over. He travelled to Rome where he settled for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfbm/0035.html Johannes Magnus], in [[Nordisk Familjebok]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1544&amp;ndash;1557 '''[[Olaus Magnus]]'''
Brother of the previous, with whom he was in exile in Rome. After the death of his brother, Olaus was consecrated by the Pope in 1544, but he never returned home. He was the last Swedish archbishop to get papal consecration.

Staying in Rome, Olaus wrote several highly regarded works about Scandinavia that still interest readers today. He also had published works by his brother Johannes.

== Archbishops after the Reformation ==

=== 16th century ===
* 1531&amp;ndash;1573 '''[[Laurentius Petri|Laurentius Petri (Nericius)]]'''
He and his brother [[Olaus Petri]] were the main Protestant reformers in Sweden; while his brother was more energetic, Laurentius laid the theoretical foundation for the [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571]].
* 1575&amp;ndash;1579 '''[[Laurentius Petri Gothus]]'''
Before becoming archbishop, Gothus appears to have been inclined towards King [[Johan III of Sweden]]'s more Catholic viewpoint. He was for this reason ordained by the King in a Catholic ritual with all its apparatus, and wrote the introduction to the King's "red book". As the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuitic]] tendencies grew stronger in Sweden in the 1570s, he became more wary; he refused to support the views of the King any longer, and published ''Contra novas papistarum machinationes'' which, although it gives proper respect to the Church fathers, polemizes against the foundation of Catholicism and the Jesuits.
* 1583&amp;ndash;1591 '''[[Andreas Laurentii Björnram]]'''
He was vicar in [[Gävle]] 1570 and is reported as one of the first priests to have used the King's "red book" in his sermons, which sparked the King's interest, and he subsequently appointed him archbishop after a four-year vacancy.

Björnram upset Church officials by declaring that the liturgy of the King was in accordance with the [[Apostles' Creed]] and that he supported it. Surprisingly, he nonetheless advocated the reading of Luther's works.
* 1593&amp;ndash;1599 '''[[Abraham Angermannus]]'''
Angermannus first became known as a critic of the liturgy of King John, and the king had him put him in jail in [[Åbo]], Finland. But he managed to escape back to Stockholm, under the protection of influential friends. However, eventually he had to flee to Germany, where he lived for 11 years. He visited the renowned universities there and wrote several book of Lutheran contents, directed to Swedish readers.

In 1593 the cathedral chapter in Uppsala elected him archbishop, and he moved back to Sweden and took the seat. He was a harsh critic of Catholicism remnants of which were still in practice around Sweden. In 1599 the King had had enough of him, and prosecuted him. Angermannus was put in prison in [[Gripsholm]], where he was forced to remain until his death in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfba/0040.html Abrahamus Andreæ Angermannus], in Nordisk Familjebok, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1599&amp;ndash;1600 '''[[Nicolaus Olai Bothniensis]]''' (not ordained)
Like his predecessor Angermannus, Bothniensis was imprisoned for 1,5 years due to his resistance to John III's non-Lutheran liturgy.

He in 1593 became the first professor of theology at the [[Uppsala University]]. He died before being consecrated.

Born 1557 in Uppsala. Educated first in Uppsala, then abroad.He was against the liturgy of King [[John III of Sweden]]. He was made archbishop owing to the support of Duke Charles ([[Charles IX of Sweden]]), although they later clashed because of their fundamentally different beliefs.
* 1609&amp;ndash;1636 '''[[Petrus Kenicius]]'''
Born 1555. Was against the King's liturgy, and was imprisoned for a short time of 1589. Participated in the Uppsala Synod 1593. Was archbishop for a long time, into his old age.
* 1637&amp;ndash;1646 '''[[Laurentius Paulinus Gothus]]'''
Born 1565. Was knowledgeable in several subjects, and was professor of astronomy and logistics at Uppsala University. Wrote several works on astronomy, astrology and theology.
* 1647&amp;ndash;1669 '''[[Johannes Canuti Lenaeus]]'''
Professor of Logic, Hebrew and Greek. Wrote an influential book about the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] that revived interest in [[Aristotelianism]] and was used as a textbook for several years.

* 1670&amp;ndash;1676 '''[[Lars Stigzelius]]'''
Professor of Logic at Uppsala where he supported Aristotelian philosophy against the adherents of [[Ramism]]. Was considered a highly learned man and was involved in various political and clerical tasks. As an archbishop he did not make any great contribution owing to his advanced age.

* 1677&amp;ndash;1681 '''[[Johan Baazius the younger]]'''
* 1681&amp;ndash;1700 '''[[Olov Svebilius]]''', (''Olaus Svebilius'')
Commissioned the new Bible translation and revising the Swedish book of hymns. Published many works, most notably ''A simple explanation of Martin Luther's little catechism''.

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Haquin Spegel.gif|thumb|right|[[Haquin Spegel]], posthumous engraving]]
* 1700&amp;ndash;1709 '''[[Erik Benzelius the elder]]'''
Benzelius took an important part in the various ecclesiastical committees active during the reigns of [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] and [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], such as that concerning the new Church Law of 1686, the new [[Book of Hymns|hymn book]] of 1695 and the new Bible translation.

He was a typical representative of 17th-century Swedish [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], careful not to deviate from established theological principles, and lacked originality in his writing. Nevertheless, he was a productive author of works in theology, and his work on church history was used as a textbook for the following century.[http://runeberg.org/nfbb/0736.html]

* 1711&amp;ndash;1714 '''[[Haquin Spegel]]''' (born ''Håkan Spegel''; 14 June 1645 &amp;ndash; 17 April 1714)

After acquiring his [[Master of Arts]] in philosophy and theology and becoming assistant professor in Latin at Uppsala University, he moved to [[Strängnäs]] where he was eventually appointed bishop in 1839. He was also an influential politician in the Swedish Riksdag from 1828 to his death.

He was known as a soft and gently person, and very firm in his beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0536.html Holström, Hans] in Nordisk Familjebok, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Stemming from [[Malmö]], he was orphaned early on and had to rely on others for his education and support. Despite this he managed to get a higher education at the [[Lund University]] in theology, [[philology]] and Church history, influenced by local academic dignitaries such as [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] and the German [[Schleiermacher]] whose works were popular in Lund at the time.

He later published a comprehensive history of the Church in Sweden, and was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0031.html Reuterdahl, Henrik] in Nordisk Familjebok, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The community gets its name from Rohidas, a [[Hindu]] saint, and Rohit are followers of this saint. They broke away from the [[Bhambi Khalpa]] community, when they decided to abandon the traditional occupation of the Bhambi, which was shoemaking. According to other traditions, the Rohit are a sub-group of the [[Chamar]] community. They are found in the districts of [[Kaira district|Kaira]], [[Surat]], [[Ahmedabad]], and [[Baroda]].

== Present circumstances ==

The Rohit are an endogamous community, and practice clan exogamy. Historically, they used to intermarry with the [[Bhambi Khalpa]], but this has been discontinued. Historically, the Rohit were tanners and shoemakers, but like other artisan communities are abandoning their traditional occupation. Many are now employed as wage labourers.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 162 to 166 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is cooked and served to the people sitting right outside the temple. Usually this is done on festival occasions as a part of worshipping the lord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theindianawaaz.com/govt-launches-seva-bhoj-yojnato-give-gst-rebate-on-langar-prasad-bhandara/ Rebates for bhandara] The Indian Awaaz&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is a  [[Marathi language|marathi]] word in origin but is being used in other languages also.

== History ==
Bhandara is actually a district in [[Maharashtra]] which is known as the “Rice bowl of the country”. Practice of bhandara is mostly done by rich people as an offering to the god they worship. It can also be organized by any individual (referred to as the yajamana) who wishes to worship the lord. This practice was first started by the founder of the sikh religion. After performing the rituals and worshipping the almighty, the yajamana serves food to the poor and the needy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God's Gateway: Identity and Meaning in a Hindu Pilgrimage Place|last=James|first=Lochtefeld|publisher=oxford university press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New york|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhog usually  called khichdi-a dish made up of rice and moong daal are served to the people. Bhandara is also organized to celebrate a birthdays, anniversaries or weddings and to commemorate the death of the departed.

The indian government has introduced a scheme known as ‘'Seva Bhoj Yojna’' to reimburse the government share of the Central Goods and Services Tax and the Integrated Goods and Service Tax for purchases by religious institutions of certain products for providing free meals. It will cover the raw ingredients of meals and is expected to cost a total of Rs. 325.00 Crores in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. To qualify, an institution will need to serve food free of charge to over 5000 people in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/110717/food-supplied-by-religious-places-exempted-from-gst-finance-min.html Food supplied by religious places exempted from GST finance] Deccan Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary developments ==
A number of ashrams across India, specially in [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] , bhandaras are offered on a daily basis to the devotees and other poor people.

[[Bhat Sikhs]]
}}

The '''Bhat''', '''Bhatt''', '''Bhatta''', '''Bhatraju''', '''Bhatra''', '''Bhatrai ''' community, refers to a [[priest]], bard, scribe in [[Sanskrit]], a title given to learned Hindu Brahmins, Sikhs and Muslims with Saraswat Brahmin heritage. This community are also known as the '''Sangat''' community and are comprised majorly of [[Sikh]], there is also a size able Muslim community ([[Bhat clan]]). Today in the United Kingdom there are significant numbers of Sikhs with Bhat ancestry, as there are in [[India]]. The majority Bhat Sikhs originate from Punjab and were among the first followers of [[Guru Nanak]] in the Punjab community, in India they are classed as raja people (kings) and are well respected people . In the Punjab most Bhat Sikhs are now in [[Patiala]], [[Amritsar District|Amritsar]], [[Nawanshahr]], [[Hoshiarpur District|Hoshiarpur]], [[Gurdaspur District|Gurdaspur]] or [[Bathinda District|Bhathinda]] districts, or in [[Jalandhar]] or [[Chandigarh]]; they also dwell in other parts of [[India]] such as [[Delhi]].

Bhat Brahmin priests were engaged in attaining the highest 'spiritual' knowledge (brahmavidya) of Brahman and adhered to different branches (shakhas) of the Vedas. The Brahmin priest was responsible for religious rituals in temples and homes of Hindus. They were authorised (after rigorous training in vedas and 'sacred' rituals) as liaisons between humans and God. In general, as family vocations and businesses are inherited, priesthood is also inherited among Brahmin priestly families. Brahmins are located at the top of the caste pyramid and were followed by the Khastriya (Kings, Warriors), Vaishyas (Merchants, Landlords), Shudras (Servants) and finally the untouchables (street cleaners, leather workers etc).

The arrival of Islamic invaders in the north of India saw a large scale upheaval for the Hindu Bhat Brahmin's, as many Hindu temples were destroyed leading to the unsettled lives for the fleeing Hindu Bhats. The birth of Sikhism in the north of India caused many Hindu Bhats and some other types of Hindus to embrace the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, becoming Sikh Bhats or Bhatras, etc. The Bhat Sikhs were devoted followers of the Sikh Gurus, where they used there hereditary skills as priests and scribes to recite poetry, write down events, take part in religious discussions and as missionaries. As religious intolerance continued the Bhat Sikh took part in many of the Gurus campaigns against persecution on and intolerance. The Bhats contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.&amp;nbsp;1389–1409), known as the "Bhata de Savaiyye".&lt;ref name="http://www.bhatra.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bhatra.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; They also wrote the [[Bhat Vahis]], which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs.

In recent times the Bhat Sikhs went on to travel and establish Sikh temples, around the globe mainly in the UK, Canada and the USA. Today's Bhat Sikhs have varied professions.

[[Other Bhat heritages]]

In Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu, people who belong to the hindu caste “Bhatraju” are said to have migrated from North of india to the south, during the relocation of kakathiya king. The Bhatraju clan reside in the villages of Killianwali, tehsil Malout, Muktsar district, and Shergarh (tehsil Dabwali, Sirsa District, Haryana) and other parts of Uttarpradesh. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Introduction to the Bhatra Sikhs==

The Bhatra Sikhs were originally northern hindu [[Saraswat Brahmin]]s who eventually became Sikhs, these Brahmins were [[Autochthon (person)|autochthonous]] inhabitants who helped found the Indus-Saraswati civilization during 4000-2000BC. They lived in the 700+ archeological sites discovered along the former [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati River]] that once flowed parallel to the [[Indus]] in present day Kashmir, Himachal, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan regions. As the intellectual and priestly class of that ancient civilization, they are highly respected and honored for creating the world's oldest literary and religious traditions. They were the original propagators (some argue composers too) of the revered texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads and took these texts into other parts of South Asia. They are considered to be the descendants of the revered Brahmin, ''Sage Saraswat Muni,'' who lived on the banks of the ancient river Saraswati.&lt;ref name=kaw&gt;{{cite book|first1=M.K. |last1=Kaw |title=Kashmiri Pandits: Looking to the future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMM-xRVr5qgC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=kashmiri+pandits+saraswat+brahmins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2DzIpkFhQn&amp;sig=l2muBsQVSQgeQyC3zJILTwDWdLw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAH3T5bTMo3rrQe20IHUBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=kashmiri%20pandits%20saraswat%20brahmins&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 July 2012|year=2008|publisher=APH Publishing House |location=5, Ansari Road, Darya Ganj, New Delhi |isbn= 8176482366 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 BC, the river Saraswati started vanishing under ground and the people on its banks started migrating to other parts of South Asia thus forming sub-communities.
During the Islamic invasions of modern day Pakistan and india, many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to flee due to religious oppression. Such as the saraswat Brahmin [[Kashmiri Pandit]].

===Sikhism===

The destruction of [[Hindu]] temples in [[India]] during the [[Islamic conquest of India]] occurred from the beginning of the Muslim conquest until the end the [[Mughal Empire]] throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In the book "[[Hindu Temples - What Happened to Them]]", Sita Ram Goel produced a politically contentious list of 2000 mosques that it is claimed were built on Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="jb"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10120488/Hindu-TemplesWhat-Happend-to-Them-by-Sita-Ram-Goel] Hindu temples- What happened to them&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th to 16th century many Saraswat Brahmins were forced to lead unsettled lifes, unable to practice their hereditary profession as Hindu priests, artists, teachers, scribes, technicians class (varna). They used their academia in their unsettled life travelling as scribes, genealogies, bards and astrologists. In the 15th century the religion of Sikhism was born causing many to follow the word of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Further conversions of the Saraswat Brahmins Bhats to Sikhism were induced by a royal preacher by the name of Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai.

Bhatra tradition and Sikh text states their ancestors came from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], where the Raja Shivnabh and his kingdom became the original 16th century followers of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of Sikhism. The Raja's grandson Prince Baba Changa after studying and competing in competition for 14 years under the high Pandit Chetan Gir earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets', and then settled himself and his followers all over India as missionaries to spread the word of Guru Nanak, where most of northern Saraswat Brahmin Bhat became Bhat Sikhs. The Bhats also contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.1389–1409), known as the "Bhata de Savaiyye".&lt;ref name="http://www.bhatra.co.uk"/&gt; They also wrote the [[Bhat Vahis]], which were scrolls or records on the Gurus and Sikhism maintained by the Bhat Sikhs. As Guru Nanak and Sikhism do not support the caste system, the Bhat people do not consider themselves as a caste in the typical sense due to the message of Guru Nanak, but a clan within [[Sikhism]] linked by Guru Nanak which is not shackled by the caste system. The majority were from the northern [[Saraswat Brahmin]] caste ([[Bhat clan]]),([[Bhat (surname)]]) as the Prince Baba Changa Bhat Rai although a [[kshatriya]], trained under Brahmins scholars and shared the Bhat [[Brahmin]] heritage due to his passion for religion, many continued to be called the Bhat/Bhat-rai sikhs, eventually leading to the name Bhat-ra Sikh. The sangat also had many members from different areas of the Sikh caste spectrum, such as the Hindu Rajputs and Hindu Jats who joined due to Bhat sikh missionary efforts. The [[Ramaiya]] community of [[Uttar Pradesh]] is said to be a sub-clan of Bhatra origin.&lt;ref&gt;Sikh Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are many Hindus and Muslims that share the Brahmin Bhat heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[^ https://books.google.com/books?id=QpjKpK7ywPIC&amp;pg=PA365&amp;lpg=PA365&amp;dq=History+of+kashmir+and+its+people&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-RI_8tLrab&amp;sig=8d9tzPeeB5lAjaq9RZqzYO8QydA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ab9pSobcB46PkAXutZW4Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6]&lt;/ref&gt; Today modern Bhat sikhs are commonly known to have pioneered many of the first Gurdwaras outside of India and have donated to various Gurdwaras.

They were executed along with the Guru at the Kotwali (police-station) near the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk area of Old Delhi, under the express orders of emperor Aurangzeb. Bhat Bhai Sati Das was wrapped in cotton wool and set on fire by the Mughal authorities for refusing to denounce his faith. His brother Bhat Bhai Mati Das was also tortured to death, by having his head sawn in two.

On 16 December 1634 the Sikh forces under the command of Rai Jodh and Kirt Bhat waged a guerrilla attack on Mughal forces at night, whereby the Sikhs routed and defeated the enemy. Guru Sahib lost 1200 Saint Soldiers including Kirat Bhat Ji. On the other side Sameer Beg and his two sons Shams Beg and Qasim Beg were also killed. The Mughal forces fled to Lahore leaving behind the dead and wounded.

After the Battle of Kartarpur, Guru Hargobind Sahib moved towards Kiratpur Sahib, which was under the rule of Raja Tara Chand (a hill state chief). Guru Sahib's entourage was suddenly ambushed by a contingent of royal forces under the command of Ahmed Khan in the village Palahi near Phagwara town on 29 April 1635. It caused considerable loss on the Guru's soldiers. In which Bhai Dasa Ji and Bhai Sohela Ji (sons of Ballu Bhat, and grandsons of Mula Bhat) sacrificed their lives.&lt;ref name="bhatra.co.uk"&gt;http://www.bhatra.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Religious Bhats also went to fight as "warrior-saints" against [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] persecution in the [[Khalsa]] campaign inspired by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji. Since many Bhat lived as travelling [[missionary|missionaries]], their mobility led them to depend on occupations which did not require a settled life.&lt;ref name="Sikh Encyclopaedia"&gt;[http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/main.php?article=199&amp;title=BHATRAS&amp;tgt=B&amp;brief= Sikh Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhat Kirat’s grandson Bhat Narbadh (son of Keso Singh) was in attendance to Guru Gobind Singh and accompanied him to Nanded (now Sachkand Hazur Sahib) where Guru Ji spent his last days. In the Bhat-Vahis, Bhat Narbadh records an entry, of the conferment of Guruship upon the Guru Granth Sahib in 1708 upon the death of Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref name="bhatra.co.uk"/&gt;

By the 19th century Bhat was the name of a [[Indian caste system|caste]] or ''jati'' within the Indian tradition of social classes, each with its own occupation. Even though Sikhism itself does not support separation by caste, the social system meant that the Bhat followed a hereditary profession of [[missionary|missionaries]], bards,scribes, poets and genealogists while some also foretold the future,&lt;ref&gt;HA Rose, ''Glossary of Tribes and Castes of the Punjab'' (Lahore 1883), quoted by Pradesh&lt;/ref&gt; if they were considered to have [[clairvoyant]] or astrological ability's, most of which were from a [[Brahmin]] heritage, eventually becoming salesman due to economic change however it is not uncommon to see Bhats in other professions such as farming and retail. According to [[John Nesfield|Nesfield]] as quoted in W. Crooke, The Tribes and Castes of the North Western India, 1896, Bhats frequently visited the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records of their genealogies. They have been praised for business acumen, described as people with "a spirit of enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/main.php?article=199&amp;title=BHATRAS&amp;tgt=B&amp;brief= Sikh Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; They were a small clan compared to others and many people in india did not know of them.&lt;ref name="Pradesh"&gt;Pradesh&lt;/ref&gt; Though some lived in Lahore, many Bhat can trace their roots to villages around Sialkot and Gurdaspur Districts.&lt;ref name="Pradesh"/&gt;

In the 21st century due to the changing world and new opportunities which are available, Bhats have almost completely left their missionary and hereditary professions, to pursue careers in Engineering, Medicine, Law, Banking, Politics, Music etc.

==Origins==

According to the ''Sikh Encyclopedia'', Bhat is related to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhatta'', a bard or poet.

===Raja Shivnabh and Prince Baba Changa Rai===

Guru Nanak met Raja Shivnabh, who was the grandfather of Changa Rai. The Guru bestowed the title of sangat on the Raja and his people, united seven kingdoms and made the Raja Shivnabh leader of them all.&lt;ref&gt;Haqiqat Rah Muqam shivnabh raje ki page 624 [p.1248]khari&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the Raja was the ruler of [[Batticaloa]].&lt;ref&gt;For more on Guru Nanak's journey to Batticaloa/Batticola see: [http://www.globalsikhstudies.net/pdf/janamsakhi.pdf Kirpal Singh, ''Janamsakhi Tradition'' (Amritsar 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theafter the grandson of Raja Shivnabh, Changa Rai or Changa Bhat, a disciple of Guru Nanak's mentioned in the [[Janamsakhis]]. Earned the title ‘Bhat Rai’ – the ‘Raja of Poets, and then settled himself and his few followers all over India as missionaries, where many Sikhs and general Indians became Bhat Sikhs., A congregation led by a teacher called Baba Changa Rai is described in an old document called the ''Haqiqat Rah Muqam''.&lt;ref&gt;''Haqiqat Rah Muqam'' "included in Bhai Banno's "bir", according to the [http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/main.php?brief=&amp;tgt=C&amp;article=29&amp;lastArt=111 Sikh Encyclopedia] and others.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Sikh Encyclopedia'' discusses the link between Bhat Sikhs,Raja Shivnabh and Prince Changa Bhat, who became a disciple of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Due to the Princes title ‘Bhat Rai’ he added Bhat to his name and spread the word of Guru Nanak to his followers, who also became known as Bhats or Bhatras.&lt;ref name="Sikh Encyclopaedia"/&gt;

Bhatra Sikhs are said to have a mixed ancestry, the mass majority of Bhats were Punjabi saraswat [[Brahmin]]. The Northern traveling Saraswat Hindu [[Brahmin]]s joined Sikhism due to the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the preaching efforts of the Sikh prince Baba changa Bhat Rai. However, as by the commandment of Guru Nanak, caste discrimination was deemed as blasphemy and so the Sikh Bhats also have a mixed ancestry due to the missionary work of the Bhat prince and his followers to spread the message of Sikhism. Some [[Kambojas]], [[Tarkhan]], [[Jat]], [[Rajput]], [[Khatri]], [[Gujjars]] and others also joined. Many Bhats are apart of the [[Khalsa]] and [[Nihang]] of Sikhism.

M.S. Ahluwalia, a Senior Fellow at the Indian Council of Historical Research, New Delhi, offers historical evidence for Guru Nanak's presence in Sri Lanka, probably in the year 1510.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhspectrum.com/082004/ceylon_guru_nanak.htm M.S. Ahluwalia, ''Guru Nanak in Ceylon'' (Sikh Spectrum Quarterly 2004)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104211712/http://www.sikhspectrum.com/082004/ceylon_guru_nanak.htm |date=4 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A place called Singaldeep or Sangladeep is often mentioned in 'Hakikat-Rah-Mukaam-Shivnabh-Raje-Ki' and is stated to be in Sri Lanka.

==Bhat Sikhs in the United Kingdom==
Bhat Sikhs started to arrive in the United Kingdom in the 1920s, but most immigrated in the late 1940s or 1950s.

In the 1920s some men travelled to Britain to work as door-to-door salesmen, most leaving their families in the Punjab to begin with. By the time of the [[Second World War]] there were a few hundred Sikhs clustered in British seaports like [[Cardiff]], [[Bristol]], and [[Southampton]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Some returned to India when war broke out, but others stayed on and used contacts with Punjabi merchant seamen to import scarce goods.

===Partition===

The [[Partition of India]] in 1947 led many Sikhs to emigrate, and the Bhat population in the UK was greatly enlarged. Later arrivals tended to join relatives, friends and neighbours from the Punjab, so that some British Bhat communities have links to one or two particular villages.&lt;ref&gt;Nye&lt;/ref&gt; Difficult journeys following Partition are not forgotten. The [[Edinburgh]] Sikh women's group (Sikh Sanjog) has exhibited artwork telling the story of leaving the Punjab and arriving in a strange land. A 2001 obituary of a senior figure in the Cardiff Bhat community described the trials of leaving northern India in turbulent times.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Mail'', 13 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jobs===
The traditional Bhat profession of itinerant salesman, Business men and taxi drivers was useful to those arriving in the UK, and was "a skill with considerable potential".&lt;ref name="Pradesh"/&gt; At first most Bhat, like some other Sikhs, worked either as doorstep or market traders (working with the [[Khatri]] community), but some settled in big cities like [[Leeds]] or [[Birmingham]], gave up self-employment and took waged jobs in industry. (At this time many educated immigrants to Britain had difficulty finding employment suited to their qualifications and experience, because of racial and/or cultural prejudice.)

Bhat traders gradually moved into other roles as self-employed businessmen, often specialising in retailing. By the end of the 1950s selling door-to-door was less common and many British Bhat Sikhs moved towards commercial enterprises like market stalls, shops, supermarkets and wholesale warehouses.&lt;ref name="Pradesh"/&gt;

‘One group of Sikhs who kept their
turbans were a group called Bhartedas (sic)’.&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Raj, 1997, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gurdwaras===
When possible the Bhat community have established [[Gurdwara]]s (temples). The first of which was opened in [[Manchester]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Sikh Encyclopaedia"/&gt; As of 2006 there are more than 30 Bhat or Bhat Sikh temples in the UK, the newest being the one opened in [[Peterborough]] in 2004. In some British towns Bhats are a small proportion of the overall Sikh population (in [[Glasgow]] 5%); elsewhere, as in Edinburgh, they are in the majority. Many Bhats took the role of [[Gyani]]s in the newer established Gurdwara, especially in [[Luton]] and [[Leicester]].

[[File:Rome-Palatin-fonds de cabanes.JPG|thumb|Iron Age hut foundations on the Palatine Hill considered to be the ''Casa Romuli'']]
The '''''Casa Romuli''''' ("hut of Romulus"), also known as the '''''tugurium Romuli''''', was the reputed dwelling-place of the legendary founder and first king of [[Rome]], [[Romulus]] (traditional dates 771-717 BC).&lt;ref name="Nardini1819"&gt;{{cite book|author=Famiano Nardini|title=Roma antica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6U_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|year=1819|pages=156–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was situated on the south-western corner of the [[Palatine hill]], where it slopes down towards the [[Circus Maximus]], near the so-called "Steps of [[Cacus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius I.79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Romulus'' 20&lt;/ref&gt; It was a traditional single-roomed peasants' hut of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], with straw roof and [[wattle-and-daub]] walls, such as are reproduced in miniature in the distinctive [[urns|funerary urns]] of the so-called [[Latial culture]] (ca. 1000 - ca. 600 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Cornell (1995) 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius II.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, the ''casa'' was repeatedly damaged by fire and storms, but carefully restored to its original state on each occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] ''Ant. Rom.'' I.79&lt;/ref&gt; Destruction by fire is recorded for 38 BC, as a result of a ceremony held inside the ''casa'' by the ''[[pontifices]]'' ("College of High Priests"), presumably a burnt sacrifice to Romulus in his deified state as the god [[Quirinus]], during which the altar-fire probably ran out of control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio|Dio]] XLVIII.43&lt;/ref&gt; The last recorded fire was in 12 BC, on the death of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], right-hand man of the first [[Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]] (ruled 30 BC - AD 14). On this occasion, the ''casa'' was apparently set on fire by some crows which dropped pieces of burning meat, again snatched from an altar, onto the thatched roof.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LIV.29&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that a ''tugurium Faustini'' on the Palatine recorded in the time of the emperor [[Constantine I the Great]] (ruled AD 312-37) was in reality the still surviving ''casa Romuli''.&lt;ref&gt;Platner (1929) ''Casa Romuli''&lt;/ref&gt;

A second ''casa Romuli'' is recorded in the classical sources, on the [[Capitoline Hill]], probably a replica of the original. It is last mentioned in AD 78.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius II.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platner (1929) ''Casa Romuli''&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, archaeologists have been unable to definitively associate the ''casa Romuli'' with any extant remains.&lt;ref name="PensabeneFalzone2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrizio Pensabene|author2=Stella Falzone|title=Scavi del Palatino I: l'area sud-occidentale del Palatino tra l'età protostorica e il IV secolo a.C., scavi e materiali della struttura ipogea sotto la cella del Tempio della Vittoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fa6zugozXqMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2001|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=978-88-8265-119-0|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong candidate is the largest of a group of dwellings whose foundations were unearthed in the appropriate location during excavations in 1946. The dwelling's foundations were cut into the [[tufa]] bedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m X 3.6m perimeter. Six post-holes arranged in a circle of which one in the centre were presumably to accommodate the supporting struts for walls and roof respectively. Organic material found in the site has been dated to the Italian early [[Iron Age]] (ca. 900-700 BC).&lt;ref&gt;ArcheoGuida ''Casa Romuli''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chapel of São Frutuoso''' ({{lang-pt|Capela de São Frutuoso}}), also known as the '''Chapel of São Frutuoso of Montélios''' ({{lang-pt|Capela de São Frutuoso de Montélios}}) or the '''Chapel of São Salvador of Montélios''' ({{lang-pt|Capela de São Salvador de Montélios}}), is a [[pre-Romanesque]] chapel in the civil parish of [[Real (Braga)|Real]], municipality of [[Braga Municipality|Braga]]. It is part of group of religious buildings that include the Royal Church, and originally built by the [[Visigoths]] in the 7th century, in the form of a [[Greek cross]]. Since 1944, it has been classified as a [[National Monument]] ({{lang-pt|Monumento Nacional}}).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70191/|title=Capela de São Frutuoso|last=|first=|date=|website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt|archive-url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70191/|archive-date=2018-03-26|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Interior. Pormenor de uma das arcadas triplas que antecedem três das quatro ábsides.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The triple horseshoe-shaped arch division between the arms of the Chapel]]
Based on historical accounts, and oral tradition, the site of the chapel was (around 560 A.D.) the location of a small Roman villa and, likely, a temple dedicated to the god [[Asclepius]].&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1903 |editor=SIPA |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |title=Capela de São Frutuoso de Montélios/Capela de São Salvador de Montélios |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |year=2004 |accessdate=2 July 2011 |first=Isabel |last=Sereno |first2=Paulo |last2=Dordio |first3=Joaquim |last3=Gonçalves |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072716/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=1903 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 656, [[Fructuosus of Braga]], then Bishop of Bracara, founded on this site the Monastery of São Salvador, ordering the construction of the chapel, as his tomb. In the biography of his life, São Valerius confirms as much, mentioning that the saint who founded the convent was buried there (between 665 and 666).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In the 9th-10th century, the chapel was reconstructed and redecorated.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From a document dated in 883, the chapel was reconsecrated to ''São Salvador'', also affirming the original construction to between 656 and 665.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Around the 12th century, following the [[Reconquista]] from the Arabs, with the revival of the Christian community and affinity for ''Saint'' Frutuoso of Braga, a cult to the saint was begun. In 1102, the [[Archbishop]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Dom (title)|D.]] Diogo Gelmires, transferred the mortal remains of Frutuoso to Compostela.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1523, Archbishop [[Dom (title)|D.]] Diogo de Sousa founded the [[Franciscan]] convent of the Order of the ''Capuchos da Piedade'', alongside the chapel of São Frutuoso, likely destroying the older Monastery of São Salvador.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

From notes by [[friar]] Manuel de Monforte (in 1696), in his ''Crónica da Província da Piedade'' (''Chronicle of the Province of Piedade''), the chapel ''"is in [the shape of a cross] with all sides equal; whose points form four chapels, whose walls close in a half-circle. One of the chapels, which one can call the foot of the cross, serves as the entrance where the door is; another which rightly corresponds to this one, as the head of the cross, serves as the principal chapel, or where the altar is; in the other two, which are the arms, are the two collateral altars; having both about 17 palms, and half a square, in this so small space this church has 24 columns: four at the main entrance to the door, six in each collateral chapel, and eight in the main of all..."''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1728, by order of Archibishop [[Dom (title)|D.]] Rodrigo de Moura Teles, the beginnings of a reconstruction and remodelling of the Convent of São Francisco's Church is undertaken, with the chapel of São Frutuoso integrated into the Church.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From this point forward, the Chapel is accessible from the main Church, owing to significant alterations; this changes include, the destruction of the main façade, the modification of the eastern and western arms of the [[Latin cross]]-design; and alterations to the internal columns, including changes to the [[baldachin]]s.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

It was architect Ernest Korrodi who first promoted the recuperation of the original plan for the chapel (in 1897), publishing a small note entitled ''"Um Monumento Latino-Bizantino em Portugal"'' (''A Latin-Byzantine Monument in Portugal'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; More than a century would pass, before João de Moura Coutinho e Sousa Lobo would begin to restore the original plan in 1931.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The architect followed the original hypothesis that the chapel was ordered constructed by [[Fructuosus of Braga]] as his 6th century tomb, following a model/design aesthetic based on the mausoleum [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia|Galla Placidia]] in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This redesign was followed by the DGEMN reconstruction of [[cupola]] and roof in 1939, again in 1941, repairs in 1958, that included the reconstruction of the walls, door, plastering of the cupola and several projects around the churchyard. In 1961, the pavement, main arch, reconstruction of the staircase and consolidation of the vaulted ceiling were undertaken, followed by conservation projects in 1966.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Similar repairs were undertaken in 1970 (repair and cleaning of the roof), in 1973 (checking of the rood, repairs, painting conservancy and arrangement of the area around the chapel), in 1984 (arrangement of the roof and paintings) and in 1987 (new projects evolving conservancy).

==Architecture==
The chapel is situated on the eastern lateral façade of the church of the Convent of São Francisco, below the level of the latter. While access to the interior of the chapel is made from the church, its original exterior access was made from through a small enclosed courtyard and gates. East of the chapel are the ruins of the old convent and its dependencies, in addition to the Fountain of Santo António ({{lang-pt|Fonte de Santo António}}) which is further below these buildings. To the southeast, the old granite pavement leads to the Quinta do Lago (''Estate of the Lake'') and the Escola Primária de Real (''Primary School of Real'') to the west.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The chapel of São Frutuoso continues to be an enigma, but it is a uniquely rare example of [[Visigoth]]ic structures in Portugal, based on a Greek-cross, which may have followed the design of a Byzantine mausoleum comparable to the 
[[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia|Galla Placidia]], in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The church is laid out in a [[Greek cross]] design, with a rectangular exterior, and semi-circular interior arms (to the north, south and east).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the exterior, the main volume of the chapel is surmounted by a tower-like cupola and cross, with the roof covered in rounded tiles. The limestone walls are surmounted by edged cornices, preceded by frieses, also in limestone, in the shape of rope, semi-circles, six-pointed rosettas and fleur-de-lis. The collateral façades are decorated with blind arcades, alternating between angular and double rounded-frieses, which are repeated in the tower cupola, and intersected by small round windows. The principal façade, which was the main entrance at one time, is highlighted by a grand arch portico, preceded by staircase. In northern part of the eastern arm of the chapel is an [[arcosolium]], where the mortel remains of Saint Fructuosus was originally entombed, and exposed to the exterior.

===Interior===
The inner masonry walls are defined by round arches, supported by large pillars, above which are large decorated friezes, with triple horseshoe-shaped arches, and a larger central arch. The chapel's arms are crossed in the middle of the wall by a narrow ribbon of limestone. While the interior arms are supported by wooden joists, the interior part of the hemispherical dome is plastered and painted white. The granite floor slabs are inscribed with coat of arms, and preceded from the main church by a staircase to the lower chapel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">'''''Chidatsu''''' (c653) was a priest of the [[Hosso]] School of [[Japanese Buddhism]].

==Nomenclature and etymology==
Chitatsu / Chidatsu (智達)

==Exegesis==
''The [[Soka Gakkai]] Dictionary of Buddhism'' (2002) mentions [[Hsyan-tsang]], [[Tz'u-en]], [[Dosho of Gango-ji]], [[Nara religion|Nara]], [[Gango-ji]], [[Chitsuare]] in reference to elucidating that Chitatsu was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A priest of the Dharma Characteristics (Hosso) school in Japan. In 658, together with Chitsu, he journeyed to China and studied the doctrine of the Dharma Characteristics school under Hsyan-tsang and his disciple Tz'u-en. They brought the doctrine back with them. Earlier, [[Dōshō]] of [[Gangō-ji]] temple in [[Nara, Nara | Nara]] went to China in 653 and studied under Hsyan-tsang. On his return he spread the Dharma Characteristics teaching at Gango-ji. Thus Chitatsu and Chitsuare regarded together as the second to propagate the doctrine of this school in Japan. After his return, Chitatsu lived at Gango-ji temple and disseminated the Dharma Characteristics doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Soka Gakkai]] Dictionary of Buddhism'' (2002). ''Chitatsu''.

'''Chinese Taoist Association''' (CTA ; {{zh|c=中国道教协会}}), founded in April 1957, is the main association of [[Taoism]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is recognized as one of the main religious associations in the People's Republic of China, and is overseen by the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]]. Dozens of regional and local Taoist associations are included in this overarching group, which is encouraged by the government to be a bridge between Chinese Taoists and the government, to encourage a patriotic merger between Taoism and government initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.gov.cn/2007-09/19/content_755854.htm Jia attends China Taoist Association's 50th founding anniversary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009023028/http://english.gov.cn/2007-09/19/content_755854.htm |date=2007-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also disseminates information on traditional Taoist topics, including forums and conferences. The association was a major sponsor of the 2007 International Forum on the [[Tao Te Ching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/daodejingforum/207901.htm The Way to Harmony: International Forum on the ''Daodejing'' - china.org.cn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Taoist Association advocates the recompensation of losses inflicted on Taoism by the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Taoism was banned for several years in the People's Republic of China during that period. 

Taoist practitioners in China are required to register with the Chinese Taoist Association in order to be granted recognition and official protection. The CTA exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel, and dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine.&lt;ref name=CECC2011&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf Annual Report 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |date=February 13, 2013 }}, Oct 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to  ‘‘fervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.’’&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; The central government of China has supported and encouraged the Association, along with other official religious groups, in promoting the "harmonious society" initiative of Communist Party General Secretary [[Hu Jintao]].&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News Agency, [http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/208446.htm China to Build Harmonious Society with Wisdom of Taoism] 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dianetics]] and [[Scientology]], '''Clear''' is one of the major states practitioners strive to reach on their way up the [[Bridge to Total Freedom]]. The state of Clear is reached when a person becomes free of the influence of [[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], unwanted emotions or painful traumas not readily available to the conscious mind.  Scientologists believe that human beings accumulate anxieties, psychosomatic illnesses, and aberration due to receiving engrams throughout their lives, and that by applying Dianetics, every single person can reach the state of Clear.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Laurie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/us/07scientology.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clear+scientology&amp;st=nyt "Defectors Say Church of Scientology Hides Abuse"], ''The New York Times'', March 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Clear is defined by the [[Church of Scientology]] as person who no longer has a "[[reactive mind]]", and is therefore free from the reactive mind's negative effects. A Clear is said to be "at cause over" (that is, in control of) their "mental energy" (their thoughts), and able to think clearly even when faced with the very situations that in earlier times caused them difficulty. The next level of spiritual development is that of an [[Operating Thetan]]. A person who has not reached a state of Clear is called a "pre-clear."&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7Ao1LN3XUUC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22clear%22+scientology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VmQ9TLiGOJP-nAe82ZTeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clear%22%20scientology&amp;f=false "Making Sense of Scientology"], in James R. Lewis. ''Scientology''. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics states that a person's awareness is influenced by the stimulus-response nature of the reactive mind. Achieving the state of Clear means a person has overcome the reactive mind and is in complete control of their analytical mind. According to Hubbard: "A Clear is a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause. The Clear has no engrams which, when restimulated, throw out the correctness of his computations by entering hidden and false data."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/Html/Part14/Chp50/pg1019-a.html What is Scientology web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] noted, “Being Clear meant being able to do all those things which one could currently not do, and to which one aspired so desperately.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lgHtauc5R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22church+of+scientology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW3tvQ6r3JAhUI0WMKHbYhDmUQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22church%20of%20scientology%22&amp;f=false |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |accessdate=2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the cost of reaching the Clear state in Scientology is $128,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/od/controversymisconception/a/scientology_cos.htm How Much Does Scientology Cost?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The state of Clear==
In ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', [[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of [[Scientology]], states that becoming a Clear strengthens a person's native individuality and creativity, and that a Clear is free with his emotions. In ''The State Of Clear,'' a Clear is defined as "a being who no longer has his own reactive mind, and therefore suffers none of the ill effects the reactive mind can cause".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050128013320/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/catechism/pg039.html The State Of Clear: Catechism of Scientology official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard states that merely knowing what the cognition is does not have the effect of realizing it for oneself:

{{quote|Now, we've known for a long time that a thetan made up his own bank (reactive mind), but telling him so didn't get him over it. And we've just found out again that telling him so didn't get him over it, too. Even when he's almost Clear. We say, "Hey, you're mocking it up," and he'd say, "Hey, am I mocking it up? Yeah, I am mocking it up." And he'll go Clear &amp;mdash; pshew! &amp;mdash; and he goes off that bottom step that isn't there, you know? And he's got to go back on and finish it up the way he should. It's got to be his cognition.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Hill Special Briefing Course lecture # 434, 26 July 1966''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard described Clears as having "an awareness which can create energy at will, and can handle and control, erase or re-create an analytical or reactive mind". Hubbard claimed that Clears have complete memories and know why events in their lives have happened, which leaves them free to pursue their goals without hindrances (the "[[reactive mind]]") emanating from past experiences. Religious scholar Pat Cook compared being "Clear" to the concept of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]] in Zen Buddhism: like nirvana in Buddhism, Clear is a state of being that is highly desired and respected in Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientology and Dianetics |journal=[[The Journal of Education]] |year=1971 |last=Cook |first=Pat |volume=153 |issue=4 |pages=58–61 |jstor=42773008 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2016-03-18 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clear state is said to be achieved through the Scientology practice of [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]. A person undergoing auditing is called a "pre-clear", often abbreviated to "PC", in [[Scientology terminology]]. The Church of Scientology claims that if all individuals in the world were “Clear”, the world would be “free of drugs, war, pollution, crime, mental illness and other ills.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newport|first1=John P.|title=The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue|date=1998|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=9780802844309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps after Clear==
After attaining the state of Clear, a person may go on to study the [[Operating Thetan]] levels, which are described in Scientology materials as states where the ability to operate outside the body via "exteriorization" becomes commonplace. Beyond that comes "Cleared Theta Clear", which Hubbard describes this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move [[MEST (Scientology)|&lt;nowiki&gt;MEST [matter, energy, space, and time]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Scientology 8-8008'', p. 114 (1st ed.), p. 151 (1990 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early Clears==
There are several conflicting accounts of who first attained the state of Clear, and under what circumstances. In August 1950, amidst the success of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as "the world's first Clear."  However, despite Hubbard's claim that she had "full and perfect recall of every moment of her life", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word "now" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in "present time," which blocked her abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Russell|last=Miller|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard|year=1987|isbn=0-8050-0654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;

Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working ''incognito'' in Hollywood posing as a [[swami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech| first=L. Ron| last=Hubbard| title=The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, Lecture 18| date=October 1958| quote="by 1947, I had achieved clearing."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=Levy|title=Scientology|journal=Life|date=1968-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Wendy|last=Michener|title=Is This the Happiest Man in the World?|journal=Maclean's|date=1966-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMaster had joined Scientology around 1962, having experienced relief of chronic stomach pain after his first auditing session. He became a leading public spokesman for Scientology and later a member of the [[Sea Org]]. He left in November 1969, expressing continuing belief in the Scientology [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Tech]], but disapproval of the way Scientology was managed.&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Atack|title=A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed|year=1990|isbn=0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Devachan'''  (compound word; Sanskrit 'deva', gods, and the Tibetan word 'chan' Wylie: 'can', possessing, having, subject to) is the "dwelling of the gods" according to the original teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] as formulated by [[H.P. Blavatsky]].

==Theosophy==
''Devachan'' is regarded as the place where most souls go after death where desires are gratified, corresponding to the [[Christian]] belief in Heaven. However, Devachan is a temporary, intermediate state of being before the soul's eventual rebirth into the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''The Theosophical Glossary''. Theosophical Publishing Society, 1892, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

| width =  75%
| align = center}}

=== According to C.W. Leadbeater===
[[C.W. Leadbeater]] located the "Devachan" on the [[mental plane]] many miles far above the surface of Earth.  While those souls at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|zeroth level of initiation]] (the vast majority of the inhabitants of Earth) go to [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] (located on the [[astral plane]] only a few miles above the surface of Earth) when they die, those who have reached the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|first, second, or third levels of initiation]] go to Devachan when they die.  The final Heaven where souls at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fourth level of initiation]] (those souls who have become [[arhats]] and no longer need to reincarnate) is called [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]].  When reaching the fourth level of initiation, one can become a [[pratyekabuddha]] and enter Nirvana right away, or become a [[List of Buddhas|buddha]] or [[bodhisattva]] and teach others before entering.  One can also choose to become a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] in the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] upon reaching the fourth level of initiation—then one's entrance into Nirvana is delayed for millions, billions, or trillions of years until one has completed climbing the [[Initiation (Theosophy)#Levels of initiation beyond the tenth level|ladder of initiation]] by completing one's tasks as a Master in the Spiritual Hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' 1926,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm Various Levels of the Afterlife in Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthroposophy==
From the perspective of [[anthroposophy]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] asserts that the Lower Devachan (or the Heavenly World) and Higher Devachan (or the World of Reason) are two "supersensible" realms, above the [[astral realm]], associated with [[emotions]] and [[Volition (psychology)|will impulse]], respectively. In comparison, the mental realm is associated with [[thought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner, Rudolf]] |url= http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/JeshuPandira/19111104p02.html |title= Jeshu ben Pandira Who Prepared the Way for an Understanding of the Christ Impulse (part I) |publisher= [[Rudolf Steiner Archive]] }} The first of two lectures delivered at Leipzig on November 4 and 5, 1911.

'''Richard Claxton Gregory''' (October 12, 1932&amp;nbsp;– August 19, 2017) was an American comedian, [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist, social critic, writer, conspiracy theorist,&lt;ref name="Wiley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4749316 "Dick Gregory's Role as Michael Jackson's Adviser"], NPR, July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; entrepreneur,&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiley|first=Ed|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|title=The 9/11 conspiracy: Rubbish or reality? – US news – Life – Race &amp; ethnicity|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 9, 2006|access-date=April 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319012825/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14789644/|archivedate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4749316 "Dick Gregory's Role as Michael Jackson's Adviser"], NPR, July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasional actor. During the turbulent 1960s, Gregory became a pioneer in stand-up comedy for his "no-holds-barred" sets, in which he mocked bigotry and [[Racism in the United States|racism]]. He performed primarily to black audiences at [[Racial segregation|segregated]] clubs until 1961, when he became the first black comedian to successfully cross over to white audiences, appearing on television and putting out comedy record albums.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Here's all you need to know about pioneering comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory, who has died aged 84|url=http://www.newsweek.com/dick-gregory-heres-what-you-need-know-about-pioneering-comedian-and-civil-652431|accessdate=August 20, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=August 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was at the forefront of political activism in the 1960s, when he protested the Vietnam War and [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|racial injustice]]. He was arrested multiple times and went on many hunger strikes.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy Now'', Amy Goodman, August 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a speaker and author, primarily promoting spirituality.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

Gregory died of heart failure at a Washington, D.C., hospital at age 84 in August 2017.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Gregory was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the son of Lucille, a housemaid, and Presley Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/dick-gregory "Dick Gregory"], Contemporary Black Biography. ''Encyclopedia.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt; When he was nine years old, he was the victim of a racist attack for touching a white woman's leg while shining her shoes.&lt;ref name="vecono" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Obituary: Richard "Dick" Gregory died on August 19th|url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21728607-american-comedian-dietician-and-civil-rights-campaigner-was-84-obituary-richard-dick|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]], he was aided by teachers, among them Warren St. James; he also excelled at running. Gregory earned a track scholarship to [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] (SIU),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeiSpeakers.com/speakerbio.php?SpeakerID=461 Dick Gregory], AEI Speakers Bureau. Accessed December 11, 2007. "A track star at Sumner High School, Gregory earned an athletic scholarship in 1951 to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and became the first member of his family to attend college."&lt;/ref&gt; where he set school records as a half-miler and miler.&lt;ref name="root-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Fields-White|first1=Monée|title=Comedian and Civil Rights Activist Dick Gregory Dead at 84|url=http://www.theroot.com/comedian-and-civil-rights-activist-dick-gregory-dead-at-1797977671|magazine=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity. In 1954, his college career was interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the [[United States Army]]. At the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of his penchant for joking, Gregory got his start in comedy in the Army, where he entered and won several talent shows. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university "didn't want me to study, they wanted me to run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven|title=African Americans in the Performing Arts|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1438107765|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hopes of becoming a professional comedian, Gregory moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included [[Nipsey Russell]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Godfrey Cambridge]], all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition that presented stereotypical black characters. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: "Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?"&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt;

Gregory began his career as a comedian while serving in the military in the mid-1950s. He served in the Army for a year and a half at [[Fort Hood]] in Texas,  [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]] in Virginia, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was drafted in 1954 while attending Southern Illinois University. After being discharged in 1956, he returned to the university but did not receive a degree. He moved to Chicago with a desire to perform comedy professionally.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html|title=About – Dick Gregory Global Watch|author=Flash|work=dickgregory.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617034501/http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html|archivedate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Gregory opened the Apex Club nightclub in Illinois. The club failed and landed Gregory in financial hardship. In 1959, Gregory landed a job as master of ceremonies at the Roberts Show Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaryproject.org/gregorydick/ "Dick Gregory – National Visionary"], National Visionary Leadership Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working for the [[United States Postal Service]] during the daytime, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized [[nightclub]]s. He was one of the first black comedians to gain widespread acclaim while performing for white audiences. In an interview with ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', Gregory described the history of black comics as limited: "Blacks could sing and dance in the white night clubs but weren't allowed to stand flat-footed and talk to white folks, which is what a comic does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saunders|first1=Lonna|title=Dick Gregory: "What I'm Running From" Bryn Mawr College Feb. 28|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/dick-gregory_b_2756800.html|accessdate=August 24, 2017|publisher=Huffington Post|date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Gregory was working at the black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago when he was spotted by [[Hugh Hefner]]. Gregory was performing the following material before a largely white audience:

{{quote|Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I understand there are a good many Southerners in the room tonight. I know the South very well. I spent twenty years there one night.

Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant and this white waitress came up to me and said, "We don't serve colored people here." I said, "That's all right. I don't eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken."

Then these three white boys came up to me and said, "Boy, we're giving you fair warning. Anything you do to that chicken, we're gonna do to you." So I put down my knife and fork, I picked up that chicken and I kissed it. Then I said, "Line up, boys!"&lt;ref&gt;[bit.ly/LooseWeightFast1]{{  Title=How to lose Weight Fast |date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gregory attributed the launch of his career to Hefner. Based on his performance at Roberts Show Bar, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago [[Playboy|Playboy Club]] as a replacement for comedian "Professor" [[Irwin Corey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/nyregion/21comicswe.html|title=A Bit Slower, but Still Throwing Lethal Punch Lines|first=Phillip|last=Lutz|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory made his first television appearance on the late night show ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]''.&lt;ref name=Paar&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Gregory's Appearance on Arsenio PT. 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUBS-sieOg|website=YouTube|access-date=November 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111200730/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUBS-sieOg|archivedate=November 11, 2016|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon began appearing nationally and on television.

Early in his career, Gregory was offered an engagement on ''Tonight Starring Jack Paar''.&lt;ref name=Paar/&gt; [[Jack Paar|Paar's]] show was known for helping propel entertainers to the next level of their careers. At the time, black comics did perform on the show, but after their performances, they were never asked to stay and sit on the famous couch and talk with the host.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/arts/dick-gregory-dies-at-84.html|title=Dick Gregory, 84, Dies; Found Humor in the Civil Rights Struggle|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=August 19, 2017|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Gregory declined several invitations from Jack Paar to perform on the show. Paar finally called him to find out why he refused to perform on his show. In order to have Gregory perform, the producers eventually agreed to allow him to stay after his performance and talk with the host on air.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; This was a first in the show's history. Gregory's interview on ''Tonight Starring Jack Paar'' spurred conversations across America.&lt;ref name=Paar/&gt;

Gregory's comedy occasioned controversy in some conservative white circles. The administration of the University of Tennessee, for instance, branded Gregory an "extreme racist"&lt;ref name="KNS-2017"&gt;Ernest Freeberg, [http://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/09/07/inviting-controversy-when-tennessee-students-demanded-free-speech-rights-half-century-ago/625129001/ "Inviting Controversy: When Tennessee Students Demanded Free Speech Rights, a Half Century Ago"], ''Knoxville News Sentinel'', September 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; whose "appearance would be an outrage and an insult to many citizens of this state",&lt;ref&gt;G. Michel, ''Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organization Committee, 1964-1969'' (Springer 2004), p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and revoked his invitation by students to speak on campus. The students sued, with noted litigator [[William Kunstler]] as their counsel, and in ''Smith v. University of Tennessee'', 300 F. Supp. 777 (E.D. Tenn. 1969), won an order from the court that the University's policy was "too broad and vague". The University of Tennessee then implemented an "open speaker" system, and Gregory subsequently performed in April 1970.&lt;ref name="KNS-2017" /&gt;

== Post-standup career ==
Gregory was number 82 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Stand-ups'' of all time and had his own star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=|access-date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-host with radio personality [[Cathy Hughes]], and was a frequent morning guest, on WOL 1450 AM talk radio's "The Power", the flagship station of Hughes' Radio One.&lt;ref name="globe-24aug2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Wil|last=Haywood|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2000/08/24/pain-and-passion-dick-gregory|title=The Pain and Passion of Dick Gregory|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=August 24, 2000|publisher=[[CommonDreams]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared regularly on the nationally syndicated ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' program.&lt;ref name="huffpo-20aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinckley|first1=David|title=How Dick Gregory Took Himself Off the Main Stage, and Why|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-dick-gregory-took-himself-off-the-main-stage-and_us_599922e7e4b03b5e472cf06c|website=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory appeared as "Mr. Sun" on the television show ''[[Wonder Showzen]]'' (the third episode, entitled "Ocean", aired in 2005). As Chauncey, a puppet character, imbibes a [[hallucinogen]]ic substance, Mr. Sun warns, "Don't get hooked on imagination, Chauncey. It can lead to terrible, horrible things." Gregory also provided guest commentary on the ''Wonder Showzen'' Season One DVD.&lt;ref name="ign-15mar2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drucker|first1=Michael|title=Wonder Showzen: Season One|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/16/wonder-showzen-season-one?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=March 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large segments of his commentary were intentionally bleeped out, including the names of several dairy companies, as he made potentially defamatory remarks concerning ill effects that the consumption of [[Milk|cow milk]] has on human beings.

Gregory attended and spoke at the funeral of [[James Brown]] on December 30, 2006, in [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="pbs-20aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nguyen|first1=Daisy|title=Comedian, civil rights activist Dick Gregory dies|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/comedian-civil-rights-activist-dick-gregory-dies/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was an occasional guest on the Mark Thompson's ''Make It Plain'' Sirius Channel 146 Radio Show from 3pm to 6pm PST.&lt;ref name="laugh-2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggins|first1=Bambi|title=Laughing Mad: The Black Comic Persona in Post-soul America|date=2007|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=9780813539850|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REBY5ldTaAAC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;ots=c3SXt5CDVO&amp;dq=dick-gregory%20%22make%20it%20plain%22&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=dick-gregory%20%22make%20it%20plain%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory appeared on [[Alex Jones (radio host)|''The Alex Jones Show'']] on September 14, 2010, March 19, 2012, and April 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="jones-14sep2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Icon Dick Gregory: The Social Engineers are Here to Divide and Conquer Us 1/4|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujo6CQKQNrI|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-19mar2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama: The Globalist Ultimate Puppet with Civil Rights Icon Dick Gregory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVoXIT49qKs|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jones-1apr2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Of Malaysia Flight 370: "Brain-Heist"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XBEKS3bWzc|website=The Alex Jones Channel|via=YouTube|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory gave the keynote address for Black History Month at [[Bryn Mawr College]] on February 28, 2013.&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/dick-gregory_b_2756800.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|first=Lonna|last=Saunders|title=Dick Gregory: "What I'm Running From" Bryn Mawr College Feb. 28|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His take-away message to the students was to never accept injustice.

{{quote|Once I accept injustice, I become injustice. For example, paper mills give off a terrible stench. But the people who work there don't smell it. Remember, Dr. King was assassinated when he went to work for [[Memphis sanitation strike|garbage collectors]]. To help them as workers to enforce their rights. They couldn't smell the stench of the garbage all around them anymore. They were used to it. They would eat their lunch out of a brown bag sitting on the garbage truck. One day, a worker was sitting inside the back of the truck on top of the garbage, and got crushed to death because no one knew he was there.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;}}

Even as late as 2013, Gregory continued to be a ringing voice of the [[Black Power|black power]] movement. Towards the end of his life, he was featured in a Fantagraphics book by Pat Thomas entitled ''Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975'', which uses the political recordings of the Civil Rights era to highlight sociopolitical meanings throughout the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lightintheattic.net/releases/685-listen-whitey-the-sounds-of-black-power-1967-1974 "Listen, Whitey! The Sounds of Black Power 1967–1974"], Light in the Attic Records.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory is known for comedic performances that not only made people laugh, but mocked [[The Establishment|the establishment]]. According to Thomas, Gregory's monologues reflect a time when entertainment needed to be political to be relevant, which is why he included his standup in the collection. Gregory is featured along with the likes of [[Huey P. Newton]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Langston Hughes and Bill Cosby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-semioli/listen-to-this-book-the-s_b_4173930.html|work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|first=Tom|last=Semioli|title=Listen to This Book: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had 11 children (including one son, Richard Jr., who died two months after birth):  Michele, Lynne, Pamela, Paula, Stephanie (also known as Xenobia), Gregory, Christian, Miss, Ayanna, and Yohance.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt; He was criticized for being an absent father. In a 2000 interview with ''The Boston Globe'', Gregory was quoted as saying, "People ask me about being a father and not being there. I say, 'Jack the Ripper had a father. Hitler had a father. Don't talk to me about family.'"&lt;ref name="globe-24aug2000"/&gt;

==Activism==
===Political activism===

==== Civil rights movement ====
[[File:Dick Gregory Tallahassee.jpg|thumb|Gregory in 1969 in Tallahassee]]
Gregory was active in the [[civil rights movement]]. On October 7, 1963, he came to [[Selma, Alabama]], and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as "Freedom Day" (October 7, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Zinn]], ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train''. Beacon Press, 1994; rev. ed. 2002, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Gregory became more involved in civil rights activities, activism against the [[Vietnam War]], economic reform, and anti-drug issues. As a part of his activism, he went on several [[hunger strike]]s and campaigns in America and overseas. In the early 1970s, he was banned from Australia, where government officials feared he would "...stir up demonstrations against the Vietnam war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19710910&amp;id=0LsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ikYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7222,2658601|last= Hart |first=Jeffrey  |title=Evonne Goolagong Plays Tennis in South Africa| date=September 10, 1971|work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Gregory played a role in the search for three [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|missing civil rights workers]], [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman]], and [[Michael Schwerner]], who vanished in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. After Gregory and members of [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] met with [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] Sheriff [[Lawrence A. Rainey]], Gregory became convinced that the Sheriff's office was complicit. With cash provided by [[Hugh Hefner]], Gregory announced a $25,000 reward for information. The [[FBI]], which had been criticized for inaction, eventually followed suit with its own reward, and the rewards worked. The bodies of the three men were found by the FBI 44 days after they disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Dick Gregory Forced the FBI to Find the Bodies of Three Civil Rights Workers Slain in Mississippi|url=http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/45776-how-dick-gregory-forced-the-fbi-to-find-the-bodies-of-three-civil-rights-workers-slain-in-mississippi|date=September 14, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017|agency=http://readersupportednews.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a civil rights rally marking the 40th anniversary of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], Gregory criticized the United States, calling it "the most dishonest, ungodly, unspiritual nation that ever existed in the history of the planet. As we talk now, America is 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 96 percent of the world's hard drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsMax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/8/102152.shtml|title=Newsmax.com – Breaking news from around the globe: U.S. news, politics, world, health, finance, video, science, technology, live news stream|author=Newsmax|work=newsmax.com|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909184044/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/8/102152.shtml|archive-date=September 9, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. =====
Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|that of John F. Kennedy]]. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as ''[[Rush to Judgment]]''. The pair wrote the King conspiracy book ''Code Name Zorro'', which postulated that convicted assassin [[James Earl Ray]] did not act alone. Gregory also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="Wiley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt;

==== Native American rights ====
In 1966, Gregory and his wife were arrested for illegal net fishing along side of the [[Nisqually people|Nisqually]] people in Washington state in a protest [[fish-in]]. The tribe was protesting against the state laws that ban forms of fishing other than [[Hook and line fishing|hook-and-line]] because it barred their rights guaranteed to them through a federal treaty that allowed them to fish in their traditional ways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native North American Almanac|last=Champagne|first=Duane|publisher=Gale Group|year=2001|isbn=0787616559|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released from jail in [[Olympia, Washington]] after six weeks of [[fasting]] to call attention to the violation of [[Native American treaties]] by the United States government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Political career ====
Gregory began his political career by running against [[Richard J. Daley]] for Mayor of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not win, this would not prove to be the end of his participation in electoral politics.&lt;ref name="guardian-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Gregory, pioneering US comedian and activist, dies aged 84|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/20/dick-gregory-pioneering-us-comedian-and-activist-dies-aged-84|accessdate=August 20, 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory ran for President of the United States in 1968 as a [[write-in candidate]] of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the [[Peace and Freedom Party]]. He garnered 47,097 votes, including one from [[Hunter S. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Hunter S.|authorlink=Hunter S.

His running mate in New Jersey was Dr. David Frost of Plainfield, a biologist, Rutgers professor, and Chairman of NJ SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy).Famed pediatrician Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]] was the running mate in Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People's Party Nominates Dr. Spock For President|author=|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=November 29, 1971|pages=B5|url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spock, Gregory to Be on Ballot|author=|newspaper=Cape Girardeau Southeast Missourian|date=March 6, 1968|page=10|url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; garnering more than the party he had left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1940|title=Our Campaigns - US President National Vote Race - Nov 05, 1968|work=ourcampaigns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freedom and Peace Party also ran other candidates, including Beulah Sanders for [[New York State Senate]] and Flora Brown for [[New York State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourCampaigns.com/PartyDetail.html?PartyID=1597|title=Our Campaigns – Political Party – Freedom &amp; Peace (FPP)|work=ourcampaigns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts landed him on the [[master list of Nixon's political opponents]].

Gregory then wrote the book ''Write Me In'' about his presidential campaign. One anecdote in the book relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of [[Operation Breadbasket]] in Chicago. The campaign had printed dollar bills with Gregory's image on them, some of which made it into circulation, causing considerable problems, but priceless publicity.  The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government.&lt;ref name="root-19aug2017"/&gt; A large contributing factor to the seizure came from the bills resembling authentic United States currency enough that they worked in many dollar-cashing machines of the time. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills could not really be considered United States currency, because "everyone knows a black man will never be on a U.S. bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Bradford|title=8 Memorable Political Campaigns by Comedians|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/08/8-memorable-political-campaigns-by-comedians/|accessdate=August 24, 2017|publisher=Splitsider|date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Warren Commission ====
Shortly after this time, Gregory became an outspoken critic of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|findings]] of the [[Warren Commission]] concerning the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. On March 6, 1975, Gregory and assassination researcher [[Robert J. Groden]] appeared on [[Geraldo Rivera]]'s late night ABC talk show ''Goodnight America''. An important historical event happened that night when the famous [[Zapruder film]] of JFK's assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|4DwKK4rkeEM|Zapruder film on Good Night America – 3/6/75 Robert Groden and Dick Gregory}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The public's response and outrage to its showing led to the forming of the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the [[Church Committee]] Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which resulted in the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigation.

==== Feminism ====
Gregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 joined [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Margaret Heckler]], [[Barbara Mikulski]], and other suffragists to lead the ''National ERA March for Ratification and Extension'', a march down [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] to the [[United States Capitol]] of over 100,000 on [[Women's Equality Day]] (August 26), 1978, to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], and for the ratification of the ERA.&lt;ref name="vibe-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Muhammad|first1=Latifah|title=Dick Gregory, Comedic Legend And Civil Rights Activist, Dead At 84|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/08/dick-gregory-comedian-activist-dead-at-84/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, Members of Congress, and activists. The ERA narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date.

==== Anti-Apartheid ====
On July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the [[Amandla Festival]] where [[Bob Marley]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Eddie Palmieri]], amongst others, performed.&lt;ref name="boston-24may2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eaton|first1=Perry|title=Long before Boston Calling, there was the Amandla Festival|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/music/2017/05/24/long-before-boston-calling-amandla-festival-brought-bob-marley-and-social-justice-to-harvard|website=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory gave a speech before Marley's performance, blaming President [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], and showing his support for the international [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]]. 

==== US Embassy Hostage Crisis in Iran ====
Gregory was an outspoken activist during the [[Iran hostage crisis|US Embassy Hostage Crisis in Iran]]. In 1980, he traveled to [[Tehran]] to attempt to negotiate the hostages' release and engaged in a public hunger strike there, weighing less than 100 pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg) when he returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="latimes-19aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dick-gregory-20170819-story.html|title=Dick Gregory, who rose from poverty to become a groundbreaking comedian and civil rights activist, dies at 84|author=Dennis McLellahn|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=August 19, 2017|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Martin Luther King, Jr. ====
[[File:WIKI - Dick Gregory 1995.jpg|thumb|right|In October 1995 Gregory returned to the Broadway stage to perform comedy once again after a 23-year absence.]]

Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|that of John F. Kennedy]]. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as ''[[Rush to Judgment]]''. The pair wrote the King conspiracy book ''Code Name Zorro'', which postulated that convicted assassin [[James Earl Ray]] did not act alone. Gregory also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="Wiley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt;

In 1998, Gregory spoke at the celebration of the birthday of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., with President [[Bill Clinton]] in attendance. Not long after, the President told Gregory's long-time friend and public relations consultant [[Steve Jaffe]], "I love Dick Gregory; he is one of the funniest people on the planet." They spoke of how Gregory had made a comment on Dr. King's birthday that broke everyone into laughter, when he noted that the President made Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] ride "in the back of the plane," on an Air Force One trip overseas.&lt;ref name="cnn-15jan1996"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton leads tribute to King|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9601/mlk/clinton/|accessdate=August 20, 2017|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=January 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Health ====
Gregory was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]] in late 1999. He said he was treating the cancer with herbs, vitamins, and exercise, which he believed kept the cancer in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findArticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_26_97/ai_62685512|title=Dick Gregory Talks About His Fight With Cancer|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Gregory was a figure in the [[health food]] industry by advocating for a raw fruit and vegetable diet. He wrote the introduction to Viktoras Kulvinskas' book ''Survival into the 21st Century''. Gregory first became a vegetarian in the 1960s and lost a considerable amount of weight by going on extreme fasts, some lasting upwards of 50 days. He developed a diet drink called "Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink" and went on TV shows advocating his diet and to help the morbidly obese.&lt;ref name="guardian-19aug2017"/&gt;

==== Animal rights ====
In 2003, Gregory and [[Cornel West]] wrote letters on behalf of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) to [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]'s CEO, asking that the company improve its animal-handling procedures.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_47_37/ai_111013629/ PETA Recruits Comedian, Activist in Anti-KFC Push]," ''Nation's Restaurant News'', November 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pollution ====
In 2008, Gregory stated he believed that air pollution and intentional water contamination with heavy metals such as lead and possibly manganese may be being used against black Americans, especially in urban neighborhoods, and that such factors could be contributing to high levels of violence in black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/dick-gregory-blasts-insane-racist-system-america|title=Dick Gregory Blasts 'Insane, Racist System' in America|date=July 7, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hunger strikes ====
On September 10, 2010, Gregory announced that he was going on a hunger strike. In a commentary that was published by the [[Centre for Research on Globalisation]] Web site in Montreal, he said that he doubted the official U.S. report about the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

=== Health Enterprises, Inc. ===
In 1984, he founded Health Enterprises, Inc., a company that distributed weight-loss products. With this company, Gregory made efforts to improve the life expectancy of African Americans, which he believed was being hindered by poor nutrition and drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/dick-gregory-funny-blunt-civil-rights-advocate "Dick Gregory, Funny, Blunt Civil Rights Advocate"], African American Registry.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Gregory introduced the "Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet", a powdered-diet mix.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', August 1985, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He launched the weight-loss powder at the Whole Life Expo in Boston under the slogan "It's cool to be healthy". The diet mix, if drunk three times a day, was said to provide rapid weight loss. Gregory received a multimillion-dollar distribution contract to retail the diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088677,00.html "The Dick Gregory Diet: Lose Weight Fast – Without Fasting – and Get (Him) Rich Quick"], ''People'' archive, September 17, 1984, Vol. 22, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Ethiopian government adopted, to reported success, Gregory's formula to combat malnutrition during a period of famine in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=dick+gregory+%22united+nations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LY5yawosmc&amp;sig=fKLB4kzI0YZ2BepHQkeJgyHlR-c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjByrywjujVAhWI6iYKHdymA_8Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dick%20gregory%20%22united%20nations%22&amp;f=false|title=Jet|last=Company|first=Johnson Publishing|date=May 27, 1985|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's clients included [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt;

In 2014, Dick Gregory updated his original 4X formula, which was the basis for the Bahamian Diet and created his new and improved "Caribbean Diet for Optimal Health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Diet|url=http://www.wellnessinnature.com/|access-date=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his health treatments have been described as "unorthodox" and "profitable rot".&lt;ref name="vecono" /&gt;

==Death==
A week prior to his death, Gregory was hospitalized in [[Washington, D.C.]], with a bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/amp/Entertainment/wireStory/comedian-civil-rights-activist-dick-gregory-dies-49317506|title=Comedian and activist Dick Gregory dies at 84|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=August 20, 2017|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the hospital in Washington, D.C., on August 19, 2017, at the age of 84.&lt;ref name="latimes-19aug2017"/&gt; The cause was [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dick-gregory-dead-stand-up-comedy-legend-civil-rights-activist-was-84-1004479|title=Dick Gregory, Trailblazer of Stand-Up Comedy, Dies at 84|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=August 19, 2017|date=August 19, 2017|author=Mike Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3966">In [[Assam]], [[Bengal]] and [[Odisha]], '''Dol Purnima or Dol Jatra''' ; is a major festival. This [[festival]] is  dedicated to [[Sri Krishna]]. On this auspicious day, an image of Krishna, richly adorned and besmeared with colored powder ([[Abir]] in Bengali and assam and Odisha), is taken out in procession, in a swinging [[palanquin]], decorated with [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], colored [[clothes]] and [[paper]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holi (Phalguna-purnima or Dol-purnima)|url=http://ramakrishnamission.org/dol_purnima.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procession proceeds forward to the accompaniment of music, blaring of [[conch shell]]s, trumpets and shouts of 'Jai' (victory).

Dol Purnima becomes all the more significant for Bengalis, because this is also the birthday of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1485–1533). He was a great [[Vaishnava]] [[saint]], who popularized modern [[sankirtana]]. He elevated the passion of [[Radha and Krishna]] to a high [[spirituality|spiritual]] plane. He underlined the emotional at the cost of the ceremonial side of devotion. Followers of [[Chaitanya School of Vaishnavism]], believe Chaitanya to be the manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu believed that the essence of [[sadhana]] is always the loving remembrance of [[Hari]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}


'''Days of Celebration'''


The first day of Deul is known as gondh .In the evening time, the full incarnation of Lord Vishnu, god Krishna become ready to visit Ghunucha’s (one of the wife of Krishna) place. His followers make a bonfire in front of the kirtan-ghar and with the beat of Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, idol of Krishna carried round the firework and then to the doul. During the festival, all the regular religious functions of kirtan ghar (prayer house) are performed. 

The second day of Deul is known as Bhor-Deul – meaning main Dol. Bhor Deul is celebrated for just one day in the month of Chot and two three days in the month of Phalgun. The idols are coloured with faku on this day.

The third day of Deul is also spent in the same manner as that of the second day. 

The last and the fourth day of Doul festival is called Sueri. On that day, god Krishna is supposed to go back to the house of mother Lakshmi from the house of Ghunucha .Devotees bring down god Krishna to a palanquin (dola) and carried in a procession. Participation of people from various regions creates a sea of devotees there. In the rhythm of the Vaishnavite drums, cymbals, conches, etc., Holi songs rend the sky. People throw coloured powders to one another. When the procession arrived at kirtan ghar, the gate is block with bamboos by the followers of Mother Lakshmi. It is believed that, Mother Lakshmi become angry with her husband god Krishna, because He stayed at Ghunucha’s place for all these days. The followers of Mother Lakshmi therefore stop the opposite group from entering her house. But at last, the bamboos are broken and Lord Krishna entered the campus and takes seven round of kirtan ghar. ‘He tires and takes rest for a while. Taking advantage of the peace, a devotee from Lakshmi’s side ‘reproves’ him; one of his devotees returns the reproof. An interesting verbal duel thus ensues. In the end he admits defeat, like a peace loving husband, satisfies her with money and other presents and earns His admittance into the shrine. There ends the great Deul festival’ (Das, 1972:89-90).

'''Einer Nielsen''' (1894–1965) was a Danish physical [[mediumship|medium]] and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 475. {{ISBN|978-0879753009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kragh 2003"&gt;Kragh, Jesper Vaczy. ''Danish Spiritualism, 1853–2012''.

[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger]]. pp. 77–78. {{ISBN|978-0-313-39947-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nielsen was born in [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]]. He travelled in [[Europe]] giving [[séance]]s and claimed to be able to produce spirit [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 652. {{ISBN|978-0766128170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally investigated by the Danish Society for Psychical Research who produced a favourable report of his mediumship. However, the report was disputed by other researchers. Norwegian investigators suspected Nielsen to be a fraud and investigated him in 1922. The committee from the [[University of Oslo|Kristiania University]] discovered that his [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] was fake.&lt;ref name="Kragh 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Universitetskomiteen, Mediet Einer Nielsen, kontrolundersøkelser av universitetskomiteen i Kristiania (Kristiania 1922). Anonymous. ''Rapport fra den av Norsk Selskab for Psykisk Forskning nedsatte Kontrolkomité''. Norsk Tidsskrift for Psykisk Forskning 1 (1921–1922), pp. 110–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the new report by the Norwegians which was negative and covered strongly by the Danish [[news media]], the original report by the Danish Society for Psychical Research was seen as an embarrassment and several members resigned from the society.&lt;ref name="Kragh 2003"/&gt; 

The psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] sat with Nielsen in [[Copenhagen]] with "unsatisfactory results."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter ''The Mechanics of Mediumship''. In [[Harry Price]]. (1939). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Longmans, Green &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen was also caught hiding his ectoplasm in his [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;Brower, M. Brady. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 171. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Johs Carstensen the leader of Nielsen's spiritualist circle wrote a pamphlet which exposed his tricks.&lt;ref&gt;Carstensen, Johs. (1932). ''Spiritismens Princip og Fejlgreb. Specielt: Afsløring af Mediet Einer Nielsen''. Brandmose's Forlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen continued to work as a medium until his death but was never considered credible again by people outside his small circle of influence. He published the book ''Solid Proofs of Survival'' in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Einer. (1950). ''Solid Proofs of Survival''. Translated by [[Helmi Krohn]]. London: Psychic Book Club.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elias David Sassoon''' (27 March 1820 – 21 March 1880), an Indian merchant and banker born in [[Baghdad]], was the second son of [[David Sassoon]], an Iraqi-Indian philanthropist Jewish businessman involved in trade in India and the Far East, with branches at Calcutta, Shanghai, Canton, and Hong Kong; and his business, which included a monopoly of the opium-trade, extended as far as Yokohama, Nagasaki, and other cities in Japan. He was father to [[Jacob Elias Sassoon]] and [[Edward Elias Sassoon]]. 

He was the first of his siblings to assist the family business' expansion into China when he opened a branch of the business there in 1844. He was also involved in his father's business in Bombay, India.  In 1867, Elias established his own business based in Hong Kong and Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sassoon|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13218-sassoon|website=Jewish Encyclopaedia|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elias died in Colombo in 1880.

'''The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC)''' is a growing network of over 500 independent, [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches mainly in the [[United Kingdom]] that preach an evangelical faith.

==History==
The FIEC was formed in 1922 under the name ''A Fellowship of Undenominational and Unattached Churches and Missions'', but was later renamed ''The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches''. The Fellowship brought together many independent churches and mission halls, which had been somewhat isolated.&lt;ref name= EJPC&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fountain| first = David | title = Contending for the Faith: E. J. Poole-Connor - A Prophet Amidst the Sweeping Changes in English Evangelicalism | publisher = Wakeman Trust | location = London| page = 174 | date =  22 March 2005  | isbn = 9781870855327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIEC is in the Independent tradition. According to the National Director of FIEC, "An ‘Independent’ church is self-governing. Each individual local church has ultimate control over its own affairs. It does not belong to any external body or institution which has control over it."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/strand-blog/independent-but-not-alone&lt;/ref&gt; The FIEC leadership claims it exercises 'something comparable to the sub-apostolic' ministry of Timothy and Titus.&lt;ref name= IC&gt;{{Cite book | last = Stevens| first = John | title = Independent Church | publisher = 10P Publishing |  page = 315 | date =  1 November 2014  | isbn = 9781909611658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace the routes of Independency to separatists, such as [[Robert Browne (Brownist)|Robert Browne]] in the time of Elizabeth I and James I of England, but "separatism" may be an unhelpful term to use in the present day to describe FIEC, because although a church has to be autonomous and self-governing to affiliate to the FIEC, one of the main purposes of the FIEC is that local churches should work together to share resources as they seek to advance the Christian Faith. However, it is correct to note that a number of churches joined FIEC when they separated from a denomination that moved away from what they considered to be historic orthodox biblical Christianity. For example, [[Westminster Chapel]], a leading church in the Independent tradition, joined the FIEC when the [[Congregational Union]] merged with the English Presbyterian Church to form the [[United Reformed Church]] denomination (URC). Many Independent churches within the FIEC are Baptist churches but the FIEC is open both to churches that only baptise adults and also to churches that baptise the children of believers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/strand-blog/all-in-the-family-baptism-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Presidents include Rev. Theodore Harold Bendor-Samuel (1967, 1978).&lt;ref name=ET&gt;[http://www.evangelical-times.org/archive/item/230/Obituaries/Theodore-Bendor-Samuel/] Theodore Bendor-Samuel, April 1998, [[Evangelical Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==FIEC Practical Services==
FIEC Limited is a registered charity and trust corporation working under the title FIEC [https://fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/strand/C4 Practical Services].  It holds church property in trust for many churches and also provides legal advice to churches and other charities. In most cases where it holds property in trust for churches, its role is limited to acting in accordance with the lawful instructions of the church for which it holds the property, although in some cases, it does also have decision making powers concerning the use of the property.

== Church Planting ==
The FIEC has been very active in church planting over recent years and has a number of resources available to help churches and individuals considering starting a new church. [https://fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/article/church-planting]

The main FIEC website also provides a map of recent church plants [https://fiec.org.uk/news/article/putting-church-planting-on-the-map here]

The [https://fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/article/go-into "Go Into" project] from the FIEC highlights 50 places across Great Britain with little or no evangelical witness relative to population size to help those thinking about starting a new church.

== Leadership ==
The FIEC is led by a team of directors. The senior director is the National Director, John Stevens. Other directors are [[Adrian Reynolds]] (Training), Andy Patterson (Mission), Richard Underwood (Pastoral), Andy Hunter (Scotland), Gemma Adam (Practical Services) and Trevor Archer (London).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fiec.org.uk/about-us/staff|title=Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches|last=Churches|first=Fellowship of Independent Evangelical|website=FIEC|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other churches==
FIEC is the largest corporate partner of [[Affinity (Christian organisation)|Affinity]], which was previously called the British Evangelical Council.&lt;ref name=Affinity&gt;[http://www.affinity.org.uk/belonging/article/affinity_partners/ Affinity. "The FIEC is the largest constituent member body of those which make up Affinity."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822032841/http://www.affinity.org.uk/belonging/article/affinity_partners/ |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also believe that [[Ecumenism]] in the form of Churches Together is not a positive move, citing various reasons including the liberal stance of other churches.&lt;ref name=unity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiec.org.uk/resources/article/gospel-unity-statement |title=FIEC's policy on uniting with other churches and groups |work=FIEC statement on Gospel Unity, official website |accessdate=2014-05-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PuKd9bJZ?url=http://www.fiec.org.uk/resources/article/gospel-unity-statement |archivedate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust Board has recently affirmed that formal membership of Churches Together (CT) is inconsistent with the FIEC Statement on Ecumenism.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} However a number of fellowships publicly profess their affiliation to CT.

===Issues raised by the Bible League Quarterly from 2009 to 2012===

Allegations of engagement in ecumenism by a missionary to Poland of [[Carey Baptist Church]] have also been made in articles in the July 2009&lt;ref name=BLQ09&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bibleleaguetrust.org/articles/fiec2.pdf | title = More downgrade in the FIEC |work= Bible League Quarterly |date= July 2009 | archiveurl = http://strateias.org/downgrade.pdf | archivedate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2010&lt;ref name=BLQ10&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bibleleaguetrust.org/articles/deepeningdowngrade_fiec.pdf |title= Deepening Downgrade In The FIEC |work= Bible League Quarterly |date= January 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725072812/http://www.bibleleaguetrust.org/articles/deepeningdowngrade_fiec.pdf |archivedate= 2011-07-25 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; issues of the ''Bible League Quarterly'',&lt;ref name=BLQ&gt;[http://www.bibleleaguetrust.org/quarterly.html Bible League Quarterly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217123601/http://www.bibleleaguetrust.org/quarterly.html |date=2010-02-17 }} retrieved May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; a journal once edited by the Fellowship's own founder, Rev [[E. J. Poole-Connor]].&lt;ref name="EJPC"/&gt; it now has a circulation of just over 1000 copies per issue.{{cn|date=September 2018}} This issue is regarded by some as controversial as it is alleged to be a violation of the Fellowship's own statement in 1996 opposing ecumenism.&lt;ref name="ecumenism"&gt;[http://www.strateias.org/96statement.htm the 1996 FIEC Council Statement on Ecumenism]&lt;/ref&gt; As an association of autonomous churches, the FIEC has defended the responsibility of Carey's elders to examine the allegations, but declined to examine them independently. The concerns were first raised in November 2008.&lt;ref name=claim&gt;[http://www.strateias.org/RU.pdf Published appeal for action] retrieved August 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 2012 a modified statement on ecumenism was published &lt;ref name=unity /&gt; and the old withdrawn.&lt;ref name="ecumenism"/&gt;
Further concerns about connections between prominent FIEC personalities and the Polish ecclesiastical scene were raised in 2012 by the same journal.&lt;ref name=BLQ12&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.strateias.org/deeper.pdf | title = Continued FIEC Cooperation with Polish Ecumenists | work= Bible League Quarterly | date= October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastors==
The FIEC offers [https://fiec.org.uk/what-we-do/strand/C3 numerous services] to pastors, including a national support team, help for pastors looking to find a church to serve in or for churches looking for a pastor to come and serve, accreditation, training and support.

The FIEC believes the classical [[Complementarianism|Complementarian]] view which recognises that the distinctive calling to be a pastor or elder in the local church, and to be the head of the home, is a calling for men.  It also recognises and encourages a wide calling of ministries within the church for women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/womenbishops.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821063416/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/womenbishops.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sikh Gurdwara''' or '''Sikh Gurdwara - San Jose''' (a [[gurdwara]] is the [[Sikh]] place of worship) was founded in [[San Jose, California]], [[United States|USA]] in 1985 by leaders of the then-rapidly growing [[Santa Clara Valley]] [[Sikh]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/San_Jose_Gurdwara_Sahib|title=San Jose Gurdwara Sahib - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|language=en|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest gurdwara in [[North America]].

==History==
Initially, the community met in a rented community center, but soon bought a small building in east San Jose. After buying nearby land in 1995, they decided it would be too expensive to build in the city limits, so they sold that land and bought a larger property further east. The first phase of the project of almost {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} was completed in 2004. 

The second phase was completed in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/05/29/power-struggle-at-sikh-temple-in-san-jose/|title=Power struggle at Sikh temple in San Jose|last=Rodriguez|first=Joe|origyear=May 29, 2015 |date=August 12, 2016|work=The Mercury News|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest gurdwara in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/us/20bcintel.html|title=Sikh Gurdwara Sahib Temple|last=Pellissier|first=Hank|date=2010-06-19|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-08-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{convert|90000|sqft|m2}}. The chief architect and designer of the project is the late Malkiat Singh Sidhu. The largest audience at the San Jose Gurdwara was on opening day when some 20,000 people were thought to have come.

'''Hasanabdal''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|حسَن ابدال}}}}), frequently misspelt as '''Hassan Abdal''', is a city in [[Attock District]] of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Province]] in [[Pakistan]], located 40&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the country's capital city, [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?client=ms-android-vivo&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=pk&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ll=33.8210214,72.6800204&amp;z=14&amp;ftid=0x38df079542156af3:0xcba7a5da497973aa&amp;q=Hassan+Abdal,+Attock,+Punjab&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFuO-00KbdAhVIUhoKHUILCsMQ8gEwAXoECAsQDw|title=Hassan Abdal|website=Hassan Abdal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As home of the [[Gurdwara Panja Sahib]], one of the most sacred sites in [[Sikhism]], Hasan Abdal is an important pilgrimage destination. The city is also notable for its association with the 16th century [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] - several monuments in the town date to the Akbar period, including the [[Mughal Garden Wah|Mughal Gardens of Wah]], [[Hakimon ka Maqbara]], and [[Tomb of Lala Rukh]]. Hasan Abdal is also near the city of [[Taxila]] – a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] famous for its [[Buddhist]] and [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ruins.

==Location==
Hasan Abdal is located in a strategic part of northern [[Punjab]], and was the location from which Mughal war expeditions were sent to the northwestern frontier.&lt;ref name="The Moghul Saint of Insanity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moon|first1=Farzana|title=The Moghul Saint of Insanity|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443883429|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_o_WCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22hasan+abdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrqrWjZ7UAhVKsFQKHbnnAk44FBDoAQhOMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hasan%20abdal%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, Hasan Abdal lies at the intersection of the [[Karakoram Highway]], and the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M1 Motorway]]. As part of the multibillion-dollar [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's [[Western Alignment]],&lt;ref name="dailytimes.com.pk"&gt;{{cite news|title=China to finance 90% of Sukkur-Multan Motorway|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/12-May-16/china-to-finance-90-of-sukkur-multan-motorway|accessdate=13 May 2016|agency=Daily Times|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Hakla–Dera Ismail Khan Motorway]] will commence at Hasan Abdal.

The famous Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] who visited the place in the 7th century A.D. mentions the sacred spring of Elapatra about 70 [[Li (unit)|li]] to the northwest of [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] which has been identified as the spring at of [[Gurdwara Panja Sahib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prasad|first1=Ram Chandra|title=Early English Travellers in India: A Study in the Travel Literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean Periods with Particular Reference to India|date=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=9788120824652|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nUx8ZzIHBsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22hasan+abdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrqrWjZ7UAhVKsFQKHbnnAk44FBDoAQhJMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hasan%20abdal%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The town is mentioned in [[Ain-i-Akbari]] in the context that Shams al-Din built himself a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] there in which lies Hakim Abu’l Fath buried. [[Akbar]]’s visit to the town on his way back from [[Kashmir]] is also mentioned.

William Finch who travelled through India between 1608 and 1611 describes Hasan Abdal to be a "pleasant town with a small river and many fair tanks in which are many fishes with golden rings in their noses ...; the water so clear that you may see a penny in the bottom".&lt;ref name="earlyEnglishTraveller"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nUx8ZzIHBsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22hasan+abdal%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=de&amp;sig=Z5_20CBS92CyBclJnBAb6JKoT_w#PPA224,M1 Early English Travellers in India by Ram Chandra Prasad]&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was seat for Mughal warring expeditions to the northwest frontier.&lt;ref name="The Moghul Saint of Insanity"/&gt; The Mughal emperor [[Jehangir]] mentions in his [[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]] this town by the name of Baba Hasan Abdal where he stayed for three days. He also praises the city in these words: "The celebrated place at this station is a spring which flows from the foot of a little hill, exceedingly clear, sweet and nice...".&lt;ref name="earlyEnglishTraveller" /&gt; Hasan Abdal was visited by various Mughal kings on their way to [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]]&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;[http://www.tourism.gov.pk/archaeoilogical_historical_sites_isb_destinations.htm Archaeological &amp; Historical Sites -Pakistan government]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raja Man Singh]] built the nearby [[Mughal Garden Wah|Wah Gardens]] during the reign of [[Akbar]]. The terraced gardens were divided into four parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine Blansha|title=Architecture of Mughal India, Part 1, Volume 4|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521267281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ctLNvx68hIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22hasan+abdal%22+mughal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bddgUyAwCD&amp;sig=1Xh5AA_0wg1_MOgz6oIG1iZoVD4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR_4aZiZ7UAhXIhVQKHaWZBPIQ6AEIVjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hasan%20abdal%22%20mughal&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shah Jahan]] rested at Hasan Abdal's Wah Gardens on his four expeditions to [[Kabul]].

===Muslim Tradition===
"The Muslim version of the story is that one Hasan, a [[Gujjar]], had many buffaloes; that a Faqir named Abdal came and asked him for a draught of milk. Hasan said, I would gladly give you some, but my buffaloes are at present dry. Abdal laid his hand on one of them and said, "Now milk it." He did so, and soon gave him a copious draught. Abdal expressed his gratitude to Hasan, and asked what he could do for him. Hasan replied that they were much straitened for want of water, on which Abdal struck the neighbouring hills in two places, from which the two streams of Hasan Abdal have come forth. On the departure of the Faqir, Hasan said the spot should hereafter be called after them jointly".

==Gurdwara==
In 1521 the founder of the Sikh faith, [[Guru Nanak]], arrived in Hasan Abdal, a Gurdwara was built on the spot that he stayed containing a sacred rock that is believed to contain the hand print of Guru Nanak.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; Punja or panja ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|پنجہ}}}} &lt;small&gt;([[Shahmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;; ਪੰਜਾ &lt;small&gt;([[Gurmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;) :hand or paw. There are different traditions about the origin of the Hand print.

==Infrastructure==
Hasan Abdal is located near the intersection of the [[Karakoram Highway]] heading northwest, and the [[M1 motorway (Pakistan)|M1 Motorway]] that connects Hassan Abdal to points northwest and southeast. As part of the multibillion-dollar [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), the Karakoram Highway will be rebuilt, while the Hasan Abdal area will serve as the terminus for CPEC's [[Western Alignment]].&lt;ref name="dailytimes.com.pk"/&gt; From the nearby village of Hakla, the [[Hakla–Dera Ismail Khan Motorway]] will run southwest out of the city and link Hassan Abdal to [[Dera Ismail Khan]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province.

==Health and medical care==
There is a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and numerous privately owned clinics in and around the city. Despite the exponential growth in population, the health care facilities are extremely insufficient. Many hospitals are located nearby [[Wah Cantonment]] or in [[Rawalpindi]].

==Education==
The city has several state owned primary schools, a high school each for boys and girls, a higher secondary school each for boys and girls and a degree college for women. There are a number of privately run schools to make up for the shortfall of the state owned ones.presentation convent high school is also established since 1956.

===Cadet College, Hasan Abdal===
[[Cadet College Hasan Abdal]] is the first [[Cadet Colleges in Pakistan|Cadet College]] in [[Pakistan]] and was established by the government of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] at the initiative of General [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]], the then [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], originally to serve as a feeder institution to the Services Academies. For this purpose, Military Wings were started in 1952 in [[Government Post Graduate College Sahiwal|Government College]], [[Sahiwal]], and [[Islamia College (Peshawar)|Islamia College]], [[Peshawar]]. On the completion of buildings at the present location, the Military Wings were shifted to Hasan Abdal and the Cadet College started functioning as Punjab Cadet College in April 1954. In 1960, the government constituted a Board of Governors to exercise administrative control over the college. [[Hugh Catchpole]] was the founder Principal of the College.

The college is located on the [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Peshawar]] road about 29 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]], in natural surroundings near the junction of the National Highway and [[Grand Trunk Road]].

==Environment==
Surrounded by the fresh water springs with crystal clear water and [[Loquat]] orchards the city used to be an idyllic place till recent past. Its beauty as mentioned in the earliest accounts&lt;ref name="earlyEnglishTraveller" /&gt; has somehow survived the ill planning that has resulted in an exponential increase in its population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9140">'''Hershel of Ostropol''' ({{lang-yi|הערשעלע אסטראפאלער|translit=Hershele Ostropoler}}, 1757 – 1811) is a prominent figure in [[Jewish humor]]. Hershele was a [[prank]]ster from [[Ostropol]], [[Ukraine]], who lived in poverty and targeted the rich and powerful, both Jew and Gentile. Common folks were not safe from his shenanigans, either, but usually got off lightly. He is also remembered by Ukrainian gentiles as something of an ethnic folk hero,&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, David A. and Weinstock, Ben, ''The Road from Letichev: The history and culture of a forgotten Jewish community in Eastern Europe, Volume 1''. {{ISBN|0-595-00666-3}} iUniverse, Lincoln, NE, 2000, pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; who could take on establishment forces much larger than himself with nothing but his humor.

While his exploits have been mythologized over the years, the character of Hershele is based on a historic figure, who lived in what is today [[Ukraine]] during the late 18th or early 19th century. He may have used his wits to get by, eventually earning a permanent position as [[court jester]] of sorts to Rabbi [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;Wiesel, Elie, 1978, ''Four Hasidic masters and their struggle against melancholy:'' Univ. of Notre Dame Press, p. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hershele stories, he was chosen by members of Rabbi Boruch's court in order to counter the rebbe's notorious fits of temper and lift his chronic melancholy.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, David A. and Weinstock, Ben, ''The Road from Letichev: The history and culture of a forgotten Jewish community in Eastern Europe, Volume 1''. {{ISBN|0-595-00666-3}} iUniverse, Lincoln, NE, 2000, pg. 79-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Hershele died of a fatal accident that was brought about by one of Rabbi Boruch's fits of anger. Hershele lingered for several days and died in Rabbi Boruch's own bed surrounded by Rabbi Boruch and his followers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Learsi. R., 1961, ''Filled with Laughter: A Fiesta of Jewish Folk Humor:'' Thomas Yoseloff, p. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to be buried in the old Jewish cemetery in [[Medzhybizh]], though his grave is unmarked.

Hershele was the subject of several epic poems, a novel, a comedy performed in 1930 by the [[Vilna Troupe]], and a US [[TV program]] in the 1950s.

Two illustrated children's books, ''The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol'', and ''[[Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins]]'', have been published. Both books were written by [[Eric Kimmel]] and illustrated by [[Trina Schart Hyman]].

A tale about him, ''When Hershel Eats-'' by [[Nathan Ausubel]], was included in [[Joanna Cole (author)|Joanna Cole]]'s 1982 work, ''Best-Loved Folktales of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Best-Loved Folktales of the World {{ISBN|1-56865-172-4}} pp. 462-464&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a play entitled ''Hershele the Storyteller''&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua H. and Pierce, Brooke, ''[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsP/pierce-brooke.html#99740 Hershele the Storyteller]'', performed at the American Theatre of Actors.&lt;/ref&gt; was performed in [[New York City]].

in 1999, Shari Aronson of [http://www.zpuppets.org Z Puppets Rosenschnoz] received permission from Eric Kimmel to adapt the book ''Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins'' for the stage. This adaptation has since been produced four times by MInnesota Jewish Theatre Company, with puppets by Chris Griffith winning a 2009 [[Ivey Awards|MN Ivey Award]], and multiple times by Jewish Community Centers across the U.S.

==Tales and examples==

===The Goose===
:When Hershele was a child, he had a number of brothers and sisters, of which he was the smallest. Thus, whenever they had a meal, he'd be the last to get anything. As a result, whenever they had goose, he never got to eat a foot, which was his favorite part. One evening, he snuck into the kitchen before dinner and cut a foot off of the goose, slipping it under his shirt to hide.
During dinner, his father noticed that Hershele's shirt was grease-stained and that the goose's left foot was missing.
::-	"Hershele," he said. "Did you take the goose's foot?"
::-	"No, father," he said. "Maybe it was a one-footed goose."
::-	"A one-footed goose? There's no such thing!"
::-	"Sure there is. I'll take you to see one after dinner."
That evening, Hershele took his father out to a lake near their village. A flock of geese were sleeping on the banks, each tucking one foot into its body so that only the other was visible.
::-	"There's one," said Hershele, pointing. Thinking to outsmart his son, his father clapped, waking the goose and causing it to lower its other leg.
::-	"There. Now, Hershele, will you admit that you stole-"
::-	"Wow, father! You just clapped and the goose grew a foot! Why didn't you do that to the one at the table?"

===My Father===
:Hershele was traveling along the road when he came to a small inn. He went up to the door and politely asked if he could have a bite to eat and a pile of hay in the stables on which to rest for the night. The innkeeper and his wife refused.
::-	"Oh, really, you're going to say no ''to me?''" snapped Hershel.
::-	"Y-yes," stammered the innkeeper, beginning to get worried.
::-	"You know what happens if you refuse me? I do what my father did when someone said no to ''him!'' Do you want me to do what my father did? Do you? Do you?"
::-	"Give him what he wants," hissed the innkeeper's wife into his ear. "He's clearly insane. I don't know what his father did, but it must be something terrible!"
Agreeing with his wife, the innkeeper allowed Hershele to stay for the night, going so far as to offer him a large meal and a place at their table. After dinner, he offered Hershele one of his finest rooms, to which the vagabond happily agreed.
::-	"So," he said as the dishes were cleared away. "Now that everything is settled, I'm curious: what did your father do?"
::-	"Well, since you ask so nicely, I'll tell you," Hershele replied. "When my father was alone starving on the road, and he was refused anything to eat, why he'd go to bed hungry!"

===Rolls and Doughnuts===
:Hershele once entered a restaurant and asked for two rolls. When these were brought to him he changed his mind, asked for two doughnuts instead, ate them, then walked out without paying. The owner ran after him and demanded to be paid for the doughnuts. 
::-	“But I gave you the rolls for them,” Hershele said. 
::-	“You didn’t pay for the rolls, either,” the owner said. 
::-	“Well, I haven’t eaten the rolls, have I?” Hershele replied and walked away.

===Good Manners===
:One time Hershele and a vagabond friend bought two loaves of bread. Hershele picked them up from the baker, then handed the smaller one to his friend and kept the larger one for himself. 
::-	“This is very impolite,” his friend said. 
::-	“What would you have done if you were me?” Hershele asked. 
::-	“I’d give you the large loaf and keep the small one, of course!” The friend said. 
::-	“Well, you’ve ''got'' the small one. Now what do you want?”

===On a Dare===
:On a dare to slap a hated man in his Jewish hometown, Hershele did just that, unprovoked. When the man asked him why he did this, Hershele replied that he thought the man was Berel. 
::-	“And if I’m Berel,” said the offended man, “does this give you the right to hit me?” 
::-	 “Keep your nose out of my and Berel’s affairs,” Hershele replied.

===The Pig===
:During the feast of [[Passover]], Hershele once sat across from a self-absorbed rich man who made derogatory remarks about Hershele’s eating habits. 
::-	“What separates you from a pig, is what I’d like to know,” the man said derisively. 
::-	“The table,” Hershele replied.

===The Painting===
:Once, Hershele was selling antiques and trinkets in the market. Among his wares was a large canvas, that was entirely blank. A customer asked Hershele what it was, and Hershele replied:
::-	"For a silver shekel, I will tell you about this painting. (The man, overwhelmed by curiosity, gives him a shekel). Well, this painting is a famous painting, depicting the Jews [[crossing the Red Sea]], with the Egyptians in pursuit."
::-	"Well, where are the Jews?"
::-	"They've crossed."
::-	"And the Egyptians?"
::-	"Haven't come yet."
::-	(Getting frustrated at having been duped) "And where's the Red Sea?!"
::-	"It's parted, dummkopf!"

==Film Adaptions==

Hershel of Ostropol was adapted into a 30-minute short film by Lukas Gordon in 2015, which received release on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4342010/|title=Hershel of Ostropol|date=25 January 2015|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[comparative religion]], many scholars, academics, religious figures have looked at the relationships between '''[[Hinduism]] and [[major religions|other religions]]'''

==Indian religions==

===Ayyavazhi===
{{Main|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}

[[Ayyavazhi]] and [[Hinduism]] are two belief systems in [[India]]. Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a [[Hindu denomination]], members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion's concepts of good, evil and [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayyavazhi Religion|url=http://www.religious-information.com/ayyavazhi-religion.html|work=religious-information.com|publisher=SBI|accessdate=29 March 2012|format=Web page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus view [[Vedas]], [[Gita]], and other texts from the [[Shastra]] as canonical scriptures, instead of the [[Akilam]]. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. [[Kaliyan]] bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Puranas]] lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about [[Venneesan]] ''"Avan pilathaal  vedamondruntakki"'' (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.

Though Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to [[Smartism]] and its [[Advaita]] beliefs in thought

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and Hinduism}}

===Jainism===
{{main|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Hinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards "freedom" (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapple|first1=Christopher|title=Asceticism and the environment|journal=Cross Currents|date=2008|volume=57|issue=4|pages=514–525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Hinduism and Sikhism}}

The historical interaction between [[Sikhism]] and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and have the majority of their followers there.

==Abrahamic and monotheistic religions==

===Christianity{{anchor|Hinduism and Christianity}}===
[[Ram Mohan Roy]] criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how "unreasonable" and "self-contradictory" they are.&lt;ref&gt;"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness. Page 166, by Abidullah Al-Ansari Ghazi, year = 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He further adds that people, even from India were embracing Christianity due to the economic hardship and weakness, just like European Jews were pressured to embrace Christianity, by both encouragement and force.&lt;ref&gt;"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness. Page 169, by Abidullah Al-Ansari Ghazi, year = 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vivekananda]] regarded Christianity as "collection of little bits of Indian thought. Ours is the religion of which Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is a very patchy imitation."&lt;ref&gt;"Neo-Hindu Views of Christianity", p. 96, by Arvind Sharma, year = 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Dayanand Saraswati]], regarded Christianity as "barbarous religion, and a 'false religion' religion believed only by fools and by the people in a state of barbarism,"&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhi on Pluralism and Communalism", by P. L. John Panicker, p.39, year = 2006&lt;/ref&gt; he included that Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and encouraging sin.&lt;ref&gt;"Dayānanda Sarasvatī, his life and ideas", p. 267, by J. T. F. Jordens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 the [[Niyogi Committee Report On Christian Missionary Activities]] was published by the Government of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This influential report on controversial missionary activities in India recommended that suitable controls on conversions brought about through illegal means should be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;CHAPTER 6 HINDUTVA, SECULAR INDIA AND THE REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H. Kim,  in Nationalism and Hindutva: A Christian Response : Papers from the 10th CMS Consultation, Mark T. B. Laing, 2005 {{ISBN|9788172148386}} &lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1950s, [[K.M. Panikkar]]'s work "Asia and Western Dominance" was published and was one of the first post-Independence Indian critiques of Christian missions. It argued that the attempt to convert Asia has definitely failed, and that this failure was due to the missionaries' claim of a monopoly of truth which was alien to the Asian mind; their association with imperialism and the attitude of moral and [[racial superiority]] of the [[Christian West]].&lt;ref&gt;CHAPTER 6 HINDUTVA, SECULAR INDIA AND THE REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H. Kim,  in Nationalism and Hindutva: A Christian Response : Papers from the 10th CMS Consultation, Mark T. B.

Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], wrote: {{quotation|Unfortunately Christian religion inherited the Semitic creed of the ‘jealous God’ in the view of Christ as ‘the only begotten son of God’ so could not brook any rival near the throne. When Europe accepted the Christian religion, in spite of its own broad humanism, it accepted the fierce intolerance which is the natural result of belief in 'the truth once for all delivered to the saints.'&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cDdpTcyJtxMC&amp;pg=PA641 The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]'', by Paul Arthur Schilpp, page = 641&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====History====
There has been some debate on historical connections between Christianity and Indian religion, it has focused on both [[Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhism]] (via [[Greco-Buddhism]]) as well as Hinduism. While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited [[Constantinople]] in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of [[Jesus Christ]] as detailed in the Bible, whereas Hinduism is not based on any one personality or one book, but rather on the philosophy that there is a god, or no god and just self, etc. Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; "Krishnology" is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between [[Krishnaism]] and the [[Christology|Christological]] dogmas of Christianity.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church, [[Bardesanes|Bar-Daisan]] (AD 154–223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.&lt;ref name="AFM"&gt;A. E. Medlycott, ''India and The Apostle Thomas'', pp.18–71;
M. R. James, ''Apocryphal New Testament'', pp.364–436;
A. E. Medlycott, ''India and The Apostle Thomas'', pp.1–17, 213–97;

V. A. Smith, ''Early History of India'', p.235;
L. W. Brown, ''The Indian Christians of St. Thomas'', p.49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism's historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' by the [[Second Vatican Council]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. 
(See also: [[Dalit theology]]).

====Doctrine====
Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: swarga) and hell (naraka) are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of "karma" takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is "moksha".

The Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members -- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]]—are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the "Creator" and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).

There have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism's description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through ''sophia'' has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.

In Hinduism (also in [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]), the concept of [[moksha]] is akin to that of Buddhism's [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity's doctrine of [[salvation]]. Hindu sannyasi [[Swami Tripurari]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ’s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father’s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us “the way” more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents “the way” in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The [[Krishna]] conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead’s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://harmonist.us/2009/05/christ-krishna-caitanya/ Christ, Krishna, Caitanya]'', [http://harmonist.us/ The Harmonist], May 31, 2009.{{better source|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model, and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers,(See also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]]). While others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Islam===
{{main|Hindu–Islamic relations}}

Hindu – Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early 7th century. [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] are two of the world’s three largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the [[Indian subcontinent]], their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a [[tawhid|strictly]] [[monotheistic]] religion in which the supreme deity is [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|الله}} {{transl|ar|"the God"}}: see [[God in Islam]]), the [[Islamic prophets|last Islamic prophet]] being [[Muhammad|Muhammad ibn Abdullah]], whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the [[Qur'an]]. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other [[Indian religions]], including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Islam shares common characteristics with [[Abrahamic religions]]–those religions claiming descent from the [[prophet]] [[Abraham]]–being, from oldest to youngest, [[Judaism]], Christianity, [[Islam]].

The [[Quran|Qur'an]] is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for [[Sunni]]s, are the [[Sunni]] [[Six major hadith collections|six major collections]] of [[Hadith|hadīth]], which are traditional records of the [[Sunnah|sayings and acts]] of [[Muhammad]]. The scriptures of Hinduism are the ''Shrutis'' (the four ''[[Veda]]s'', which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism.|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=0-7914-7082-2|pages=46–49|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the ''[[Smritis]]'' (including the ''[[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' [part of the [[Mahabharata]] cycle], and the ''[[Puranas|Purānas]]''), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas are compilation  of great Universal Wisdom,cosmic knowledge &amp; prediction of B.C /A.D sects or religions of Present epoch 'Kaliyug' from BhavishyaPuran was destined to be true Vishnu's Divine Incarnation form KrishnaDwaipyan VedVyas 27th , Shrimad Bhagwad mahaPuran ultimately gave Peace scripted with Devoted Mind to his OriginSource of almighty Universal Supreme Krishna .The Bhagavad Gita however enjoys a special status in that, it is considered on par with the Vedas by most Hindus.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and Hinduism}}
Hinduism is recognized in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as one of four known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] ([[Kalki avatar]]). [[Krishna]] is included in the succession of [[Manifestations of God]]. The authenticity of the [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]] is seen as uncertain.&lt;ref name="smith-indian-religions"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Indian religions |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===

'''Inri Cristo''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈĩʁi ˈkɾistu|lang}}, born '''Álvaro Theiss''' {{IPA-pt|ˈaɫvɐɾu ˈtajs|}}, March 22, 1948) is a Brazilian educator who claims to be [[Jesus Christ]] [[reincarnation|reincarnated]]. He is well known for his many appearances in the media of Brazil and other countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713022636/http://www.paulosalem.com/?p=110|url=http://www.paulosalem.com/?p=110|title=The birth of insanity|date=June 20, 2009|archivedate=July 13, 2010|last=Salem|first=Paulo|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inri Cristo regularly participates in lively debates with religious figures, such as priest [[Oscar González Quevedo]] (Cristo claims Fr Quevedo is the [[reincarnation]] of the Spanish Inquisitor [[Tomás de Torquemada]]), and also appears in interviews and comedy shows. His provocative statements about [[evolutionism]], [[vegetarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721015711/http://www.vidavegetariana.com/site/noticias.php?page=noticias%2F200 |url=http://www.vidavegetariana.com/site/noticias.php?page=noticias/200 |title=Inri Cristo fala ao Vida Vegetariana sobre sua alimentação, vegetarianismo na bíblia e o que come diariamente |archivedate=July 21, 2010 |date=September 6, 2009 |publisher=Vida Vegeteriana |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |deadurl=yes |language=pt |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[birth control]], [[abortion]], [[atheism]], [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]], growth of overall disillusionment,{{clarify|date=March 2011}} and a potential [[World War III]] have stirred much commentary and controversy.

==Early life==
Inri Cristo was raised by two [[Roman Catholic]] farmers of German ancestry, Wilhelm and Magdalena Theiss.&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Wilhelm and Magdalena Theiss, ''Awakener'', page 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Inri had a humble childhood and studied for about three years at the Adolfo Konder School. He quit studying in order to help his mother, whom he calls "the woman who raised him", with domestic supplies, since his father was retired owing to a work accident.

Since childhood, Inri has claimed to obey a "powerful voice" that speaks inside his head. Obedient to this voice, he left home at thirteen to live independently of his family. In adolescence he worked as a greengrocer, baker, delivery boy, peddler and waiter. Eventually, Inri severed all ties to Christianity, becoming an atheist, until he received what he calls the "revelation of his identity".

==Public speaking and religious activities==
In 1969, at the age of 21, Inri began his public life as a self-professed [[prophet]] and astrologer, introducing himself as "Iuri de [[Nostradamus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=December 25, 1977|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727083620/http://www.millarch.org/artigo/previsoes-de-yuri-nostradamus|archivedate=July 27, 2011|title=As previsões de Iuri de Nostradamus|language=pt|publisher=Almanaque Estado do Paraná|page=1|url=http://www.millarch.org/artigo/previsoes-de-yuri-nostradamus|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, he began speaking on television, with [[TV Morena]] (an affiliate of Brazilian [[Rede Globo]]), and this opportunity introduced him to a wider audience.  In 1976, claiming to blaze the trail of spiritual [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], Inri became vegetarian. In 1977 he lived for some time in [[Copacabana Palace]] hotel, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a part of high society. In 1978, he left Brazil on a tour through [[Latin America]], speaking on radio.

In 1979, obeying the same powerful voice that he claims to have heard since childhood, he underwent a [[fasting|fast]] in [[Santiago, Chile]]. On this occasion, he says, the voice said in a rasping voice, "I am your Father", and revealed itself to be the God of [[Abraham]], of [[Isaac]], and of [[Jacob]].

This voice, he says, said that he was the same Christ crucified two thousand years ago under [[Pontius Pilate]]. It also said that the second letter of his name (the "u" in "Iuri") would henceforth be upside down, making his name "Inri", the acronym for [[Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yug Yoga Yoguismo'', Serge Reynaud de la Ferrière, page 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Inri launched a pilgrimage over many countries, dressed in a white tunic and sandals, announcing that his mission would be accomplished in the dawn of a [[New Age]] of peace.

Inri wandered over 27 countries spreading his message. In 1980, Inri was expelled from the [[United States]], from [[Venezuela]] and from [[England]]. [[France]] sheltered him for nine months and even announced in [[Antenne 2]]: "Le Christ est revenu sur la terre" ("Christ is back on Earth"). On this occasion, Inri was invited to speak in the Grande École Polytechnique de Paris. &lt;!-- These references may support some of the previous statements, but I can't be sure of that, and their links are dead: &lt;ref&gt;Le Courrier Picard, ''Le prophète brésilien a parlé, et des faites troublant se sont produits''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/2171559/INRI-CRISTO-no-Jornal-Le-Courrier-Picard-Parte-2]&lt;/ref&gt; and Le Courrier de l'Oise &lt;ref&gt;Le Courrier de l'Oise, ''Un brélisien de 32 ans accueilli comme un prophète par les Montatairiens''&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/2171551/Reportagem-de-INRI-CRISTO-no-Jornal-Le-Courrier-Picard]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Back in Brazil, on February 28, 1982 Inri performed what he calls a "libertarian act". He broke into the cathedral in [[Belém]] in [[Pará]] state. Accused of profanation and vandalism by the clergy, he was sent to jail for fifteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inricristo.org.br/index.php/en/multimedia/journalistic-releases/316-jornal-a-provincia-do-para|title=No presidio, aclamado: "Cristo, Cristo"|language=pt|publisher=A Província do Pará|date=March 1, 1982|page=7|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inricristo.org.br/jornais_e_revistas/jornal_provincia_2a.jpg A Província do Pará, ''Advogado vai pedir soltura de Inri'']&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, he established a new mystical order, SOUST (''Suprema Ordem Universal da Santissima Trindade''), that he calls the formalization of the promised [[Kingdom of God]] on [[Earth]]. On April 20, 1982, Inri Cristo officially establishment of SOUST in [[Curitiba]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], where he remained for 24 years in a "provisional" headquarters.

He has been detained by police more than forty times, owing to his statements and unusual way of dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inricristo.org.br/index.php/en/multimedia/journalistic-releases/317-jornal-do-brasil-e-o-mundo-em-manchete|language=pt|title=INRI Cristo é preso pela&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; vez|trans-title=INRI Cristo is arrested for the 48th time|publisher=[[Jornal do Brasil]]|date=July 4, 1984|page=7|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inricristo.org.br/jornais_e_revistas/jornal_provincia_2a.jpg A Província do Pará, ''Advogado vai pedir soltura de Inri'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often invited to give lectures in many colleges and universities throughout Brazil, and is usually well received by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inricristo.org.br/index.php/en/multimedia/journalistic-releases/335-materia-jornal-campus-unb|title=Com a palavra, o novo Messias|newspaper=Campus|publisher=[[Universidade de Brasília]]|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=June 28, 2016|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gongen Zukuri.png|right|thumb|A gongen-zukuri shrine. From the top:''honden'', ''ishi-no-ma'', ''haiden''. In yellow the ridges of the roofs]]
{{nihongo|'''''Ishi-no-ma-zukuri'''''|石の間造}}, also called {{nihongo||権現造|[[gongen]]-zukuri}}, {{nihongo|''yatsumune-zukuri''|八棟造}} and {{nihongo|''miyadera-zukuri''|宮寺造}}, is a complex [[Shinto shrine]] structure in which the ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'', or worship hall, and the [[honden]], or main sanctuary, are interconnected under the same roof in the shape of an H.&lt;ref name="sos2"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/bts/bts_g.html#gongen-zukuri ''Gongen-zukuri''] accessed on December 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

The connecting passage can be called {{nihongo|ai-no-ma|相の間|}}, {{nihongo|ishi-no-ma|石の間}}, or {{nihongo|chūden|中殿|intermediate hall}}.&lt;ref name="Jaa"/&gt; The floor of each of the three halls can be at a different level. If the ''ai-no-ma'' is paved with stones it is called ''ishi-no-ma'', whence the name of the style. It can, however, be paved with planks or ''[[tatami]]''. Its width is often the same as the ''honden's'', with the ''haiden'' from one to three ''[[Ken (unit)|ken]]'' wider.&lt;ref name="Jaa"/&gt;

This style, rather than the structure of a building, defines the relationship between member structures of a shrine. Each member then belongs to a particular architectural style. For example, the ''honden'' and ''haiden'' at {{nihongo|Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine|大崎八幡宮|Ōsaki Hachiman-gū}} are single-storied, ''irimoya-zukuri'' edifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are connected by a passage called ''ishi-no-ma'' and are covered by a single roof, however, the complex is classified as belonging to the ''ishi-no-ma-zukuri'' style.

One of the oldest examples is [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="sos2"/&gt; The ''gongen-zukuri'' name comes from [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]] in [[Nikkō]], which enshrines the Tōshō Daigongen ([[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]) and adopts this structure.&lt;ref name="Jaa"&gt;Jaanus, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/g/gongenzukuri.htm Gongen-zukuri], accessed on December 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jessie Oonark''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|RCA}} ( '''ᔨᐊᓯ ᐅᓈᖅ'''; 2 March 1906 –  7 March 1985) was a prolific and influential [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Inuit]] [[artist]] of the [[Utkuhiksalik|Utkuhihalingmiut]] ''Utkuhiksalingmiut'' whose wall hangings, prints and drawings are in major collections including the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. She was born in 1906 in the [[Chantrey Inlet]] (''Tariunnuaq'') area,&lt;ref name=NGC&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=4108|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  near the

Her artwork portrays aspects of the traditional hunter-nomadic life that she lived for over five decades, moving from fishing the camp near the mouth of [[Back River (Nunavut)|Back River]] on [[Chantrey Inlet]] in the Honoraru&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|3}} area to their caribou hunting camp in the [[Garry Lake]] area,&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}} living in winter snow houses ([[igloo]]s) and caribou skin tents in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.r-arcticnet.sr.unh.edu/Points/P3687.html |title=Hayes River Above Chantrey Inlet |publisher=uhn.edu |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oonark learned early how to prepare skins and sew caribou skin clothing.

In later years in Baker Lake they became a small minority and fewer people could speak the language.

==Biography ==

Jessie Oonark's parents were Qiliikvuq and Aghlquarq&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}}(Aglaguaq).&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Aglaguaq and his brothers hunted muskox.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Oonark's spent most of her time the in Chantrey Inlet where there were lots of fish.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The Utkukhalingmiut had many taboos, one of which was the drawing of images. According to Marie Bouchard— a researcher, art historian, and community worker who lived in Baker Lake for many years— "Oonark's grandmother repeatedly warned her that images could come to life in the dark of night."&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Oonark's mother married Qiqniikpak after the death of Oonark's father. Oonark lived with her mother.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The Danish explorer, [[Knud Rasmussen]], crossed the Canadian Arctic by dogsled and visited the Jessie Oonark's camp when she was just a teenager during his Fifth Thule Expedition.  Utkuhikhalingmiut represented the first white contact. In the 1980s, Mame Jackson taped Jessie Oonark's description of the encountered broadcast on CBC radio.&lt;ref name="Jackson_1985"&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Baker Lake Inuit drawings : a study in the evolution of artistic self-consciousness |first=Marion Elizabeth |last=Jackson |year=1985 |type=PhD |institution=The University of Michigan |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/33985076_BAKER_LAKE_INUIT_DRAWINGS_A_STUDY_IN_THE_EVOLUTION_OF_ARTISTIC_SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS_%28CANADA%29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oonark was married at a young age to Qabluunaq, (Kabloona,  Kabloonak) the son of Naatak and Nanuqluq from [[Gjoa Haven]].&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983"&gt;{{citation |title=Transcripts of interviews with Jessie Oonark and her Children |first=Marion E. |last=Jackson  |first2=William |last2=Noah (translator |date=April 1983 |location=Baker Lake |number=NC 114 B32 o66 1984 |pages=39|work=Inuit Art Section, DIAND}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Natak joined them in their hunting camp. Although Kabloona was "a good hunter and a respected fur trader", the family was often hungry.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Their oldest daughter remembers the periods of hunger. Oonark's mother-in-law, Naatak, would boil a caribou skin into a "broth" in an attempt to appease the hunger. Even in 2007, Baker Lake Inuit kept animal bones for marrow ''patek''.&lt;ref name="IAQ_2007_Kigusiuq" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
{{quote|"My grandmother, Natak, was always cooking something. She used to cook caribou skins. She would take hair off the skin and cook it. We would drink the broth. My grandmother used to even cook wolf meat. That was how we survived."|Janet Kigusiuq to Marie Bouchard}}

Their first daughter, [[Janet Kigusiuq]], was born at Putuqsuqniq in the Back River area in 1926.&lt;ref name="IAQ_2007_Kigusiuq" /&gt;{{rp|10}} She had eleven more children including [[Josiah Nuilaalik|Joshuan Nuilaliq]], Mamnguqsualuq, [[Victoria Mamnguqsualuk|Victoria Mamnguqsualuq]], [[Miriam Marealik Qiyuk|Miriam Nanuqluq]], [[Mary Yuusipik Singaqti|Mary Yuusipik]], [[Peggy Qablunaaq Aittauq|Peggy Gabluunaq]], [[Nancy Pukingrnak|Nancy Pukingnaq]] (born 1940–), [[William Noah]], Isumataq, Qaqurialuq, Amarouk, and Makitgag.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

In the 1940s, Oonark was assigned a [[Disc number]] by the Canadian federal government— E2-384. In the 1940s, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) conducted a census of Inuit populations. They assigned the infamous identification numbering system using discs. These disc numbers were dropped during "Operation Surname" in the 1960s.

In the 1950s there was a slump in the fox fur trade. Sometime around 1953 and 1954, Kabloonak and her four youngest children died of illness&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}}  in the [[Garry Lake]] area when [[William Noah]] was still a child and Nancy Pukingrnak was in her early teens and they were still dependent on her. Luke Anguhadluq, camp leader helped her at this time.

==Starvation==
The annual [[Barren-ground caribou|caribou]] migration shifted away from the area where they lived, leaving many Inuit to starve. The Back River Inuit, including Oonark and her family, had a hard time during the starvation period of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="IAQ_2007_Kigusiuq" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The winter of 1957–1958 was marked by a severe shortage of country food in the Back River area. Oonark and her daughter Nancy Pukingrnak were starving. William Noah walked from their camp to Baker Lake in March to seek help. They were airlifted by the Canadian armed forces to Baker Lake.&lt;ref name="MSAC_1998" /&gt;

==Baker Lake==
When Oonark first arrived in Baker Lake in 1958 she survived by "cleaning skins for her friend, Sandy Lunan, at the Hudson's Bay Company post, cooking meals, washing dishes and sewing traditional Arctic garments for local sale"&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} and eventually worked as janitor at the Anglican Church.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Baker Lake residents "derisively referred to the Back River people as ''qangmaliqs'' (the people who only come in to trade) and considered them to be socially backwards.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

In the 1950s, because of a severe famine in the Keewatin District, many Inuit arrived in Baker Lake. A federal dayschool was opened at Baker Lake in 1957. Pre-fabricated subsidized government housing constructed from the mid-1950s. The Northern Services Officer—Doug Wilkinson— encouraged the development of the arts and crafts industry in Baker Lake. At that time the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources (DIAND) established arts and crafts projects in Inuit hamlets as part of socio-economic development (Goetz, 1985:43).&lt;ref name="Goestz_1985"&gt;{{citation |last=Geotz |year=1985 |title=The role of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs in the development of Inuit art |location=Hull, Quebec |work=Canadian Inuit Art Information Centre (DIAND) |series=Unpublished manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} Bill Larmour was the DIAND arts and crafts officer in Baker Lake from 1961 to 1962.

On November 18, 2015, Oonark's 1969 wall hanging depicting a hunting scene, made of duffel, felt and embroidery floss, sold for $70,800, a new record for the Baker Lake artist. The wall hanging was one of 333 pieces of art up for sale, organized by [[Walker's Auctions|Walker's Fine Art Auctions]] in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/kenojuak-ashevak-rabbit-eating-seaweed-record-price-1.3327718|title='Great, famous, rare, iconic': Kenojuak Ashevak print nets record-breaking price|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==
In 1958 after observing school children drawing in Baker Lake, Oonark casually remarked to the school teacher that she could draw better than that.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} The next summer in 1959, the teacher shared this comment with [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] biologist, Dr. Andrew Macpherson, who was in Baker Lake studying [[Arctic fox]]. Macpherson gave her coloured pencils and paper,&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}} purchased her drawings and brought some of them to Ottawa.&lt;ref name="Baele" /&gt; Macpherson continued to send her coloured pencils and a drawing pad after his return to Ottawa in the late fall of 1959. In the spring of 1960 Oonark sent him twelve completed drawings in the sketchbook via the Northern Services Officer Tom Butlers.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="Bell_1971"&gt;{{citation |last=Bell |first=Elizabeth |title=Eskimo Art is for Kabloona |journal=Arctic |volume=24 |number=3 |date=September 1971 |pages=154–56 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic24-3-154.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2015 |doi=10.14430/arctic3129}}Bell was Liaison Officer, Man in the North Project, The Arctic Institute of North America (AINA)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}}

Edith Dodds, the wife of the Northern Service Officer, Sam Dodds, sent six of Oonark's drawings to [[James Archibald Houston]] at the West Baffin Co-operative in [[Cape Dorset]]. Two of her drawings—''Inland Eskimo Woman/Eskimo Woman'' and ''Tattooed Faces''— were made into single colour stone cut prints under the name of Una (Kazan River) at the newly established Cape Dorset print shop and included in the 1960 Cape Dorset print collection and catalogue.

In 1961 William Larmour, crafts officer with the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of Indian and Northern Affairs]] established a federal government arts and crafts program with Jessie Oonark as one of their key artists.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}} In 1963 Gabriel Gely developed a printmaking program in Baker Lake.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Ten experimental prints were made in 1964 and two of them were based on Oonark's drawings—"Drum Dancer" (1964).&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Boris Kotelewetz, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs' arts and crafts officer, who arrived in Baker Lake in March 1966, provided Oonark with studio space and a salary.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

In 1970, the [[National Museum of Man]] in Ottawa organized a touring exhibition of fifty of Oonark's drawings and works by sculptor [[John Pangnark]]. It toured major galleries in Canada for eight months.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Later that year, [[Avrom Isaacs]] featured Inuit artists such as Oonark and [[Karoo Ashevak]] in solo exhibitions in 1970 in the [[Avrom Isaacs|Isaacs Innuit Gallery]]—in the gallery's opening year. Isaacs Innuit Gallery became one of Toronto's most prestigious galleries for over thirty years. It was Oonark's first solo exhibition and in 1971 Isaacs had an exhibition of Oonark's wallhangings.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

The Baker Lake Sanavik Co-operative was incorporated in 1971. The print-makers who rendered Oonark's drawings into [[limited edition]] [[fine art print]]s included [[Thomas Sivuraq]]. The printing technique in Baker Lake included colour [[stonecut]]s, [[stencil]] and [[lithograph]] on [[Japanese wove paper]]. These include the chop for Oonark and Sanavik. In the same year, Oonark received a travel grant from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council of the Arts]] to travel to Toronto and Montreal for the opening of the exhibitions of her drawings. The Toronto wall hangings solo-exhibition took place in April at the Innuit Gallery of Eskimo Art. In Montreal, the exhibition was held at the Canadian Guild of Crafts.&lt;ref name="Bell_1971" /&gt;{{rp|155}}

Oonark's work illustrated a 1972 anthology of Inuit poetry from the circumpolar regions including Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia 1972.&lt;ref name="Lewis_1972"&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Lewis |title=I Breathe a New Song: Poems of the Eskimo|year=1971 }}With an introduction by [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1972, Baker Lake print collection is released and it includes five Oonark prints, two of which are based on small wall hangings. The stencil print, ''Young Woman,'' is featured on the cover of the catalogue. Later that year, an Oonark wall hanging is commissioned by [[Ivey Business School|The Ivey Business School]], [[University of Western Ontario]], is featured on the cover of their publication, ''The Business Quarterly.''

In May 1975 Oonark was elected a Member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]. Later that year, the Baker Lake print collection is released featuring 11 Oonark prints, a new record for the artist. By 1976, Oonark is well known in her community. That year, her work was featured on 2 stamps for the United Nations commemorating the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements. The first day of Issue was May 28, 1976.

In 1984 she was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

In 1986 the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] mounted a retrospective of her work with a major touring exhibition and catalogue both entitled ''Jessie Oonark: a Retrospective''.&lt;ref name="Enright_1987_IAQ"&gt;{{citation |last=Enright |first=Robert |title=The Art of Jessie Oonark |work=Inuit Arts Quarterly |volume=2 |number=1 |date=Winter 1987 |pages=1, 3–4 |url=http://inuitartfoundation.org/wp-content/themes/u-design/images/Archives/1987_01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113051441/http://inuitartfoundation.org/wp-content/themes/u-design/images/Archives/1987_01.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Retrospective_1986"&gt;{{citation |last1=Blodgett |first1=Jean |first2=Marie |last2=Bouchard |title=Jessie Oonark, A Retrospective |series=Exhibition catalogue |year=1986|location=Winnipeg |pages=148|work=Winnipeg Art Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987 Oonark already has eleven solo exhibitions and more than fifty national and international group exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

In 1998 the [[Macdonald Stewart Art Centre]] presented a major exhibition with catalogue entitled ''Qamanittuaq (Where the River Widens): Drawings by Baker Lake Artists'' which including first-generation artist Jessie Oonark and the distinctive drawings of four of her children: Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, Nancy Pukingrnak, and William Noah among many others.&lt;ref name="MSAC_1998"&gt;{{citation |last1=Nasby |first1=Judith |first2=William |last2=Noah |first3=Marion E. |last3=Jackson |first4=Peter |last4=Millar |title=Qamanittuaq (Where the River Widens): Drawings by Baker Lake Artists From the Collection of the Macdonald Stewart Art Centre |series=Exhibition catalogue |location=Guelph |work=Macdonald Stewart Art Centre |year=1998 |url=http://www.msac.ca/art-collections-inuit-art.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092217/http://www.msac.ca/art-collections-inuit-art.html |archivedate=2015-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Bernadette Driscoll-Ellgelstad, curated the exhibition entitled ''Northern Lights: Inuit Textile Art from Arctic Canada'' which included wall hangings by Jessie Oonark and her daughters, Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsllaluk, her relatives Ruth Qaulluaryuk and other women from the Back River area along with artists from Baker Lake.&lt;ref name="IAQ_1992"&gt;{{citation |title=A Woman's Vision |work=Inuit Art Quarterly |url=http://inuitartfoundation.org/wp-content/themes/u-design/images/Archives/1994_02.pdf |format=PDF |first=Bernadette |last=Driscoll-Ellgelstad |volume=9 |number=2 |date=Summer 1994 |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oonark's influence in Inuit art==
In the first generation of Inuit artists working in printmaking, Oonark, together with [[Pitseolak Ashoona]] and [[Kenojuak]] were recognized quickly as significant figures, receiving solo exhibitions, scholarly attention and professional awards.&lt;ref name=Berlo/&gt;
Rosemary Tovell wrote in the catalogue entitled ''Baker Lake Prints 1985'' that When Oonark died in 1985, the Canadian Eskimo Art Council (CEAC) were quoted as saying that they were pleased with the quality of her last prints and they recognized that "[W]ithout Oonark, Baker Lake as a centre for prints may never have happened. It was largely due to her enormous talent that the world's attention came to the community."&lt;ref name="CEAC_Tovell"&gt;{{citation |first=Rosemary |last=Tovell |year=1985 |title=Baker Lake Prints 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2016, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] released an article titled, "''Inuit Art Centre to Reveal Beauty of the North in the South"'' discussing Winnipeg's $65-million centre that will house the world's largest collection of Inuit art. In it, they reference the important role printmaking played, especially for female artists like Oonark, [[Kenojuak Ashevak]] and [[Helen Kalvak]], who gravitated towards visual arts, while men focused on stone-carving which required more physical strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/inuit-art-centre-1.3743680|title=Inuit Art Centre to reveal beauty of the North in the south|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
"A strong, bold graphic sense informs all of Oonark's work. Traditional dress, women's facial tattoos, and shamanistic themes are common in her art, yet they usually appear as isolated, fragmentary forms, shaped into a graphically bold image rather than a comprehensible narrative. Oonark is also well known as a textile artist, whose wool and felt wall-hangings reveal her as a master of color and form."&lt;ref name="Berlo_1995"&gt;{{citation |first=Janet Catherine |last=Berlo |title=Jessie Oonark |series=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary |year=1995 |editor-first1= Jules |editor-last1=Heller |editor-first2=Nancy G. |editor-last2=Heller |pages=420–1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA420&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=Between+1970+and+1985+more+than+100+of+Oonark%27s+drawings+were+translated+into+prints+and+issued+in+the+annual+Baker+Lake+print+editions.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QyCpTkQZ8F&amp;sig=Z4KdHLflz6auysRQeMY3ZnyaDiQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hJu2VPzQGMeVyASwnoCwCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Between%201970%20and%201985%20more%20than%20100%20of%20Oonark's%20drawings%20were%20translated%20into%20prints%20and%20issued%20in%20the%20annual%20Baker%20Lake%20print%20editions.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|420}}

==Themes in her artwork==

Oonark's work includes visual puns and shape-shifting,&lt;ref name="Art_Libraries_Journal"&gt;{{citation |title=Shape-Shifting and Other Points of Convergence: Inuit Art and Digital Technologies |year=1999 |first=Maureen |last=Flynn-Burhoe|journal=Art Libraries Journal |publisher=Art Libraries Society (ARLIS) |location=London, UK |volume=24 |number=3 |pages=38–41 |url=https://aflicktion.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/inuit-art-shape-shift-digital/}}&lt;/ref&gt; descriptive works depicting clothing, tools and cultural objects of importance to the Utkuhihalingmiut as well as images based on storytelling, legends and shamanism.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blodgett" /&gt;

;Visual Puns or [[Ambiguous image]]s
Mame Jackson, George Swinton and Jean Blodgett noted that Oonark's work reflects a high tolerance for ambiguity, a kind of double vision. For example, her work entitled "Two Fish Looking for Something to Eat" (1978), when viewed as a horizontal image, suggests two swimming fish-like creatures and depicts her version of the cannibal fish legend.  When viewed vertically one figure resembles a standing woman whose face fills the amaut. Is she birthing or eating the small blue fish? The fish-figure wearing a man's parka seems to be kiss-touching rather than eating.

Jessie Oonark, although familiar with oral traditions and legends, is never satisfied with a one-layered literal illustration. The horizontal print Two Fish Looking for Something to Eat depicts her version of the cannibal fish story but her double vision leaves room for ambiguity. The cannibal fish also appears in her print "Untitled (Yellow fish)" (1977).

Jessie Oonark's verbal descriptions of her own work are often cryptic, 
{{quote|"These are sea creatures, and they are sort of eating one another. There is a story, and that is it that one whole person along with a qayak was swallowed up by some giant fish or creature or whatever – somewhere near Gjoa Haven or Back River."|Oonark in Jackson 1983:39}}

;Shamanism
Oonark's father Aglaguaq and her grandfather were said to be [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Aglaquarq used his shamanic powers infrequently but Oonark vividly remembered his helping spirit— ''Uupitanaisuak.''&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Aglaguaq had a daughter who is Oonark's stepsister, Kayuruq. When Janet Kigusiuk was still a baby, Anglican missionaries, Canon James and his Inuk assistant catechist Thomas Tapatai came to Oonark's hunting camp. She adopted the Anglican religion and they gave her a prayer book and a Bible. The arrival of Christian missionaries divided their small camp into two divisions—those who became Christian and those who held onto the old ways.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Oonark did not participate in drum dancing nor did she follow the ways of shamanism. However she continued to depict the drum dance and aspects of shamanism in her artwork such as ''Horned Spirits'' (1970), ''Shaman'' (1970) and ''The People Within'' (1970).&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name="Blodgett"&gt;{{citation |last=Blodgett |first=Jean |year=1979 |title=The Coming and Going of the Shaman: Eskimo Shamanism and Art |series=Exhibition catalogue |work=Winnipeg Art Gallery|ISBN=0889150680 |pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colour stonecut and stencil print on laid Japanese paper printed by Thomas Sivuraq of a drawing by Jessie Oonark called "A Shaman's Helping Spirits" (1971), in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada depicts a horned shaman, with animal helping spirits and with a small spirit on his head. Oonark's father—Aglaquarq—used his shamanic powers infrequently but Oonark vividly remembered his helping spirit— ''Uupitanaisuak.''&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
{{quote|" " It was small and wore a baby caribou-skin hat. They asked me if I wanted to have it. I saw it from a distance and it almost came near me, but I didn't want to have a spirit helper."|Jessie Oonark in Bouochard 1987}}

;Drum Dance
She no longer participated in the drum dance either but she depicted images of the drum dance for example in "Drum Dance" (1970).&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

Shape-shifting was a popular theme seen in ''Day Spirit'' (1970).

;Inuit storytelling
Oonark's mother and father and her mother-in-law Naatak, (Natak)&lt;ref name="IAQ_2007_Kigusiuq" /&gt;{{rp|10}} were storytellers&lt;ref name="IAQ_2007_Kigusiuq" /&gt;{{rp|10}} and these stories are richly represented in Oonark's work, such as the 1970 print entitled "Dream of the Bird Woman",&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Driscoll_1980"&gt;{{citation |first=Bernadette |last=Driscoll |title=Inuit Amautik }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} referring to the [[Kiviuq]] (Qiviuk), an Inuk who faced dangerous obstacles in his journeys by kayak, which was described by [[Franz Boas]] as the most widely known Inuit legend in the circumpolar region.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{citation |work=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=17 |number=64 |date=January{{ndash}}March 1904 |title=The Folk-Lore of the Eskimo |first=Franz |last=Boas |pages=1–13 |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-533982/533982_djvu.txt |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Clothing and tools
The knife used by women, the ''[[ulu]]'', their clothing, the ''[[amauti]]'' were recurring themes in her work.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt; ''People of the Inland'' (1961) depicts the Back River people.&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|14}} One of her best known works is "Woman" (1970) described as,&lt;ref name="Furneaux_1974"&gt;{{citation |title=Arts of the Eskimo: Prints |last1=Furneaux |first1=Patrick |last2=Rosshandler |first2=Leo |editor-last=Roch |editor-first=Ernst |year=1974 |pages=196–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Geometry, abstraction, design and activated symmetry are all combined to bring out the very real image of a woman in her winter dress. The brilliant colours emphasize the contrasting shades of caribou skin, beautifully assembled to form a traditional design on the parka. With this print Oonark set a style for herself to which she has remained true – strong and explicit use of line, an intelligent positioning of mass and daring choice of colour."|Furneaux and Rosshandler 1974}}

;Birds
Bernadette Driscoll explained the presence of birds— in the drawing and print "Dream of the Bird Woman" and in Oonark's other artworks— demonstrated the "symbolic significance of the importance of birds as a symbol of flight and in several instances as a reference to shamanism as in "Angagkok Conjuring Birds (1979) but also as a harbinger of spring and itself a symbol of fecundity and rebirth."&lt;ref name="Driscoll_1984"&gt;{{citation |last=Driscoll |first=Bernadette |title=Tattoos, Hairsticks and Ulus: The Graphic Art of Jessie Oonark |work=Arts Manitoba |volume=3 |number=4 |date=Fall 1984 |pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

;Christianity
Reverend Alan Whitton was the Anglican minister at Saint Aidan's Church, Baker Lake, from 1963 until 1972. During that time his wife Elizabeth Whitton, befriended Oonark. In 1966 Elizabeth organized a sewing projects with Oonark and others where they produced mittens, parkas, slippers, duffle socks as well as appliqued images from scraps for sale. At Easter in 1968 Elizabeth Whitton asked Oonark to do drawings about their church for their local women's auxiliary magazine. Oonark's drawings included depictions of Reverend Whitton, catechist Thomas Tapatai, local Ihuit parishioners including women with traditional Inuit tattoos and the church exterior.&lt;ref name="Gibson_1998"&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Christianity, Syncretism, and Inuit Art in the Central Canadian Arctic |first=Jennifer |last=Gibson |institution=Carleton University |location=Ottawa, Ontario |date=January 1998 |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk1/tape10/PQDD_0021/MQ48373.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|201–2}} Oonark continued to use these themes in later work, for example in her 1971–1972 wall hanging for Saint Jude's Cathedra1 in Iqaluit&lt;ref name="Gibson_1998" /&gt;{{rp|202}} and in a 1971–1972 wall hanging of wool and stroud in the permanent collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario.&lt;ref name="Gibson_1998" /&gt;{{rp|205}} Oonark described this wall-hanging,&lt;ref name="Mame_Jackson_1983" /&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref name="Gibson_1998" /&gt;{{rp|206}}

{{quote|"I was more thinking of people on the journey and seeing different tribes of different people, sort of walking between the hills or mountains. Those two women on the way back corners have the latest clothes from the Cambridge Bay area, and then next to her is a young one. Every young person seems to have those kind of parkas with a long tail and sort of a straight cut."|Oonark interviewed by Mame Jackson 1983}}

In her 1984 essay entitled "Christianity and Inuit Art" and in the 1986 "Jessie Oonark, A Retrospective" Blodgett notes how Oonark blended traditional Inuit clothing and symbols with Christian motifs.&lt;ref name="Blodgett_Christianity"&gt;{{citation |first=Jean |last=Blodgett |title=Christianity and Inuit Art |work=Beaver |date=Fall 1984 |volume=3 | pages=16–25}}ASTIS record 15820&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Blodgett |chapter=Christianity and Inuit Art|title=Inuit Art: An Anthology |location=Winnipeg |publisher=Watson and Dwyer |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}&lt;ref name="Gibson_1998" /&gt;

==Later life==

Oonark began to experience numbness in her hands and feet and in 1979, when a surgical intervention failed to check the symptoms, she lost much of her manual dexterity and produced only a few more pieces afterwards.&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Her career had lasted roughly 19 years, but its impact on Inuit art – and on the perception of Inuit art in the larger world – is considerable. She died March 7, 1985 in Churchill, Manitoba.&lt;ref name="NGC" /&gt; and is buried on Blueberry Hill in [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]].&lt;ref name="Bouchard_1987_IAQ" /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="Lindeman_1999"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17516">'''Karl Maria Wiligut''' (alias '''Weisthor''', '''Jarl Widar''', '''Lobesam'''; 10 December 1866&lt;ref name=Lange31&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1998|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 3 January 1946) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Occultist]] and [[SS-Brigadeführer]].

== Early life ==
Wiligut was baptised a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]&lt;ref name=Lange31/&gt; in Vienna. At the age of 14, he joined the ''Kadettenschule'' there.&lt;ref name=Lange31/&gt; Aged 17, he was conscripted to the [[Imperial and Royal|k.u.k.]] infantry regiment of [[Milan I]] king of Serbia. On 17 December 1883 he was appointed to infantry, four days later he became a [[Gefreiter]] (private). In 1888, he was promoted to lieutenant.&lt;ref name=Lange31/&gt;

==Career==
In 1889, he joined the quasi-masonic "Schlaraffia-Loge". He published his first book, ''Seyfrieds Runen'', in 1903, under his real name, as "Karl Maria Wiligut (Lobesam)", mentioning his real and additional artist name. 1908 followed the ''Neun Gebote Gôts'', where Wiligut first claimed to be heir to an ancient tradition of [[Irminism]].

During [[World War I]], Wiligut served at the southern and eastern fronts and he was decorated for gallantry. On 1 August 1917, he was promoted to colonel. In May 1918, he was retired from the front and commanded a [[convalescence]] camp near [[Lviv]].

After almost 40 years in military service, he retired on 1 January 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an impeccable record, and moved to [[Morzg]] near [[Salzburg]] where he dedicated his time to occult studies.  He renewed his acquaintance with [[Theodor Czepl]] of the [[Ordo Novi Templi]], who in winter 1920/21 spent seven weeks in Wiligut's house. Czepl compiled a report for the archive of the O.N.T., where he describes Wiligut as "a man martial in aspect, who revealed himself as bearer of a secret line of German kingship".

Wiligut supposedly founded the postwar newspaper ''Der Eiserne Besen'', although no evidence for such a newspaper exists.

==Personal life==
In 1906, he married Malwine Leuts von Treuenringen of [[Bozen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sterbebilder.schwemberger.at/picture.php?/212798 Albrecht Malwine verh. Leurs von Treuenringen in Bozen, Südtirol 1847-1894 Vinkovce]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had two daughters, Gertrud and Lotte. A twin brother of one of the girls died as an infant, a devastating tragedy for Wiligut, who was desperate for a male heir to which he could pass on his "secret knowledge", which estranged him from his wife.&lt;ref name=NGC182&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hospitalisation ==
Wiligut's wife remained unimpressed by her husband's above claim to kingship, and blaming him for their destitution she pushed for his committal to a mental hospital. While in a cafe with some friends, on 29 November 1924, Wiligut was arrested by police and taken to the local [[mental institution]] where he was held for a couple of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1998|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Deathsheadring.jpg|thumb|300px|[[SS-Ehrenring|Totenkopf ring]] of the SS designed by Karl Maria Wiligut – requested and authorised by Heinrich Himmler]] --&gt;

Wiligut's medical records reflect violence at home, including threats to kill his wife, grandiose projects, eccentric behavior and occult interests. Eventually, in 1924, he was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and [[megalomania]] and was declared legally [[Capacity (law)|incompetent]] by a Salzburg court and then committed to a Salzburg asylum, where he remained until 1927. In 1932, he abandoned his wife and family, and emigrated from Austria to Germany, residing in [[Munich]]. He is known to have corresponded with many admirers and disciples, including [[Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg|Ernst Rüdiger]] and members of the [[Order of the New Templars]].

== Involvement in Himmler's "Persönlicher Stab" ==
Shortly after being introduced to [[Heinrich Himmler|Reichsführer-SS Himmler]] in September 1933 at a conference of the ''[[Nordische Gesellschaft]]'', Wiligut was inducted into the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (under the [[pseudonym]] "Karl Maria Weisthor") to head a Department for Pre- and Early History which was created for him within the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA). In April 1934 he was promoted to the SS equivalent of his old colonel rank ([[Standartenführer]]), and then made head of Section VIII (Archives) for RuSHA in October 1934. In November 1934 a promotion followed to the rank of [[Oberführer]] (lieutenant-brigadier), and then in the spring of 1935 Wiligut was transferred to Berlin to serve on [[Persönlicher Stab Reichsführer-SS|Himmler's personal staff]]. He was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadeführer]] in September 1936.

In Berlin, where he worked in the office of [[Karl Wolff]], chief [[adjutant]] of the SS, Wiligut developed his plans for the rebuilding of the [[Wewelsburg]] into an allegorical "center of the world". Wiligut's friend [[Manfred von Knobelsdorff]] attempted to practise Wiligut's Irminism on the Wewelsburg. An [[Irminenschaft|Irministic]] 'baptism' of Karl Wolff's eldest son Thorisman was performed by Wiligut on 4 January 1937, attended by SS dignitaries [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Karl Diebitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56649039|title=Top Nazi : SS General Karl Wolff : the man between Hitler and Himmler|last=MaryBeth.|first=Friedrich,|last2=Collection.|first2=Mazal Holocaust|date=2005|publisher=Enigma|isbn=1929631227|oclc=56649039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1936, [[Gunther Kirchhoff]] and Wiligut, undertook a private 22-day expedition to the [[Murg (Northern Black Forest)|Murg Valley]] near Baden-Baden in the [[Black Forest]], where there was a settlement described as consisting of "old half-timbered houses, architectural ornament, crosses, inscriptions, and natural and man-made rock formations in the forest," which, they claimed, showed it to be an ancient Krist settlement (Krist was a messianic Germanic figure allegedly associated with Irminism).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiligut identified [[Schloss Eberstein]] as a center of Irminism. In Saxony, he discovered another "Irminist complex", identifying {{Interlanguage link multi|Einum|de}} as "spirit point", [[Bodenburg]] as "will point", [[Bad Gandersheim|Gandersheim]] as "central awareness point", {{Interlanguage link multi|Engelade|de}} as "force hand point", [[Kalefeld]] as "heart point" of the crucified [[Balder]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Brunstein|de|3=Burg Brunstein}} as "generative point", [[Naensen]] as "material hand point" and [[Ebergötzen]] as "skould point".

Wiligut identified [[Irminism]] as the true German ancestral religion, claiming that [[Guido von List]]'s [[Wotanism]] and [[Armanen runes|Armanen runic row]] was a schismatic false religion. 
 
Wiligut contributed significantly to the development of Wewelsburg as the order-castle and ceremonial center of SS pseudo-religious practice. He designed the [[Totenkopfring]], which Himmler personally awarded to prestigious SS officers.

== Retirement ==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Wiligut.jpg|thumb|250px|Wiligut in his later years]] --&gt;
In November 1938, [[Karl Wolff]], chief adjutant of Himmler's personal staff and the second-highest-ranking officer in the SS, visited Wiligut's wife and learned of Wiligut's earlier involuntary commitment to a mental institution, which proved embarrassing to Himmler.

Wiligut's staff was notified that his "application" for retirement on grounds of age and poor health had been granted in February 1939, and the official retirement was dated 28 August 1939, only a few days prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]].

==Death==
Wiligut's final years were insecure: he moved to [[Aufkirchen]] in 1939, to [[Goslar]] in 1940, and to [[Wörthersee]] in 1943, and after the war to a refugee camp in St. Johann near [[Velden am Wörther See|Velden]], where he suffered a stroke. After this he was permitted to return to Salzburg, but he soon moved on to [[Arolsen]] in [[Hesse]], where he died on 3 January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gravestone is inscribed with ''"UNSER LEBEN GEHT DAHIN WIE EIN GESCHWÄTZ"'' ("Our Life Passes Away Like Idle Chatter").

In 1889, Wiligut joined the Schlaraffia, a quasi-masonic lodge. When he left the lodge in 1909, he held the rank of knight and the office of chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, ''Seyfrieds Runen'', was published in 1903 under his full real name with the addition Lobesam. "Seyfrieds Runen" was a collection of poems about the Rabenstein at Znaim on the Austrian-Moravian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, followed the ''Neun Gebote Gots'', where Wiligut first claimed to be heir to an ancient tradition of [[Irminism]]. Both List and Wiligut were influenced by [[Friedrich Fischbach]]'s 1900 ''Die Buchstaben Gutenbergs''.
Wiligut claimed to be in the tradition of a long line of Germanic mystic teachers, reaching back into prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;"The Occult History Of The Third Reich", 1987 Eagle Media Video&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have spiritual powers that allowed him direct access to genetic memories of his ancestors thousands of years previously. 
From 1908, Wiligut was in contact with the occultist [[Ordo Novi Templi]] in Vienna. Wiligut claimed that the [[Bible]] had originally been written in Germanic, and testified to an "Irminic" religion – ''Irminenreligion'' or '''Irminism''' – that contrasted with [[Wotanism]]. He claimed to worship a Germanic god "Krist", whom Christianity was supposed later to have appropriated as their own saviour [[Christ]].

According to Wiligut, Germanic culture and history reached back to 228,000 BC. He proposed that at this time, there were three suns, and Earth was inhabited by giants, dwarfs and other mythical creatures. Wiligut claimed that his ancestors, the Adler-Wiligoten, ended a long period of war. By 12,500 BC, the Irminic religion of Krist was revealed and from that time became the religion of all Germanic peoples, until the schismatic adherents of [[Wotanism]] gained the upper hand. In 1200 BC, the Wotanists succeeded in destroying the Irminic religious center at [[Goslar]], following which the Irminists erected a new temple at the ''[[Externsteine]]'', which was in turn appropriated by the Wotanists in AD 460. Wiligut's own ancestors were supposedly protagonists in this setting: the Wiligotis were ''Ueiskunings'' ("Ice kings") descending from a union of [[Aesir]] and [[Vanir]]. They founded the city of [[Vilna]] as the center of their Germanic empire and always remained true to their Irminic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiligut's convictions assumed a paranoid trait in the 1920s as he became convinced that his family was the victim of a continuing persecution of Irminists, at present conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Jews, and the Freemasons, on which groups he also blamed the defeat of World War I and the downfall of the Habsburg Empire.

During the 1920s, Wiligut wrote down 38 verses (out of a number purportedly exceeding 1,000), the so-called ''Halgarita Sprüche'', that he claimed to have memorized as a child, taught by his father. Wiligut had designed his own "[[Wiligut runes|runic alphabet]]" for this purpose.

[[Werner von Bülow]] and [[Emil Rüdiger]] of the ''[[Edda-Gesellschaft]]'' (Edda Society) translated and annotated these verses. They claimed that numbers 27 and 1818 are connected with the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]].&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Wiligut1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Karl Maria Wiligut]] --&gt; Verse number 27 according to Willigut is a 20,000-year-old "solar blessing":
:''Sunur saga santur toe Syntir peri fuir sprueh Wilugoti haga tharn Halga fuir santur toe''

Werner von Bülow translates this as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend tells, that two Suns, two wholesome in change-rule UR and SUN, alike to the hourglass which turned upside down ever gives one of these the victory / The meaning of the divine errant wandering way / dross star in fire's sphere became in fire-tongue revealed to the Earth-I-course of the race of Paradise / godwilling leaders lead to the weal through their care in universal course, what is visible and soon hidden, whence they led the imagination of mankind / polar in change-play, from UR to SUN in sacrificial service of waxing and waning, in holy fire Santur is ambiguously spent in sparks, but turns victorious to blessing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Santur'' is interpreted as a burnt-out sun that was still visible at the time of [[Homer]]. Rüdiger speculates that this was the center of the solar system hundreds of millennia ago, and he imagines a fight between the new and the old Suns that was decided 330,000 years ago. ''Santur'' is seen as the source of power of the [[Hyperborean]]s.

In esoteric currents of [[Neo-Nazism]], [[Neofolk]], [[National Socialist black metal]] and [[Neopaganism]], Wiligut's writings enjoyed renewed interest in the 1990s.

==Runes==
In 1934, Wiligut developed a rune row loosely based on the [[Armanen runes]] of [[Guido von List]] even though  Wiligut rejected List's runes and his overall philosophy.

Wiligut claimed to have been initiated into "runic lore" by his grandfather Karl Wiligut (1794–1883).
His rune row has 24 letters, like the [[Elder Futhark]]. Like von List's Armanen runes that are closely based on the [[Younger Futhark]], many of Wiligut's runes are identical to historical runes, with some additions. The historical Futhark sequence is not preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Widar, Jarl – Whispering of Gotos – Rune-Knowledge [from Hagal 11 (1934), Heft 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–15]. [[Stephen Flowers|Flowers, Dr. Stephen E.]] and Moynihan, Michael – ''The Secret King'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiligut's names for his runes are: Tel, Man, Kaun, Fa, Asa, Os, Eis, Not, Tor, Tyr, Laf, Rit, Thorn, Ur, [[Sig rune|Sig]], Zil, Yr, Hag-Al, H, [[Wend-horn]], [[Gibor]], Eh, Othil, Bar-Bjork.

Runes without precedent in the historical runes are Tel (a crossed ring, similar to the [[sun cross]] symbol), Tor (like a Latin [[T]]), Zil (like a rotated Latin [[Z]]), Gibor (taken from von List's runes). The shape of [[Wend-horn]] is similar to [[Tvimadur#Additional runes|Tvimadur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9601">'''Perfect Master''' is the English term [[Meher Baba]] began to use in his writing as early as 1925&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Intelligence'', Meher Baba, Sheriar Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the Eastern idea of a [[Satguru|sadguru]] ([[Vedanta]]) or a [[Qutub (Sufism)|qutub]] ([[Sufism]]). A Perfect Master, according to Baba, is a [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realized]] person (one whose limited individualized consciousness has merged with God) who can use his Divine attributes of Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss for the spiritual upliftment of others.&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Baba, The Awakener,'' Charles Haynes, Ph.D., The Avatar Foundation, Inc., 1989, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In describing Meher Baba's specialized use of the term [[Charles Purdom]] writes, "The title ‘Perfect Master’ . . . means one who has himself reached the goal to which he directs others: one who, pointing to God, has himself realized God." &lt;ref&gt;''The God-Man: The Life, Journeys &amp; Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence &amp; Spiritual Teaching'', C. B. Purdom, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1964, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== States of God-realized souls ==
Meher Baba stated in his book ''[[God Speaks]]'' that when a spiritually advanced soul loses its consciousness as a separate being, it merges in God in one of three distinct states:
* The soul becomes conscious of itself as God and enjoys eternally His divine attributes of Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss, but remains completely unconscious of Creation.
* The soul becomes conscious of itself as God and retains consciousness of Creation but does not use His divine attributes in it.
* The soul becomes conscious of itself as God and uses His divine attributes for the spiritual advancement of others.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose,'' Meher Baba, Dodd, Mead and Company, 1973, Sec. Ed. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba calls people who are in the third state '''Perfect Masters''' or ''Mukammil''. He distinguishes the second state from Perfect Masters, calling them instead "Perfect Ones" or ''Kamil''. One of the aspects that he says demarcates the Perfect Master from the Perfect One is that the Perfect Master has disciples, while the Perfect One does not. Also Baba says that a Perfect Master can make like himself any number of souls or even the whole of creation, while the Perfect One can only make one soul like himself. However, Meher Baba makes it clear in his system as outlined in ''God Speaks'' that the consciousness of these souls is absolutely One and the same. To explain this apparent contradiction he likens the difference between these two classifications of God realized souls to a difference in the 'office' of the God Realized person.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose,'' Meher Baba, Dodd, Mead and Company, 1973, Sec. Ed. pp. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba says that at all times on Earth there are 56 incarnate God-realized souls, but that of these only five are deemed the five Perfect Masters of their era. When one of the five Perfect Masters "drops" his physical body, Baba says, another God-realized soul among the 56 incarnate at that time replaces him by taking up that office in that moment. Thus, Meher Baba says there are 56 God-realized souls on Earth at all times, but only and exactly five hold the office of Perfect Master.

In addition, Baba says there is one very rare type of God-realized person who has no disciples but who has duties included in his office. These he says are called Most Perfect Ones or ''Akmal''.&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose,'' Meher Baba, Dodd, Mead and Company, 1973, Sec. Ed. pp. 148,301&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Five Perfect Masters.jpg|thumb|Top: Babajan, Upasni Maharaj. Middle: Sai Baba, Tajuddin Baba. Bottom: Narayan Maharaj.]]

== The Five Perfect Masters ==

Meher Baba is unique among Indian teachers in that he said that the number of Perfect Masters on the Earth is exactly five at all times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/674313 University of Chicago Journals, ''Signs and Society'', Vol. 2 S 1, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; He said further that at the time of his own God-realization the five Perfect Masters were [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], [[Upasni Maharaj]], [[Hazrat Babajan]], [[Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin|Hazrat Tajuddin Baba]] and [[Narayan Maharaj]] and that these five brought him down to human consciousness as the [[Avatar]] on Earth in this cycle of time. "During the Avataric period,
the five Perfect Masters make God incarnate as man."&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 4930&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, "What I am, what I was, and what I will be as the Ancient One is always due to the five Perfect Masters of the Age. Sai Baba, Upasni Maharaj, Babajan, Tajuddin Baba and Narayan Maharaj - these are the five Perfect Masters of this age for me." &lt;ref&gt;C. B. Purdom, ''The God-Man: The Life, Journeys &amp; Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence &amp; Spiritual Teaching'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1964 p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; All of these have since died and Meher Baba did not say who their replacements were, except to indicate that for the time being they will be in the East. He further indicated that although the 'offices' of the five Perfect Masters are always filled, when they drop their bodies they 'also shed forever their Subtle and Mental vehicles and pass away utterly as God, retaining infinite Individuality and experiencing the Infinite Power, Knowledge and Bliss'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything and the Nothing'', Meher Baba, Meher House, Sydney, 1963, pp. 23-6. Available online {{cite web |url=http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/Book_Files/Everything.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228220200/http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/Book_Files/Everything.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba also said that while there are numerous planets in the Universe with human life on them, Earth is the only planet where God realization is possible and where the five Perfect Masters take birth.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  pp. 618-619, 5651&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Avatar ==

Meher Baba asserts that beyond the five Perfect Masters of the age, (distinguished as those God-realized souls which fulfill the office of Perfect Master temporarily until they drop their physical bodies), there is also the [[Avatar]]. "The number of God-Realized souls on earth is eternally fixed at fifty-six and is never altered, except during Avataric ages when God directly descends as a man." &lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  pp. 618-619, 815&lt;/ref&gt; The Avatar, according to Meher Baba, is a special Perfect Master who was the original Perfect Master, or the Ancient One, who never ceases to incarnate in spite of his original attainment of God-realization. Baba says that this particular soul personifies the preserver or sustainer state of God which in [[Hinduism]] is called ''[[Vishnu]]'' and in Sufism is called ''[[Parvardigar]]''. According to Meher Baba the Avatar appears on Earth every 700–1400 years, and is brought down into human form by the five Perfect Masters of that age to aid in the process of moving creation in its never-ending journey toward Godhood. He said that in other ages this role was fulfilled by [[Zoroaster]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Jesus]], and lastly by [[Muhammad]]. "Of the most recognized and much worshiped manifestations of God as Avatar, that of Zarathustra is the earliest – having been before Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad." &lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  p. 4216&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Perfect One ''(Kamil)'', Most Perfect One ''(Akmal)'', and Perfect Master ''(Mukammil)'', Meher Baba described one other type of incarnate soul that has transcended the finite ego and merged in a state of God-consciousness, but cannot help others. This type is the ''Majzoob'' (Arabic: ''Absorbed''). Unlike the Perfect Master, or any of the other sub-types of God-realized souls, the Majzoob is absorbed in God to such a degree that he cannot be of any direct assistance to anyone else in creation though he can be of indirect help to those who honor him. This is because he is a perfect [[Mast (Sufism)|mast]] and as such has no experience of the external physical or internal mental worlds. According to Meher Baba the Majzoob has no experience of the gross, subtle, or mental worlds, but is entirely absorbed in the bliss of his state of Godhood.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin, William, M.D., "The Wayfarers: Meher Baba with the God-Intoxicated", Adi K.

{{Ancient Greek religion|expanded=practices}}
A '''pharmakós''' ({{lang-el|φαρμακός}}, plural '''''pharmakoi''''') in [[Ancient Greek religion]] was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human [[scapegoat]] or victim.

==Ritual==
A slave, a cripple or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation.

Some scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In ''Aesop in Delphi'' (1961), Anton Wiechers discussed the parallels between the legendary biography of [[Aesop]] (in which he is unjustly tried and executed by the Delphians) and the ''pharmakos'' ritual. For example, Aesop is grotesquely deformed, as was the ''pharmakos'' in some traditions; and Aesop was thrown from a cliff, as was the pharmakos in some traditions.

Gregory Nagy, in ''Best of the Achaeans'' (1979), compared Aesop’s ''pharmakos'' death to the “worst” of the Achaeans in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Thersites. More recently, both Daniel Ogden, ''The Crooked Kings of Ancient Greece'' (1997) and [[Todd Compton]], ''Victim of the Muses: Poet as Scapegoat, Warrior and Hero'' (2006) examine poet ''pharmakoi''. Compton surveys important poets who were exiled, executed or suffered unjust trials, either in history, legend or Greek or [[Indo-European myth]].

==Modern interpretations&lt;!--'Plato's Pharmacy' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Walter Burkert]] and [[René Girard]] have written influential modern interpretations of the ''pharmakos'' rite. Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert. ''Greek Religion'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Girard likewise discusses the connection between catharsis, sacrifice, and purification.&lt;ref&gt;René Girard. ''I See Satan Fall Like Lightning'', pp. 37–38, 51, 78, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have connected the practice of [[ostracism]], in which a prominent politician was exiled from Athens after a vote using pottery pieces, with the ''pharmakos'' custom. However, the ostracism exile was only for a fixed time, as opposed to the finality of the ''pharmakos'' execution or expulsion.

Pharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean [[deconstruction]]. In his essay "'''Plato's Pharmacy'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;''Dissemination'', translated by Barbara Johnson, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrida]] deconstructs several texts by [[Plato]], such as ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain ''pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus'' and the notably absent word ''pharmakos''. In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (''pharmakeia–pharmakon–pharmakeus''). As a concept, Pharmakos can be said to be related to other Derridian terms such as "[[Trace (philosophy)|trace]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3835">'''Quhyar''' ({{lang-fa|کوه یار}}), was the ruler of the [[Qarinvand dynasty]], ruling briefly in 839 until his assassination.

== Biography ==
Quhyar was the son of [[Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd]], and had a brother named [[Mazyar]], who, after ascending the Qarinvand throne, was repelled from [[Tabaristan]] by his uncle Vinda-Umid and the [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Shahriyar I]]. However, Mazyar returned in 822/23 with the support of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to take revenge. [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]], who was the son and successor of Shahriyar I, was defeated and killed along with Vinda-Umid. Mazyar then united Tabaristan under his own rule.

Mazyar, however, later rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate, an act which was widely supported by the native [[Zoroastrians]], who began plundering the Muslim villages.{{sfn|Mottahedeh|1975|p=76}} The [[Tahirid]] ruler [[Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani]] and the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] shortly sent five corps that entered Tabaristan from all sides. Mazyar made his brother Quhyar as the defender of the Qarinvand mountains, and the Bavandid [[Qarin I]] as the defender of eastern Tabaristan. However, the fall of Tabaristan went quickly: several cities were caught by surprise, while Qarin I betrayed Mazyar and agreed to aid the Abbasids in exchange for being restored as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. The people of [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] shortly revolted against Mazyar, and Quhyar betrayed Mazyar, and had him captured and given to al-Mu'tasim.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}}

Mazyar was shortly brought to [[Samarra]], where he was executed. His body later became [[Gibbeting|gibbeted]] with the body of the [[Khurramite]] [[Babak Khorramdin]]. Quhyar, who had just ascended the Qarinvand throne, however, was shortly killed by his own [[Dailamite]] soldiers because of his betrayal against Mazyar. Although many scholars considered the death of Quhyar as the fall of the Qarinvand dynasty, the dynasty continued to rule in parts of Tabaristan, and a certain [[Baduspan ibn Gurdzad]] is mentioned in 864 as the ruler of the Qarinvand dynasty

'''Robert "Bob" Passantino''' (11 August 1951 – 17 November 2003), was an Italian-American Christian author and journalist who wrote on subjects related to [[Christian apologetics]], [[philosophy]], and the [[Christian countercult movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Passantino 1951-2003", ''Christianity Today'', February 2004, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Passantino, 52: Author, Co-Founder of Evangelical Center" ''Los Angeles Times'', [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/21/local/me-passings21.5] November 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Passantino lived and worked for most of his adult life in [[Costa Mesa, California]], and received instruction in Christian teaching and practiced as a professing member of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]. He emerged as an apologist for faith in [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christianity during the 1970s. He and his soon-to-be wife, Gretchen, had already begun to collaborate in a ministry of Christian evangelism toward adherents of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] when they became acquainted with the Baptist pastor and countercult writer [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stafford, "The Kingdom of the Cult Watchers," ''Christianity Today'', October 7, 1991, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was the founder of the apologetics ministry [[Christian Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, "Christian Research Institute," ''The Christian Librarian'', Volume 14, number 1, October 1970, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Martin relocated the Institute from New Jersey to southern California where he re-established his ministry in association with the Melodyland School of Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Quebedeaux, ''The Worldly Evangelicals'', San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1978, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin officiated as the minister at the marriage ceremony of the Passantinos.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, "Kingdom of Cult Watchers", p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Passantinos assisted Martin in the ministry of the Christian Research Institute for approximately five years from 1974 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Biggs,"Walter Martin: Patron Saint of Evangelical Apologists" [https://web.archive.org/web/20040818204137/http://www.aplacefortruth.org/Martin.Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Martin, "Foreword" in Robert Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, ''Answers to the Cultist at Your Door'', Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House Publishers, 1981, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In that context Martin privately taught them the rudiments of the discipline of apologetics and of investigative reporting in countercult ministry. During the 1970s and 1980s Gretchen served as an editorial assistant in preparing revised editions of some of Martin's books such as ''The Rise of the Cults'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, "Acknowledgements" ''The Rise of the Cults'', Rev. Ed., Santa Ana: Vision House, 1977, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Kingdom of the Cults''&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'', Rev. Ed., Minneapolis: Bethany House, 1985, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Maze of Mormonism''.&lt;ref&gt;Walter R. Martin, ''The Maze of Mormonism'', Rev. Ed., Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As a couple, the Passantinos began to develop their profile as speakers in evangelical churches delivering presentations about cults and general apologetics questions concerning the existence of God and the historicity of the Bible. Together they then branched out from working at Christian Research Institute and began to operate their own apologetics and countercult ministry known as Christian Apologetics: Research and Information Service (CARIS).&lt;ref&gt;"Credits" in Walter R. Martin, ''The New Cults'', Santa Ana: Vision House, 1980, p 410.&lt;/ref&gt; This ministry subsequently was renamed as Answers In Action.

They founded Answers In Action with the intent to help both Christians and non-Christians apply logic and reason to religious inquiry and to assist in answering questions about apologetics, religion, philosophy, evangelism, and theology. Robert's approach to religion was to "represent their belief system as accurately as you would have them represent yours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Apologetics Study Bible: Understand Why You Believe'', Nashville: Holman Bible Publishers, 2007, p. 1655.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of their initial writing appeared as researched chapters in Martin's book ''The New Cults''.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter one "The Deception of the New Cults" and "The Local Church of Witness Lee" in Martin, ''The New Cults'', pp. 11-35 and 379-408.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first co-written book ''Answers to the Cultist at Your Door'' was designed as a popular apologetics handbook for Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Passantino and Gretchen Passantino and Raymond Schafer, ''Answers to the Cultist at Your Door'', Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The book consisted of brief chapters about the phenomenon of cults followed by specific chapters containing evangelical apologetic responses to the doctrines taught by the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormons]], [[Unification Church]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]], and the [[Way International]].

Passantino contributed an essay on Jehovah's Witnesses in [[Ronald Enroth]]'s book ''Evangelising the Cults''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Enroth ed. ''Evangelising the Cults'', Milton Keynes: Word Publishing, 1991, pp.121-138.&lt;/ref&gt; This essay centered a basic Evangelical apologetic argument that challenged the stance taken by Jehovah's Witnesses on three doctrines: the Trinity, Christ, and Salvation. He also contributed a lengthy essay that explored the theory, techniques, and application of religious research to the Evangelical Ministries to New Religions' symposium volume ''Contend for the Faith'' that was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;"Religious Research: theory, techniques and Application" in ''Contend for the Faith'', Eric Pement ed. Chicago: Evangelical Ministries to new Religions, 1992, pp. 26-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s the Passantinos emerged as critical evangelical voices on a number of questions connected to Protestant understandings about the subject of [[Satanism]] and the [[Occult]]. One of their early exposés, first published in [[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]] magazine, concerned [[Laurel Rose Willson|Lauren Stratford]]'s fraudulent claims of satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Bob &amp; Gretchen Passantino and Jon Trott, "Satan's Sideshow: The True Lauren Stratford Story", Cornerstone, 1990 Vol. 18, Issue 90&lt;/ref&gt; They were highly skeptical about claims concerning [[Satanic Ritual Abuse]] and they argued that the basis of these claims could be explained as a combination of folklore and [[moral panic]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert &amp; Gretchen Passantino, "Satanic Ritual Abuse in Popular Christian Literature: Why Christians Fall For a Lie Searching for the Truth," ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', Volume 20, number 3, Fall 1992, pp. 299-305.&lt;/ref&gt; In both published essays and books they called into question what they regarded as misconceptions commonly held by Christians about the beliefs and practices of Satanist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, ''Satanism'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1995, pp. 45-61.&lt;/ref&gt; This included their alarm at how Satanists were often accused in Christian literature or in popular media as being perpetrators of organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;''When the Devil Dares Your Kids: Protecting Your Children from Satanism, Witchcraft, and the Occult'', Ann Arbor: Servant Publications/Guildford, Surrey: Eagle, 1991, pp.131-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passantino's commitment to a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] concept of free-agency led to critical evaluations of theological, philosophical, and socio-psychological forms of determinism. Against a wide current of Christian and non-Christian opinion, the Passantinos published a controversial article in Cornerstone magazine in 1994, titled ''Overcoming The Bondage Of Victimization: A Critical Evaluation of Cult Mind Control Theories'' [http://www.answers.org/cultsandreligions/mind_control.html], in which they criticized the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of "mind control" and "exit counseling" models. The article was reprinted in a later edition of Martin's ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', but has since been removed due to allegations that it didn't represent Martin's own views.[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/c174ab.html]

The Passantinos were highly influential on other apologists as evidenced by the acknowledgements made by other apologists who refer to them concerning their input and research. This was particularly so because it was new and no one had really addressed the subject prior to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Strobel, "Acknowledgements" in ''The Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus,'' Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1998, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Lee Strobel, ''The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity'', Zondervan, 2000, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Hybels and Mark Mittelberg, "Acknowledgements" in ''Becoming a Contagious Christian'', Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Robert Passantino died on November 17, 2003, age 52, due to [[Ventricular fibrillation|cardiac arrest]]. He is buried at Westminster Memorial in [[Westminster, California]]. His wife, Gretchen, died from [[cardiogenic shock|cardiac dysrhythmia]] as a result of undiagnosed [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|diabetes]] on October 2, 2014, age 61, at [[Hoag (health network)|Hoag Hospital Newport Beach]]. They are survived by their three children.

In October 2007, [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Chad Meister]] published a collection of essays written in honor of Passantino titled ''Reasons for Faith: Making a Case for the Christian Faith''.

==Plot==
''Saugatuck Cures'' follows a widowed bed and breakfast owner, Maggie Callaghan (Chapman), living in [[Saugatuck, Michigan]], dealing with a second round of cancer. When she cannot afford treatment, Maggie's gay son Drew (Adler) becomes determined to raise money for her treatment, though he does not have the slightest idea of how to do it.

After a falling-out with his affluent sister, Penelope, a religious conservative, Drew is convinced by his eccentric best friend Brett (Danny Mooney), who is straight, to pose as ex-gay ministers in order to raise the money by "[[Conversion therapy|converting]]" homosexuals into heterosexuals. The two friends set forth on a crazy adventure, getting into a lot of trouble with the law, family conflicts and not knowing if they will have enough time to save mom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5926">'''Semitic neopaganism''' refers to a group of [[religion]]s based on or [[polytheistic reconstructionism|attempting to reconstruct]] the [[Ancient Semitic religion|old religious traditions]] of the [[Semitic people]]s, mostly practiced among [[secular Jews]] in the [[United States]].

==Jewish neopaganism==
In the United States, the notion of historical Israelite or Jewish polytheism has been popularized in the 1960s by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'', focusing on the cult of female [[goddess]]es such as the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Asherah]] in [[Solomon's Temple]].

During the growth of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] throughout the 1970s, a number of minor Canaanite or Israelite oriented groups emerged. Most contained [[syncretism|syncretistic]] elements from [[Western esotericism]].

[[Image:Jewitchery SYMBOL pink.png|thumb|120px|A pink [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]] seen in Jewitchery]]
Forms of [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|Witchcraft]] religions inspired by the Semitic milieu, such as ''Jewitchery'', may also be enclosed within the Semitic Neopagan movement. These Witchcraft groups are particularly influenced by [[Jewish feminism]], focusing on the goddess cults of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Kien, ''Reinstating the Divine Woman in Judaism'' (2000), {{ISBN|978-1-58112-763-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable contemporary Levantine Neopagan group is known as [[Am ha'aretz|Am Ha Aretz]] ({{lang|he|&amp;#1506;&amp;#1501; &amp;#1492;&amp;#1488;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1509;}}, lit. "People of the Land", a rabbinical term for uneducated and religiously unobservant Jews), "AmHA" for short, based in [[Israel]]. This group grew out of Ohavei Falcha, "Lovers of the Soil", a movement founded in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hunter, ''Magickal Judaism: Connecting Pagan and Jewish Practice''. Citadel Press Books, Kensington Publishing Corp., New York, New York, 2006, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elie Sheva, according to her own testimony an "elected leader of AmHA" reportedly founded an [[United States|American]] branch of the group, known as "Primitive Hebrew Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Elie in ''Being a Pagan: Druids, Wiccans, and Witches Today'', by [[Ellen Evert Hopman]] and Lawrence Bond (2001), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=uswv&amp;c=words&amp;id=12595|title=Witchvox Article|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beit Asherah'' ("House of Asherah"), was one of the first Jewish Neopagan groups, founded in the early 1990s by Stephanie Fox, Steven Posch, and Magenta Griffiths. Magenta Griffiths is High Priestess of the Beit Asherah coven, and a former board member of the [[Covenant of the Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSnxlwQV0ccC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=beit%20asherah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=veCy608Htf&amp;sig=baNYZXua3Msyu0iP1MVh2yhDLQw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=emfeTrG2B8agiQKvw9XvCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=beit%20asherah&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions|first=James R.|last=Lewis|date=1 January 1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=8 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cog.org|title=Covenant of the Goddess - Representing Witches and Wiccans since 1975|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sister Kate''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[NBC]] during the [[1989–90 United States network television schedule|1989–1990 television season]].

==Synopsis==
The series stars [[Stephanie Beacham]] as Sister Kate, a nun who is transferred from an archeological dig to Redemption House, an orphanage in [[Chicago]]. Sister Kate is put in charge of a group of unwanted orphans who, due to their scheming ways, have already run off three priests. Storylines involved Sister Kate (nicknamed "Sister Mary Rambo") matching wits with the kids, and the kids' potential adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F. |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|pages=1247|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Sister Kate'' premiered on Saturday, September 16, 1989 at 9:30 EST, and was moved to 8:00 EST on Sundays for the remainder of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F. |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|pages=1246|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low-rated series was canceled after eighteen episodes, due to competition from ABC's ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and the first half of CBS's ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.

==Cast==
* [[Stephanie Beacham]] as Sister Katherine "Kate" Lambert
* [[Jason Priestley]] as Todd Mahaffey

* Hannah Cutrona as Frederika "Freddy" Marasco
* Penina Segall as Hilary Logan
* [[Harley Cross]] as Eugene Colodner

==Guest appearances==
[[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fabrice Morvan]] appeared as [[Milli Vanilli]] in the January 7, 1990 episode "Eugene's Feat", speaking a few lines in their natural voices before (what was later revealed to be) [[lip-synching]] their hit "[[Blame It on the Rain]]". In an especially ironic turn, one of the children got the duo to "perform" at the orphanage through deception.

==Theme song==
The series theme song, "Maybe An Angel", was performed by pop star [[Amy Grant]] and written by Brian Rawlings and [[Mason Cooper]].

'''''Taiyi Shengshui''''' ({{zh|c=太一生水|p=Tàiyī Shēngshuǐ|l=The Great One Gave Birth to Water}}) was written about 300 BC during the [[Warring States period]].

It is a [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[creation myth]]. The opening lines are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
太一生水
水反輔大一，
是以成天。[地]
天地...也，
是以成神明。
神明復相輔也，
是以成陰陽。

The Great One Gave Birth to Water.
Water returned and assisted The Great One ("Taiyi"),
in this way developing heaven and Earth.
Heaven and earth repeatedly assisted each other,
in this way developing the "gods above and below".
The "gods above and below" repeatedly assisted each other,
in this way developing [[yin and yang]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commentators describe Taiyi as a representation of Heaven ([[James Legge]]), an impersonal "Watery Chaos" ([[Kong Yingda]]). At least one scholar (Medhurst) interprets this as the "Supreme One", possibly [[Shangdi]].

In Japan, [[Amaterasu]] is traditionally considered syncretic deity with Taiyi. The name O-Amaterasu-Omikami is also sometime use for [[Amenominakanushi]]-no-kami.

The ''Taiyi Shengshui'' was written on 14 [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo strips]] in the Chu script. It was discovered in 1993 in [[Hubei]], [[Jingmen]]. It is part of the [[Guodian Chu Slips]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tao-te-king.org/taiyi_shengshui.htm Full text of the myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Brandsma Review''''' is a bi-monthly [[magazine]] of conservative [[Catholic]] opinion in circulation in [[Ireland]].  Its [[Latin]] masthead is ''Pro Vita, Pro Ecclesia Dei et Pro Hibernia'' 'for life, for the Church of God and for Ireland'.  It is called after the Dutch [[Carmelite]] priest-journalist Blessed [[Titus Brandsma]], who lived in Ireland for a period in the 1930s and was subsequently martyred by the Nazis.

==Overview==
The magazine was founded in the wake of the [[X Case]] and the resignation of Bishop Casey of Galway in 1992 and it has maintained a consistent pro-life position since then, regarding euthanasia and embryo experimentation as much as abortion.

The legend 'Ecclesia Dei' is a reference to the 1988 document of [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Ecclesia Dei Adflicta]]'' which deals with the [[Tridentine Mass]], but this is not a unanimous position within the editorial board.  Board members of the [[Latin Mass Society of Ireland]] have contributed pieces over the years.  At the same time, the Review tries to cultivate a broad presentation of Catholic culture and has correspondents in North America, continental Europe and the Antipodes.  It sometimes publishes articles by non-Catholics (generally Evangelical Protestants and eastern Orthodox, but sometimes Jews, Muslims and conservative secularists have contributed) on matters of common concern.

''The Brandsma Review'' has published many articles criticising the state of catechesis in Irish Catholic schools and the existence of unorthodox liturgical practices and doctrinal statements within sections of Irish Catholicism.  It has also been critical of the tendency of some traditionalists to adopt extreme-right views.  The March–April 2008 issue (vol. 17 no.2) p.&amp;nbsp;2 has an editorial "Beware of French Letter Liberals - And Jew Baiters!" which describes "our sniff test for articles submitted for publication.  The left nostril is for pro-contraceptionists... the right nostril, for Jew baiters.  Both are incompatible with real Catholicism, and so both are a no-no."  It has also published articles questioning the alleged Marian apparitions at Medugorje.

The founder editor of ''The Brandsma Review'' is Nick Lowry, a retired news editor from [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Radio Telefís Éireann]] who contributes signed editorials and a regular column "Straws for the Camel's Back" commenting on current events within Irish Catholicism. Lowry retired in February 2012 and was replaced by Peadar Laighleis, who was also President of the [[Latin Mass Society of Ireland]].  The original model used was that of the ''Ballintrillick Review'', which was in circulation in Ireland in the 1980s, until its editor Doris Manley died of cancer; the ''Ballintrillick Review'' was outspokenly pro-life but was somewhat more communitarian on economic matters and had no particular interest in the Tridentine Mass.  Many of the original ''Brandsma Review'' subscribers had subscribed to the more strident ''Faith and Family'' which earned notoriety at the time by being banned from the Catholic book store Veritas.

'''Tomás Garrido Canabal''' (September 20, 1891 in [[Playas de Catazajá]], [[Chiapas]] &amp;ndash; April 8, 1943 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician and revolutionary and [[atheist]] activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico 1910-1982: Reform or Revolution?|work=|year=1983 |series=|page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkjXjgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Mexico+1910-1982:+Reform+Or+Revolution?&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj41piT1efNAhXFtRQKHcexDHcQ6AEIJTAB|accessdate= |publisher=Zed Press|isbn=9783700303398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrido Canabal served as dictator and governor of the state of [[Tabasco]] from 1920 to 1924 and again from 1931 to 1934, and was particularly noted for his [[Anti-Catholicism]]. During his term he fiercely persecuted the Church in his state, killing many priests and laymen and driving the remainder underground.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshner, Alan M. [http://jcs.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/3/479.extract "A Setback to Tomas Garrido Canabal's Desire to Eliminate the Church in Mexico"]. ''Journal of Church and State'' (1971) 13 (3): 479-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tomás Garrido Canabal was born in the [[hacienda]] Catazajá in the northernmost part of the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]. During the [[Mexican Revolution]], he was drawn into politics. He was named interim governor of Tabasco for a brief spell in 1919 (and then of the Yucatán in May and June 1920) until in December 1920 "Garrido again 
became provisional governor of Tabasco. From this point until August 1935 (except for a brief hiatus during the de la Huerta rebellion) he controlled the state."&lt;ref name="Ridgeway"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrido's rule, which marked the apogee of Mexican anti-clericalism, was supported by the [[Radical Socialist Party of Tabasco]] (PRST) of which he was the leader.

Garrido Canabal's revolutionary fervor was reflected in the names of his children: [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and Zoila Libertad. He even had a farm with a bull named [[God]], an ox and a hog named [[Pope]], a cow named after [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and a donkey named [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="historicaltextarchive.com"/&gt; In Tabasco, satirical plays were also organised, with for instance "the parading of a stud bull called 'the [[bishop]]' or an ass labeled 'the [[pope]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Garrido Canabal's administrative achievements included stimulating the social development of the state of Tabasco by means of agricultural and social policies and his support for the enfranchisement of women. In 1934, he introduced [[women's suffrage]] to Tabasco, making him the second governor to do so after [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto]] of the Yucatán twelve years earlier. In Mexico, Garrido Canabal's Tabasco was one of several "vying with one another for the title 'Laboratory of the Revolution'."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert M. Joseph (ed.), ''The Mexico Reader'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002): 411.&lt;/ref&gt; As Governor, however, he also issued rigid decrees against corsets and alcohol and outlawed tombstones.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884892,00.html|title=Milestones, Apr. 19, 1943|date=1943-04-19|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] was elected president in 1934, his first cabinet was hand-picked by his patron, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], the "Jefe Máximo" and power behind the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F. ''The United States and Mexico'', second edition. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1961, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Calles named fellow anticlerical Garrido Canabal as Secretary of Agriculture to Lázaro Cárdenas's cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748144,00.html|title=MEXICO: Palm Down|date=1934-12-10|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrido Canabal brought the Red Shirts to Mexico City.

June 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissing Garrido Canabal was part of Cárdenas's political maneuvering against Calles, who had expected to continue to be the power behind the presidency. Politically, eliminating Garrido Canabal and Calles gained Cárdenas the grudging support of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''United States and Mexico'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Garrido Canabal's paramilitary groups were subsequently disbanded. He was allowed to return to Mexico in 1941 and died two years later of cancer in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

Dorn (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' (New York: Scribner's, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; though his name is never mentioned. The novel's protagonist is a (also unnamed) "[[whisky priest]]", a theme often used in Garrido Canabal's antireligious propaganda.

A '''visitor''', in [[England and Wales|English and Welsh]] law and history, is an overseer of an autonomous [[Church body|ecclesiastical]] or [[charitable organization|eleemosynary]] institution, often a [[charitable organization|charitable institution]] set up for the perpetual distribution of the founder's alms and bounty, who can intervene in the internal affairs of that institution. Those with such visitors are mainly cathedrals, chapels, schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals.

Many visitors hold their role ''[[ex officio]]'', by serving as the [[British monarch|British sovereign]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Lord President of the Council]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]], or the [[bishop]] of a particular [[diocese]]. Others can be appointed in various ways, depending on the constitution of the organization in question.  Bishops are usually the visitors to their own cathedrals. The Queen usually delegates her visitatorial functions to the Lord Chancellor. During the reform of the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in the 19th century, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] ordered Visitations to the universities to make inquiries and to reform the university and college statutes.

There is a ceremonial element to the role, and the visitor may also be called upon to give advice where an institution expresses doubt as to its powers under its charter and statutes. However, the most important function of the visitor was within academic institutions, where the visitor had to determine disputes arising between the institution and its members. The right of the visitor, and not the courts, to adjudge on alleged deviations from the statutes of academic colleges was affirmed in the case of ''Philips v. Bury'', 1694, in which the [[House of Lords]] overruled a judgement of the [[Court of King's Bench]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 1, Chapter XVIII "Of Corporations", Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/new/casebook/cases/Cases%20Chapter%2013/Philips%20v%20Bury.doc |title=Opinion of John Holt (King's Bench)|format=DOC|publisher=Oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the courts have been exempted from any jurisdiction over student complaints. There had been much speculation that this contravened the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. However, the [[Higher Education Act 2004]] transferred the jurisdiction of Visitors over the grievances of students in English and Welsh universities to the [[Office of the Independent Adjudicator]].

==Outside England and Wales==
The position has also existed in universities in other countries which have followed the English and Welsh model (there being no such office in Scotland), although in many countries the visitor's role in complaints has been transferred to other bodies.

In the Republic of Ireland, the Universities Act, 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0024/index.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|date=|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; redefines the appointment, function and responsibility of a visitor. Where a university does not have a Visitor, a visitor may be appointed by the [[Irish Government|Government]] and must be either a current Judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] or a retired Judge of the High Court or [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]].

In Fiji the Court of Appeal in Muma v USP [1995] FJLawRp 16 declared that in default of appointment, the country's President was the Visitor of a university established by the Queen since Fiji had subsequently become a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/fj/cases/FJLawRp/1995/16.html|title=Muma v University of the South Pacific [1995] FJLawRp 16; [1995] 41 FLR 101 (22 May 1995)|author=|date=|website=www.paclii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], as a member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Canadian Royal Family]], has served as visitor to [[Upper Canada College]], in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], since 1955.

Also in Canada, the Queen's Representative in Ontario, His Honour the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, serves as the visitor to the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lt.gov.on.ca/en/Their_Honours/Honours_and_Awards.asp?nav=1&amp;sub=2 The Lieutenant Governor of Ontario - Honours and Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612210232/http://www.lt.gov.on.ca/en/Their_Honours/Honours_and_Awards.asp?nav=1&amp;sub=2 |date=12 June 2011 }}.

In India, the [[President of India]] is the visitor to 126 Central government institutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presidentofindia.nic.in/president-visitor.htm|title=President as Visitor of Central Institutes of Higher Learning|publisher=presidentofindia.nic.in|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/infocell/commrev/committee/iii.pdf |format=PDF |title=IIT Review 2004 : Acknowledgement |publisher=Iitk.ac.in |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the United States, the office of visitor, from its early use at some colleges and other institutions, evolved specifically into that of a trustee. Certain colleges and universities, particularly of an earlier, often colonial founding, are governed by boards of visitors, often chaired by a rector (rather than regents or trustees, etc.). Examples include the [[College of William and Mary]] and the [[University of Virginia]].

In Nigeria, the Visitor in publicly funded tertiary institution is the most senior member of government. This is usually the President in federally funded Universities or the Governor for State funded Universities. &lt;ref&gt;https://oouagoiwoye.edu.ng/the-visitor/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ui.edu.ng/uigovernance|title=University Governance - UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN|author=|date=|website=www.ui.edu.ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">'''Wigbod''', also known as '''Wigbald''' or '''Wigbold''', in Latin '''Wicboldus''', was a theological writer of the eighth century.

Of his works there is extant a Latin commentary on the [[Octateuch]] called ''Quaestiones in Octateuchum'' that is, on the Five Books of Moses, [[Josue]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]]. He wrote the work, as the full title states, at the command of [[Charlemagne]]. As Charlemagne is only called king of the Franks and Lombards, not Emperor, the work must have been written before the year 800.
 
The form of the book is that of a [[dialogue]] between pupil and teacher. The pupil propounds the difficulties and the teacher gives the solution. Wigbold, however, did not compose these answers himself, but gives verbatim, statements by eight [[Church Father]]s: [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], [[St. Gregory]], [[St. Jerome]], [[St. Ambrose]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|St. Hilary]], [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore]], [[St. Eucherius]] and [[St. Junilius]]. For the greater part of Genesis only Jerome and Isidore are drawn on, and later Isidore almost entirely. The two members of the Congregation of Saint-Maur, Martène and Durand, who found the manuscript in the monastery of St. Maximin of Trier, have, therefore, only given the portion to the first three chapters of Genesis in their ''Collectio amplissima'', IX, (Paris, 1733), 295-366. This portion has been reprinted in P. L., XCVI. 1101-68.
 
The work is chiefly valuable for its preservation of the texts of the Fathers quoted. The commentary is preceded by three Latin poems in hexameter. In the first Wigbold felicitates his book, because it is to be taken into the palace of the king; in the second he praises the king, particularly because Charlemagne has brought together books from many places, and because he knows the Bible well; in the third he treats the seven days of creation. The first two are largely taken from the introductory poems written by [[Eugenius II of Toledo]] to the work of [[Dracontius]], the third is the closing poem to Dracontius (''Monum. German. Histor.: Poet. Latin.'', I, 95-97). The manuscript used by Martène and Durand is now unknown. Two manuscripts without the poems are at [[Admont Abbey|Admont]] and Vienna.
 
Nothing positive is known as to the author. Martène and Durand mention Wigbald, who was vice- chancellor under the chancellors Itherius and Rado, and Widbod, who was [[Count of Périgueux]] about 778. The last mentioned hardly seems possible.
