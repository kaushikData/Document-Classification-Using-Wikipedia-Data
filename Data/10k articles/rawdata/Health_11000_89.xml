{{essay-like|date=January 2015}}
'''Cheating''' is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/search~S0?/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(cheating+)/1%2C63%2C63%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on [[morality]], [[ethics]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to [[infidelity]]. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a ''cheat'' in [[British English]], and a ''cheater'' in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]]. A person described as a "cheat" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on deceiving tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it.

==Academic==
{{Main article|Academic dishonesty}}
[[File:Cheating.JPG|thumb|A small [[cheat sheet]] can be used to cheat during an academic examination.]]

[[Academic]] cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have [[plagiarized]]. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by [[Rutgers University]] professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a [[Gallup survey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicintegrity.org/icai/integrity-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, "74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated."&lt;ref&gt;The Case of the Purloined Paper by Brigid Schulte&lt;/ref&gt; The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to [[educator]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |title=Ohiomatyc.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[MP3]] players can hold digitalized notes; [[graphing calculators]] store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reader's Digest]]'', pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: "but everybody is doing it".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese civil service examination|Chinese civil service examinations]], the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, was bedeviled for centuries by rampant cheating and examiner-bribery, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 Book of Swindles]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport, games and gambling ==

=== Sports ===
{{Main article|Unsportsmanlike conduct}}
Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as "[[Doping in sport|doping]]"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.
[[File:Lance Armstrong--2002--w.jpg|thumb|Lance Armstrong]]
High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[José Canseco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ken Caminiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.

Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly &amp; illegally using "stickum" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Cheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 90's to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. During the [[2007 Formula One Season]], driver [[Fernando Alonso]] was labelled a "cheat" for exchanging confidential information between the teams of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] and [[Mclaren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |title=Fernando is just a 'cheat' |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-21 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Spearman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114233444/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[collusion]]. 

An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. 

Cheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Video games ===
{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}
[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]
In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats &amp; Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as "[[fog of war]]", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).

Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus as of yet involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; - sometimes considered a form of "cheating" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.

Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become "stuck" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling ===

{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}

The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.
A boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].
Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.
An [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In "hole carding", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.
One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.

== Business ==

Various [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].

The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].

The '''Clinical Trials Directive''' (Officially Directive 2001/20/EC of 4 April 2001, of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to implementation of [[good clinical practice]] in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use) is a [[European Union directive]] that aimed at facilitating the internal market in medicinal products within the [[European Union]], while at the same time maintaining an appropriate level of protection for public health. It seeks to simplify and harmonise the administrative provisions governing [[clinical trial]]s in the European Community, by establishing a clear, transparent procedure.

The Member States of the [[European Union]] had to adopt and publish before 1 May 2003 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. The Member States had to apply these provisions at the latest with effect from 1 May 2004.

The '''Crow''' ('''Eric''') is a fictional character and the [[protagonist]] of ''[[The Crow]]'' comic book series, originally created by American artist [[James O'Barr]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From the Beginning, 'The Crow' Had a Grim Side : Movies: James O'Barr's comic book might have adapted smoothly to the big screen, but it was spurred by personal tragedy. |publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-30/entertainment/ca-63961_1_comic-book |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titular character is an [[undead]] [[vigilante]] [[Revenant (fiction)|brought back to life]] by a supernatural [[crow]] to avenge his murder and that of his fiancée. The character has subsequently appeared in several feature films, a television series, and spin-off novels and comics. In the various incarnations, films, and spin-offs, many people have taken on the Crow persona in order to avenge their own wrongful deaths. In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked the Crow 37th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.
The Crow made his live-action debut in the 1994 ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''  portrayed by [[Brandon Lee]]. Later, The Crow was portrayed by [[Mark Dacascos]] in the 1998 television series ''[[The Crow: Stairway to Heaven]]''.

==The Crow (bird)==
{{See also|Crow#Myth and spirituality|label 1=Crows in myth and spirituality}}

The Crow is a [[supernatural]] bird that serves as the protagonist's link between the living world and the realm of beyond. The magical crow is capable of resurrecting people who have been murdered, so that the victims may be able to seek justice on the person or people responsible for their death. This story is said to come from an old Native American legend.

During the person's "rebirth", the crow serves as a guide, helping the individual tap into his or her potential and assisting in tracking down the wrongdoers. Other people do not see the crow, only the reborn, unless he wants it. The Crow speaks to the reborn, often helping guide them to exact their revenge.

In the film adaptations, the crow is a real bird and if harmed or killed, the reborn becomes vulnerable. However, the Crow also seems to be much more enduring than a regular bird and might possess some regeneration abilities (e.g. in ''The Crow'' movie the bird survives after being shot with a rifle).

== Powers and abilities ==
While they are in possession of the Crow's powers, the reborn are endowed with several unique abilities. As they are already dead, the reborn are incapable of feeling pain or fatigue and possess a supernatural ability to recover from seemingly all injuries in a matter of moments. Chief among their physical abilities is their inhuman strength and enhanced reflexes; able to quickly brutalize several opponents simultaneously, even those who would be otherwise untouchable, as well as catch fast-moving projectiles such as throwing knives with their bare hands. In both ''Wicked Prayer'' and ''Stairway to Heaven'', the source of the reborn's strength is attributed to their love for the ones they've lost. Alternatively, Ashe Corvin says in ''City of Angels'' that the fuel for ''his'' power is pain. In either case, the Crow's magic is rooted in lost love.

Also, again in the movies, the reborn possesses the ability to see images from his or her loved one's memory when touching things he or she touched before, or to see the memories of a person when touching them. In addition the reborn usually can send the images and feelings from the memories already absorbed to the person whose eyes the reborn touches at the moment; in ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', protagonist Eric Draven makes villain Top Dollar feel 30 hours of his (Eric's) murdered girlfriend Shelly's pain in one moment. In ''The Crow: Stairway to Heaven'', Eric can see events that transpired simply by touching objects that belonged to someone.

Although the person brought back to life by the Crow is physically invulnerable, in the movies and later Crow comics they do have one weakness: they lose their power if the crow is harmed or killed. In addition, the reborn lose their invincibility when they consider their mission completed; in ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'', protagonist Alex Corvis is tricked into thinking that he completed his mission, thus he becomes vulnerable. However, his guide Crow makes Alex realize his mistake and rise again.

In the comic book ''The Crow: Waking Nightmares'', it is stated that the Crow power is taken from the reborn if they abandon their mission. In case of losing special powers the reborn become vulnerable, starts to rot, and [[rigor mortis]] sets in, as if the reborn were still in their graves.

In ''The Crow: City of Angels'' and ''The Crow: Salvation'', those resurrected by the Crow have the ability to turn into crows themselves and possess the natural abilities of a crow, such as flight and night vision.

==Appearance==
In the comic book, the origin of Eric's make-up is explained briefly as "painting his face in the colors of joy". This indicates that he copied the Greek comedy masquerade mask in his and Shelly's house. Contrary to the movie, in the book Eric does not paint his face with white. The white pale color comes from the fact that Eric is dead, it's just a corpse inhibited by a soul. Joshua and Mark Leung do not wear any distinctive make-up, and Ashe's is provided by Sarah, as in the movie. Iris Shaw paints the semblance of a Crow on her face with the tail covering her nose, and the wings covering her eyes. She removes it to face her final killer. Michael Korby's makeup covers his neck and shoulders. The makeup is referred as "the mask of death" and "the trails of Gorgon's blood" in ''[[The Crow: Wild Justice]]'' comic book. In ''[[The Crow: Death and Rebirth]]'', Jamie Osterberg's pale skin color and eye/mouth lines are not created by make-up, however, and his hair has turned completely white. In ''[[The Crow: Curare]]'', Carrie's pale skin color is not accomplished by make-up, there is no horizontal line over the mouth, and the vertical lines over the eyes are shorter and thinner.

In all feature films, except ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'', the protagonist wears make-up that cover their face. In the first movie Eric Draven copies the pattern from one of the [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] that decorated his and Shelly's apartment, which consists of white paint placed over the face with black paint around eyes, black vertical lines over and under eyes, black paint on the lips and a black horizontal line across the mouth and cheeks, resembling a [[Glasgow smile]]. In ''The Crow: City of Angels'' Ashe's make-up was provided by Sarah and looks similar. Jimmy's make-up in ''The Crow: Wicked Prayer'' is similar as well, though there is no horizontal line over the mouth and the vertical eye lines are shorter and thinner.

In the third movie, ''The Crow: Salvation'', Alex Corvis is executed in the electric chair, and his face is burned by the metal helmet which was worn over his head during the execution. He removes the burned skin following his resurrection, scarring his face around the eyes and lips, thus forming a pattern similar to the classical make-up. However, there are two vertical lines over each of his eyes and they cross with the horizontal lines on his mouth.

In ''The Crow: Stairway to Heaven'' TV series, Eric's "make-up" appears automatically whenever he "changes" into The Crow. His fingernails become black, while his face becomes white, with vertical lines over the eyes and short horizontal/diagonal lines extending from his lips, like a smile; they disappear when he becomes 'normal'.

Even though not all the reborn wear make-up, they are still usually drawn in a certain style: their lips are usually distinctively black, skin around eyes is black, while the eyes are sometimes burning white. Generally the style of drawing reminds the pattern of the classical makeup.

The resurrected souls in the ''Crow'' novels do not wear the traditional face paint/markings.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Comics===
====Eric====
The [[protagonist]] of the original [[comic book]]. Eric and his fiancée, Shelly, are on their way back from a romantic get-away, when their vehicle breaks down on a deserted road. A car full of gang members stops, not to help, but to take advantage of the couple's misfortune. They shoot Eric in the head paralysing him while they rape and kill his fiancée in the car, Eric dying hours later in the hospital. A year later, resurrected by The Crow, Eric exacts vengeance on the men responsible for their deaths.

Following the original series, London Night Studios published the six-issue series ''The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain'' (#1-4, #0 and a Finale issue) in 1998, which saw Eric paired with Everette Hartsoe's character, [[Razor (character)|Razor]]. In it Eric is again returned to the land of the living, this time to help Razor fight a demonic gang known as Pain. In the end Eric must face the events which led to his death, and the realization that why the reason his soul cannot rest is because he blames himself for being unable to save Shelly. A follow-up magazine entitled ''The Crow/Razor: Nocturnal Masque'', featuring artwork of both characters with quotes attributed to each, was also published.

Eric was also in a 10 issue series by [[Image Comics]] which reimagined the plot, adding influences from the film. Eric and Shelly's lives are cut short when a wrong apartment number leads a gang of drug lords to mistakenly murder them only days before their wedding. Now, Eric haunts the city as the Crow, a shadow administering revenge for not only his loss, but for others as well. A police officer enlists the aid of the Crow to uncover the truth about the jailed suspect of a murdered 9-year-old girl. As the Crow is flushing out information about the murder, he discovers that Shelly`s grave has been desecrated and her body has been removed. Another vigilante, a Native American named Walker, who communicates with a wolf, begins killing local murderers.

====Joshua====
Joshua appears in the three issue series ''[[The Crow: Dead Time]]'', the follow-up to the original [[graphic novel]]. Joshua is a Native American farmer of the [[Crow Nation]] who adopts the "white man's way" and becomes a farmer. Joshua, along with his wife and child, are murdered by a band of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers. A century later, Joshua is resurrected by the Crow and hunts down the soldiers, who have been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a biker gang.

====Iris Shaw====
Iris appears in the three issue series ''The Crow: Flesh and Blood'' and is the first woman to assume the role. Iris is a Federal Conservation officer who is killed, along with her unborn child, by terrorists. The Crow resurrects her to hunt them down. She seems to be not completely invincible, as, according to the Crow, she must complete her mission before she rots. Thus, she cannot really heal, and uses a stapler to repair her wounds.

====Michael Korby====
Michael appears in the three-issue series ''The Crow: Wild Justice''. Michael and his wife are murdered during a car jacking. He is brought back by two crows named Hugo and Manny respectively, and must avenge his and his wife's death before the [[Gorgon]] blood running through his veins runs out. The Gorgon god tattoos Michael's body, which gives him the power to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] until the blood runs out.

====Mark Leung====
Mark appears in the four-issue series ''The Crow: Waking Nightmares''. Mark and his wife are murdered by the Chinese Mafia. Instead of going after their killers, Mark returns to save his twin daughters, whom the mob have sold into slavery.

Leandre appears in ''The French Crow'', Vols. 2 and 3, published in France in 2007, in the two-part story "The Medieval Crow". Leandre and his wife Jeanne are murdered and their son Lestal stolen on the orders of Lord Arthuro, who is seeking an heir. Leandre achieves his vengeance and eventually kills Arthuro, but accidentally kills Lestal. After his son's death, Leandre is abandoned by his Spirit Crow and must wander the Earth until he learns the true reason for his restless wandering.

====Vincent====
He appears in ''The French Crow'', Vol. 4, published in France in 2010, in the story "La Fiancée du Corbeau" ("Bride of the Crow").  Vincent is a young make-up artist in the 1930s who falls in love with Evy, an actress. He tries to rescue Evy from being raped by a gang of stagehands but is murdered by them, and he returns a year later, aided by a Spirit Crow, to seek vengeance.

====Elorah====
She appears in ''The French Crow'', Vols. 4 &amp; 5, published in France in 2010, in the two-part story "Le Sang des Innocents" ("Blood of the Innocent"). Elorah is an undercover police officer investigating a narcotics baron; after being murdered and revived by a Spirit Crow, she must now face not only her murderer but his creation: a cyborg that feeds on blood.

====Jamie Osterberg====
Appearing in the five issue series ''The Crow: Death And Rebirth'', Jamie Osterberg is a foreign exchange student studying in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. His fiancée Haruko and other friends vanish, only to return possessed by someone else. Jamie finds out too much and is killed. Resurrected by the power of The Crow, with a sword that seeks truth, he learns that the "possession" was caused by a process that can insert one person's mind into another person's body and that Haruko was taken because an old rich dying woman wanted a new life in Haruko's body. Jamie hunts down those responsible to free the souls of his friends and be reunited with his one true love ... even if it means allying himself with Japanese ghosts and demons and following a path of vengeance through the different Japanese Hells (see ''[[Diyu]]'').

====The Man====
The protagonist of the three issue series ''[[The Crow: Skinning The Wolves]]'', which takes place at a [[Nazi concentration camp]].

The Man is resurrected by The Crow and wreaks terrible vengeance on all of the troops at the camp.  He eventually finds and kills his murderer, avenging himself and the other victims of the camp. He then disappears into the night, intending to take revenge on the nearby town whose inhabitants knew what was happening at the camp and did nothing about it.

====Carrie/"Curare"====
In the three issue series ''The Crow: Curare'', Carrie is a young girl who was murdered by a serial killer who preys on children. She is resurrected by a Spirit Crow (which she calls "Birdy"). She is also the only protagonist in the "Crow" canon who does not personally engage in violence; instead, she helps Detective Joe Salk, who investigated her murder, to find her killer and take revenge.

====Salvador====
In ''[[The Crow: Pestilence]]'', Salvador is a young boxer in [[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], [[Mexico]] who refuses to take a fall, but has no problem taking a drug gang's pay-off. When the gang kills Salvador and his family, he returns years later in search of vengeance and forgiveness. The final showdown not only reveals an unexpected ally and an equally unexpected truth about his family's murder, but also pits him against ''el Santa Muerte'' ... Death itself.

====David Amadio====
In ''The Crow: Momento Mori'', David is a Catholic altar boy who is killed along with his girlfriend Sarah and dozens of others in a terrorist attack in Rome, Italy. Resurrected as the Crow, he wreaks vengeance on those who committed the atrocity, but wiping out the terrorists does not prove the end of the story, as the mastermind behind the attack and the reasons for it still remain a mystery that he must solve before he can rest in peace.

==In other media==
===Film===
====Eric Draven====
Eric Draven was portrayed by martial artist actor [[Brandon Lee]] in the 1994 film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', based on the comic book. The film had the same basic premise, except that the couple were murdered in their [[loft apartment]] because they were fighting tenant eviction instead of being murdered on the side of the road for fun. The film supplies Eric and Shelley with the respective last names Draven and Webster; in the graphic novel, they were referred to only by their first names. In the movie Eric depends on the Crow's health (which is a real bird) to be invincible (unlike the book where Eric is totally invincible and the crow is kind of a spirit that mostly only Eric sees).

====Ashe Corven====
He appears in ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'', the sequel to ''The Crow''.

Ashe Corven (portrayed by ([[Vincent Pérez]]) is resurrected by the magical crow to avenge the death of his son Danny, who was killed along with him after accidentally witnessing a gang committing a murder. Like his predecessor, Ashe successfully kills each of the gang members until he meets the crime boss who ordered his death. The crime boss, Judah Earl (portrayed by [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]]), wishes to obtain Ashe's powers for himself and will do his worst to gain them. In his endeavors, Ashe is assisted by Sarah (from the original film; now portrayed by [[Mia Kirshner]]). Sarah provides Ashe's facial make-up in honor of Eric and helps him in his mission. While Ashe is on his way to kill Judah after dispatching his gang, Judah captures his spirit crow and drinks its blood, gaining Ashe's powers. While the film's ending has Ashe and Danny reunited, the original intended ending leaves Ashe unable to move on to the Afterlife, condemning him to wander the Earth.

====Alexander Frederick "Alex" Corvis====
He appears in ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'', the third movie in the series. Alexander Frederick "Alex" Corvis (portrayed by [[Eric Mabius]]) is convicted of murdering his girlfriend, Lauren (portrayed by [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), and then [[death sentence|executed]] in the [[electric chair]]. Alex is assisted by Lauren's younger sister, Erin (portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]]), as they uncover the mystery surrounding the murder. Alex is the only reborn whose make-up didn't appear mysteriously and wasn't provided purposefully, but rather appeared in the form of creepy-looking burn scars on his face.

====James "Jimmy" Cuervo====
Appears in ''[[The Crow: Wicked Prayer]]'', the fourth movie in the series, which was based on the fifth book of the Crow series of the same name (Dan Cody was the character's name in the book).

As in the book, James "Jimmy" Cuervo (portrayed in the movie by [[Edward Furlong]]) and his girlfriend Lily "Ignites the Dawn" (Leticia "Dreams The Truth" Hardin in the novel and portrayed by [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] in the film) are hunted down by a gang of [[Satanism|Satanists]] who want to steal her eyes for use in an outlandish ritual. She and Jimmy are both killed in the process. Jimmy then goes on a journey to avenge his and his girlfriend's death and take down the satanists in the process.

===Television===
====Eric Draven====
Eric was also portrayed by [[Mark Dacascos]] in the television series ''[[The Crow: Stairway to Heaven]]'' in 1998. This version of Eric differed slightly from the other versions in that his mission wasn't about revenge, but about redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Crow: Stairway To Heaven – The Complete Series DVD Review |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |date= |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17589 |accessdate=2010-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615061852/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17589 |archivedate=2011-06-15 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 episodes were produced in which Eric acts as a vigilante helping the needy, before the series was pulled in 1999.

====Hannah Foster====
Played by [[Bobbie Phillips]], she appears in ''The Crow: Stairway to Heaven''. Hannah Foster is brought back to life one year after she and her daughter are killed. Like Draven, Hannah has a Spirit Crow and possesses all of the Crow's powers. However, unlike Eric, she constantly battles between the need for redemption and her lust for vengeance; also, her methods for dealing with her opposition are far more severe than Draven's.

===Toys===
[[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] Cult Classics Icons Series 1 Action Figure Eric Draven (The Crow).
[[Hot Toys]] release The Crow (Eric Draven) 1/6th scale collectible figure.

==Novels==
===William Blessing===
He appears in ''[[The Crow: Quoth the Crow]]'', the first published novel in the series. Blessing is a popular horror writer who is murdered by his jealous protégé Donald Marquette, aided by a goth gang with literary aspirations. His wife is viciously raped in the encounter, and Blessing is brought back to exact vengeance. Blessing's body is continually on the verge of rotting away, his willpower to complete his mission the only thing holding him together. It's also implied that Blessing's healing abilities are actually the result of cannibalistic feeding off his victims.

===Jared Poe===
He appears in ''[[The Crow: The Lazarus Heart]]'', the second published novel in the series. Poe is a controversial S&amp;M photographer who becomes the target of a serial killer in [[Louisiana]] who preys on gay men and transsexuals. He is wrongfully arrested by members of a homophobic police force and convicted for the murder of his homosexual lover (who was actually killed by the serial killer), and while on Death Row is murdered by a fellow inmate whose brother was one of the serial killer's victims and who believed that Poe was the killer. Upon his rebirth, he tries to track down the real killer with the help of his lover's transsexual sister, while also avenging himself on the homophobes who were responsible for his arrest, conviction and death. This novel's basic plot was the direct inspiration for ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]''.

===Amy Carlisle===
She appears in ''[[The Crow: Clash by Night]]'', the third published novel in the series. Amy is a day care owner who is killed in a bombing, along with some of the children she watches, when a militia group calling themselves The Sons of America tries to kill a popular senator who was supposed to have been visiting the center but who pulled out at the last minute. Six months after the bombing, Amy is resurrected by a Spirit Crow, but discovers that her husband Rick has moved on with her best friend, who survived the blast. During her acts of vengeance against the militia group's members, Amy is seen and recognized by Rick, who then attempts to infiltrate the militia group.

===Stephen Lelliott===
He appears in ''[[The Crow: Temple of Night]]'', the fourth published novel in the series. In turn-of-the-century Bangkok, the Klong Toey shantytowns are home to shadowy erotic emporiums where millionaire celebrities act out their darkest sexual fantasies, protected by money, influence, and American diplomacy. Stephen Lellicott is a young American journalist assigned to expose the latest cover-up, but he's about to break the two cardinal rules of journalism: Don't fall in love, and don't get killed.

===Dan Cody===
He appears in ''The Crow: Wicked Prayer'', the fifth published novel in the series and the basis for the [[The Crow: Wicked Prayer|film of the same name]]. He and his girlfriend Leticia "Dreams The Truth" Hardin are murdered by John Church and Kyra Damon, who have learned about the power of The Crow, who want immortality and who need Leticia's eyes to achieve it. Dan is resurrected, then goes on a journey to avenge his and his girlfriend's deaths.

===Billy Parker and Dren===
They appear in ''[[The Crow: Hellbound]]'', the last published novel, dating from 2001. In this book, a demon named Dren is looking for salvation; Satan's fiery underworld has become a foreign place to him and he feels he is different from the other souls. After escaping from Hell, Dren must save a single soul in order to pass on to the heavens above. Billy is a young hoodlum working for a big-time mobster, and like Dren he has also changed and wants out of the seedy underworld he calls his home. But neither the mob nor Hell look kindly on deserters; Satan has sent two rogue demons to stop Dren and the mob has hired a conjurer named Nadja to kill Billy. In the end, the two must call on the powers of the Crow to save them both and to escape their own hells — waging a full-scale war on the mobsters of Earth above and the lord of darkness below.

==Popular culture==
*Eric Draven (alongside his crow) appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Cannot Be Erased, So Sorry" voiced by [[Simon Pegg]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the Nerd (voiced by [[Seth Green]]) spices up his dream by imagining Eric Draven in place of the Scarecrow (along with [[Optimus Prime]] replacing the Tin Man and [[Lion-O]] replacing the Cowardly Lion). His dialogue is always over-the-top nihilistic with background music similar in style to [[The Cure]].  When engaging a flying monkey at the castle of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], Eric explains the meaning of existence in such a depressing way that the flying monkey hangs himself. Eric then sheds a single tear.
*In the season two episode of the [[Comedy Central]] program ''[[Workaholics]]'' titled "Teenage Mutant Ninja Roommates", Anders is shown to have attended Eric Draven Middle School.
*Professional wrestler [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] used the Crow facepaint for his darker persona in late 1996 and still uses a modified version of it to this day. The original face paint was a near identical replica of Eric Draven's face paint with the exception of a frown being painted on his lips instead of a smile. The modified versions include longer trails on the eyes and mouth, resembling black blood. He also briefly merged the look with that of [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] during his battle with Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff's group Immortal in TNA before returning to the modified Crow styling.

'''Daniel Gollán''' is the former [[Health Minister]] of Argentina. 

==Biography==
Daniel Gollán made his university studies during the [[Dirty War]], and joined the "Juventud Universitaria Peronista". He met the future president [[Néstor Kirchner]] by then. He studied under the guidance of the cardiologist [[Floreal Ferrara]]. He led the ANMAT from 2008 to 2010, and advises the ''[[Carta Abierta]]'' group on topics related to health.&lt;ref name="quien"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1771613-quien-es-daniel-gollan-el-nuevo-ministro-de-salud|title= Quién es Daniel Gollán, el nuevo ministro de Salud|trans-title=Who is Daniel Gollan, the new ministry of health|language= Spanish|author= |date= February 26, 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Daniel Gollán (cropped).jpg|thumb|Daniel Gollán]]

He was appointed minister of health in Argentina, on February 26, 2015. Replacing [[Juan Luis Manzur]].&lt;ref name="quien" /&gt; Kirchnerism could not achieve a victory for [[Daniel Scioli]] in the [[Argentine general election, 2015|2015 presidential election]] that allowed him to prevent a ballotage, and runs for a runoff election against [[Mauricio Macri]]. Kirchnerism reacted with a [[negative campaigning]] against Macri. Gollán said, in his Twitter account, "The 12 new radiation therapy centers to treat cancer will continue if Scioli is president. Think well before you vote". The opposition asked for his resignation, and Gollán deleted the post and claimed that his account had been hacked. Still, his previous posts have a similar tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1842464-un-tuit-del-ministro-gollan-desato-una-polemica-y-reavivo-la-campana-negativa|title= Un tuit del ministro Gollán desató una polémica y reavivó la campaña negativa|trans-title=A tweet by minister Gollán started a controversy and renewed the negative campaigning|language= Spanish|author= Mariana Verón|date= November 4, 2015|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stammel 5206.JPG|thumb|300px|''Dipsomania'', an 18th-century woodcarving by Josef Stammel in the library of [[Admont Abbey]].]]
'''Dipsomania''' is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as [[alcoholism]]. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek ''dipso'' ({{lang-el|"δίψα"}}= thirst) and ''mania''.

It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD-10 classification as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26

==History==
The term was coined by the German physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasso Spode]]: Die Macht der Trunkenheit. Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte des Alkohols, Opladen 1993, pp. 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he translated Brühl-Cramer's term "''trunksucht''" as "dipsomania".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 The history of alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's concepts and observations - KIELHORN - 2006 - Addiction - Wiley Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lexikon Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie, Medizinische Psychologie''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w5Rd6NFbMiAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Dr.+C.+W.+Hufeland+dipsomania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sWdfdrSL5J&amp;sig=kZ1uxCPacTOfjWQRrmATAb2hRK4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=am_0SbrfOZiclAeLktXWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 Dipsomania entry] at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Brühl-Cramer classified dipsomania in terms of continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its cause, [[pathogenesis]], [[sequela]]e, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the [[laws of chemistry]] and concepts of excitability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Wiley.com journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54233 NLA record]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as "the most medical" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=dipsomania+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqkL0Nbrrv&amp;sig=aIGzrvkXaWMAsdSyxfWet4Dt4YY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=G3n0SZiYE42clAeJ4sy3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Google book search]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with terms such as "inebriety", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease.&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137"&gt;[http://sls.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/5/1/37 Extract at sagepub.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it "illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137" /&gt;

Although ''dipsomania'' was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.&lt;ref name="psych encyc"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/dipsomania Dipsomania entry] at Psychoanalysis Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1893 book ''Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania'', Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt; Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt;

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tracy | first = Sarah | title = Alcoholism in America |pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;q=dipsomania | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4946">The '''Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre''' (EPPI-Centre) is part of the Social Science Research Unit at the Institute of Education, [[University of London]]. Its work is concerned with [[systematic review]]s which use transparent and explicit methodologies for reviewing research evidence in order to be clear about what we know from research and how we know it.  

== Methods for Research Synthesis ==

A major focus of the EPPI-Centre is the development of methods of systematic reviews including systematic mapping and synthesis. The Centre is the Methods for Research Synthesis (MRS) Node of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) National Centre for Research Methods.

The Centre has adapted the model of systematic reviews that has been widely developed in healthcare to address a broader range of questions and methodologies relevant to public policy research such as statistical, narrative and conceptual synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley A, Gough D, Oliver S, Thomas J. The politics of evidence and methodology: lessons from the EPPI-Centre. ''Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice 2005'', 1 (1) 5 – 31&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Working with a range of users ==

The EPPI-Centre's programme of work seeks to develop ways of working with various groups of research and service ‘users’ throughout the review process, including deciding which topics need most urgently to be reviewed, and analyzing and disseminating the results of reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Rees R, Oliver S (2007) User Involvement in systematic reviews: an example from health promotion. In Coren E (ed) Collection of examples of service user and carer participation in systematic reviews. London: Social Care Institute for Excellence&lt;/ref&gt;  
A particular aim is to explore the perspectives and participation of those people who are, or represent, people receiving a service or who are affected by the service in some other way. This might include: patients in a clinical encounter; students in a classroom; people receiving, missing or avoiding health promotion interventions; or students and parents in relation to an education policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gough D (2007) Giving voice: evidence-informed policy and practice as a democratizing process. In M Reiss, R DePalma and E Atkinson (Eds) "Marginality and Difference In Education and Beyond." London: Trentham Books &lt;/ref&gt; 

== Evidence Library ==

The EPPI-Centre conducts systematic reviews of research evidence across a range of topics. Major areas include education, health promotion, employment, social care and justice.
The reviews on these topics can be found in an Online Evidence Library, which provides evidence overviews of broad topic areas as well as summaries and full reports of specific reviews conducted or supported by the EPPI-Centre.

== Collaborative Partnerships ==
{{main|Collaborative partnerships}}

Work at the EPPI-Centre is funded by a range of research councils,  government departments and charities and national and international partners. The EPPI-centre has strong links with two international collaborations concerned with policy-relevant reviews of research evidence: the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] in health care and the [[Campbell collaboration]] for social interventions.

== Teaching and Learning ==
 
The EPPI-Centre offers a large programme of training and workshops on methodological and practical aspects of systematic research synthesis, including an [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/?tabid=692 MSc in Research for Public Policy and Practice.] The Centre offers face-to-face and online distance short courses in [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=694 Systematic reviews for policy and practice]; [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=695 Participative research and policy]; and [http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=696 Methods for research synthesis]. &lt;ref&gt;Bird, K (2008) 'An 'objective-centred' approach to course redesign: using learning objectives to integrate e-learning', ''Reflecting Education'', Vol. 4, No. 1: 51-62&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPPI-Reviewer software ==

EPPI-Reviewer&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J, Brunton J, Graziosi S (2010) EPPI-Reviewer 4.0: software for research synthesis. EPPI-Centre software. London: Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; is a web application that enables researchers to manage the entire lifecycle of a review in a single location.  Users are able to upload studies for screening, complete keywording and data extractions and analyse the results over the internet. Analytical functions include meta-analysis, summary tables and support for qualitative synthesis.

'''Exercise prescription''' commonly refers to the specific plan of fitness-related activities that are designed for a specified purpose, which is often developed by a fitness or rehabilitation specialist for the client or patient. Due to the specific and unique needs and interests of the client/patient, the goal of exercise prescription should be focused on motivation and customization, thus making achieving goals more likely to become successful.&lt;ref name=EMedicine88648&gt;{{EMedicine|article|88648|Exercise Prescription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patient referral ==
In the United Kingdom there is a scheme called "Exercise on prescription" in which doctors are able to prescribe [[exercise]] to those with conditions that benefit from it, such as [[asthma]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or [[obesity]].  The initiative particularly aimed to lower the rate of [[heart disease]]. National standards for such initiatives from doctors were established by the  [[Department of Health]] in 2001. Exercise on prescription aims to prevent deterioration of conditions, and views exercise as a preventative health measure. Fitness classes or a course at the local gym are available on prescription at a reduced rate to people who might benefit from them. It aims to make it easier for people to follow their doctors' advice about taking more exercise or losing weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1261950.stm |title=Exercise on prescription |publisher=BBC News |date=April 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such preventative measures hope to lead to savings for the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/exercise-for-depression.aspx] Exercise on prescription (Times)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Researchers in New Zealand have also discussed the benefits of exercise referral by medical practitioners there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hi-mag.com/healthinsurance/article.do?articleid=20001764961 Analysis: Workplace Wellbeing{{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New Zealand it is known as a green prescription, while in the United States a similar initiative is known as [[Exercise is Medicine]].
A green prescription is a referral given by a doctor or nurse to a patient, with exercise and lifestyle goals written on them.
The term, used by health practitioners in New Zealand draws parallel to the usual [[medical prescription|prescription]]s given to patients for medications, and emphasises the importance of exercise in improving their condition, and not relying on drugs.
The green prescription is written after discussing the issues and goals in the consultation.
Studies have shown that an increase in exercise, better sense of well-being, and a decrease in [[blood pressure]] results from using the method. A decreased risk of [[coronary heart disease]] has not been shown. This was shown in two studies, one by Swinburn (1998), that surveyed patients in [[Auckland]] and [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref name="pmid9491025"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Swinburn BA, Walter LG, Arroll B, Tilyard MW, Russell DG |title=The green prescription study: a randomized controlled trial of written exercise advice provided by general practitioners |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=288–91 |year=1998 |pmid=9491025 |pmc=1508188 |doi=10.2105/ajph.88.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was Elley (2003) and was done in 42 practices in the same region of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="pmid12689976"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Elley CR, Kerse N, Arroll B, Robinson E |title=Effectiveness of counselling patients on physical activity in general practice: cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7393 |pages=793 |year=2003 |pmid=12689976 |pmc=153098 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7393.793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General practitioner]]s like the idea as it formalises what they are telling the patient about how their lifestyle changes are necessary (Swinburn 1997).&lt;ref name="pmid9406491"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Swinburn BA, Walter LG, Arroll B, Tilyard MW, Russell DG |title=Green prescriptions: attitudes and perceptions of general practitioners towards prescribing exercise |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=47 |issue=422 |pages=567–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9406491 |pmc=1313106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Australia has suggested that an exercise prescription program would be very beneficial and many ICU physiotherapists are already performing this practice, however there is no national standards to govern how this practice is administered so there is great variety in the ways this is administered therefore more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skinner |first1=Elizabeth H. |last2=Berney |first2=Susan |last3=Warrillow |first3=Stephen |last4=Denehy |first4=Linda |title=Rehabilitation and exercise prescription in Australian intensive care units |journal=Physiotherapy |volume=94 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=220–9 |doi=10.1016/j.physio.2007.11.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hagan |first1=Ciara |last2=De Vito |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Boreham |first3=Colin A.

== For specific diseases ==

=== Osteoarthritis ===
Studies show that exercise prescription aids in both preventing and minimizing the effects of joint disorders such as [[osteoarthritis]]. Evidence shows that in addition to the general physiological, psychological and functional benefits gained from exercise, greater quadriceps strength has a mitigating effect on knee joint pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Grady |first1=Michael |last2=Fletcher |first2=Jacquelyn |last3=Ortiz |first3=Susan |title=Therapeutic and physical fitness exercise prescription for older adults with joint disease: an evidence-based approach |journal=Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=617–46 |year=2000 |pmid=10989515 |doi=10.1016/S0889-857X(05)70159-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression ===
A large body of research indicates that exercise prescription has beneficial effects for patients suffering depression. One study shows a significant improvement for a randomized group of women with [[major depressive disorder]] engaging in a twice-weekly resistance training program compared to a control group. The reasons for this marked change is thought to have biochemical, physiological and [[psychosocial]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanton |first1=Robert |last2=Happell |first2=Brenda M. |title=An Exercise Prescription Primer for People with Depression |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=626–30 |year=2013 |pmid=23909675 |doi=10.3109/01612840.2012.758207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) ===
{{See also|Peripheral arterial disease}}
Blockage or closing of the arteries of the lower limbs impairs blood flow to the legs and results in significant reduction in physical capacity. Alternate exercise prescriptions to walking are considered. [[Aerobic exercise]]s such as arm-cranking or cycling are recommended.  Risk factors for disease progression should also be taken into account when aiming to improve waling ability. Functional capacity should be determined prior to commencement of prescribe exercise programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Askew |first1=Christopher D. |last2=Parmenter |first2=Belinda |last3=Leicht |first3=Anthony S. |last4=Walker |first4=Philip J. |last5=Golledge |first5=Jonathan |title=Exercise &amp; Sports Science Australia (ESSA) position statement on exercise prescription for patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=623–9 |year=2014 |pmid=24315956 |doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.10.251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diabetes mellitus ===
The number of individuals diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus]] are rapidly increasing and a lot of evidence suggests this is due to an insufficiently active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=pmid21621458&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hordern |first1=Matthew D. |last2=Dunstan |first2=David W. |last3=Prins |first3=Johannes B. |last4=Baker |first4=Michael K. |last5=Singh |first5=Maria A. Fiatarone |last6=Coombes |first6=Jeff S. |title=Exercise prescription for patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes: A position statement from Exercise and Sport Science Australia |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |year=2012 |pmid=21621458 |doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2011.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benefits of exercise include stress reduction, reduced risk of heart disease, lowers blood pressure, helps control weight and aids insulin in improving management of diabetes. Exercise that is not too strenuous is recommended. Such activities may include walking, swimming, gardening, cycling or golfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabetes and Exercise - Keeping Active|url=http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Keeping-Active/|website=Diabetes Australia|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Incidental activities are encouraged, such as using the stairs instead of an escalator/lift or walking short distances instead of driving. 
Dr Gebel, who works at James Cook University's Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention conducted a study reporting increased health benefits through incorporation of more vigorous exercise. He stated that this could include 'vigorous gardening', not necessarily meaning going to the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walton|first1=Alice|title=Vigorous Exercise Linked To Longer Life, Study Says|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/04/06/vigorous-exercise-may-lengthen-lives-study-finds/|website=Forbs|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diabetes Australia suggest 30 minutes of exercise daily as a suitable target, which can be divided into three 10-minute sessions throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabetes and Exercise - Keeping Active|url=http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Keeping-Active/|website=Diabetes Australia|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exercise programs however should be tailored and delivered by individuals with appropriate qualifications.

== Exercise recommendations ==
According to Exercise and Sport Science Australia, a minimum amount of 210 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 125 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise should be performed per week. Exercise should include both aerobic and resistance training. For greater health benefits, exercise should be performed regularly with no more than a two-day gap between training sessions.&lt;ref name=pmid21621458/&gt;

=== Elderly ===
Research has found that having a well planned exercise routine can greatly benefit the elderly. It an reduce the risks of coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and insulin resilience, hypertension and obesity as well as vast improvements in bone density and muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mazzeo |first1=Robert S. |last2=Tanaka |first2=Hirofumi |title=Exercise Prescription for the Elderly |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=809–18 |year=2001 |pmid=11583105 |doi=10.2165/00007256-200131110-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise program development ==
Exercise prescription is designed to modulate acute exercise programming variables to create the adaptations desired by the individual or sport. With  aerobic exercise prescription, the type of exercise, duration of exercise, frequency, and duration is adjusted.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=William J. |last1=Kraemer |first2=Steven J. |last2=Fleck |first3=Michael R. |last3=Deschenes |year=2011 |chapter=Exercise Testing for Health, Physical Fitness, and Predicting Sport Performance |pages=385–414 |title=Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-8351-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescription of [[stretching]] and other activities is also commonly seen.
Exercise prescription can be divided into 5 components:&lt;ref name=EMedicine88648/&gt;
*Type of exercise or activity (eg, walking, swimming, cycling)
*Specific workloads (eg, watts, walking speed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vogiatzis |first1=Ioannis |title=Physiological Response to Moderate Exercise Workloads in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program in Patients With Varying Degrees of Airflow Obstruction |journal=Chest |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=1200–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10559076 |doi=10.1378/chest.116.5.1200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Duration and frequency of the activity or exercise session

'''Fish medicine''' is the study and treatment of the diseases of [[fish]]. Although some practitioners work primarily with [[aquarium]] fish, this field also has important applications to [[fisheries]] management.

Fish medicine is a relatively recent veterinary specialization; veterinary textbooks in the English language were not published until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Karen L.|last2=Forbes|first2=Neil A.|last3=Frye|first3=F.L.|last4=Lewbart|first4=G.A.|title=Rapid Review of Exotic Animal Medicine &amp; Husbandry.|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=London|isbn=9781840765335|pages=8-10|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States does not have an official [[Veterinary specialties|specialization]] for fish medicine,&lt;ref name="Weber 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=E.

[[File:Spilled_strawberries.jpg|thumb|Strawberries dropped on the ground. The five-second rule suggests that if they are picked up in at least 5 seconds, it is safe to eat them without rewashing.]]
The '''five-second rule''', sometimes also the '''three-second rule''',&lt;ref name="3sec"&gt;(7 February 2006) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=20060207&amp;id=V-spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9NUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3658,5281110 Getting the dirt of the 5-second rule], ''[[Southeast Missourian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is a western cultural [[food hygiene]] concept, that states that there is a defined window where it is permissible  to pick up food (or sometimes cutlery) after it has been dropped and thus exposed to contamination. Some may believe this assertion, whereas most people employ the rule as an amusing social fiction that allows them to eat a dropped piece of food, despite the potential reservations of their peers. How many and what type of bacteria would stick to a piece of dropped food depends on many factors, the food or the floor being wet or dry among them. There is also a social dimension as dropped food in a restaurant or when guests are around is simply unacceptable, but in a family or private situation it may be still tolerated.

There appears to be no scientific consensus on the general applicability of the rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/5-second-rule-rules-sometimes-#1 |author=Leanna Skanulis| title='5-Second Rule', Sometimes |publisher=[[WebMD]] |date=2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its origin is unclear.&lt;ref name="sefton"&gt;Sefton, Dru (2003).

== Research ==
The five-second rule has received some scholarly attention.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Deardorff [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/09/health/la-he-capsule-20100809 "Capsule: The five-second rule"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', August 9, 2010, accessed January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been studied as both a public health recommendation and a sociological effect.

In 2003, Jillian Clarke of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] found in a survey that 56% of men and 70% of women surveyed, were familiar with the five-second rule. She also determined that a variety of foods were significantly contaminated by even brief exposure to a tile inoculated with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="aces"/&gt; On the other hand, Clarke found no significant evidence of contamination on public flooring.&lt;ref name="aces"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.aces.illinois.edu/news/if-you-drop-it-should-you-eat-it-scientists-weigh-5-second-rule |title=If You Drop It, Should You Eat It? Scientists Weigh In on the 5-Second Rule|last=Picklesimer|first=Phyllis|publisher=[[University of Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences]]|work=ACES News |date=2003-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, Clarke received the 2004 [[Ig Nobel Prize|{{Nowrap|Ig Nobel}} Prize]] in public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2004|title=Improbable Research|author=|date=|website=improbable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more thorough study in 2006&lt;!-- sic. it was published the next year --&gt; using [[salmonella]] on wood, tiles, and nylon carpet, found that the bacteria were able to thrive under dry conditions even after twenty-eight days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tested after eight hours of exposure, the bacteria was still able to contaminate bread and [[Bologna sausage|bologna]] in under five seconds. But a minute-long contact increased contamination about tenfold (especially tile and carpet surfaces).&lt;ref name="bologna"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/09curi.html |title=The Five-second Rule Explored, or: How Dirty Is That Bologna? |last=McGee |first=Harold | authorlink = Harold McGee|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The researchers at the [[Rutgers University]] also debunked this theory by dropping watermelon cubes, Haribo strawberry gummies, plain white bread, and buttered bread from a height of five inches on to the ground. 
The surfaces selected were slathered in ''[[Enterobacter aerogenes]]''. The surfaces used were carpet, ceramic tile, stainless steel and wood. The food was left on the surface in intervals of 5, 30 and 300 seconds. The scientists assessed the amount of ''E. aerogenes'' transferred between surface and food. Since bacteria tended to be attracted to moisture, wet food had more risk to have bacteria transferred than dry food. To the surprise of the researchers, carpet transferred fewer bacteria than steel or tile. Wood was hard to pin down. It showed a large variation. "The five-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food,” Donald Schaffner, a Rutgers University biologist and an author of the research, said in a statement in the ''Washington Post''. "Bacteria can contaminate instantaneously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/13/the-five-second-rule-for-eating-food-scientists-just-demonstrated-how-gross-it-is/|title=The 'five-second rule' for eating food? Scientists just demonstrated how gross it is.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five-second rule was also featured in an [[MythBusters (2005 season)#Five-second Rule|episode]] of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[MythBusters]]''. There was no significant difference in the number of bacteria collected. The aspects that affect the contamination process is the moisture, surface geometry and the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2005/10/mythbusters_chinese_invasion_a.html|title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 39  Chinese Invasion Alarm, 5 Second Rule|accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Allen put the rule to the test in an episode of ''[[Food Detectives]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food-detectives/the-5-second-rule/index.html|title=Food Detectives, Episode OF0101|accessdate=2011-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506142828/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food-detectives/the-5-second-rule/index.html|archivedate=2011-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that bacteria will cling to food immediately.  [[Vsauce]], a YouTube channel, also dedicated a video to this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYXdsOEWBj0|title=Is The 5-Second Rule True?|first=|last=Vsauce|date=30 November 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study could not verify the "rule" and looked at tile, wood, and carpet floors. It indicated that bacteria can survive on grounds for long time.&lt;ref name="DawsonHan2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anupriya |first1=P. |last2=Han |first2=I. |last3=Cox |first3=M. |last4=Black |first4=C. |last5=Simmons |first5=L. |title=Residence time and food contact time effects on transfer of Salmonella Typhimurium from tile, wood and carpet: testing the five-second rule|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology |volume=102 |issue=4 |year=2007|pages=945–953|issn=1364-5072|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.03171.x |pmid=17381737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 ''New York Times'' article states "You may think your floors are so clean you can eat off them, but a new study debunking the so-called five-second rule would suggest otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/science/five-second-rule.html|title=‘Five-Second Rule’ for Food on Floor Is Untrue, Study Finds|last=Mele|first=Christopher|date=2016-09-19|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-10|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a pediatrician discounted the danger in consuming certain foods dropped onto floors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/upshot/im-a-doctor-if-i-drop-food-on-the-kitchen-floor-i-still-eat-it.html Aaron Carroll, "I'm a doctor. If I drop food on the kitchen floor, I still eat it." ''New York Times,'' 10 Oct 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study, by biology students at [[Aston University]] in England, suggested that there may be a basis for the five-second rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aston.ac.uk/news/releases/2014/march/five-second-food-rule-does-exist/&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Hilton, head of microbiology at Aston University, indicated in 2017 that food dropped on a seemingly clean floor for a few moments can be eaten with minimal risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/five-second-rule-food-dropped-floor-germs-scientists-professor-anthony-hilton-aston-university-a7629391.html| author=Ryan Hooper| title=‘Five-second rule’ for food dropped on the floor approved by germ scientists| publisher=The Independent (UK)| date=March 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Stock''' is a [[biophysics|biophysicist]], best-selling [[author]], biotech [[entrepreneur]], and the former director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society at [[UCLA]]’s School of Medicine. His interests lie in the scientific and evolutionary as well as ethical, social and political implications of today's revolutions in the life sciences and in information technology and computers.

==Life, written works, and business career==

===Education===

He received an MBA from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1987, where he was a Baker Scholar and won the Freund-Porter Entrepreneurship award. Stock completed a [[doctorate]] in biophysics from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1977, where he received a BS and MS in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socgen.ucla.edu/pmts/Stock.htm UCLA Website: Gregory Stock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821043849/http://socgen.ucla.edu/pmts/Stock.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biotechnology and its impact on society===

He has written extensively on the implications for society, medicine and business of the [[human genome project]] and associated developments in [[molecular genetics]] and [[bioinformatics]]. The Storefront Genome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socgen.ucla.edu/About.html The Storefront Genome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706075214/http://www.socgen.ucla.edu/About.html |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the symposium he convened in January 2003 to consider the broad challenges that cheap, easy access to our genetic constitutions drew wide media attention, and his 1998 look at the possibilities of manipulating the genetics of human embryos, the first major public discussion of this issue among distinguished scientists, opened a global debate on this then taboo topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stock|first=Gregory|date=2004-07-06|title=From Regenerative Medicine to Human Design: What Are We Really Afraid Of?|url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/104454903770946656?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=dna|journal=DNA and Cell Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=11|pages=679–683|doi=10.1089/104454903770946656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biotech entrepreneur===
Stock was the CEO of [[Signum Biosciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signumbiosciences.com/about_signum.html Signum Biosciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321071610/http://www.signumbiosciences.com/about_signum.html |date=2009-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signum Biosciences is a private biotechnology company dedicated to developing small-molecule therapeutics derived from its Signal Transduction Modulation (STM) platform to modulate signal transduction imbalances. Through research on protein networks that control biological systems, Signum is developing therapeutic candidates for [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and certain skin conditions. Signum’s STM technology provides many opportunities for the development of novel consumer products and pharmaceutical candidates. Signum was founded on the science derived from basic research studying cellular signaling at the [[Princeton University]] laboratory of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715160210/http://w/ ww.molbio.princeton.edu/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=240 Dr. Jeffry Stock]

He sits on the editorial board of the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]'' and is in the department of Pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.ucla.edu/huge/gregory.html UCLA Center for Society and Genetics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418204614/http://www.ess.ucla.edu/huge/gregory.html |date=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the Board of Directors of Napo Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napopharma.com/people/Gregory_Stock_bd.html Napo Pharmaceuticals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215085914/http://www.napopharma.com/people/Gregory_Stock_bd.html |date=2011-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sits on the California Advisory Committee on Stem Cells and Reproductive Cloning and serves as the associate director for the [[Bioagenda Institute]] and the [[Center for Life Science Studies]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

Dr. Stock has been an invited speaker to many academic, government and business conferences. He makes regular appearances on television and radio, and has appeared on [[CNN]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week1051/interview2.html|title=August 17, 2007 ~ Gregory Stock {{!}} August 17, 2007 {{!}} Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly {{!}} PBS|date=2007-08-17|work=Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]] and the [[BBC]] in shows including [[Talk of the Nation]], [[Charlie Rose]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/2294 Gregory Stock on Charlie Rose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221123222/http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/2294 |date=2012-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Biotech Nation]] and [[Larry King]].

==Public policy and activities==

Stock was an early force in considering the implications of [[Human Germline Engineering|human germline engineering]] and human enhancement. Through the [[Program on Medicine, Technology and Society]], which he founded at the UCLA School of Medicine, he organized an influential 1998 conference at [[UCLA]]: "Engineering the Human Germline," which included a panel of [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], [[French Anderson]], [[Lee Hood]] and other major figures in the life sciences. The event, which attracted considerable media attention and opened up broad debate on what was then a largely taboo topic, was covered on the front page of the [[New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;Gina Kolata for the New York Times. March 21, 1998 [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/21/us/scientists-brace-for-changes-in-path-of-human-evolution.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Scientists Brace for Changes In Path of Human Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; Through another seminal UCLA conference, [[Milestones on Aging]], he organized, Stock helped legitimize research to significantly extend human longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agingresearch.org/content/article?page=6 Alliance for Aging Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126232044/http://www.agingresearch.org/content/article?page=6 |date=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 
event led to a follow conference he co-hosted at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] with Bruce Ames and Aubrey de Grey, who went on to found the [[Methuselah Foundation]], an organization that has aggressively promoted research on life extension. The activity of the MTS Program was also critical in establishing [[UCLA’s Center on Society and Genetics]], which actively explores broad policy issues in the genomics arena.

Stock is now primarily engaged in the development of new therapeutics at [[Signum Biosciences]], a biotech company he co-founded in 2003, but he remains active in the policy arena through UCLA's MTS Program, which he still directs, and the [[BioAgenda Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioagendaprograms.com/|title=BioAgenda|website=www.bioagendaprograms.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he is the associate director of, and through various public appearances and debates. Stock has presented diverse keynotes ranging from “The Coming Era of Personalized Medicine” at [[Medco Health Solutions|Medco]], “Trends in Health, Science and Nutrition” at the [[American Dietetic Association]], "The Future of Genomics and Healthcare" at [[Johnson and Johnson]], "The Coming Healthcare Revolution" at HIMS (Healthcare Information Management Society) and "The Evolution of the Biotech Revolution" at [[Applied Biosystems]] to "21st Century Opportunities and Challenges" at the [[World Future Society]], "Beauty, Health and Biotech: A Look Ahead" at [[Fashion Group International]], "Redesigning Humans: Best Hope, Worst Fear" at the TED (Technology, Education and Design) Conference, and "From Pharmacogenomics to Genetic Design" at the [[World Transhumanist Association]]. He has also been involved with broadcast media through guest appearances on shows such as the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary "Religion and Ethics: The Challenge and Ethics of Strong Biotechnology," debates on NPR's Talk of the Nation and Charlie Rose, via an online multimedia documentary he produced with funding from the Greenwall and Sloan Foundations entitled "Human Germline Engineering: Implications for Science and Society"(www.germline.ucla.edu), and in an ARTE documentary examining key figures in Biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.ucla.edu/huge/report.html Engineering the Human Germline Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513230801/http://www.ess.ucla.edu/huge/report.html |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (he also has a nephew named Jake Posl)

Stock's expertise in biotechnology, genetics and public policy in the life sciences led to his appointment on the California Advisory Committee on Stem Cells and Reproductive Cloning, Dept. of Health Services, [[State of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/services/boards/HSCR/Pages/default.aspx |title=Human Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee Information |access-date=2009-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528084218/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/services/boards/HSCR/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=2009-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==

Stock has always been a strong advocate for the aggressive implementation of new technology in the life sciences and he has publicly debated many leading figures in the bioethics community, including [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jeremy Rifkin]], [[Leon Kass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1141610|title=Biotechnology|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Annas]], [[Dan Callahan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8994837371721694774 Edmonton Aging Symposium Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill McKibben]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/C/2003552.html|title=New website features live webcast with Dr. Gregory Stock and Bill McKibben|website=www.scienceblog.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Sandel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanitas.org/resources/articles/articlesindex.htm#The%20Case%20Against%20Perfection|title=Resources -- Articles|website=humanitas.org|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">{{About|the psychological term|other uses|Identity crisis (disambiguation)|and|Personality crisis (disambiguation){{!}}Personality crisis}}
{{cleanup|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]], the term '''identity crisis''' means the failure to achieve ego [[Identity formation|identity]] during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Cherry, [http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/identitycrisis.htm Identity Crisis - Theory and Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "S216"&gt;(Schultz, 216)&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by German psychologist [[Erik Erikson]].

The [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stage of psychosocial development]] in which identity crisis may occur is called the Identity Cohesion vs. Role Confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"&gt;(Schultz, 215-216)&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|progress through previous developmental stages]], centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"/&gt;

Erikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born [[Ashkenazic Jewish]], Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the [[Yurok]] of northern California and the [[Sioux]] of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

==Concept==
{{Main article|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}

Sometimes individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to "find themselves". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

On the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. 

Erikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually "redistrict" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is [[fidelity]], which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

He described identity as "a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given &amp;mdash; that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals &amp;mdash; with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters."&lt;ref name = "E730"&gt;(Erikson, 730)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marcian theory==
{{Main article|James Marcia}}

James Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also apply to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents.

'''Identity foreclosure''' is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice.  "The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"&gt;James Marcia, [http://social.jrank.org/pages/322/Identity-Development.html Identity Development - Aspects of Identity]&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the "security blanket" of their assumed identity is removed.  These "foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed."&lt;ref&gt;Seth J. Scwartz, ''The Evolution of Eriksonian and Neo-Eriksonian Identity Theory and Research: A review and Integration''.  "Identity, An International Journal of Theory and Research", 2001 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news.

'''Identity diffusion''' is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents.  Identity diffusion can be described as "the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure.  An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes recluse after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury.

'''Identity moratorium''' is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as "the active exploration of alternatives".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"/&gt;  Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Schwartz, 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion.

'''Identity achievement''' is the resolution to many identity crises.  Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity."&lt;ref&gt;(Marcia)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Health Regulations (2005)''' are a legally binding instrument of international law that aim to a) assist countries to work together to save lives and livelihoods endangered by the international spread of diseases and other health risks, and b) avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel.

The purpose and scope of IHR 2005 are to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. (Art. 2, IHR (2005))

==History==

{{Empty section|date=February 2017}}

=== International Health Regulations Evolution - 1851 and cholera epidemic responses===
The International Health Regulations originated with the International Sanitary Regulations adapted at the [[International sanitary conferences|International Sanitary Conference]] in Paris in 1851. The cholera epidemics that hit Europe in 1830 and 1847 made apparent the need for international cooperation in public health.

===1948 and World Health Organization===
In 1948, the [[World Health Organization]] Constitution came about. The Twenty-Second World Health Assembly (1969) adopted, revised and consolidated the International Sanitary Regulations, which were renamed (in the English language only) the International Health Regulations (1969). The Twenty-Sixth World Health Assembly in 1973 amended the IHR (1969) in relation to provisions on cholera. In view of the global eradication of smallpox, the Thirty-fourth World Health Assembly amended the IHR (1969) to exclude smallpox in the list of notifiable diseases.

===1995 World Health Assembly===
During the Forty-Eighth World Health Assembly in 1995, WHO and Member States agreed on the need to revise the IHR (1969). The revision of IHR (1969) came about because of its inherent limitations, most notably:
* ''narrow scope of notifiable diseases'' ([[cholera]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]], [[yellow fever]]).[http://www.who.int/features/qa/39/en/index.html] The past few decades have seen the emergence and re-emergence of [[infectious disease]]s. The emergence of “new” infectious agents [[Ebola]] Hemorrhagic Fever in Zaire (modern- day Democratic Republic of Congo) and the re-emergence of cholera and plague in South America and India, respectively;
* ''dependence on official country notification''; and
* ''lack of a formal internationally coordinated mechanism'' to prevent the international spread of disease.

These challenges were placed against the backdrop of the increased travel and trade characteristic of the 20th century.

===International Health Regulations (2005)===
The IHR (2005) entered into force, generally, on 15 June 2007, and are currently binding on 196 States Parties, including all 194 Member States (countries) of WHO.

====The Principles Embodying the IHR (2005)====
The implementation of IHR (2005) shall be:
# With ''full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom'' of persons;
# Guided by the ''Charter of the [[United Nations]] and the Constitution of the World Health Organization'';
# Guided by the ''goal of their universal application for the protection of all people'' of the world from the international spread of disease;
# States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, ''the sovereign right to legislate and to implement legislation'' in pursuance of their health policies. In doing so, they should ''uphold the purpose of these Regulations''. (Art 3. IHR (2005))

===2010 Geneva meeting===
In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of [[Biological warfare|Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons]]  and Their Destruction in [[Geneva]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opbw.org/new_process/msp2010/BWC_MSP_2010_WP8_E.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance]] was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the IHR (2005) with the aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties. The significance of the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is pointed out in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents in the environmental sites, conducting laboratory analysis of biological materials, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.

=== Public Health Emergency of International Concern ===
A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. [1] This definition implies a situation that is:
* serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected;
* carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; and
* may require immediate international action.
Since 2007, the WHO Director-General has declared public health emergencies of international concern in response to the following: [2]

1) 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic

2) 2014 setbacks in polio global eradication efforts

3) 2014 west Africa Ebola epidemic

4) 2016 Zika virus outbreak

'''Criticism of International Health Regulations'''

Revisions to the International Health Regulations in 2005 were meant to lead to improved global health security and cooperation. However, the WHO’s perceived delayed and inadequate response to the west African Ebola Epidemic brought renewed international scrutiny to the International Health Regulations. Numerous published reports by high-level panels have assessed the International Health Regulations for inadequacies and proposed actions that can be taken to improve future responses to outbreaks. [3]

One publication reviewed seven of these major reports and identified areas of consensus on action. [4] The seven reports noted inadequate compliance with WHO’s International Health Regulations as a major contributor to the slow response to Ebola. They found three major obstacles that contributed to poor compliance: 1) countries’ core capacities, 2) unjustified trade and travel restrictions, and 3) inability to ensure that governments report outbreaks quickly.

·       Core Capacity

The IHR requires countries to assess their disease surveillance and response capacities and to identify if they can adequately meet their requirements. The seven Ebola reports universally agree that the country’s self-assessment capabilities are insufficient and that verification measures need to be improved upon. A significant problem is the inadequate level of core capacities in some countries, and the question of how to build upon them has been frequently raised. The reports make several recommendations to encourage governments to increase investment in outbreak identification and response programs. These include technical help from external sources conditional on mobilizing domestic resources, external financing for low income countries, pressure from the international community to increase investment, and considering outbreak preparedness as a factor in the International Monetary Fund’s country economic assessments, which influence governments’ budget priorities and access to capital markets.

·       Trade and Travel

The second issue frequently raised is ensuring that restrictions on trade and travel during outbreaks are justified. Because of increased attention and concern from the public and the media, many governments and private companies restricted trade and travel during the Ebola outbreak, though many of these measures were not necessary from a public health standpoint. These restrictions worsened financial repercussions and made the work of aid organizations sending support to affected regions more difficult.

There was broad consensus across the reports that bringing such restrictions to a minimum is critical to avoid further harm to countries experiencing outbreaks. Moreover, if governments assume that reporting will lead to inappropriate travel and trade restrictions, they may be hesitant to notify the international community about the outbreak. Potential solutions raised included the WHO and the UN more assertively “naming and shaming” countries and private companies that impose unjustified restrictions on WHO working with the World Trade Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and International Maritime Organization to develop standards and enforcement mechanisms for trade and travel restrictions.

·       Outbreak Reporting

The third compliance issue relates to countries’ obligation to rapidly report outbreaks. The reports recommend strengthening this obligation by WHO publicizing when countries delay reporting suspected outbreaks. In contrast, mechanisms ensuring that countries rapidly receive operational and financial support as soon as they do report were also recommended. A novel approach to encourage early notification is the World Bank’s Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. This was created to provide rapid financing for the control of outbreaks and to protect countries from the devastating economic effects of outbreaks via an insurance program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3809">This is a '''list of restaurant terminology'''. A [[restaurant]] is a [[business]] that prepares and serves food and drink to customers in return for money, either paid before the meal, after the meal, or with a running tab. Meals are generally served and eaten on premises, but many restaurants also offer [[take-out]] and [[Delivery (commerce)|food delivery services]]. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of the main chef's [[cuisine]]s and [[Customer service|service]] models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">'''Medical Laboratory Assistants''' ('''MLAs''') prepare, and in some cases process [[human sample|samples]] within a [[pathology]] laboratory. They also utilise pre-analytical systems in order for [[biomedical scientist]]s (BMS) or Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers to process the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] tests requested on the sample. The majority of an MLA's time is spent in processing [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s. As such, the MLA has to have excellent knowledge of their particular sample acceptance policy, whilst obeying the [[Data Protection Act 1998|data protection act]], [[Physician-patient privilege|patient confidentiality]], [http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/ COSHH] and the [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-information-governance-review Caldicott] rules.

Other duties an MLA may undertake include, setting up blood analyzers, running Quality Controls and manual controls prior to a BMS undertaking analysis on samples. Maintenance and decontamination is essential for the function of the machinery therefore MLAs carry out this role on a weekly or monthly basis.

A typical method of sample acceptance (in a clinical chemistry lab) is as follows:

# Sample is received.
# Sample is checked (to ensure that the sample is sent in the correct container for the specimen).
# Patient's details checked and matched on both form and sample (non-matching samples and/or forms rejected).
# Sample and form labelled with unique identifying number (UIN).
# Tests requested on form receipted onto UIN on computer system.
# Samples placed either on pre-analytical system by MLA or analysed immediately by BMS (dependent on test requested).
# UIN attached to patient using patient identifying details on form.

MLA's also deal with all sample queries and give low level advice to clinical staff on sample acceptance and correct sampling method. They may also do minor upkeep on the pre-analytical systems as well as further upkeep on some [[point of care]] analysers &amp;mdash; depending on the laboratory in which they are based.

==Requirements==

Requirements for a position of medical laboratory assistant vary from state to state, but they are generally as follows:

* Legal age (18+ years)
* High school diploma or equivalent
* State-approved training
* Successful completion of [[Medical assistant#Certification|certification exam]]

Medical laboratory assistants are required to have good analytical abilities and keen attention to detail. They must be able to work under pressure and display manual dexterity. Because they work with minute substances and [[technical equipment]], good [[Visual system|vision]] and computer skills are mandatory.

'''Medical foods''' are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/CFR101-9.HTML|title=CFR 21 Part 101 Subpart A|author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In Europe the [[European Food Safety Authority]] established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcome of a public consultation on the Draft Scientific and Technical Guidance of the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on foods for special medical purposes in the context of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2015.EN-904/pdf|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food for special medical purposes|url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/special_groups_food/medical_en|publisher=European Commission|language=en|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a [[health claim]], and from dietary supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:&lt;ref name="FDA2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food And Drug Administration Compliance Program Guidance Manual: Chapter 21 – Food Composition, Standards, Labeling And Economics|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/complianceenforcement/ucm073339.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA_1116"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Statutes &amp; Regulations on Dietary Treatment of Disorders Identified Through Newborn Screening November 2016|url=http://www.nccrcg.org/docs/NCC/ACA/Products/Dietary_Treament_Supplements_2016.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding ([[nasogastric tube]])
* be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
* be intended to be used under medical supervision.

Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:
*Nutritionally complete formulas
*Nutritionally incomplete formulas
*Formulas for metabolic disorders
*Oral rehydration products

==Regulation==
Medical foods are regulated by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act regulations.  21 CFR 101.9(j) (8).&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"/&gt;

The term medical food, as defined in section 5(b) of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm|title=Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information|first=Office of Regulatory|last=Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical foods are not required to undergo premarket review or approval by FDA. Additionally, they are exempted from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In 2016 the FDA published an update: Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition. Definitions and labeling requirements are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm|title=Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mythotherapy''' is a therapeutic method based on [[psychology]], [[mythology]], [[Cognitive Sciences]], [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]].

== Etymology and definitions ==
Mythotherapy is combined from two parts: the first part is mytho- which is the equivalent for  the word "myth" which itself is from French "mythe" (1818) and originally from "mythus" in [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] and its older form was the Greek "mythos" which means: speech, thought, story, [[myth]], anything delivered by word of mouth.&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So in Mythotherapy, myth has a very vast meaning and refers to, primarily, mythological texts and secondly, sacred texts. What is important in mythotherapy is the fundamental realms of human soul and spirit which contains [[archetypes]] and a very huge [[unconscious cognition|unconscious]] knowledge and wisdom. 
The second part, the suffix -logy comes from -logia (λογία) in Greek which means "study of" or "research".
Mythotherapy is an [[interdisciplinary]] therapeutic method which uses myths and sacred texts and mythological findings for therapy; and at the same time uses psychology, cognitive sciences, cognitive behavior therapy, anthropology, philosophy and ancient knowledge and wisdom for therapeutic intentions. Mythotherapy is also a method for knowing [[the Self]] and [[self-actualization]]

== History ==
In ancient cultures using myths and sacred texts as a therapeutic tool was known and applied. Also they used myths and sacred texts for teaching a child how to enter the adult world, especially during the [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In initiation, myths have a really important role to give the person the teachings a man needs for knowing the world, its mechanisms, human, and the [[Self]] and how to act in the world. 
In the ancient world they used myths to heal disease. In [[ancient Egypt]], for example, to cure an illness a physician who was at the same time a [[votary]] would start to narrate a special myth or a narration from a sacred text. This action would heal the person even in physical cases.&lt;ref&gt;Jung 1987&lt;/ref&gt;    
In modern psychology it was [[Carl Gustav Jung]] that for the first time noted this domain in a very vast, deep and practical way.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980 decade it was [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], the Jungian psychiatrist, who used myths as a way to discover the inner soul of men and women and a way to reach the unconscious of human.&lt;ref&gt;Bolen 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10262">The '''National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan''', more commonly called the '''National Contingency Plan''' or '''NCP''', is the [[United States federal government]]'s blueprint for responding to [[oil spill]]s and [[hazardous substance]] releases. It documents national response capability and is intended to promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans.&lt;ref name=EPAEM&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/ncpover.htm National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan Overview], [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. Accessed November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first National Contingency Plan was developed and published in 1968, in response to a massive oil spill from the oil tanker [[Torrey Canyon]], off the coast of [[England]] a year earlier. More than 37 million gallons of [[crude oil]] spilled into the water and caused massive environmental damage. To avoid the problems faced by response officials involved in the incident, US officials developed a coordinated approach to cope with potential spills in US waters. The 1968 plan provided the first comprehensive system of accident reporting, spill containment, and cleanup. It also established a response headquarters, a national reaction team, and regional reaction teams (precursors to the current National Response Team and Regional Response Teams).&lt;ref name="EPAEM" /&gt;

Congress has broadened the scope of the National Contingency Plan over the years. As required by the Clean Water Act of 1972, the NCP was revised the following year to include a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills and oil discharges. Following the passage of [[Superfund]] legislation in 1980, the NCP was broadened to cover releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions. Over the years, additional revisions have been made to the NCP to keep pace with the enactment of legislation. The latest revisions to the NCP were finalized in 1994 to reflect the oil spill provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.&lt;ref name="EPAEM" /&gt;

Under the National Contingency Plan, federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for addressing oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants; coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with one another coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with affected states, local governments, and private entities; and make available those facilities or resources that may be useful in a response situation, consistent with agency authorities and capabilities.&lt;ref name="Ref04"&gt;''40 CFR 300.105(a)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a response has been triggered, the USCG or USEPA "is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil or
CWA hazardous substance is discharged or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable
waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States."&lt;ref name="Ref05"&gt;''40 CFR 300.125(b)''&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) "directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release."&lt;ref name="Ref06"&gt;''40 CFR 300.120(a)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major revisions==

* 1968 Initial plan&lt;ref name="EPAEM" /&gt;
* 1973 Added provisions for hazardous substances&lt;ref name="EPAEM" /&gt;
* 1980 (circa) revised to reflect CERCLA provisions&lt;ref name="EPAEM" /&gt;
* 1990 Revised and reorganized to reflect SARA provisions&lt;ref name="Ref02"&gt;''55 FR 8666'', May 8, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1994 Revised to reflect OPA revisions&lt;ref name="Ref03"&gt;''59 FR 47384'', September 15, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in BP oil spill==
The plan places responsibility for [[command and control]] in managing serious disaster response with the [[US federal government]] and not a private company like [[BP]], according to a 2010 article in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)]]'' about the [[BP Gulf oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Dickinson [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/111965?RS_show_page=6 The Spill, The Scandal and the President; The inside story of how Obama failed to crack down on the corruption of the Bush years – and let the world's most dangerous oil company get away with murder] Rolling Stone June 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==
Section 300.110 establishes the National Response Team and its roles and responsibilities in the National Response system, including planning and coordinating responses to major discharges of oil or hazardous waste, providing guidance to Regional Response Teams, co-ordinating a national program of preparedness planning and response, and facilitating research to improve response activities. The EPA serves as the lead agency within the National Response Team (NRT). 

Section 300.115 establishes the Regional Response Teams and their roles and responsibilities in the National Response System, including, coordinating preparedness, planning, and response at the regional level. The RRT consists of a standing team made up of representatives of each federal agency that is a member of the Net, state and local government representatives, and also an incident-specific team, made up of members of the standing team that is activated for a response. The RRT also provides oversight and consistency review for area plans within a given region.

Section 300.120 establishes general responsibilities of federal On-Scene Coordinators.

Section 300.125(a) requires notification of any discharge or release to the National Response Center through a [[toll-free telephone number]]. The National Response Center (NRC) acts as the central clearinghouse for all pollution incident reporting.

Section 300.135(a) authorizes the predesignated On-Scene Coordinator to direct all federal, state, and private response activities at the site of a discharge.

Section 300.135(d) establishes the unified command structure for managing responses to discharges through coordinated personnel and resources of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party.

Section 300.165 requires the On-Scene Coordinator to submit to the RRT or the NRT a report on all removal actions taken at a site.

Section 300.170 identifies the responsibilities for federal agencies that may be called upon during response planning and implementation to provide assistance in their respective areas of expertise consistent with the agencies' capabilities and authorities.

Section 300.175 lists the federal agencies that have duties associated with responding to releases.

Section 300.210 defines the objectives, authority, and scope of Federal Contingency Plans, including the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Regional Contingency Plans (RCPs), and Area Contingency Plans (ACPs).

Section 300.317 establishes national priorities for responding to a release.

Section 300.320 establishes the general pattern of response to be executed by the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), including determination of threat, classification of the size and type of the release, notification of the RRT and the NRC, and supervision of thorough removal actions.

Section 300.322 authorizes the OSC to determine whether a release poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States based on several factors, including the size and character of the discharge and its proximity to human populations and sensitive environments. In such cases, the OSC is authorized to direct all federal, state, or private response and recovery actions. The OSC may enlist the support of other federal agencies or special teams.

Section 300.323 provides special consideration to discharges which have been classified as a spill of national significance. In such cases, senior federal officials direct nationally-coordinated response efforts.

Section 300.324 requires the OSC to notify the National Strike Force Coordination Center (NSFCC) in the event of worst case discharges, defined as the largest foreseeable discharge in adverse weather conditions. The NSFCC coordinates the acquisition of needed response personnel and equipment. The OSC also must require implementation of the worst case portion of the tank vessel and Facility Response Plans and the Area Contingency Plan.

Section 300.355 provides funding for responses to oil releases under the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, provided certain criteria are met. The responsible party is liable for federal removal costs and damages as detailed in section 1002 of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA). Federal agencies assisting in a response action may be reimbursed. Several other federal agencies may provide financial support for removal actions.

Subpart J establishes the NCP Product Schedule, which contains dispersants and other chemical or biological products that may be used in carrying out the NCP. Authorization for the use of these products is conducted by Regional Response Teams and Area Committees or by the OSC, in consultation with EPA representatives.

Section 300.415(b) authorizes the lead agency to initiate appropriate removal action in the event of a hazardous substance release. Decisions of action will be based on threats to human or animal populations, contamination of drinking water supplies or sensitive ecosystems, high levels of hazardous substances in soils, weather conditions that may cause migration or release of hazardous substances, the threat of fire or explosion, or other significant factors affecting the health or welfare or the public or the environment.

Section 300.415(c) authorizes the OSC to direct appropriate actions to mitigate or remove the release of hazardous substances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">'''Non-protein nitrogen''' (or NPN) is a term used in animal nutrition to refer collectively to components such as [[urea]], [[biuret]], and [[ammonia]], which are not proteins but can be converted into proteins by [[microbes]] in the [[ruminant]] stomach. Due to their lower cost compared to plant and animal [[proteins]] their inclusion in a diet can result in economic gain, but at too high levels cause a depression in growth and possible ammonia toxicity (microbes convert NPN to ammonia first before using that to make protein.) NPN can also be used to artificially raise [[Protein_(nutrient)#Testing_in_foods|crude protein]] values, which are measured based on nitrogen content, as protein is about 16% nitrogen, but, for example, urea is 47% nitrogen. The source of NPN is typically a chemical feed additive, or sometimes chicken waste&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.fass.org/cgi/reprint/43/1/201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/3/706&lt;/ref&gt; and cattle manure.&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/1/144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.fass.org/cgi/reprint/57/Supplement_2/221.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''operational definition''' is the articulation of [[operationalization]] (or statement of procedures) used in defining the terms of a process (or set of [[Formal verification|validation tests]]) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], [[terminology|term]], or [[object (philosophy)|object]]) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, [[chemical composition]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Adanza, Estela G. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yNmTHbQiPEUC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Research methods: Principles and Applications''] p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevilla, Consuelo G. ''et al.'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SK18tR3vTucC&amp;pg=PA20 ''Research methods''], revised edition p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a [[Levels of measurement#Ordinal scale|more or less]] operational definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoemaker, Pamela J.|title=How to build social pyramid |publisher=SAGE |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7619-2667-2 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKs83Ypq5KgC&amp;pg=PA29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by [[peer review|peers]].

An example of operational definition of the term ''weight'' of an object, operationalized to a degree, would be the following: "weight is the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a [[weighing scale]]". According to it, the weight can be any of the numbers shown on the scale after, including the very moment the object is put on it. Clearly, the inclusion of the moment when one can start reading the numbers on the scale would make it more fully an operational definition. Nonetheless, it is still in contrast to those purely [[theoretical definition]]s.

[[File:Pbnjmpegman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An operational definition can, when operationalized to a greater degree, besides the procedure needed to bring something into existence, include also [[measurement|measuring]] the stuff, time sequences at which every step should be done, and the duration of each step.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Simply stating that a [[peanut butter]] sandwich might be ''"the result of putting peanut butter on a slice of bread with a butter knife and laying a second equally sized slice of vegan milk on top"'' is only [[operationalization|operationalized]] to a degree.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Besides such a simple [[recipe]] as the one for making the sandwich, the [[sheet music]] is another example of definitions that are operationalized to a certain degree.]]

==Overview==
Properties described in this manner must be sufficiently accessible so that people other than the definer may independently measure or test for them at will.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} An operational definition is generally designed to model a [[theoretical definition]].
The most operational definition is a process for [[Identity (philosophy)|identification]] of an object by distinguishing it from its background of empirical experience.

The binary version produces either the result that the object exists, or that it doesn't, in the experiential field to which it is applied. The [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] version results in discrimination between what is part of the object and what is not part of it. This is also discussed in terms of [[semantics]], [[pattern recognition]], and operational techniques, such as [[Calibration (statistics)|regression]].

Operationalize means to put into operation or use. Operational definitions are also used to define system states in terms of a specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/validation|title=the definition of validation|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;testing, which is repeatable at will. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be crudely defined by describing the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil. An item like a brick, or even a photograph of a brick, may be defined in terms of how it can be made. Likewise, iron may be defined in terms of the results of testing or measuring it in particular ways.

Vandervert (1980/1988) described in scientific detail a simple, everyday illustration of an operational definition in terms of making a cake (i.e., its recipe is an operational definition used in a specialized laboratory known as the household kitchen).&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, L. (1988). Operational definitions made simple, useful, and lasting. In M. Ware &amp; C. Brewer (Eds.), Handbook for teaching statistics and research methods (pp.&amp;nbsp;132–134). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. (Original work published 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the saying, ''if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be some kind of duck'', may be regarded as involving a sort of measurement process or set of tests (see [[duck test]]).

==Application==
Despite the controversial [[philosophical]] origins of the concept, particularly its close association with [[logical positivism]], operational definitions have undisputed practical applications. This is especially so in the social and medical sciences, where operational definitions of key terms are used to preserve the unambiguous empirical testability of hypothesis and theory. Operational definitions are also important in the [[physical sciences]].

===Philosophy===
The ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' entry on scientific realism, written by [[Richard Boyd]], indicates that the modern concept owes its origin in part to [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], who felt that the expression of scientific concepts was often abstract and unclear. Inspired by [[Ernst Mach]],  in 1914 Bridgman attempted to redefine unobservable entities concretely in terms of the physical and mental operations used to measure them.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Richard|title=Scientific Realism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/scientific-realism/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the definition of each unobservable entity was uniquely identified with the instrumentation used to define it. From the beginning objections were raised to this approach, in large part around the inflexibility. As Boyd notes, "In actual, and apparently reliable, scientific practice, changes in the instrumentation associated with theoretical terms are routine, and apparently crucial to the progress of science. According to a 'pure' operationalist conception, these sorts of modifications would not be methodologically acceptable, since ''each'' definition must be considered to identify a ''unique'' 'object' (or class of objects)."&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt; However, this rejection of operationalism as a general project destined ultimately to define all experiential phenomena uniquely did not mean that operational definitions ceased to have any practical use or that they could not be applied in particular cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Science===
The [[theory of relativity|special theory of relativity]] can be viewed as the introduction of operational definitions for [[relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity of events]] and of [[length contraction|distance]], that is, as providing the operations needed to define these terms.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |title=Special relativity |author=NMJ Woodhouse |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA58,M1 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |publisher=Springer |location=London |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]] the notion of operational definitions is closely related to the idea of [[observables]], that is, definitions based upon what can be measured.&lt;ref name=Isham&gt;{{cite book |title=Lectures on Quantum Theory |author= C. J. Isham |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR3sS2hEFzcC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=observable+operational+definition+quantum|isbn=1-86094-001-3 |publisher=Imperial College Press |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite book |title=Hilbert Space Operators in Quantum Physics |author1=Jiří Blank |author2=Pavel Exner |author3=Miloslav Havlíček |isbn=1-56396-142-3 |publisher=Springer |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0BSIoGXHLQC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=observable+operational+definition+quantum|page=252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational definitions are often most challenging in the fields of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]], where intuitive concepts, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as [[IQ test]]s.

===Business===
On October 15, 1970, the [[West Gate Bridge]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] collapsed, killing 35 construction workers. The subsequent enquiry found that the failure arose because engineers had specified the supply of a quantity of ''flat steel plate.'' The word ''flat'' in this context lacked an operational definition, so there was no test for accepting or rejecting a particular shipment or for controlling quality.

In his managerial and statistical writings, [[W. Edwards Deming]] placed great importance on the value of using operational definitions in all agreements in business. As he said:

::"An '''operational definition''' is a procedure agreed upon for translation of a concept into measurement of some kind." – W. Edwards Deming

::"There is no true value of any characteristic, state, or condition that is defined in terms of measurement or observation. Change of procedure for measurement (change of '''operational definition''') or observation produces a new number." – W. Edwards Deming

===General process===
'''Operational''', in a process context, also can denote a working method or a philosophy that focuses principally on cause and effect relationships (or stimulus/response, behavior, etc.) of specific interest to a particular domain at a particular point in time. As a working method, it does not consider issues related to a domain that are more general, such as the [[ontological]], etc.

=== In computing ===
Science uses computing. Computing uses science. We have seen the development of Computer Science. There are not many who can bridge all three of these. One effect is that, when results are obtained using a computer, the results can be impossible to replicate if the code is poorly documented, contains errors, or if parts are omitted entirely. &lt;ref&gt;Collberg, C., Roebsting, T. (2016) "Repeability in Computer Systems Research" Communications of the ACM, Vol. 59, No. 3, pages 62–69 (via [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198873-repeatability-in-computer-systems-research/abstract acm.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

Many times, issues are related to persistence and clarity of use of variables, functions, and so forth. Also, systems dependence is an issue. In brief, length (as a standard) has matter as its definitional basis. What pray tell can be used when standards are to be computationally framed?

Hence, operational definition can be used within the realm of the interactions of humans with advanced computational systems. In this sense, one area of discourse deals with computational thinking in, and with how it might influence, the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"Computational Thinking in Science" American Scientist, Jan/Feb 2017 (via [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2017/1/computational-thinking-in-science My American Scientist])&lt;/ref&gt; To quote the American Scientist: 
* The computer revolution has profoundly affected how we think about science, experimentation, and research.

One referenced project pulled together fluid experts, including some who were expert in the numeric modeling related to computational fluid dynamics, in a team with computer scientists. Essentially, it turned out that the computer guys did not know enough to weigh in as much as they would have liked. Thus, their role, to their chagrin, many times was "mere" programmer.

Some [[knowledge-based engineering]] projects experienced similarly that there is a trade-off between trying to teach programming to a domain expert versus getting a programmer to understand the intricacies of a domain. That, of course, depends upon the domain. In short, any team member has to decide which side of the coin to spend one's time.

The International Society for Technology in Education has a brochure detailing an "operational definition" of computational thinking. At the same time, the ISTE made an attempt at defining related skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Operational Definition of Computational Thinking" (for K–12 Education) 2011 (via [http://www.iste.org/docs/ct-documents/computational-thinking-operational-definition-flyer.pdf website])&lt;/ref&gt;

A recognized skill is tolerance for ambiguity and being able to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a [[knowledge-based engineering]] system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the [[subject matter expert]], thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the [[duck test]]'s necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by [[simulation]] or [[artifact (observational)|artifact]], working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.

In advanced modeling, with the requisite computational support such as knowledge-based engineering, mappings must be maintained between a real-world object, its abstracted counterparts as defined by the domain and its experts, and the computer models. Mismatches between domain models and their computational mirrors can raise issues that are apropos to this topic. Techniques that allow the flexible modeling required for many hard problems must resolve issues of identity, type, etc. which then lead to methods, such as duck typing. Many domains, with a [[Numerical analysis|numerics]] focus, use limit theory, of various sorts, to overcome the duck test necessity with varying degrees of success. Yet, with that, issues still remain as representational frameworks bear heavily on what we can know.

In arguing for an object-based methodology, Peter Wegner&lt;ref&gt;Wegner, P. () "Beyond Computable Functions" ''Specification of Parallel Algorithms'' Page 37 American Mathematical Society (via [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg5RyQ1bcPYC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google])&lt;/ref&gt;  suggested that "positivist scientific philosophies, such as operationalism in [[physics]] and behaviorism in psychology" were powerfully applied in the early part of the 20th century. However, computation has changed the landscape. He notes that we need to distinguish four levels of "irreversible physical and computational abstraction" (Platonic abstraction, computational approximation, functional abstraction, and value computation). Then, we must rely on interactive methods, that have behavior as their focus (see duck test).

==Examples==

===Temperature===
The thermodynamic definition of [[temperature]], due to [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], refers to heat "flowing" between "infinite reservoirs". This is all highly abstract and unsuited for the day-to-day world of science and trade. In order to make the idea concrete, temperature is defined in terms of operations with the gas thermometer. However, these are sophisticated and delicate instruments, only adapted to the national standardization laboratory.

For day-to-day use, the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS) is used, defining temperature in terms of characteristics of the several specific sensor types required to cover the full range. One such is the [[electrical resistance]] of a [[thermistor]], with specified construction, [[calibration|calibrated]] against operationally defined fixed points.

===Electric current===
[[Electric current]] is defined in terms of the [[force]] between two [[infinity|infinite]] [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] conductors, separated by a specified distance. This definition is too abstract for practical measurement, so a device known as a [[current balance]] is used to define the [[ampere]] operationally.

===Mechanical hardness===
Unlike [[temperature]] and [[electric current]], there is no abstract physical concept of the [[hardness]] of a material. It is a slightly vague, subjective idea, somewhat like the idea of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. In fact, it leads to three more specific ideas:

# Scratch hardness measured on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs' scale]];
# Indentation hardness; and
# Rebound, or dynamic, hardness measured with a [[Shore scleroscope]].

Of these, indentation hardness itself leads to many operational definitions, the most important of which are:

# [[Brinell hardness test]] – using a 10&amp;nbsp;mm steel ball;
# [[Vickers hardness test]] – using a pyramidal diamond indenter; and
# [[Rockwell hardness test]] – using a diamond cone indenter.

In all these, a process is defined for loading the indenter, measuring the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each of these three sequences of measurement operations produces numbers that are consistent with our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.

===The constellation Virgo===
{{See also|Axial precession}}
The [[Virgo (constellation)|constellation Virgo]] is a specific constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky ''is'' repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that we are talking about the ''same'' Virgo), and any number may be operational.

===Academic discipline===
New [[academic discipline]]s appear in response to [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] activity at universities. An academic suggested the following operational definition for when a new discipline is recognized:
:'''Discipline''' is a term used to describe a subject matter area when there are more than approximately a dozen university departments using the same name for roughly the same subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1977) "Interdisciplinary science on campus – the elusive dream", [[Chemical and Engineering News]] 55(35): 28–40&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phulwara oil''' is extracted from seeds of Phulwara tree ([[Diploknema butyracea]]; family [[Sapotaceae]]). Phulwara Trees are also known locally as Chiuri Trees, Kaeleb Trees, or Butter Nut Trees. Refined Phulwara Oil is marketed as Phulwara Ghee.

==Habitat==
The Phulwara Tree is a tree native to Nepal and adjoining areas of India. It grows in the sub-[[Himalayas|Himalayan]] tract between 300 and 1500 meters above sea level. 

The tree also grows in the Andaman Islands.

==Tree==
The Phulwara is a medium-size [[deciduous tree]] with a straight [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]. It typically attains a height of 15 to 22 [[meter]]s and a girth of 1.5 to 1.8 meters. In the [[Andaman Islands]] it can reach a [[height]] of 21 to 36 meters and a girth of 1.5 to 2.4 meters. In the hills of [[Kumaon division|Kumaun]], the tree attains a girth of 3 meters. The bark is dark grey or brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novodboard.com/Cheer-Eng.pdf|title=cheura|publisher=novodboard.com|date=|accessdate=2013-11-22}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree typically begins to yield fruits after five to nine years, reaching full potential in about fifteen years.  It can  yield fruits for fifty to sixty years.&lt;ref name="manorama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramagroup.co.in/speciality_fats_phulwara.html|title=PHULWARA|publisher=manoramagroup.co.in|date=|accessdate=2013-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015144830/http://www.manoramagroup.co.in/speciality_fats_phulwara.html|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaves===

The leaves form clusters at the end of branches that may be pink or white in color. Normally, they are elliptically shaped, and are 20 to 35&amp;nbsp;mm long by 9 to 18&amp;nbsp;cm width.

===Flowers===

The flowers, which are 2.0 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, are white or pale yellow in color and have a sweet fragrance.

===Fruit===

The fruit is an oval shaped berry, 2.0 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The fruit has a bright shiny green or blackish skin. The pericarp is thick and soft. The fruit ripens during the months of May and August. The fruit is sweet and edible, containing 8.5% sugars &amp; 5.6% crude fiber.

The seed constitutes twenty percent of the fruit.&lt;ref name="manorama"/&gt;  Typically three seeds are present in a single fruit. The seeds are black and sparkling, 1.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm in length, with an almond shaped white kernel containing saponins. The seed coat varies from thin to thick and woody to crusty. The seeds contain 42-47% oil and the kernel contains 60-66% oil. 100 seeds weigh approximately 78 grams. The average annual fruit yield per tree is about {{convert|100|to|250|kg|lb}}.

==Seed collection==
Ripened Phulwara fruits are collected by hand or by beating the plant with long [[bamboo]] sticks. The harvested fruits are dried in shade for eight to twelve days. Seeds can be separated from fruits either manually or mechanically. If the quantity of fruits is relatively small, the fruits are crushed manually and the seeds separated. For larger quantities, a roller machine is used for seed extraction. The machine sequences the fruit through trays, collecting fresh fruit at one end and the seeds at the lower end.

==Oil extraction==
Oil is extracted from the kernel of Phulwara seeds. The outer shell of seeds is removed by adopting traditional or mechanical methods. In the traditional method, the seeds are boiled in water and softened seeds are placed on the floor and pressed until the kernels come out. In the mechanical system, the shell of the seed is removed by a [[decorticator]] machine.

After cleaning and drying, the seeds are pounded into a fine powder using a traditional pounder called [[Dhiki]]. The powder is steamed on a perforated plate over a boiling pan. Oil is then extracted using a traditional oil expeller known locally as [[Chepuwa]].&lt;ref name="candle"/&gt;

==Properties of oil==
The oil has a bitter taste due to impurities such as saponins, which accompany the extracted fat. Post-extraction filtration or purification is necessary for the ghee to become edible.

'''Composition of fatty acids'''

Phulwara oil contains 56.6% palmitic acid and 3.6% stearic acid, both of which are [[saturated fatty acid]]s.It also contains 36.0% oleic acid along with 3.8% linoleic acid, both of which are unsaturated fatty acids. Oleic acid is a mono-[[unsaturated fatty acid]] and has one double bond at the 9th carbon of its hydrocarbon chain. Linoleic acid has two double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain of the acid.

== Uses of oil ==
Phulwara ghee is the main source of edible oil for more than one hundred thousand people. The Ghee is used to cook vegetables and roti (Nepali bread).

Chiuri butter is used in [[confectionery]], [[pharmaceutical]], vegetable ghee production, candle manufacturing and [[soap]] making. It has been found to be effective for [[rheumatism]]. It is also used as an additive in animal ghee.&lt;ref name="candle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appropedia.org/Chiuri_-_the_Butter_Tree_of_Nepal_(Practical_Action_Brief)|title=Chiuri - the Butter Tree of Nepal |publisher=appropedia.org/|date=|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picnic in Columbus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|A picnic party assembling in [[Columbus, Ohio]], c. 1950]]
A '''picnic''' is a [[meal]] taken outdoors ([[Al fresco dining|''al fresco'']]) as part of an [[excursion]] – ideally in scenic surroundings, such as a park, lakeside, or other place affording an interesting view, or else in conjunction with a public event such as preceding an open-air theatre performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.picnicbasketshop.com/beautiful-picnic-locations-around-world/|title=Beautiful Picnic Locations Around The World|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and usually in summer.

Picnics are usually meant for the late mornings or midday breakfasts, but could also be held as a luncheonette or a dinner event.
Descriptions of picnics show that the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed and was enjoyed out-of-doors was essential to a picnic from the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen W. Hern, "Picnicking in the Northeastern United States, 1840-1900", ''Winterthur Portfolio'' '''24'''.2/3 (Summer - Autumn 1989), pp. 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picnics are often family oriented but can also be an intimate occasion between two people or a large get together such as company picnics and church picnics. It is also sometimes combined with a cookout, usually a form of [[barbecue]]: either [[grilling]] ([[griddle|griddling]], [[gridiron (cooking)|gridironing]], or [[charbroiling]]), [[braising]] (by combining a charbroil or gridiron grill with a broth-filled pot), [[baking]], or a combination of all of the above.

On romantic and family picnics, a [[picnic basket]] and a blanket (to sit or recline on) are usually brought along. Outdoor games or some other form of entertainment are common at large picnics.  In established public parks, a '''picnic area''' generally includes [[picnic table]]s and possibly other items related to eating outdoors, such as built-in [[grill (cooking)|grill]]s, [[tap water|water faucets]], garbage containers, and [[restroom]]s.

Some picnics are a [[potluck]], an entertainment at which each person contributed some dish to a common table for all to share. When the picnic is not also a cookout, the food eaten is rarely hot, instead taking the form of [[Delicatessen|deli]] sandwiches, [[finger food]], fresh fruit, salad, cold meats and accompanied by chilled wine or [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[soft drink]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:François lemoyne - piquenique durante a caçada 03-1.jpg|thumb|''Hunt Picnic'' by [[François Lemoyne]], 1723]]
The first usage of the word is traced to the 1692 edition of Tony Willis, ''Origines de la Langue Française'', which mentions ''pique-nique'' as being of recent origin; it marks the first appearance of the word in print. The term was used to describe a group of people dining in a restaurant who brought their own wine. The concept of a picnic long retained the connotation of a meal to which everyone contributed something. Whether ''picnic'' is actually based on the verb ''piquer'' which means 'pick' or 'peck' with the rhyming ''nique'' meaning "thing of little importance" is doubted; the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says it is of unknown provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/picnic| Oxford English Dictionary, "picnic"]&lt;/ref&gt;Though the provenance of the word ‘picnic’ is unknown, it is believed to come from the French ‘pique-nique’, which referred to people who brought their own wine while dining at a restaurant.

Picnicking was common in France after the French Revolution, when it became possible for ordinary people to visit and mingle in the country’s royal parks. In 18th and 19th centuries, picnics were elaborate social events with complex meals and fancy drinks that sometimes took days to prepare.

The word ''picnic'' first appeared in English in a letter of the Gallicized [[Lord Chesterfield]] in 1748 (''OED''), who associates it with card-playing, drinking and conversation, and may have entered the English language from this French word.&lt;ref&gt;The German ''Picknick'', not part of Lord Chesterfield's cultural sphere, may simply be a parallel borrowing from the French word, ''pique-nique''.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of an elegant meal eaten out-of-doors, rather than an agricultural worker's dinner in a field, was connected with respite from hunting from the [[Middle Ages]]; the excuse for the pleasurable outing of 1723 in [[François Lemoyne]]'s painting (''illustration, left'') is still offered in the context of a hunt.

Though it may have appeared in a 17th-century dictionary as "pique-nique," the actual usage began as "pique un niche" meaning to "pick a place," an isolated spot (a nest) where family or friends could enjoy a jolly meal together away from the distractions, demands, and public nature of a communal life.  The term morphed into "pique-nique" and after years of usage entered the official French language.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book|title=Dictionnaire étymologique, ou Origines de la langue françoise|location=Paris|editor=Jean Anisson|year=1694|page=580|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8704524p/f702}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book|title=Dictionnaire de l'Académie françoise | edition=3|volume=2|location=Paris|editor=Jean-Baptiste Coignard|year=1740|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k50402s/f342|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having been thoroughly debunked, a spurious etymology linking the origin of the word to lynchings of African-Americans in the American South continues to resurface from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/language/offense/picnic.asp|title=The Word 'Picnic' Originated with Lynchings?|date=2017-01-21|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related historical events ==
After the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, royal parks became open to the public for the first time. Picnicking in the parks became a popular activity amongst the newly [[Suffrage|enfranchised]] citizens.

Early in the 19th century, a fashionable group of Londoners (including [[Edwin Young]]) formed the '[[Picnic Society]]'. Members met in the [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]] on [[Oxford Street]]. Each member was expected to provide a share of the entertainment and of the refreshments with no one particular host. Interest in the society waned in the 1850s as the founders died.&lt;ref&gt;English picnics are described in Georgina Battiscombe (1949). ''English picnics''. London: Harvill Press; there is also a ''National Trust Book of Picnics'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1830s, Romantic American landscape painting of spectacular scenery often included a group of picnickers in the foreground. An early American illustration of the picnic is [[Thomas Cole]]'s ''The Pic-Nic'' of 1846 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hern, Mary Ellen W. |title=Picnicking in the Northeastern United States, 1840-1900|journal=Winterthur Portfolio'' '''24'''.2/3|date=Summer–Autumn 1989|pages=139–152 (Fig. 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, a guitarist serenades the genteel social group in the [[Hudson River Valley]] with the [[Catskills]] visible in the distance. Cole's well-dressed young picnickers having finished their repast, served from splint baskets on blue-and-white china, stroll about in the woodland and boat on the lake.

The image of picnics as a peaceful social activity can be utilised for political protest, too. In this context, a picnic functions as a temporary occupation of significant public territory. A famous example of this is the [[Pan-European Picnic]] held on both sides of the Hungarian/Austrian border on the 19 August 1989 as part of the struggle towards [[German reunification]].

In 2000, a 600-mile-long picnic took place from coast to coast in France to celebrate the first [[Bastille Day]] of the new Millennium. In the United States, likewise, the [[Independence Day (United States)|4 July]] celebration of [[United States Declaration of Independence|American independence]] is a popular day for a picnic. In Italy,  the favorite picnic day is [[Easter Monday]].

The '''pink tax''' is a phenomenon often attributed as a form of gender-based price [[discrimination]], with the name stemming from the observation that many of the affected products are pink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Products marketed specifically toward women are generally more expensive than those marketed for men, despite either gender's choice to purchase either product. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs conducted a study that concludes that women's products are typically more expensive than men's for often reasonable cause. There are many causes of this discrepancy, including the [[tampon tax]], [[product differentiation]], and the belief that women are less [[Price elasticity of demand|price elastic]] than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/pink-tax-means-women-are-paying-43-more-for-their-toiletries-than-men|title=‘Pink tax’ has women paying 43% more for their toiletries than men|date=2016-04-26|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products marketed specifically toward women cost on average 7% more than products marketed toward men, according to a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs study.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf.|title=From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being A Female Consumer|last=de Blasio|first=Bill|date=|website=NYC DCA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy applies to apparel, toys, and healthcare products, among other things. In the toy sector, girls' toys cost on average 7% more than boys' toys.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The study talked about a side-by-side comparison of a [[Radio Flyer]] scooter where the red scooter costs $24.99 and a pink scooter, identical in all ways but color, costs $49. In children's apparel, girls' clothes were 4% more expensive than boys.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Men's clothing was 8% less expensive than women's clothes. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}The largest discrepancy came to personal care/hygiene products, where women's products cost 13% more than men's.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study found women's products often being smaller in volume.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-things-women-pay-more-for-than-men-2014-01-17|title=6 times it’s more expensive to be a woman|last=Hill|first=Catey|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
There are many reasons why the pink tax exists, including [[tariff]]s, product discrimination, and product differentiation. Clothing made for women and men are taxed at different levels when first entering the United States.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/business/28gender.html|title=In Apparel, All Tariffs Aren’t Created Equal|last=Barbaro|first=Michael|date=2007-04-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some tariffs are higher for men's clothing, others are higher for women's. In 2018, clothing companies sought to get tariffs on clothing removed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Their reasoning suggested these tariffs, while enlarging the gender gap, also put clothing companies at a disadvantage when operating overseas, but only in certain types of clothing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} They maintained that those tariffs hurt the clothing industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Product differentiation can account for a portion of the difference between prices of men's goods and women's goods. Products like the Radio Flyer scooter may cost more due to the cost of slightly changing the product. For example, a pink scooter may cost more than a red scooter because it is more expensive to paint a scooter pink than red- assumedly, such a large difference for this reason of production would be because the red scooters are the larger production, and pink scooters are in the minority. They may also be seen as more of a "special edition", like camo-print trampolines. This also applies to services like haircuts or dry cleaning. Oftentimes, women's haircuts cost more than men's. Salons say that, because women's haircuts can involve more time and are labor-intensive than men's, they need to price haircuts for women higher than for men. In [[dry cleaning]], men's clothing tends to be more uniform, women's clothing has a lot of variability which can make it harder to clean. Women's clothes are often smaller and more tapered, which means they are not suited for pressing machines at the dry cleaners.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/03/27/pink-tax-forces-women-pay-more-than-men/99462846/|title='Pink Tax' forces women to pay more than men|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason those who campaign against the pink tax claim it to be so problematic is alleged product discrimination. Critics say women's and men's razors are essentially the same and distinguishing between them is simply a [[marketing strategy]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While the physical difference between a men's razor and a women's razor is minimal, the difference in marketing those products is large. Marketers have found that women are less price sensitive than men, meaning that they are generally willing to pay higher prices for goods than men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other examples of marketers acting on [[price discrimination]] are student or senior [[Discounting|discounts]], allowing people who are more sensitive to price to pay less in order to gain their business. Airline ticket prices in advance compared to last-minute prices are another example.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8a42df04-8b6d-4949-b20b-6f40a326db9e/the-pink-tax---how-gender-based-pricing-hurts-women-s-buying-power.pdf|title=The Pink Tax -- How Gender Based Price Discrimination Hurts Women's Buying Power|last=Maloney|first=Carolyn|date=December 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have a greater need to buy a product are often willing to pay much more, leading to price discrimination.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women are often subjected to this in the tampon and sanitary napkin market. These are products that women absolutely must buy, so they can be priced as high as a marketer would want and they would still sell their entire product. To marketers, women are less price elastic, meaning they care less about the price of a product or service.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Manufacturers and marketers exploit this, resulting in prices of women's goods and services being higher.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Tampon Tax ==
In the US, there is no specialized tax on tampons.  In states where sales taxes are collected, tampons are taxed in much the same way as most other non-exempt items (such as toilet paper and toothpaste).  There has been a recent push to carve out a special tax-exempt status for tampons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article53009920.html|title=Time for tax-free tampons? California lawmaker thinks so|last=White|first=Jeremy B.|date=2016|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]], [[Canada]], and Britain have voted on legislation to create special tax exemptions for tampons, but none have become law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-18/tampon-tax-to-stay-despite-senate-voting-to-remove-it/9879382|title='Sexist' tampon tax to stay despite Senate saying GST should not apply to sanitary products|date=2018-06-18|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has recently scrapped tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44912742|title=India scraps tampon tax after campaign|date=2018-07-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic Impact ==
The economic impact of the pink tax is that women have less buying power, especially paired with the gender-based [[Gender pay gap|pay gap]]. Buying power relates to the amount of goods and services a person can buy, given current prices and available income to spend.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The wage gap already puts women at a disadvantage when it comes to buying power. Women currently make a statistical average 89 cents for every $1 a man earns in the United States due to differences in work choices, meaning women statistically, on average, have less income to spend on goods and services.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/09/gender-pay-gap-facts/|title=The narrowing, but persistent, gender gap in pay|date=2018-04-09|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alone gives men more money and, ultimately, more buying power. The pink tax further contributes to the [[economic inequality]] between men and women. Paying more for goods just because they are marketed to women when women already earn less than men means men hold the majority of the buying power in the economy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Taxes on feminine hygiene products that men don't have to buy further contributes to this discrepancy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== Congresswoman Jackie Speier ===
Representative [[Jackie Speier]] was a member of the California state [[Senate]] from 1998-2006. In 2008 she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing California's 14th Electoral District, which includes most of San Mateo County and part of San Francisco County. She has held her position in Congress. Speier, a Democrat, is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001175|title=SPEIER, Karen Lorraine Jacqueline (Jackie) - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, she introduced H.R. 5464, the Pink Tax Repeal Act, to end gender-based discrimination in the pricing of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This followed her introduction of an earlier version of the bill two years earlier.

==== Pink Tax Repeal Act ====
On July 8, 2016, Speier introduced H.R. 5686, Pink Tax Repeal Act, to the House floor. She was the bill's primary sponsor. This was widely considered an early version of the bill. It was been revised and edited over the succeeding two years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5464|title=Pink Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 5464)|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2018 Speier introduced a revised version of the Pink Tax Repeal Act, H.R.5464. The 115th Congress (2017-2018) was expected to review the acts's 2018 version. Skopos Labs, a technology company that predicts risks and opportunities, gave the bill a 1% chance of being enacted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5464#|title=Pink Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 5464)|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall intention of the Pink Tax Repeal Act is to end gender-based price discrimination. To accomplish this, the Pink Tax Repeal Act would mandate that any comparable products that are marketed toward men and women must be priced equally. Although Speier said she did not expect the bill to pass, she still tried to push forward the conversation about gender-based price discrimination in goods and services.

==== Gender Tax Repeal Act ====
While in the California state Assembly, Speier introduced Assembly Bill No. 1088, also known as the Gender Tax Repeal Act, in 1995. It was similar to the Pink Tax Repeal Act, except it focused on gender-based price discrimination in services. The bill stated that businesses such as tailors, barbers, hair stylists, dry cleaners and laundries would not be permitted to discriminate for "standard services" due to a person’s gender or the gender the clothing is intended for, without a valid, prominently placed written justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020AB1088|title=Bill Text - AB-1088 Civil rights:  gender discrimination.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/shopping/pink-tax-repeal-act-aims-to-make-pricing-fair-to-women/|title=Pink Tax Repeal Act Aims to Make Pricing Fair to Women|work=Consumer Reports|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed and remains in effect. A similar bill was proposed soon after aimed at consumer goods, however it gained large opposition from manufacturing companies. The main opposition argument was that a bill proposed on goods would lead to [[litigation]] and price increases.

=== Senator Ben Hueso (D-San Diego) ===
California state Sen. Ben Hueso of San Diego proposed a new version of the Gender Tax Repeal Act, SB-899, in 2016, but withdrew the bill after pushback from industry lobbyists. It would have banned businesses in California from charging customers different prices for similar goods on the basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2016/06/30/pink-tax-bill-dies-youll-still-pay-more-for-products-marketed-to-women/|title=‘Pink tax’ bill dies: You’ll still pay more for products marketed to women|date=2016-06-30|work=Orange County Register|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delegate Jennifer Boysko, (D-Fairfax) ===
Jennifer Boysko, a Democratic member of the Virginia state House of Delegates, in 2018 submitted HB 24, which would exempt menstrual supplies from sales and use taxes, in response to the Tampon Tax in Virginia.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Propelled-by-MeToo-groups-seek-to-remove-Tampon-Tax-in-Virginia-471345364.html|title=Bill to remove 'Tampon Tax' in Virginia clears first hurdle|last=Service|first=Tianna Mosby, Capital News|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Criticism of the concept of a pink tax include the principle that the idea robs women of agency and choice by suggesting that women are so easily brainwashed by marketing that they are prevented from choosing the lesser priced but otherwise "identical" male-marketed alternative. If it were truly identical to the female-marketed variety, there would be no reason not to buy the cheaper variety. Instead, critics have attributed the pricing disparity to market forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/05/the-pink-tax-is-a-myth|title=The 'Pink Tax' Is a Myth|last=Nolan Brown|first=Elizabeth|website=reason.com|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that if women continue to buy a more expensive pink razor, it is because they see some utility or additional aesthetic that they are willing to pay for. That there are substantive differences in price indicates differences in marketability of different products, not necessarily a conspiracy against women.

Opposition to the Pink Tax Repeal Act, came from retailers and manufacturers of women's products and clothing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Their chief argument is that the Pink Tax Repeal Act would be difficult to enforce and lawsuits would follow. The difference between men's and women's products is not always easy to see, they argue, so removing the pink tax would be subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-california-toys-gender-discrimination-20160628-snap-story.html|title=Bill to end gender disparity in retail pricing is withdrawn after pushback from industry lobbyists|last=Ulloa|first=Jazmine|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also alleged that the bill was unfriendly to domestic manufacturing jobs and that lowering the prices for women's products could lead to employee layoffs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Republican opposition for a recall of the tampon tax in Virginia argued that tax discrimination against products for women needed to be sorted out by changing the general tax code. They added that they supported the elimination of sales taxes overall. Another opposition argument was that only disease-preventing hygiene products should be exempt from Virginia's sales tax and that feminine hygiene products did not prevent disease.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The satirical card game ''[[Cards Against Humanity]]'' released a "For Her" edition of its base set (which is exactly the same as the original except with pink-coloured packaging and a higher price) in 2017 as a satire of the pink tax, and in support of [[EMILY's List]]—a U.S. [[political action committee]] supporting female [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/11/15955988/cards-against-humanity-for-her|title=Cards Against Humanity takes on the pink tax with ‘for Her’ box|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|date=July 11, 2017|website=Polygon|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Placebo in history''' is the account of the changing understanding of the phenomena of the [[placebo effect]] and term "placebo". 

The word placebo was used in a medicinal context in the late 18th century to describe a "commonplace method or medicine" and in 1811 it was defined as "any medicine adapted more to please than to benefit the patient". Although this definition contained a derogatory implication&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shapiro AK |title=Semantics of the placebo |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=653–95 |year=1968 |pmid=4891851 |doi=10.1007/BF01564309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not necessarily imply that the remedy had no effect.&lt;ref name="Kaptchuk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk TJ |title=Powerful placebo: the dark side of the randomised controlled trial |journal=The Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9117 |pages=1722–5 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9734904 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10111-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(97)10111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placebos have featured in medical use until well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview/&gt; In 1955 [[Henry K. Beecher]] published an influential paper entitled ''The Powerful Placebo'' which proposed idea that placebo effects were clinically important.&lt;ref name="Hrob2001"/&gt; Subsequent re-analysis of his materials, however, found in them no evidence of any "placebo effect".&lt;ref name="Kienle &amp; Kiene"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kienle GS, Kiene H | title = The powerful placebo effect: fact or fiction? | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 12 | pages = 1311–8 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9449934 | doi = 10.1016/s0895-4356(97)00203-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''placebo'' itself originated from the [[Latin]] phrase for ''I shall please.''&lt;ref name=Jacobs00&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs B |title=Biblical origins of placebo |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=213–4 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10844895 |pmc=1297986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in Latin text in the [[Bible]] (Psalm 114:9, [[Vulgate]] version by [[Jerome]] (116 in many modern editions), "Placebo Domino in regione vivorum", "I shall please the Lord in the land of the living"). Jerome translated as "I shall please" (placebo), the Hebrew word "ethalech", "I shall walk with" as in "I shall be in step with".

This word gave its name, placebo, to the [[Office of the Dead]] church service. From that, a ''singer of [[Placebo (at funeral)|placebo]]'' became associated with someone who falsely claimed a connection to the deceased to get a share of the funeral meal, and hence a flatterer, and so a deceptive act to please.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt;

==Early medical usage==
[[File:Title page of Ambroise Pare's Ouevres.jpg|thumb|Doctors and surgeons such as [[Ambroise Paré]] traditionally emphasized the importance of consoling the patient through the use of 'placebos'. This is the title page to one of Paré's works.]]
In the practice of medicine it had been long understood that, as [[Ambroise Paré]] (1510–1590) had expressed it, the [[physician]]'s duty was to "[[cure]] occasionally, relieve often, console always" ("Guérir quelquefois, soulager souvent, consoler toujours"). Accordingly, placebos were widespread in medicine until the 20th century, and were often endorsed as necessary deceptions.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview/&gt;

According to Nicholas Jewson, eighteenth century English medicine was gradually moving away from a model in which the patient had considerable interaction with the physician – and, through this consultative relationship, had an equal influence on the physician's therapeutic approach. It was moving towards a paradigm in which the patient became the recipient of a more standardized form of intervention that was determined by the prevailing opinions of the medical profession of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholas D. Jewson |title=Medical Knowledge and the Patronage System in 18th Century England |journal=Sociology |volume=8 |number=3 |pages=369–385  |url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/8/3/369.abstract |date=September 1974 |doi=10.1177/003803857400800302 |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewson characterized this as parallel to the changes that were taking place in the manner in which medical knowledge was being produced; namely, a transition from "bedside medicine", through to "[[hospital]] medicine", and finally to "[[laboratory]] medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholas D. Jewson |title=The Disappearance of the Sick-Man from Medical Cosmology, 1770–1870 |journal=Sociology |volume=10 |issue=2 |url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/10/2/225.abstract?patientinform-links=yes&amp;legid=spsoc;10/2/225 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |year=1976 |page=227 |doi=10.1177/003803857601000202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last vestiges of the "consoling" approach to treatment were the prescription of ''morale-boosting'' and ''pleasing'' remedies, such as the "[[sugar pill]]", [[electuary]] or [[pharmaceutical syrup]]; all of which had no known pharmacodynamic action, even at the time. Those doctors who provided their patients with these sorts of morale-boosting therapies (which, while having no pharmacologically active ingredients, provided reassurance and comfort) did so either to reassure their patients while the ''[[Vis medicatrix naturae]]'' (i.e., "the healing power of nature") performed its normalizing task of restoring them to health, or to gratify their patients' need for an active treatment.

In 1811, [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper's]] ''Quincy's Lexicon–Medicum'' defined placebo as "an epithet given to any medicine adapted more to please than benefit the patient". In 1903 Richard Cabot said that he was brought up to use placebos,&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview/&gt; but he ultimately concluded by saying that "I have not yet found any case in which a lie does not do more harm than good."&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt;

Early implementations of placebo controls date back to 16th-century Europe with Catholic efforts to discredit exorcisms. Individuals who claimed to be possessed by demonic forces were given false holy objects. If the person reacted with violent contortions, it was concluded that the possession was purely imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brain Wars: The Scientific Battle Over the Existence of the Mind and the Proof That Will Change the Way We Live Our Lives|last=Beauregard|first=Mario | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012|isbn=978-0-06-207156-9|location=New York |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the placebo effect as a medical treatment has been controversial throughout history, and was common until the mid twentieth century.&lt;ref name="HistoricalOverview" /&gt; In 1903 [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]] concluded that it should be avoided because it is deceptive. Newman points out the "placebo paradox" – it may be unethical to use a placebo, but also unethical "''not'' to use something that heals". He suggests to solve this dilemma by appropriating the meaning response in medicine, that is make use of the placebo effect, as long as the "one administering... is honest, open, and believes in its potential healing power".&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | first = David H. | last = Newman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Hippocrates' Shadow |publisher=Scribner |year=2008| pages=134–59 |isbn=978-1-4165-5153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Haygarth]] was the first to investigate the efficacy of the placebo effect in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth C | title = The rod of Aesculapios: John Haygarth (1740-1827) and Perkins' metallic tractors | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16059528 | doi = 10.1258/j.jmb.2005.04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested a popular medical treatment of his time, called "[[Perkins tractors]]", and concluded that the remedy was ineffectual by demonstrating that the results from a ''dummy'' remedy were just as useful as from the alleged "active" remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Haygarth J | url = http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/records/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the/title_pages | title = Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body; Exemplified by Fictitious Tractors, and Epidemical Convulsions | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215142711/http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/records/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the/title_pages | archive-date=2013-12-15 | publisher = Crutwell | location = Bath | year = 1800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émile Coué]], a [[France|French]] pharmacist, working as an [[apothecary]] at [[Troyes]] between 1882 and 1910, also advocated the effectiveness of the "Placebo Effect". He became known for reassuring his clients by praising each remedy's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each given medication. His book ''Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion'' was published in England (1920) and in the United States (1922).

The first to recognize and demonstrate the placebo effect was English physician [[John Haygarth]] in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested a popular medical treatment of his time, called "[[Perkins tractors]]", which were metal pointers supposedly able to 'draw out' disease. They were sold at the extremely high price of five guineas, and Haygarth set out to show that the high cost was unnecessary.  He did this by comparing the results from ''dummy'' wooden tractors with a set of allegedly "active" metal tractors, and published his findings in a book ''On the Imagination as a Cause &amp; as a Cure of Disorders of the Body''.&lt;ref&gt;
Haygarth, J., ''[http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/records/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the/title_pages Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body; Exemplified by Fictitious Tractors, and Epidemical Convulsions ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215142711/http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/illustrating/records/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the/title_pages |date=December 15, 2013 }}'', Crutwell, (Bath), 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wooden pointers were just as useful as the expensive metal ones, showing "to a degree which has never been suspected, what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Wootton, David.  Bad medicine: Doctors doing harm since Hippocrates.  Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; While the word placebo had been used since 1772, this is the first real demonstration of the placebo effect.

In modern times the first to define and discuss the "placebo effect" was T.C Graves, in a published paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. C.

At the [[Royal London Hospital]] in 1933, William Evans and Clifford Hoyle experimented with 90 subjects and published studies which compared the outcomes from the administration of an active drug and a dummy simulator ("placebo") in the same trial. The experiment displayed no significant difference between drug treatment and placebo treatment, leading the researchers to conclude that the drug exerted no specific effects in relation to the conditions being treated.

In 1946, the [[Yale]] [[biostatistician]] and [[physiologist]] [[E. Morton Jellinek]] described the "placebo reaction" or "response". He probably used the terms "placebo response" and "placebo reaction" as interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, E. M. "Clinical Tests on Comparative Effectiveness of Analgesic Drugs", ''Biometrics Bulletin'', Vol.2, No.5, (October 1946), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry K. Beecher]]'s 1955 paper ''The Powerful Placebo'' was the first to use the term "placebo effect", which he contrasts with drug effects.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry K.

However, this paper has been criticized for failing to distinguish the placebo effect from other factors, and for thereby encouraging an inflated notion of the placebo effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Finniss DG, Kaptchuk TJ, Miller F, Benedetti F | title = Biological, clinical, and ethical advances of placebo effects | journal = Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9715 | pages = 686–95 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20171404 | pmc = 2832199 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61706-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1997 re-analysis failed to support Beecher's conclusions.&lt;ref name="Kienle &amp; Kiene" /&gt;

{{quotation|In 1955, Henry K. Beecher published a paper entitled ''The Powerful Placebo''. Since that time, 40 years ago, the placebo effect has been considered a scientific fact.

In 1961 [[Henry K. Beecher]] concluded that surgeons he categorized as enthusiasts relieved their patients' chest pain and heart problems more than skeptic surgeons.&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, the placebo effect became widely recognized and placebo-controlled trials became the norm in the approval of new medications.&lt;ref name="pmid9780448"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ | title = Intentional ignorance: a history of blind assessment and placebo controls in medicine | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–433 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9780448 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.1998.0159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dylan Evans]] argues that placebos are linked with activation of the [[Acute-phase reaction|acute-phase response]] so will work only on subjective conditions such as pain, swelling, stomach ulcers, depression, and anxiety that are linked to this.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Dylan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Placebo: the belief effect |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-712612-3 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[systematic review]] of clinical trials concluded that there was no evidence of clinically important effects, except perhaps in the treatment of pain and continuous subjective outcomes.&lt;ref name="Hrob2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC | title = Is the placebo powerless?

The word ''obecalp'', "placebo" spelled backwards, was coined by an Australian doctor in 1998 when he recognised the need for a freely available placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Axtens, Michael |title=Letters to editor: Mind Games |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15921467.300-mind-games.html |work=New Scientist  |date=1998-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to make the use or prescription of fake medicine less obvious to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see [http://www.wsoctv.com/specialreports/7373238/detail.html Gulf War Veteran Gets Placebos Instead Of Real Medicine] or [http://www.bookofjoe.com/2004/11/behindthemedspe_3.html BehindTheMedspeak: Obecalp].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
Some statements about the role of placebos in doctor patient relationship are:
* [[Sir Astley Paston Cooper|Cooper]] (1823, p.&amp;nbsp;259): "[When applying] the compound decoction of the [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]] ... [in cases of] irritable ulcer, ... some think it placebo; others have a very high opinion of its efficacy ... [when it is used] after the use of mercury, it diminishes the irritability of the constitution, and soon soothes the system into peace".
* Shapiro&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;656): "[This use of the term "placebo" is a form of] [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]].... Introduction of the word placebo to describe a class of treatments not previously specified was an important development in the history of [[methodology]] and medicine."
* Handfield-Jones (1953): "some patients are so unintelligent, neurotic, or inadequate as to be incurable, and life is made easier for them by placebo".
* Platt (1947, p.&amp;nbsp;307): "the frequency with which placebos are used varies inversely with the combined {{sic|intelligence}} of the doctor and his patient".
* Steele (1891, pp.&amp;nbsp;277–8): "To argue with a man, and especially with a woman, that there is little the matter with them might be thought injudicious, and to advise them to return at a more convenient occasion requires more time and resolution than writing out a prescription or administering a placebo."
* But Shapiro&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;679): "If a placebo is prescribed by a physician because it is thought that it will help the patient, then it is a specific [remedy] and therefore not a placebo [at all]."
* An editorial in the ''British Medical Journal'' of 19 January 1952 (p.&amp;nbsp;150): "But it is a fallacy to suppose that an inactive medicine can do no harm. If prescribed in a perfunctory way for a patient needing explanation and reassurance it may increase faith in his disease rather than in the remedy, and a doctor who gives a placebo in the wrong spirit may harm the patient."
* Pepper (1945, p.&amp;nbsp;411): "There may be a time when during the carrying out of diagnostic tests it is undesirable to give potent medicine lest it interfere with the tests and yet the patient must be encouraged by treatment.... There is a certain amount of skill in the choice and administration of a placebo. In the first place, it must be nothing more than what the name implies a medicine without any [[pharmacologic]] action whatever. Even a mild [[sedative]] is not a true placebo. Secondly, its name must be unknown to even the most inveterate [[patient]] who knows most drugs by name and is always quick to read the [[Medical prescription|prescription]]. If the medicines named are familiar, the type of patient who needs a placebo will promptly exclaim that this or that drug had been tried and 'had not helped me' or 'had upset my stomach'. It is well if the drug have a Latin and [[polysyllabic]] name; it is wise if it be prescribed with some assurance and emphasis for [[psychotherapeutic]] effect. The older physicians each had his favorite placeboic prescriptions – one chose [[Tincture]] of [[Condurango]], another the Fluidextract [sic] of [[Cimicifuga]] nigra. Certainly this latter by its Latin name might be expected to have more [[supratentorial]] action than if one merely wrote for the [[Black Cohosh]], and Condurango would be more effectual than sugar of milk." Pepper's assertion that a placebo "must be nothing more than what the name implies" – namely that it must be "a medicine without any pharmacologic action whatever" – in order for it to be called a placebo, is most significant.
* Findley (1953, pp.&amp;nbsp;1824, 1826): "[If the placebo is not] used as an instrument of deception, but as a technique for cementing the emotional bond which must attach doctor to patient if any form of treatment is to be really successful ... [it was] the most important weapon the physician has ... [specifically because] in proportion as this [doctor-patient] bond is firm, the [patient's] need for drugs will likely diminish."
* Leslie (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;854): "Because medicine has been so concerned with its scientific growth, too little attention has been paid to advancing the art of medicine, to which therapy with placebos belongs, and consequently knowledge of the use of placebos has not progressed significantly."
* Carruthers, Hoffman, Melmon &amp; Nierenberg (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;1268): "In clinical practice, where a majority of patient visits are for conditions that cannot be explained on a pathophysiologic basis of for which no specific treatment is available, it is essential that physicians understand the concepts and principles of placebos and placebo effects and, when appropriate, use them correctly."
* Cochrane&lt;ref&gt;[[Archie Cochrane|Cochrane, Archie]]: Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services. The Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust 1972,  (1972) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is important to distinguish the very respectable, conscious use of placebos. The effect of placebos has been shown by randomised controlled trials to be very large. Their use in the correct place is to be encouraged. What is inefficient is the use of relatively expensive drugs as placebos."

'''Primary polydipsia''' is a form of [[polydipsia]]&lt;ref name="pmid10372737"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1999|title=Urinary excretion of aquaporin-2 water channel differentiates psychogenic polydipsia from central diabetes insipidus|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10372737|journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=84|issue=6|pages=2235–2237|doi=10.1210/jc.84.6.2235|pmid=10372737|url-access=|vauthors=Saito T, Ishikawa S, Ito T, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes '''psychogenic polydipsia''' ('''PPD''' – not to be confused with [[postpartum depression]]), which is caused by psychiatric disorders, often [[schizophrenia]], and often accompanied by the sensation of [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Some forms of primary polydipsia are explicitly non-psychogenic.  Primary polydipsia is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]].

== Terminology ==
In diagnosis, primary polydipsia is usually categorised as:
* [[Psychogenic disease|Psychogenic]] (PPD) – caused by underlying [[psychiatric]] symptoms, including those caused by [[Psychosis|psychoses]] and rarely by [[Affective spectrum|affective disorders]]
* Non-psychogenic – another non-psychological cause, including [[idiopathic]] (unknown cause)

The terms primary polydipsia and psychogenic polydipsia are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably – to be considered psychogenic, the patient needs to have some other psychiatric symptoms, such as [[delusion]]s involving fluid intake or other unusual behaviours. Primary polydipsia may have physiological causes, such as [[autoimmune hepatitis]].

Since primary polydipsia is a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis may be made for patients who have [[Medically unexplained physical symptoms|medically unexplained]] excessive thirst, and this is sometimes incorrectly referred to as ''psychogenic'' rather than ''primary'' polydipsia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Diagnostic considerations ==

=== Acute hyponatraemia ===
If the patient presents with acute hyponatraemia (overhydration) caused by psychogenic polydipsia, treatment usually involves administration of intravenous [[hypertonic]] (3%) [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] until the [[Sodium in biology|serum sodium]] levels stabilise to within a normal range, even if the patient becomes asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/865/treatment/details.html|title=Psychogenic polydipsia – Management – Step by step|date=5 May 2016|website=|journal=British Medical Journal|access-date=29 October 2016|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluid restriction ===
If the patient is [[mental hospital|institutionalised]], monitoring of behaviour and serum sodium levels is necessary. In treatment-resistant polydipsic psychiatric patients, regulation in the inpatient setting can be accomplished by use of a weight-water protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowen|first=L.|last2=Glynn|first2=S.

Weight will normally fluctuate during the day, but as the water intake of the polydipsic goes up, the weight will naturally rise. The physician can order a stepped series of interventions as the weight rises. The correlation must be individualized with attention paid to the patient's normal weight and fluctuations, diet, [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] disorders (such as a [[Epilepsy|seizure disorder]]) and urinary system functioning. Progressive steps might include redirection, room restriction, and increasing levels of physical restraint with monitoring. Such plans should also include progressive increases in monitoring, as well as a level at which a serum sodium level is drawn.

=== Behavioural ===
Behavioural treatments may involve the use of a [[token economy]] to provide [[Reinforcement|positive reinforcement]] to desirable behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, [[cognitive therapy]] techniques can be used to address the thought patterns that lead to compulsive drinking behaviour. Success has been seen in trials of this technique, with emphasis on the development of coping techniques (e.g. taking small sips of water, having ice cubes instead of drinks) in addition to challenging [[delusion]]s leading to excessive drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costanzo|first=Erin S.|last2=Antes|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Christensen|first3=Alan J.|date=2016-11-01|title=Behavioral and medical treatment of chronic polydipsia in a patient with schizophrenia and diabetes insipidus|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=66|issue=2|pages=283–286|issn=1534-7796|pmid=15039516}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=This is a primary source and a case study with a single patient|date=September 2018}}

Psychogenic polydipsia often leads to [[institutionalisation]] of mentally ill patients, since it is difficult to manage in the community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most studies of behavioural treatments occur in institutional settings and require close monitoring of the patient and a large degree of time commitment from staff.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although primary polydipsia is usually categorised as psychogenic, there are some rare non-psychogenic causes.

The '''''Program for Jewish Genetic Health''''' is a centralized resource for the Jewish community, addressing all health concerns related to the [[medical genetics of the Jewish people]].  The Program's stated mission is to protect the health of the current Jewish community and its future generations.  Launched in 2011, the Program for Jewish Genetic Health integrates the social mission the [[Montefiore Health System]] with the clinical services, genetic education, and biomedical advances of its medical school, the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]].

The Program for Jewish Genetic Health has three main objectives: 
#to provide accessible and affordable options for carrier testing for Jewish genetic diseases
#to increase awareness and disseminate timely information regarding all aspects of genetic health to lay and professional sectors of the Jewish community
#to serve as a centralized resource and support center for Jewish genetic health and associated concerns from before birth through old age.

==Carrier testing for Jewish genetic diseases==

About one in four [[Ashkenazi Jews]] carries a genetic alteration associated with a recessive “Jewish genetic disease.”  Many of these diseases have the potential to be severely debilitating and even fatal.  A child must inherit altered genes for a given disease from both parents to have the disease. Genetic testing can identify individuals who themselves are asymptomatic carriers, but whose children may be at risk.  Community-based screening for [[Tay-Sachs disease]] is considered by many to be one of the most successful public health initiatives in medical history.  Although this has resulted in a near eradication of the disease from the Jewish population, the disease-causing genetic alterations still are present, and screening still is necessary in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=54–6 |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815f247c |title=Carrier screening in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent |year=2008 |last1=Gross |first1=Susan J. |last2=Pletcher |first2=Beth A. |last3=Monaghan |first3=Kristin G. |journal=Genetics in Medicine |volume=10 |pmid=18197057 |author4=Professional Practice Guidelines Committee |issue=1 |pmc=3110977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrier screening for many Jewish genetic disorders has become standard of care. As technology advances, so does the number of disorders for which screening is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=37–46 |doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2010.01.001 |title=Ashkenazi Jewish Screening in the Twenty-first Century |year=2010 |last1=Klugman |first1=Susan |last2=Gross |first2=Susan J. |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America |volume=37 |pmid=20494256 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies suggest that consumers desire more reproductive genetic testing, particularly for diseases that wil result in death by the age of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=137–46 |doi=10.1007/s10897-008-9199-3 |title=Consumers' Desire towards Current and Prospective Reproductive Genetic Testing |year=2009 |last1=Hathaway |first1=Feighanne |last2=Burns |first2=Esther |last3=Ostrer |first3=Harry |journal=Journal of Genetic Counseling |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=19160030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional medical model, screening for the Jewish genetic diseases usually is recommended by a woman’s obstetrician/gynecologist once the woman is contemplating a pregnancy or already pregnant. As an alternative model, community-based carrier screening programs have been established nationwide. In addition to spreading further awareness about genetic health issues, screening programs allow for carriers to be identified prior to pregnancy, and even prior to picking a future marriage partner. This enables them to have the largest number of options when considering their future families. Since health insurance policies do not universally cover the complete cost of this genetic testing, many screening programs rely on philanthropic dollars to ensure that no one is turned away due to financial barriers.

The Program for Jewish Genetic Health works with the [http://www.montefiore.org/womens-health-professional-training-programs-services-reproductive-genetics Division of Reproductive Genetics] at [[Montefiore Medical Center]] to screen individuals of child-bearing age in the New York metropolitan area.  [http://pjghtesting.com/ Screening appointments at Montefiore], which include private genetic counseling sessions, are open to the community and subsidies are provided to those who are uninsured or under-insured.

==Increasing awareness==

The Program for Jewish Genetic Health offers educational programs - both live and [http://www.genesights.com online] - to various sectors of the community to educate them on Jewish genetic health issues, including the Ashkenazi Jewish link to breast and ovarian cancer, Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer, as well as alternative family planning options such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

In May 2013, the program launched the [http://www.myjewishgenetichealth.com MyJewishGeneticHealth.com Online Educational Series] to provide the Jewish community with effective and accessible learning via online webinars and supplemental materials.  MyJewishGeneticHealth.com is composed of individual "lessons," based on their current relevance to Jewish genetic health issues, from diseases and conditions to related treatments and ethical issues.

Program leaders also present symposia to rabbis and other Jewish leadership to provide guidance on how genetics relates to engagement and marriage and how leadership can counsel congregants through potential and actual affected pregnancies, as well as to provide applicable referrals if necessary.

==Centralized resource==
The Program for Jewish Genetic Health provides a place for Jews to be able to access resources relevant to Jewish genetic health issues and solutions, from clinical programs to support groups to educational material.  Program staff consist of board certified obstetricians and gynecologists, geneticists and genetic counselors who can provide guidance and answer questions about the relationship between once's Ashkenazi Jewish heritage and a host of medical conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">'''Public health nursing''', a term coined by [[Lillian Wald]] of the [[Henry Street Settlement]], or '''community health nursing''', is a [[nursing]] specialty focused on [[public health]].  Public health nurses (PHNs) or community health nurses "integrate community involvement and knowledge about the entire population with personal, clinical understandings of the health and illness experiences of individuals and families within the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/phn/ |title=Public Health Nursing Section |publisher=APHA |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public health nursing in the United States traces back to a nurse named [[Lillian Wald]] who, in 1893, established the [[Henry Street Settlement]] in New York City and coined the expression "public health nurse".

Public health nurses work within communities and focus on different areas to improve the overall health of the people within that community. Some areas of employment for public health nurses are school districts, county or state health departments, and departments of correction. The public health nurse looks for areas of concern within the community and assesses and plans ways through which the concerns can be resolved or minimized. Some health concerns a public health nurse may work on are infection control, health maintenance, health coaching, as well as home care visits for welfare and to provide care to certain members of the community who may need it.

The term '''Rainfed agriculture''' is used to describe farming practices that rely on rainfall for water. It provides much of the food consumed by poor communities in [[developing countries]]. For example, rainfed agriculture accounts for more than 95% of farmed land in sub-Saharan Africa, 90% in Latin America, 75% in the Near East and North Africa; 65% in East Asia and 60% in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/PDF/Water_Issue_Brief_10.pdf] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010, Issue 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of productivity, particularly in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, are low due to [[soil degradation|degraded soils]], high levels of [[evaporation]], [[drought]]s, [[flood]]s and a general lack of effective [[water management]]. A major study into water use by agriculture, known as the [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]], coordinated by the [[International Water Management Institute]], noted a close correlation between [[hunger]], [[poverty]] and [[water]]. However, it concluded that there was much opportunity to raise productivity from rainfed farming.

The authors considered that managing rainwater and [[soil moisture]] more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale [[irrigation]], held the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and [[surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of rainfed agriculture varies regionally but produces most food for poor communities in developing countries. In subSaharan Africa more than 95% of the farmed land is rainfed, while the corresponding figure for Latin America is almost 90%, for South Asia about 60%, for East Asia 65% and for the Near East and North Africa 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAOSTAT]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries in the world depend primarily on rainfed agriculture for their grain food. Despite large strides made in improving productivity and environmental conditions in many developing
countries, a great number of poor families in Africa and Asia still face poverty, hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition where rainfed agriculture is the main agricultural activity. These problems are exacerbated by adverse biophysical growing conditions and the poor socioeconomic infrastructure in many areas in the semi-arid tropics (SAT). The SAT is the home to 38% of the developing countries’ poor, 75% of whom live in rural areas. Over 45% of the world’s hungry and more than 70% of its malnourished children live in the SAT
                     
There is a correlation between poverty, hunger and [[water stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkenmark, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Millennium Development Project has identified the ‘hot spot’ countries in the world suffering from the largest prevalence of [[malnourishment]]. These countries coincide closely with those located in the semi-arid and dry subhumid hydroclimates in the world (Fig. 1.1), i.e. [[savannah]]s and [[steppe]] ecosystems, where rainfed agriculture is the dominating source of food and where water constitutes a key limiting factor to crop growth.&lt;ref&gt;SEI, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 850 million undernourished people in the world, essentially all live in poor, developing countries, which predominantly are located in tropical regions.&lt;ref&gt;UNSTAT, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
                    
Since the late 1960s, agricultural land use has expanded by 20–25%, which has contributed to approximately 30% of the overall grain production growth during the period.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramankutty et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining yield outputs originated from intensification through yield increases per unit land area. However, the regional variation is large, as is the difference between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. In developing countries rainfed grain yields are on average 1.5 t/ha, compared with 3.1 t/ha for irrigated yields (Rosegrant et al., 2002), and increase in production from rainfed agriculture has mainly originated from land expansion.
Trends are clearly different for different regions. With 99% rainfed production of main cereals such as [[maize]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], the cultivated cereal area in sub-Saharan Africa has doubled since 1960 while the yield per unit of land has been nearly stagnant for these staple crops (FAOSTAT, 2005). In South Asia, there has been a major shift away from more drought-tolerant, low-yielding crops such as sorghum and millet, while wheat and maize hasapproximately doubled in area since 1961 (FAOSTAT, 2005). During the same period, the yield per unit of land for maize and wheat has more than doubled (Fig. 1.2). For predominantly rainfed systems, maize crops per unit of
land have nearly tripled and wheat more than doubled during the same time period. Rainfed maize yield differs substantially
between regions (Fig. 1.2a). In Latin America (including the Caribbean) it exceeds 3 t/ha, while in South Asia it is around 2 t/ha and in subSaharan Africa it only just exceeds 1 t/ha. This can be compared with maize yields in the USA or southern Europe, which normally amount to
approximately 7–10 t/ha (most maize in these regions is irrigated). The average regional yield per unit of land for wheat in Latin America
(including the Caribbean) and South Asia is similar to the average yield output of 2.5–2.7 t/ha in North America (Fig. 1.2b). In comparison, wheat yield in Western Europe is approximately twice as large (5 t/ha), while in sub-Saharan Africa it remains below 2 t/ha. In view of the historic regional difference in development of yields, there appears to exist a significant potential for raised yields in rainfed agriculture, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
          
Rural development through sustainable management of land and water resources gives a plausible solution for alleviating rural poverty and improving the livelihoods of the rural poor.
In an effective convergence mode for improving the rural livelihoods in the target districts,
with watersheds as the operational units, a holistic integrated systems approach by drawing attention to the past experiences, existing
opportunities and skills, and supported partnerships can enable change and improve the livelihoods of the rural poor. The well-being of the
rural poor depends on fostering their fair and equitable access to productive resources. The rationale behind convergence through watersheds has been that these watersheds help in ‘cross-learning’ and drawing on a wide range of experiences from different sectors. A significant
conclusion is that there should be a balance between attending to needs and priorities of rural livelihoods and enhancing positive directions of change by building effective and sustainable partnerships. Based on the experience and performance of the existing integrated community watersheds in different socioeconomic environments, appropriate exit strategies, which include proper sequencing of interventions, building up of financial, technical and organizational capacity of local communities to internalize and sustain interventions, and the requirement for any minimal external technical and organizational support needs to be identified.

While absolute grain yield variations exist between different global locations as cited in this article, the potential for improved rain fed grain yields may be less than is suggested by a comparison between sub-Saharan and European locations for example, this applies particularly in areas where grain yield is primarily determined by the growing season rainfall. A more accurate formula for measuring yield potential is y x a = X, where X is grain yield in Kg/hectare, y is millimetres of growing season rainfall and a is the variable yield factor, a number that may vary somewhere between 5 and 20. Thus assuming a variable yield factor of 15 and a growing season rainfall of 220mm the formula would express as 220mm x 15 = 3300&amp;nbsp;kg/ha yield potential.
This formula, while not taking account of either the carryover benefits of stored rainfall in the soil profile resulting from out of season rainfall or the impact of temperature or soil fertility, still gives a more accurate picture of the degree to which actual grain yields are matching the region's potential yields and is a better basis for comparison between very different regions such as Europe and the sub-Sahara.
A European yield of 5000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha from a rainfall of 500mm results in a variable yield factor of 10 while a yield of 2500&amp;nbsp;kg/ha in a 200mm rainfall area has a variable yield factor of 12.5, in such an example the lower yielding crop has actually been 25% more efficient in its rainfall utilisation than the higher yielding crop. Agronomy needs to be based on attaining the highest possible variable yield factor rather than the highest absolute yield, factor numbers as high as 17+ are achievable.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The '''rare disease assumption''' is a mathematical [[wikt:assumption|assumption]] in [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] [[case-control study|case-control studies]] where the [[hypothesis]] tests the association between an exposure and a disease. It is assumed that, if the [[prevalence]] of the disease is low, then the [[odds ratio]] approaches the [[relative risk]].

Case control studies are relatively inexpensive and less time consuming than [[cohort study|cohort studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Since case control studies don't track patients over time, they can't establish [[relative risk]]. The case control study can, however, calculate the exposure-odds ratio, which, mathematically, is supposed to approach the relative risk as prevalence falls.

Some authors {{who|date=June 2015}} state that if the prevalence is 10% or less, the disease can be considered rare enough to allow the rare disease assumption. Unfortunately, the magnitude of discrepancy between the odds ratio and the relative risk is dependent not only on the prevalence, but also, to a great degree, on two other factors.

The following example will illustrate this difficulty clearly. Consider a standard table showing the association between two binary variables with frequencies ''a'' = true positives = 49,005,929, ''b'' = false positives = 50,994,071, ''c'' = false negatives = 50,994,071 and ''d'' = true negatives = 849,005,929. In this case the odds ratio (OR) is equal to 16 and the relative risk (RR) is equal to 8.65. Although the prevalence in our example equals 10% it is very difficult to apply the rare disease assumption because OR and RR can hardly be considered to be approximately the same. However, in this example the disease is not particularly "rare"; a 10% prevalence value means 1 in 10 people would have it. As the prevalence drops lower and lower, OR approaches the RR much more closely. This is one of the most problematic aspects of the rare disease assumption, since there is no threshold prevalence below which a disease is considered "rare", and thus no strict guideline to determine when the assumption applies.

'''Roy Wright Menninger''' (born 1926) is an American doctor and psychiatrist. His father and family established the [[Menninger Foundation]] in 1925 in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. 

==Early life and education==
Roy Wright Menninger was born in 1926 as the first of three sons to [[William C. Menninger]] and his wife Catherine Wright, while they lived in New York. His father was completing an internship at Bellevue Hospital. The family returned to Topeka, Kansas in 1927, when his father joined the Menninger Clinic, with his brother [[Karl Menninger]] and father [[Charles Frederick Menninger]]. Roy grew up in the world of medicine and psychiatry.

==Career== 
Roy became a doctor and psychiatrist, and joined his father and uncle at the [[Menninger Foundation]], which became internationally known center for the treatment of behavioral disorders. 

In 1967 he succeeded his father as President and CEO of the Menninger Foundation. He worked in that position until 1993, when he retired to become Chairman of Menninger Trustees.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Sexually transmitted infections''' ('''STI'''), also referred to as '''sexually transmitted diseases''' ('''STD'''), are [[infection]]s that are commonly [[Transmission (medicine)|spread]] by [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]], [[anal sex]] and [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Women2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/sexually-transmitted-infections|title=Sexually transmitted infections|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Murray PR, Rosenthal KS, Pfaller MA|title=Medical microbiology|date=2013|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323086929|page=418|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBEVsFmR2yQC&amp;pg=PA418 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201070705/https://books.google.com/books?id=RBEVsFmR2yQC&amp;pg=PA418|archivedate=2015-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goering|first1=Richard V.|title=Mims' medical microbiology.|date=2012|publisher=Saunders|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780723436010|page=245|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzQayLEQ5mQC&amp;pg=PA245|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms and signs of disease may include [[vaginal discharge]], [[penile discharge]], [[genital ulcers|ulcers on or around the genitals]], and [[pelvic pain]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; STIs can be [[vertically transmitted infection|transmitted to an infant]] before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/reducing-mother-to-child-risk/preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv|title=Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV|website=HIV.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some STIs may cause [[infertility|problems with the ability to get pregnant]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
More than 30 different [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[parasite]]s can be transmitted through sexual activity.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Bacterial STIs include [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Viral STIs include [[genital herpes]], [[HIV/AIDS]], and [[genital warts]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Parasitic STIs include [[trichomoniasis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; While usually spread by sex, some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue, blood, [[breastfeeding]], or during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the [[developed world]], but this is often not the case in the developing world.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
The most effective way of preventing STIs is by [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]].&lt;ref name=CDC2013P/&gt; Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including [[Hepatitis B vaccine|hepatitis B]] and some types of [[HPV vaccine|HPV]].&lt;ref name=CDC2013P/&gt; [[Safer sex]] practices such as use of [[condom]]s, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2013P&gt;{{cite web|title=How You Can Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=13 December 2017|date=31 May 2016|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209015403/http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=}}{{CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Circumcision]] in males may be effective to prevent some infections.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; During school, [[comprehensive sex education]] may also be useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most STIs are treatable or curable.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Resistance to certain [[antibiotic]]s is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22874837 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm |year=2012 |author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention |title=Update to CDC's Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2010: Oral cephalosporins no longer a recommended treatment for gonococcal infections |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=61 |issue=31 |pages=590–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} STIs were commonly known as ''venereal diseases'', the word ''venereal'' being derived from the Latin word venereus, and meaning relating to sexual intercourse or desire, ultimately derived from [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of love.&lt;ref name="Venereal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Venereal|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=June 18, 2013|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/venereal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603094806/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/venereal|archivedate=June 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; STIs have been euphemistically referred to as "blood diseases" and "social diseases" in the past.&lt;ref name="AllanBurridge1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Allan|author2=Kate Burridge|title=Euphemism &amp; dysphemism: language used as shield and weapon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8NZAAAAMAAJ|date=6 June 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506622-7|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has recommended the more inclusive term ''sexually transmitted infection'' since 1999.&lt;ref name=WHO2003Term/&gt; [[Public health]] officials originally introduced the term ''sexually transmitted infection'', which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term ''sexually transmitted disease'' in order to distinguish it from the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Madhav Naidu|title=Community Health Nursing|publisher=Gyan Publishing House (2010)|chapter=Epidemiology and Management|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--''STD'' may refer only to infections that are causing diseases, or it may be used more loosely as a synonym for ''STI.'' Most of the time, people do not know that they are infected with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term ''sexually transmissible disease'' is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, [[meningitis]] is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the [[pathogen]]s that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means ''other than sexual contact''. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—[[blood transfusion]], sharing of [[hypodermic needle]]s—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], [[genital herpes]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.--&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}

Not all STIs are [[symptom]]atic, and symptoms may not appear immediately after infection. In some instances a disease can be carried with no symptoms, which leaves a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Depending on the disease, some untreated STIs can lead to [[infertility]], [[chronic pain]] or death.&lt;ref name="STI video"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/education/about/male-sti-check-up|title=Male STI check-up video|accessdate=2009-01-22|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123014007/http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/education/about/male-sti-check-up|archivedate=2009-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of an STI in [[prepubescent]] children may indicate [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727 }}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main types===

Sexually transmitted infections include:

*[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''. In women, symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge, burning during urination, and bleeding in between periods, although most women do not experience any symptoms.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"&gt;King, B. (2009). Human Sexuality Today (Sixth ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms in men include pain when urinating, and abnormal discharge from their penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chlamydiainfections.html |title=Chlamydia Infections: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702144024/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chlamydiainfections.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If left untreated in both men and women, Chlamydia can infect the urinary tract and potentially lead to [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID). PID can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even has the potential to cause infertility. It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly [[ectopic pregnancy]], in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.
*The two most common forms of [[herpes]] are caused by infection with [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|title=The Basics of Genital Herpes|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922132912/http://www.webmd.com/genital-herpes/guide/genital-herpes-basics|archivedate=2014-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, [[Flu like symptoms]], swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|title=Herpes|publisher=Avert.org|accessdate=2013-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704200815/http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission ([[Valaciclovir|Valtrex]]). Although HSV-1 is typically the "oral" version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the "genital" version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either at the top of the spine, producing the "oral" outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.
*The [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |title=Human Papillomavirus (HPV) &amp;#124; Overview |publisher=FamilyDoctor.org |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703081608/http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/human-papillomavirus-hpv.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 40 different strands of HPV and many do not cause any health problems. In 90% of cases the body’s immune system clears the infection naturally within 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm |title=STD Facts - Human papillomavirus (HPV) |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628022801/http://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/STDFact-HPV.htm |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases may not be cleared and can lead to genital warts (bumps around the genitals that can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like cauliflower) or cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers. Symptoms might not show up until advanced stages. It is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers. There are also two vaccines available for women ([[Cervarix]] and [[Gardasil]]) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex. It is important to remember that the infected partner might not have any symptoms.
*[[Gonorrhea]] is caused by bacterium that lives on moist mucous membranes in the urethra, vagina, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. The infection can spread through contact with the penis, vagina, mouth or anus. Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear 2 to 5 days after contact with an infected partner however, some men might not notice symptoms for up to a month. Symptoms in men include burning and pain while urinating, increased urinary frequency, discharge from the penis (white, green, or yellow in color), red or swollen urethra, swollen or tender testicles, or sore throat. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge, burning or itching while urinating, painful sexual intercourse, severe pain in lower abdomen (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes), or fever (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes); however, many women do not show any symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007267|Gonorrhea}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some antibiotic resistant strains for Gonorrhea but most cases can be cured with antibiotics.

[[File:SyphilistischeZiekten.jpg|thumb|right|Secondary syphilis]]

*[[Syphilis]] is an STI caused by a bacterium. Untreated, it can lead to complications and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm |title=STD Facts –Syphilis |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211181644/http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical manifestations of syphilis include the ulceration of the uro-genital tract, mouth or rectum; if left untreated the symptoms worsen. In recent years, the prevalence of syphilis has declined in Western Europe, but it has increased in Eastern Europe (former Soviet states). A high incidence of syphilis can be found in places such as [[Cameroon]], [[Cambodia]], Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/docstore/hiv/GRSTI/005.htm |title=Syphilis |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030205556/http://www.who.int/docstore/hiv/GRSTI/005.htm |archivedate=2006-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis infections are increasing in the United States.&lt;ref name="ClementOkeke2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2014.13259 |pmid=25387188 |title=Treatment of Syphilis |journal=JAMA |volume=312 |issue=18 |pages=1905–17 |year=2014 |last1=Clement |first1=Meredith E |last2=Okeke |first2=N. Lance |last3=Hicks |first3=Charles B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Trichomoniasis]] is a common STI that is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called ''Trichomonas vaginalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/stdfact-trichomoniasis.htm |title=STD Facts – Trichomoniasis |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210323/http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm |archivedate=2013-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trichomoniasis affects both women and men, but symptoms are more common in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/trichomoniasis.html |title=Trichomoniasis: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302033550/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/trichomoniasis.html |archivedate=2013-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is very effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trichomonas_vaginalis/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Trichomoniasis – NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211095944/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trichomonas_vaginalis/Pages/Introduction.aspx |archivedate=11 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[HIV]] (human immunodeficiency virus) damages the body's immune system, which interferes with its ability to fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills [[CD4]] cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hiv-aids/DS00005 |title=Hiv/Aids |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]].com |date=2012-08-11 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703100900/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hiv-aids/DS00005 |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual is said to have [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/aids.htm |title=AIDS |publisher=Avert.org |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704193504/http://www.avert.org/aids.htm |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include [[Acute HIV Infection|primary infection]], asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ [[T Cells]]. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt; When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/treatment/pages/default.aspx |title=HIV/AIDS Treatment |publisher=Niaid.nih.gov |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703101033/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/treatment/pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses in semen===

Twenty-seven different viruses have been identified in semen. Information on whether or not transmission occurs or whether the viruses cause disease is uncertain. Some of these microbes are known to be sexually transmitted.&lt;ref name=pmid29048276&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3201/eid2311.171049 |pmid=29048276 |pmc=5652425 |title=The Breadth of Viruses in Human Semen |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1922–1924 |year=2017 |last1=Salam |first1=Alex P |last2=Horby |first2=Peter W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those found in semen are listed by the CDC.&lt;ref name=pmid29048276/&gt;

Microbes known to be sexually transmissible (but not generally considered STDs/STIs) include:
* [[Marburg virus]] – Virus in semen for seven weeks after clinical recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Marburg virus disease: origins, reservoirs, transmission and guidelines,| publisher = ((Great Britain)) GOV.UK| url = https://www.gov.uk/marburg-virus-disease-origins-reservoirs-transmission-and-guidelines| date = 5 September 2014| accessdate = 2015-07-03| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150705080829/https://www.gov.uk/marburg-virus-disease-origins-reservoirs-transmission-and-guidelines| archivedate = 5 July 2015| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[HTLV]] (both types 1 and 2) – Sexually transmissible, consumption of breast milk [[breastfeeding]], and once mistaken as a HIV, risk of [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70081-6 |pmid=17376384 |title=Human T-lymphotropic virus 1: Recent knowledge about an ancient infection |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=266–81 |year=2007 |last1=Verdonck |first1=Kristien |last2=González |first2=Elsa |last3=Van Dooren |first3=Sonia |last4=Vandamme |first4=Anne-Mieke |last5=Vanham |first5=Guido |last6=Gotuzzo |first6=Eduardo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==

Many STIs are (more easily) transmitted through the [[mucous membrane]]s of the [[penis]], [[vulva]], [[rectum]], [[urinary tract]] and (less often—depending on type of infection) the [[mouth]], [[throat]], [[respiratory tract]] and [[Human eyes|eyes]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Madhav Naidu. ''Community Health Nursing'', Gen Next Publications, 2009, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; The visible membrane covering the [[glans penis|head of the penis]] is a mucous membrane, though it produces no [[mucus]] (similar to the [[lip]]s of the mouth). Mucous membranes differ from [[skin]] in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases, a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Some STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Healthcare professionals suggest [[safer sex]], such as the use of [[condom]]s, as a reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity, but safer sex cannot be considered to provide complete protection from an STI. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as [[blood transfusion]]s and other blood products, sharing injection [[Intravenous therapy|needles]], needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing [[tattoo]] needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and [[haemophilia]]cs and drug users, particularly at risk.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

It is possible to be an [[symptom|asymptomatic]] carrier of sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, sexually transmitted diseases in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Prevention ==
{{Main|Safe sex}}
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strategies for reducing STD risk include:  vaccination, [[mutual monogamy]], reducing the number of sexual partners and abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|title=How You Can Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|last=|first=|date=31 March 2016|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: [[cybersex]], [[phonesex]] or [[masturbation]] from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both partners can get tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged in contact with someone else. Many infections are not detectable immediately after exposure, so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests to be accurate. Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect with current medical procedures.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Some treatment facilities utilize in-home test kits and have the person return the test for follow-up. Other facilities strongly encourage that those previously infected return to ensure that the infection has been eliminated. Novel strategies to foster re-testing have been the use of text messaging and email as reminders. These types of reminders are now used in addition to phone calls and letters.&lt;ref name="DesaiWoodhall2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sextrans-2014-051930 |pmid=25759476 |title=Active recall to increase HIV and STI testing: A systematic review |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=314–23 |year=2015 |last1=Desai |first1=Monica |last2=Woodhall |first2=Sarah C |last3=Nardone |first3=Anthony |last4=Burns |first4=Fiona |last5=Mercey |first5=Danielle |last6=Gilson |first6=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining a sexual history, a healthcare provider can encourage risk reduction by providing prevention [[counseling]]. Prevention counseling is most effective if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the person's culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs is usually offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received a diagnosis, have had an STI in the past year, or have [[multiple sex partners]].&lt;ref name=cdc2015&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26042815 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6403a1.htm |year=2015 |author1=Workowski |first1=K. A |title=Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2015 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=64 |issue=RR-03 |pages=1–137 |last2=Bolan |first2=G. A |author3=Centers for Disease Control Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt;

USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs. Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.&lt;ref name = cdc2015/&gt;

=== Vaccines ===

Vaccines are available that protect against some viral STIs, such as [[Hepatitis A vaccine|Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B]], and some types of [[HPV vaccine|HPV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/populations/msm.htm|title=Men Who Have Sex with Men {{!}} Populations and Settings {{!}} Division of Viral Hepatitis {{!}} CDC|last=|first=|date=31 May 2015|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccination before initiation of sexual contact is advised to assure maximal protection. The development of vaccines to protect against gonorrhea is ongoing.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190 |pmid=26579097 |pmc=4620152 |title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: The treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=6 |pages=1190 |year=2015 |last1=Baarda |first1=Benjamin I |last2=Sikora |first2=Aleksandra E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Condoms ===

Condoms and [[female condom]]s only provide protection when used properly as a barrier, and only to and from the area that they cover. Uncovered areas are still susceptible to many STIs.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the case of HIV, sexual transmission routes almost always involve the penis, as HIV cannot spread through unbroken skin; therefore, properly shielding the penis with a properly worn condom from the vagina or anus effectively stops HIV transmission. An infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of HIV would not be considered "sexually transmitted", but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact. This can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when presenting open, bleeding wounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Other STIs, even viral infections, can be prevented with the use of latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms as a barrier. Some microorganisms and viruses are small enough to pass through the pores in natural skin condoms, but are still too large to pass through latex or synthetic condoms.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Proper male condom usage entails:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

*Not putting the condom on too tight at the tip by leaving {{convert|1.5|cm|1}} room for [[ejaculation]]. Putting the condom on snug can and often leads to failure.
*Wearing a condom too loose can defeat the barrier
*Avoiding inverting or spilling a condom once worn, whether it has ejaculate in it or not
*If a user attempts to unroll the condom, but realizes they have it on the wrong side, then this condom may not be effective
*Being careful with the condom if handling it with long nails
*Avoiding the use of oil-based lubricants (or anything with oil in it) with latex condoms, as oil can eat holes into them
*Using flavored condoms for oral sex only, as the sugar in the flavoring can lead to yeast infections if used to penetrate

In order to best protect oneself and the partner from STIs, the old condom and its contents are be assumed to be infectious. Therefore, the old condom must be properly disposed of. A new condom is used for each act of intercourse, as multiple usage increases the chance of breakage, defeating the effectiveness as a barrier.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In case of female condoms, the device consists of two rings, one in each terminal portion. The larger ring should fit snugly over the cervix and the smaller ring remains outside the vagina, covering the vulva. This system provides some protection of the external genitalia.&lt;ref name="femenine condon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Planned Parenthood |title=Condón femenino |website=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/es/temas-de-salud/anticonceptivos/condon-femenino |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cap and cervical diaphragm ===

The cap was developed after the cervical diaphragm. Both cover the cervix and the main difference between the diaphragm and the cap is that the latter must be used only once, using a new one in each sexual act. The diaphragm, however, can be used more than once. These two devices partially protect against STDs (they do not protect against HIV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mscbs.gob.es/campannas/campanas10/embarazoescosade2/metodos-anticonceptivos.jsp |website=métodos contraceptivos y de prevención de las ITS |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonoxynol-9 ===

Researchers had hoped that [[nonoxynol-9]], a vaginal microbicide would help decrease STI risk.  Trials, however, have found it ineffective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003939 |pmid=12519623 |title=Nonoxynol-9 for preventing vaginal acquisition of sexually transmitted infections by women from men |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4 |pages=CD003939 |year=2002 |last1=Wilkinson |first1=David |last2=Ramjee |first2=Gita |last3=Tholandi |first3=Maya |last4=Rutherford |first4=George W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may put women at a higher risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. ''Healthy Choices for Fertility Control''. CreateSpace, Scotts Valley, CA, 2009. {{ISBN|1-4486-6472-1}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
Specific age groups, persons who participate in risky sexual behavior, or those have certain health conditions may require screening. The CDC recommends that sexually active women under the age of 25 and those over 25 at risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly.

[[File:STILL AT THE TOP OF THE SICK LIST - NARA - 515490.tif|thumb|right|[[World War II]] US Army poster warning of venereal disease]]

[[medical test|Testing]] may be for a single infection, or consist of a number of tests for a range of STIs, including tests for [[syphilis]], [[trichomonas]], gonorrhea, [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[herpes]], [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV test|HIV]]. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.

STI tests may be used for a number of reasons:

* as a [[diagnostic test]] to determine the cause of symptoms or illness
* as a [[screening test]] to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic [[infection]]s
* as a check that prospective sexual partners are free of disease before they engage in sex without [[safer sex]] precautions (for example, when starting a long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship, in [[Fluid bonding (sexual practice)|fluid bonding]], or for procreation).
* as a check prior to or during pregnancy, to prevent harm to the baby
* as a check after birth, to check that the baby has not caught an STI from the mother
* to prevent the use of infected [[blood donation|donated blood]] or [[organ donation|organ]]s
* as part of the process of [[contact tracing]] from a known infected individual
* as part of mass [[epidemiological]] surveillance

Early identification and treatment results in less chance to spread disease, and for some conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a [[window period]] after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that people turn to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jfprhc.2011.0060 |pmid=21454267 |title='The Cringe Report': Why patients don't dare ask questions, and what we can do about that |journal=Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–2 |year=2011 |last1=Quilliam |first1=Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"/&gt;

Prior to the invention of modern medicines, sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable, and treatment was limited to treating the symptoms of the disease. The first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at [[London Lock Hospital]].&lt;ref name="AIM-Albert"&gt;Archives in London and the M25 area ([http://www.aim25.ac.uk/index.stm AIM25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410043108/http://www.aim25.ac.uk/index.stm |date=2006-04-10 }}) [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=859&amp;inst_id=9 London Lock Hospital records]&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century, the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] were used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number of states concluded the [[Brussels Agreement (1924)|Brussels Agreement]], whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.

The first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted disease was [[Arsphenamine|salvarsan]], a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s, a large number of  sexually transmitted diseases became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STDs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

During this period, the importance of [[contact tracing]] in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the 1980s, first genital herpes and then [[AIDS]] emerged into the public consciousness as sexually transmitted diseases that could not be cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time [[HIV]] (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705329104 |pmid=17978186 |pmc=2141817 |title=The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the Americas and beyond |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=47 |pages=18566–70 |year=2007 |last1=Gilbert |first1=M.

E |last6=Worobey |first6=M |bibcode=2007PNAS..10418566G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition that AIDS threatened a global [[pandemic]] led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.

The effects of how social grouping strategies may reduce or increase the spread of disease is critical for the health of large groups of people. Places with large amounts of human interaction have a high risk for disease transmission. Social groups, community structures, and different cultures have different strategies and behaviors of reducing the spread of disease. Animals groups and humans that live in a place with high population density have an increased risk of disease prevalence. Some ways that large groups can help reduce the spread of disease is to have clean water supply and food supply. Also, another way groups can reduce spread of disease is through avoiding contact with individuals in the community that are ill.

== Non-human social groups and disease transmission ==
Studies have generated very mixed results regarding pathogen risk and prevalence in animal communities. One of the earliest measurements we have regarding a correlation between pathogen prevalence and animal social groups is with prairie dog wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoogland|first1=John L.|title=Aggression, Ectoparasitism, and Other Possible Costs of Prairie Dog (Sciuridae, Cynomys Spp.) Coloniality|journal=Behaviour|date=1 January 1979|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1163/156853979X00377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoogland, 1979, found in his study that as the size of the ward increased, the abundance of parasites in the burrow also increased. Several studies that followed in years since have also supported this finding that an increase in community size and density produces an increase of risk and prevalence of pathogenic infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=G.S.|title=The Social Organization of the Common Vampire Bat|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1985|volume=17|issue=2|doi=10.1007/BF00299244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=William M.|last2=Crook|first2=Janice R.|title=Barn Swallow Coloniality: A Net Cost for Group Breeding in the Adirondacks?|journal=Ecology|date=October 1987|volume=68|issue=5|pages=1373–1386|doi=10.2307/1939221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=Anders Pape|last2=Dufva|first2=Reija|last3=Allander|first3=Klas|title=Parasites and the Evolution of Host Social Behavior|journal=Advances in the study of Behavior|date=1993|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altizer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altizer|first1=Sonia|last2=Nunn|first2=Charles L.|last3=Thrall|first3=Peter H.|last4=Gittleman|first4=John L.|last5=Antonovics|first5=Janis|last6=Cunningham|first6=Andrew A.|last7=Cunnningham|first7=Andrew A.|last8=Dobson|first8=Andrew P.|last9=Ezenwa|first9=Vanessa|last10=Jones|first10=Kate E.|last11=Pedersen|first11=Amy B.|last12=Poss|first12=Mary|last13=Pulliam|first13=Juliet R.

Møller et al. (1993) speculate, however, that animals have evolved behaviors to mitigate the pathogenic risk of living in social groups. This includes grooming, rotating roost sites, mate selection, and aggressive behavior that is thought to reveal the presence of a depressed immune system in an individual.

Not all research has supported this connection between pathogens and sociality, however. In fact, an abundance of information on social mammals as well as avian groups has drawn the exact opposite conclusion,&lt;ref name="Griffin Nunn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=Randi H.|last2=Nunn|first2=Charles L.|title=Community structure and the spread of infectious disease in primate social networks|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=21 September 2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=779–800|doi=10.1007/s10682-011-9526-2|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8715733/Griffin_CommunityStructure.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snaith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snaith|first1=Tamaini V.|last2=Chapman|first2=Colin A.|last3=Rothman|first3=Jessica M.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Michael D.|title=Bigger groups have fewer parasites and similar cortisol levels: a multi-group analysis in red colobus monkeys|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=November 2008|volume=70|issue=11|pages=1072–1080|doi=10.1002/ajp.20601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Kenneth|last2=Knell|first2=Robert|last3=Boots|first3=Michael|last4=Koch-Osborne|first4=Jane|title=Group living and investment in immune defence: an interspecific analysis|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=January 2003|volume=72|issue=1|pages=133–143|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00680.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huang li"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Wei|last2=Li|first2=Chunguang|title=Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks with community structure|journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment|date=1 January 2007|volume=2007|issue=01|pages=P01014|doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2007/01/P01014|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2007/01/P01014/pdf|language=en|issn=1742-5468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salathe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salathé|first1=Marcel|last2=Jones|first2=James H.|title=Dynamics and Control of Diseases in Networks with Community Structure|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=8 April 2010|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e1000736|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000736|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000736|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wey 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wey|first1=Tina|last2=Blumstein|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Shen|first3=Weiwei|last4=Jordán|first4=Ferenc|title=Social network analysis of animal behaviour: a promising tool for the study of sociality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1 February 2008|volume=75|issue=2|pages=333–344|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.06.020|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnold|first1=Walter|last2=Anja|first2=V.

Similarly, Snaith et al. (2008) found that large social groups had even fewer parasites and they also measured lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that reduces immune function. Viral presence in [[scale-free network]]s without communities is higher, and in fact, the stronger the community structure of the animals is, the less likely a new outbreak will occur &lt;ref name="huang li" /&gt; This information has stimulated inquiry into the various social structures that characterize animals.
A few reasons for the contrary findings have been speculated. Due to the complex nature of social groups, studies that sample pathogen presence frequently fail to account for the fission-fusion nature that characterizes them: conflicts occur, new social bonds are made or die out, births and deaths of individuals occur, groups or individuals may migrate, networks may overlap or else be quite far apart from one another. Social groups are far from being stagnant and single measurements of pathogen presence can easily have misleading results.&lt;ref name="Salathe" /&gt; Wilson et al., 2003, also highlight the importance of accounting for shared ancestry among animals, which includes recent genetic relation as well as phylogenetic relationships. Parasite-host co-evolution is also important to consider, which may lead to an endemic presence of a pathogen in a group, or conversely, an immunity.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Many other factors confound the dynamics of social groups and pathogen spread that will be examined in the "Challenges" section.

== Community structures of social animals and implications for contagious infections ==
Griffin and Nunn's (2012) article on community structure simulated the introduction of a pathogen into various group structures and communities. Ultimately, "increased modularity mediates the elevated risk of parasitism associated with living in larger groups".&lt;ref name="Griffin Nunn" /&gt; Such structures are composed of nodes that may represent an individual or a unit of individuals in a group who have ties to other nodes. If the community structure is strong, the [[Eigenvector centrality|eigenvector]] (here represented as a pathogen) will experience a dying-out effect,&lt;ref name="Griffin Nunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang li" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wey 2008" /&gt; In geometrical structures of communities, a point represents a node, and a line between two nodes represents a social tie or interaction. In certain structures, the eigenvector may pass from one group to another, but the chances are limited. If a node is said to represent an individual, we can imagine that three potential outcomes will occur once that node has been infected. The individual may die, may become immune to future infection by the pathogen, or may live with the disease chronically until it is shed. In the first two outcomes, the pathogen will begin to experience a dying-out effect and transmission will begin to weaken. Wey et al. (2008) note that not all nodes are equal in weight within the community's structure, and therefore their level of risk for both reception and transmission may vary heavily. Furthermore, this "weight" of an individual can have interesting implications for transmission if a "key individual" is removed from the structure.&lt;ref name="wey 2008" /&gt; An extreme consequence of the removal of a key individual could be the collapse of the structure, but also may mean the loss of a "super-spreader", which is an individual with many ties inside a community as well as ties to other communities.&lt;ref name="Griffin Nunn" /&gt; Super-spreaders may be measured by their high levels of in-degree and out-degree numbers. In-degree is a reflection of the susceptibility of a node because it is a measurement of all the social ties a node is the recipient of, whereas out-degree is a reflection of the contagiousness of a node because it is a measurement of all the social ties generating from that node.&lt;ref name="wey 2008" /&gt;

=== Challenges ===
In addition to the natural factors that make measuring true pathogen risk and prevalence difficult (mentioned above) are behaviors like mate selection, stress-hormone levels, degree of promiscuity in a group, and diet.&lt;ref name="Altizer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Consideration of the effects humans have had on animal populations, both directly and indirectly, are paramount to understanding the spread of pathogens. Altizer et al. (2003) mention [[habitat fragmentation]], crowding of animals onto wildlife reserves, and encroachment upon formerly wild lands that leads to increases in contact between wildlife and domesticated species as well as humans. More generally, Daszak et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daszak|first1=P.|title=Emerging Infectious Diseases of Wildlife-- Threats to Biodiversity and Human Health|journal=Science|date=21 January 2000|volume=287|issue=5452|pages=443–449|doi=10.1126/science.287.5452.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; would include climate change as a tremendous confounding factor. We might furthermore speculate that certainly tourism and poaching have contributed their own to the contagion paradigm.

== Human social groups ==
Humans are surprisingly predictable when it comes to the range of possible social group structures. We occupy less than half of the social network structures that characterize non-human primates, however among primates we can be found to comfortably reside in the largest gamut for any one species.&lt;ref name="Rodseth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodseth|first1=Lars|last2=Wrangham|first2=Richard W.|last3=Harrigan|first3=Alisa M.|last4=Smuts|first4=Barbara B.|last5=Dare|first5=Ron|last6=Fox|first6=Robin|last7=King|first7=Barbara J.|last8=Lee|first8=P. C.|last9=Foley|first9=R. A.|last10=Muller|first10=J. C.|last11=Otterbein|first11=Keith F.|last12=Strier|first12=Karen B.|author12-link=Karen B. Strier|last13=Turke|first13=Paul W.|last14=Wolpoff|first14=Milford H.|title=The Human Community as a Primate Society [and Comments]|journal=Current Anthropology|date=1 January 1991|volume=32|issue=3|pages=221–254|jstor=2743773}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few other notable characteristics make humans unique when considering community structure. We are the only primates that keep consanguineal relationships, even after departure from a natal group, and retain ties with kin living in different social groups.&lt;ref name="Rodseth" /&gt; Although some non-human primates form temporary groups of "roaming bachelors", these social groups do not come anywhere near the fairly common social structures of permanent religious celibates. Some other examples of aberrant community and social structures in humans include men or women absenting for long periods in war or trade, "raiding" for wives that results in total displacement, eunuchs, and isolated stigmatized groups (criminals, lepers, etc.). A further oddity to consider regarding human social behavior is the "creation" of kin out of unrelated individuals, including the nomination of "godparents", step-families, and exceptionally close friends that assume a role of a relative. All of these examples have complicated effects on the measurement and understanding of pathogenic propagation within the human realm.

== Human social groups and disease implications ==
Invasion by a pathogen in any community, human or otherwise, requires a two-step process.&lt;ref name="Hu 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Hao|last2=Nigmatulina|first2=Karima|last3=Eckhoff|first3=Philip|title=The scaling of contact rates with population density for the infectious disease models|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|date=1 August 2013|volume=244|issue=2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.013|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2013.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, there must be importation of the pathogen by means of migration. This may occur through a traveling node, or a vector, or may occur when an entire community relocates. Second, the number of infections must rise due to the social contacts within that population. For humans, this process can appear extremely chaotic. "Local public sites with extremely high population density such as train stations, or large social, political, or religious mass gatherings are regarded as high-risk…".&lt;ref name="Hu 2013"/&gt;
In addition to those mentioned by Hu et al., 2013, we can add airports, schools, camps, and holiday shopping bedlam. An exceptionally important note to make here is that these heavily dense situations involve mainly strangers, as opposed to close social contacts that operate in a structured network. Especially with respect to modern technological advances that allow us to do such things as pass over enormous geological features, it would appear we are ripe for constant global pandemic. We are left to wonder, then, how human society can possibly persist so fruitfully considering the constant violations we make of strong community structures that would act as a buffer. Before examining research that addresses that question, it is important to acknowledge and understand the interwoven nature of human culture and epidemiology.

== Cultural gatherings and risk ==
The first large human social activities, trailed by major disease outbreaks that have been documented occurred by fecal-oral route.&lt;ref name="Abubakar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abubakar|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Gautret|first2=Philippe|last3=Brunette|first3=Gary W|last4=Blumberg|first4=Lucille|last5=Johnson|first5=David|last6=Poumerol|first6=Gilles|last7=Memish|first7=Ziad A|last8=Barbeschi|first8=Maurizio|last9=Khan|first9=Ali S|title=Global perspectives for prevention of infectious diseases associated with mass gatherings|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=12|issue=1|pages=66–74|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(11)70246-8|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contaminated food or water by fecal matter can cause devastating effects and spread with extreme rapidity. They are, of course, not the only types of infection that threaten large gatherings of people. Respiratory infections, sexually transmitted infections, and measles have all been measured as potential infections resulting from mass gatherings.&lt;ref name="Abubakar"/&gt; Social gatherings that have been linked to outbreaks include the 1918 Great Pandemic, the Asian Flu Pandemic of 1957, a 1987 outbreak of multi-drug resistant shigellosis in North Carolina that infected over 50% of event attendees, a 1992 outbreak of Campylobacter in the UK, a 1993 Hepatitis A outbreak at a youth camp in Australia, two separate outbreaks  of meningococcal meningitis at the 2000 and 2001 Hajj, a 2008 influenza outbreak in Sydney, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (which followed a large Easter gathering in Mexico).&lt;ref name="Abubakar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rainey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rainey|first1=Jeanette J.|last2=Phelps|first2=Tiffani|last3=Shi|first3=Jianrong|title=Mass Gatherings and Respiratory Disease Outbreaks in the United States – Should We Be Worried? Results from a Systematic Literature Review and Analysis of the National Outbreak Reporting System|journal=PLOS ONE|date=18 August 2016|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e0160378|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160378|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160378|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey et al. (2016) identified a total of 72 mass-gathering related respiratory outbreaks between 2005 and 2014. Many of these outbreaks led to further outbreaks within the cities that infected individuals returned home to after the events. Particularly the epidemiological consequences of the [[Hajj]] are notable because of the range of dissemination that attendees have when they return from the pilgrimage. Infected individuals may return to their homes far from the source of the outbreak, and into communities that are especially vulnerable to a disease not characteristic of that community. Health response teams may be less equipped to manage the spread of the foreign pathogen, and the people may be less knowledgeable about risks and symptoms. Diseases such a [[tuberculosis]] have long incubation periods, which creates another obstacle since it separates the point of infection from the start of illness and therefore obscures the connection.
Intervention and mitigation are possible for such large events, but involve very expensive and complex measures. Vaccinations are highly effective, but it is extremely costly to attempt to vaccinate large hordes of individuals. In a study of livestock populations, Hu et al., 2013 observed important patterns for vaccination efforts. When deaths from infection occur, or a method of culling is used, social networks will alter and individuals will spread out. Because of this, carefully designed vaccination efforts are significantly more effective and cheaper and must be implemented as fast as possible in order to contain the pathogen. Relatively new methods, such as tracking mobile phone data, have been used to glean information on effective strategies for containment in the situation of mass gatherings.&lt;ref name="Finger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finger|first1=Flavio|last2=Genolet|first2=Tina|last3=Mari|first3=Lorenzo|last4=de Magny|first4=Guillaume Constantin|last5=Manga|first5=Noël Magloire|last6=Rinaldo|first6=Andrea|last7=Bertuzzo|first7=Enrico|title=Mobile phone data highlights the role of mass gatherings in the spreading of cholera outbreaks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=7 June 2016|volume=113|issue=23|pages=6421–6426|doi=10.1073/pnas.1522305113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finger et al. (2016) state "human mobility is undisputedly one of the main spreading mechanisms of infectious disease". In their study, cell phone data was used to track the migration of people for the Grand Magal de Touba, a religious pilgrimage event that occurs in Senegal. Figure 6 illustrates the findings of this study and identifies areas that are paramount for targeting in an epidemiological prevention effort.

== Behavioral immune system ==
Schaller and Park (2011) used the term ''the Behavioral Immune System'' to account for observable activities that humans utilize in the face of pathogen threat. Whereas non-human social animals appear to largely rely upon distinctly organized social structures to combat the threat of diseases, it is evident such systems would be strained to apply in most modern human societies. Schaller and Park (2011) describe "perceptual cues" that humans use that will trigger aversive behavior toward other individuals. For example, people who appear to be ill may stimulate avoidance behavior in those around them, particularly if the others around them have temporarily suppressed immune systems,&lt;ref name="Schaller and Park"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaller|first1=M.|last2=Park|first2=J. H.|title=The Behavioral Immune System (and Why It Matters)|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=15 April 2011|volume=20|issue=2|pages=99–103|doi=10.1177/0963721411402596}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaller Murray"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=D. R.|last2=Trudeau|first2=R.|last3=Schaller|first3=M.|title=On the Origins of Cultural Differences in Conformity: Four Tests of the Pathogen Prevalence Hypothesis|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=9 February 2011|volume=37|issue=3|pages=318–329|doi=10.1177/0146167210394451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Bao-Pei|last2=Chang|first2=Lei|title=The social impact of pathogen threat: How disease salience influences conformity|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1 July 2012|volume=53|issue=1|pages=50–54|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.02.023|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2012.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson et al., 2003, speculated that gregarious species may invest less overall in their immune functions because so many of the body's resources must go to support somatic growth and competition among mates. One potential explanation, therefore, for human hypersensitivity to the perception of disease threat is that we are left relatively vulnerable by our under-provisioned immune systems. Schaller and Park (2011) also make a connection between the experience of disgust and things that do pose actual threat of pathogen risk, however this "disgust" experience has a tendency to be over-applied rather than under-applied in the favor of the individual's health and is therefore triggered by things that resemble disgust-inducing objects or actions. Such research has enormous implications for the explanation of aspects ranging from cultural diet variance to conformity and xenophobia. Schaller and Murray (2008) ran a comparison against research by Grunier et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Jeslin J. L.|last2=Capozzoli|first2=Monica|last3=Sato|first3=Mitsuharu|last4=Watthanaworawit|first4=Wanitda|last5=Ling|first5=Clare L.|last6=Mauduit|first6=Marjorie|last7=Malleret|first7=Benoît|last8=Grüner|first8=Anne-Charlotte|last9=Tan|first9=Rosemary|last10=Nosten|first10=François H.|last11=Snounou|first11=Georges|last12=Rénia|first12=Laurent|last13=Ng|first13=Lisa F. P.|title=An Integrated Lab-on-Chip for Rapid Identification and Simultaneous Differentiation of Tropical Pathogens|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date=31 July 2014|volume=8|issue=7|pages=e3043|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003043|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003043|issn=1935-2735}}&lt;/ref&gt; that displayed the variability of the prevalence of pathogens on a geographic scale. Schaller and Murray (2008) found overlap in cultural differences that included food preparation, mate selection and family structure, and sociosexual practices. In regions where infectious disease threat was lower, people trended toward more liberal sexual practices, more extroverted personalities, and less "self-conscious" behavior. In the 2011 article "the Behavioral Immune System", the authors discuss how avoidance behaviors can also be triggered when an individual witnesses another individual violating social norms, hence a general trend toward ethnocentrism and wariness of foreigners. Especially during times of known pathogenic outbreak, this can be so extreme as to manifest itself in the form of xenophobia. Wu and Chang's 2011 study elucidated trends toward conformity that they believe may have evolved as a protective dynamic against the introduction of contagions.

Although research in this area is still very new, it provides a logical and cogent connection between particulars of human sociality and disease transmission. It furthermore stimulates key insight into cultural dynamics that assist in human survival.

A '''solar still''' [[distillation| evaporates the water with subsatnces dissolved in it
]] water, using the heat of the [[Sun]] to evaporate water so that it may be cooled and collected, thereby purifying it. They are used in areas where drinking water is unavailable, so that clean water is obtained from dirty water or from plants by exposing them to sunlight.

There are many types of solar still, including large scale [[concentrated solar still]]s and '''condensation traps''' (better known as '''moisture traps''' amongst [[survivalists]]). In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic or glass. The pure [[water vapor]] condenses on the cool inside surface and drips down, where it is collected and removed.

Distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing into water again as it cools and can then be collected. This process leaves behind impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is pure distilled water.

== History ==
Condensation traps have been in use since the pre-[[Incan]] peoples inhabited the [[Andes]].

Today a method for gathering water in moisture traps is still taught within the [[Military of Argentina|Argentinian Army]] for use by specialist units expected to conduct extended patrols of more than a week's duration in the arid border areas of the Andes.

==Uses==
Solar stills are used in cases where rain, piped, or well water is impractical, such as in remote homes or during power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anjaneyulu|first=L.|last2=Kumar|first2=E. Arun|last3=Sankannavar|first3=Ravi|last4=Rao|first4=K.

== Methods ==
Several methods of trapping condensation exist:

=== First method ===
This method was first used by the peoples of the Andes. A pit is dug into the earth, at the bottom of which is placed the receptacle that will be used to catch the condensed water. Small branches are placed with one of their ends inside the receptacle and their other ends up over the edge of the pit, forming a funnel to direct the condensed water into the receptacle. A lid is then built over this funnel, using more small branches, leaves, grasses, etc. The completed trap is left overnight, and moisture can be collected from the receptacle in the morning.

This method relies on the formation of [[dew]] or [[frost]] on the receptacle, funnel, and lid. Forming dew collects on and runs down the outside of the funnel and into the receptacle. This water would typically [[evaporate]] with the morning sun and thus vanish, but the lid traps the evaporating water and raises the [[humidity]] within the trap, reducing the amount of water that is lost. The shade produced by the lid also reduces the temperature within the trap, which further reduces the rate of water loss to evaporation.

=== Modern method ===
Today, with the advent of [[plastic]] sheeting, the moisture trap has become more efficient.

The method is very similar to that described above, but a single sheet of plastic is used instead of branches and leaves. The greater efficiency of this type of trap arises from the waterproof nature of the plastic, which doesn't let any water vapour pass through it (some water vapour escapes through the leaves and branches of the first method). This efficiency requires a certain amount of diligence of the part of the user, in that the plastic sheet must be firmly attached to the ground on all sides; this is often accomplished by using stones to weight the sheet down and/or covering the edges of the plastic sheet with earth (such as that dug out to make the hole in which the trap sits). Weighting the centre of the plastic sheet down with a stone forms the funnel via which the condensed water will run into the receptacle.

=== Transpiration method ===
Water can be obtained by placing clear plastic bags over the leafy branch of a ''non-poisonous'' tree and tightly closing the bag's open end around the branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Meagher|first1=Bert|last2=Reid|first2=Dennis|last3=Harvey|first3=Ross|title=Aids to survival: a handbook on outback survival|date=2007|publisher=Western Australia Police Academy|location=Maylands, W.A.|isbn=0-646-36303-4|page=24|edition=25th|url=http://www.vks737.on.net/pdfs/survival.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any holes in the bag must be sealed to prevent the loss of water vapour.

During photosynthesis plants lose water through a process called [[transpiration]]. A clear plastic bag sealed around a branch allows photosynthesis to continue, but traps the evaporating water causing the [[vapor pressure]] of water to rise to a point where it begins to condense on the surface of the plastic bag. Gravity then causes the water to run to the lowest part of the bag. Water is collected by [[tap (valve)|tapping]] the bag and then resealing it. The leaves will continue to produce water as the roots draw it from the ground and photosynthesis occurs.

The vapor pressure of water in the sealed bag can rise so high that the leaves can no longer transpire, consequently when using this method, the water should be drained off every two hours and stored. Tests indicate that if this is not done the leaves stop producing water.

If there are no large trees in the area, clumps of grass or small bushes can be placed inside the bag. If this is done the foliage will have to be replaced at regular intervals when water production is reduced, particularly if the foliage must be uprooted to place it in the bag.

Efficiency is greatest when the bag receives maximum sunshine at all times. Exposed roots are tested for water content. Soft, pulpy roots will yield the greatest amount of liquid for the least amount of effort.

== Condensation trap efficiency ==
Condensation traps are not in themselves a sustainable source of water; they are sources for extending or supplementing existing water sources or supplies, and should not be relied on to provide a person's daily requirement for water, since a trap measuring 40&amp;nbsp;cm (16 inches) in diameter by 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12 inches) deep will only yield around 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;ml per day.

One method to increase the water output is to [[urinate]] into the pit before placing the receptacle in. This increases the moisture content of the earth, reducing the amount of water vapour that the earth can subsequently absorb.

==Materials==
A simple basin-type solar still can be constructed with 2–4 stones, plastic film or transparent [[glass]], a central weight to make a point and a container for the condensate. A cubic hole in moist ground is created of about 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12 inches) on each side.  Into the centre of this hole, a collection container is placed. Then a sheet of plastic film is stretched over the hole. Stills can also be made from water bottles or plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructables.com/id/Uncle-Johns-portable-solar-water-distiller-Fo/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

===Transpiration bag===
An alternative method of the solar still is called the transpiration bag.&lt;ref&gt;Munilla, R. [http://www.practicalsurvivor.com/solarstill Solar Still] ''Practical Survivor'' Retrieved April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The bag is a simple plastic bag and it folds over a stemmed plant with a corner pointing down to allow the condensate to pool.  From there a person can remove the water by taking the bag off and pouring the water out or one can make a tiny incision into the corner to drip water into a cup.  Its advantage over the basin type solar still mentioned before is that it only requires a bag like one can get at the grocery store.  It doesn’t need to be completely transparent.  A disadvantage of the transpiration bag is the requirement for a plant in direct sunlight or heat to take the condensate.

In a study performed in 2009{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}, variations to the angle of plastic and increasing the internal temperature of the hole versus the outside temperature made for better water production.  Other methods used included using a brine to absorb water from and adding dyes to the [[brine]] to change the amount of solar radiation absorbed into the system.  During the adjusted tilt angle experiment, the different angles used by the different researchers created different results and it was difficult for any of them to get a definite answer.  In the graph, a bell curve is observed with the maximum water output being at 30 degrees angle adjustment.  Each brine depth created a different amount of water and it is noted on the graph that about an inch is optimal with a decreasing trend if more is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abdul Jabbar N. Khalifa|author2=Ahmad M. Hamood|title=Performance correlations for basin type solar stills |journal=Desalination |volume=249 |issue=1 |date=30 November 2009 |pages=24–28 |issn=0011-9164 |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2009.06.011 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916409007358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wick still===
[[File:Wick solar still.png|thumb|This image shows how a wick basin solar still works.]]
The “wick” type solar still is a glass-topped box constructed and held at angle to allow sunlight in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=V. Manikandan|author2=K. Shanmugasundaram|author3=S. Shanmugan|author4=B. Janarthanan|author5=J. Chandrasekaran |title=Wick type solar stills: a review |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=20 |date=April 2013|pages=322–335 |issn=1364-0321 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.046 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032112006600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt water poured in from the top is heated by sunlight, evaporating the water. It condenses on the underside of the glass and drips to the bottom. A pool of brine in the still is attached to the wicks which separates the water into banks to increase surface area for heating.  The distilled water comes out of the bottom and, depending on the quality of construction, most of the salt has been purged from the water.  The more wicks, the more heat can be transferred to the salt water and more product can be made.  A plastic net can also catch salt water before it falls into the container and give it more time to heat up and separate into brine and water.  The wick type solar still is made vapor-tight, as in the vapor does not escape to the atmosphere.  To aid in absorbing more heat, some wicks are blackened to take in more heat.  Glass’s absorption of heat is negligible compared to plastic at higher temperatures.  A problem, depending on application, with glass is that it is not flexible if the solar still is not a standard shape.

==Practical considerations==
The pit still may be inefficient as a survival still, requiring too much construction effort for the water produced.&lt;ref name="Alloway2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=David|title=Desert survival skills|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0pXR2qylP0C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=9 May 2013|date=2000|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-79226-5|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In desert environments water needs can exceed {{convert|1|gal|L}} per day for a person at rest, while still production may average {{convert|8|USfloz|mL}} per day.&lt;ref name="Alloway2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Force2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Air Force|title=U.S. Air Force Survival Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYz4ODJ5XhsC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=9 May 2013|date=1 April 2008|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-60239-245-8|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with tools, digging a hole requires energy and makes a person lose water through [[perspiration]]; this means that even several days of water collection may not be equal to the water lost in its construction.&lt;ref name="Force2008" /&gt;

==Seawater still==
In 1952 the United States military developed a portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean, which comprises an inflatable 24-inch plastic ball that floats on the ocean, with a flexible tube coming out the side. A separate plastic bag hangs from attachment points on the outer bag. Seawater is poured into the inner bag from an opening in the ball's neck.  Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the side tube that leads to bottom of the inflatable ball.  It was stated in magazine articles that on a good day 2.5 US quarts (2.4 l) of fresh water could be produced.  On an overcast day, 1.5 US quarts (1.4 l)  was produced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8dwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lYK0T7T1Es2dgQe5iMgH&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Sea Water Still"]. ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1952, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sea water stills are included in some [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]] [[survival kit]]s, though manual [[reverse osmosis]] desalinators have mostly replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=a0f2e9cd317c57ab0333b5da36c95319&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 |title=Manual Reverse Osmosis Desalinator - Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source, USAF |work=fbo.gov |date=2012 |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distilling urine ==
Using a condensation trap to [[distillation|distill]] urine will remove the urea and salt, providing one with drinkable water as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grantham|first=Donald F.|date=March 2, 2001|title=A Source of Wilderness Novice Survival Skills|publisher=Xlbris Corp|page=119|isbn=0738836826|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T-2 Mycotoxin''' (pronounced as 'Tee-Two') is a [[trichothecene]] [[mycotoxin]].  It is a naturally occurring [[mold]] byproduct of ''[[Fusarium]]'' spp. [[fungus]] which is toxic to humans and animals. The clinical condition it causes is ''alimentary toxic [[aleukia]]'' and a host of symptoms related to organs as diverse as the skin, airway, and stomach. Ingestion may come from consumption of moldy whole [[grain]]s. T-2 can be [[Absorption (skin)|absorbed]] through human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 22749975 | title = Human skin penetration of selected model mycotoxins | year = 2012 | last1 = Boonen| first1 = Jente| last2 = Malysheva| first2 = Svetlana V.| last3 = Taevernier| first3 = Lien| last4 = Diana Di Mavungu| first4 = José| last5 = De Saeger | first5 = Sarah| last6 = De Spiegeleer | first6 = Bart| journal = Toxicology| volume = 301 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 21–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2012.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no significant systemic effects are expected after dermal contact in normal [[agriculture|agricultural]] or residential environments, local skin effects can not be excluded. Hence, skin contact with T-2 should be limited.

==History==
Alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA), a disease which is caused by trichothecenes like T-2 mycotoxin, killed many thousands of USSR citizens in the [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg District]] in the 1940s. It was reported that the mortality rate was 10% of the entire population in that area. During the 1970s it was proposed that the consumption of [[food contamination|contaminated]] food was the cause of this mass poisoning. Because of World War II, harvesting of grains was delayed and food was scarce in Russia. This resulted in the consumption of grain that was contaminated with ''Fusarium'' molds, which produce T-2 mycotoxin.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, J. L., An introduction to mycotoxins. In Mycotoxin prevention and control in foodgrains, 1989.{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is still controversial, it is suspected that T-2 mycotoxin has been used as a [[chemical weapon|chemical warfare agent]] from the 1970s till the 1990s. Based on the descriptions of eyewitnesses and victims, T-2 mycotoxin was mostly delivered by low-flying aircraft that released a yellow oily liquid. Hence, this phenomenon is also named "[[yellow rain]]".

In 1982, the [[US Secretary of State]] [[Alexander Haig]] and his successor [[George P. Shultz]] accused the Soviet Union of using T-2 mycotoxin as a chemical weapon in Laos (1975–81), Kampuchea (1979–81), and [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]] (1979–81), where it allegedly caused thousands of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Shultz, G. P. Chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan: an update; The United States Secretary Of State: Washington, D.C., 1982.{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although several US chemical weapons experts have identified "yellow rain" samples from Laos as trichothecenes, other experts believe that this exposure was due to naturally occurring T-2 mycotoxin in contaminated foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.D. |title='Yellow rain' or natural toxins? |journal=Nature |volume=301 |issue=5902 |year=1983 |pages=651 |bibcode=1983Natur.301Q.651C |doi=10.1038/301651a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second alternative theory was developed by Harvard biologist [[Matthew Meselson]], who proposed that the "yellow rain" found in Southeast Asia originates from the excrement of jungle bees.&lt;ref&gt;Yellow Rain Falls. The New York Times 3 September 1987.{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indication for this theory came from finding high levels of [[pollen]] in the collected samples, giving the substance its yellow color. It was also found that jungle bees in this area fly collectively in great numbers, at altitudes too high to be easily seen, producing showers of feces that could have been mistaken for sprays from aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meselson |first1=Matthew S. |first2=Julian Perry |last2=Robinson |chapter=The Yellow Rain Affair: Lessons from a Discredited Allegation |chapterurl=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/18277/yellow_rain_affair.html |pages=72–96 |date=June 2008 |editor1-first=Anne L. |editor1-last=Clunan |editor2-first=Peter R. |editor2-last=Lavoy |editor3-first=Susan B. |editor3-last=Martin |title=Terrorism, War, or Disease?

T-2 mycotoxin is also thought to be a cause of [[Gulf War Syndrome]]. US troops suffered from mycotoxicosis-like symptoms after an Iraqi missile detonated in a US military camp in Saudi Arabia during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the Persian Gulf War, in 1991. It has been shown that Iraq researched trichothecene mycotoxins, among other substances, and thus was capable of its possession and its usage in [[chemical warfare]]. Nevertheless, much of the key information from these incidents remains classified, leaving these matters still unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zilinskas |first1=Raymond A. |title=Iraq's Biological Weapons: The past as future? |journal=JAMA |volume=278 |issue=5 |pages=418–24 |year=1997 |pmid=9244334 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03550050080037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical properties ==
This compound has a tetracyclic [[sesquiterpenoid]] 12,13-epoxytrichothene ring system, which relates it to the trichothecenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|830892|CBRNE - T-2 Mycotoxins}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are generally very stable and are not degraded during storage/milling and cooking/processing of food. They do not degrade at high temperatures either. This compound has an epoxide ring, and several acetyl and hydroxyl groups on its side chains. These features are mainly responsible for the biological activity of the compound and make it highly toxic. T-2 mycotoxin is able to inhibit [[DNA synthesis|DNA]] and [[RNA synthesis]] [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]]&lt;ref&gt;Marin, S.; Ramos, A. J.; Cano-Sancho, G.; Sanchis, V., Mycotoxins: Occurrence, toxicology, and exposure assessment. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2013, 60 (0), 218-237&lt;/ref&gt; and can induce [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Torp, M.; Langseth, W., Production of T-2 toxin by a Fusarium resembling Fusarium poae. Mycopathologia 1999, 147 (2), 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in vivo the compound rapidly metabolizes to HT-2 mycotoxin (a major [[metabolite]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Q. H.; Wang, X.; Yang, W.; Nussler, A. K.; Xiong, L. Y.; Kuca, K.; Dohnal, V.; Zhang, X. J.; Yuan, Z. H., Oxidative stress-mediated cytotoxicity and metabolism of T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol in animals and humans: an update. Archives of toxicology 2014, 88 (7), 1309-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The [[toxicity]] of T-2 toxin is due to its 12,13-epoxy ring.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Y.; Wang, Z.; Beier, R. C.; Shen, J.; De Smet, D.; De Saeger, S.; Zhang, S., T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin: review of toxicity, metabolism, and analytical methods. Journal of agricultural and food chemistry 2011, 59 (8), 3441-53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epoxide]]s are in general toxic compounds; these react with [[nucleophile]]s and then undergo further [[enzymatic reaction]]s. The [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of epoxides can lead to reactions with endogenous compounds and cellular constituents like DNA bases and proteins.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Timbrell, Principles of Biochemical Toxicologie. CRC Press: 2009; Vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;                          
These reactions could be the reason for the noticed actions and effects of T-2 mycotoxin. The toxic compound influences the [[metabolism]] of [[cell membrane|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s, leads to an increase of liver lipid [[peroxidase]]s and has an inhibiting effect on DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition it can bind to an integral part of the 60s ribosomal subunit, [[peptidyltransferase]], thereby inhibiting [[protein synthesis]]. 
These effects are thought to be the explanation for T-2 toxin inducing apoptosis (cell death) in different tissues as the [[immune system]], the gastrointestinal tissue and also fetal tissue. With regard to apoptosis there has been noticed that the level of the pro-apoptotic factor Bas (Bcl-2-associated X protein) was increased and the level of Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic factor, was decreased in human chrondocytes ([[cartilage]] cells).  When exposed to T-2 mycotoxin. Furthermore, the level of Fas, an apoptosis-related cell-surface antigen and p53, a protein regulating the cell cycle, were increased.

==Metabolism==
T-2 toxin is metabolized after ingestion. In vivo studies showed that the most occurring reactions are [[ester]] [[hydrolysis]] and [[hydroxylation]] of the isovaleryl group. Deepoxidation and [[glucuronide]] conjugation do also occur. Ht-2 is the main metabolite. For the hydroxylation, the cytochrome p450 enzyme complex is suggested to be involved. T-2 triol and T-2 tetraol are most likely to be formed via [[acetylcholine esterase]]s. Some of the metabolic reactions of the mycotoxin are performed by the [[microflora]] in the gut.  The formed metabolites in these reactions are species- and pH-dependent. The ester cleavages are however performed by the mammal itself and not by the microflora. In [[red blood cell]]s T-2 mycotoxin is metabolized to [[neosolaniol]] and in [[white blood cell]]s to HT-2 via hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxylesterases.T-2 toxin has a very short half-life.

==Synthesis==
T-2 mycotoxin is produced naturally by Fusarium fungi of which the most important species are: F. sporotrichioides, F. langsethiae, F. acuminatum and F. poae.  These fungi are found in grains such as [[barley]], [[wheat]] and [[oats]]. The production of this compound for research and commercial purposes is generally accomplished by cultivating some strain of T-2 mycotoxin producing fungi on [[agar plate]]s. On these agar plates the fungi appear powdery and can yield substantial amounts of T-2 mycotoxin. For the isolation of the compound [[high pressure liquid chromatography]] is commonly used (HPLC).&lt;ref&gt;T-2 toxin from fusarium sp., powder, ≥98% (HPLC). http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/t4887?lang=en&amp;region=NL (accessed 25 march).
&lt;/ref&gt; No methods for chemically synthesizing T-2 mycotoxin have been established as of yet.

==Toxicity==

=== Exposure ===
Humans and animals are generally exposed to T-2 mycotoxins through food. Certain grains can contain the toxin which makes it a threat to human health and an economic burden.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, Q.; Wu, G.; He, Q.; Tang, H.; Wang, Y., The toxicity of acute exposure to T-2 toxin evaluated by the metabonomics technique. Molecular bioSystems 2015, 11 (3), 882-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most biological toxins T-2 mycotoxin can be absorbed through intact skin. The compound can be delivered via food, water, droplets, [[aerosol]]s and smoke from various dispersal systems. This makes it a potential [[biological weapon]], however large amounts of the compound are required for a [[lethal dose]]. T-2 mycotoxin has an [[LD50]] of approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight

The [[EFSA]] estimates that the mean exposure of T-2 in the EU lies between 12 and 43&amp;nbsp;ng/kg bw/day.&lt;ref&gt;Escrivá, L.; Font, G.; Manyes, L., In vivo toxicity studies of fusarium mycotoxins in the last decade: A review. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2015, 78 (0), 185-206.&lt;/ref&gt; This range is below the TDI of 100&amp;nbsp;ng/ kg body weight for the sum of HT-2 and T-2 toxins which is used by the EFSA.

=== Toxic effects ===
T-2 is highly toxic when inhaled.  Acute toxic symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, skin irritation, itching, rash, blisters, bleeding and [[dyspnea]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalantari H, M. M., REVIEW ON T-2 TOXIN. Jundishapur Journal of Natural Pharmaceutical Products 2010, 5 (1), 26-38.&lt;/ref&gt; If the individual is exposed to T-2 over a longer period alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) develops.

At first the patient experiences a burning sensation in the mouth, throat and stomach. After a few days the person will suffer from an acute [[gastroenteritis]] that will last for 3 to 9 days. Within 9 weeks the [[bone marrow]] will slowly degenerate. Also the skin starts bleeding and the total number of [[leukocyte]]s decreases. Problems with the nervous system can occur.

In the end the following symptoms might occur: a high fever, [[petechial haemorrhage]], [[necrosis]] of muscles and skin, bacterial infections of the necrotic tissue, [[enlarged lymph nodes]]. There is the possibility of [[asphyxiation]] because of [[larynx|laryngeal]] [[oedema]] and [[stenosis]] of the [[glottis]]. The lack of oxygen is then the cause of death.  Otherwise the patient will die of [[bronchial pneumonia]] and lung bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Semple, A. S. F., P.A. Hicks and J.V. Lozare, Mycotoxin prevention and control in foodgrains. UNDP/FAO Regional Network Inter-Country Cooperation on Preharvest Technology and Quality Control of Foodgrains (REGNET) and the ASEAN Grain Postharvest Programme: Thailand, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on animals ===
T-2 mycotoxin is also toxic to animals. The compound is known for having lethal and sub-lethal effects on farm animals. It is often found in contaminated cereal grains that are fed to these animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cortinovis, C.; Pizzo, F.; Spicer, L. J.; Caloni, F., Fusarium mycotoxins: effects on reproductive function in domestic animals--a review. Theriogenology 2013, 80 (6), 557-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the toxic effects are shared between humans and animals. After exposing [[zebra fish]] embryos to a concentration of 20&amp;nbsp;µmol/L or higher [[malformation]] and [[mortality rate]]s increased. The malformations included tail deformities, [[cardiovascular]] defects and changes in behavior in early stages of life. This is the result of an increase in the amount of epoxides, which causes cell apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, G.; Wang, Y.; Yuan, X.; Zhang, T.; Zhao, J.; Huang, L.; Peng, S., T-2 toxin induces developmental toxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish embryos. Journal of environmental sciences 2014, 26 (4), 917-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that T-2-toxin causes lipid peroxidation in rats after feeding it to them.

The compound also seems to reduce the fertility of ewes and heifers. Research has shown that a high dose of T-2 delays the [[ovulation]] due to a delayed [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] maturation. This possibly retards the following [[luteinisation]], which makes it impossible for female animals to conceive.

T-2 also has an effect on the fertility of bulls. In 1998 it was discovered that moldy hay influenced the quality of semen of bulls. Analysis of the moldy hay showed that T-2 was present. The compound decreased [[sperm motility|motility]] and testosterone levels and increased the amount of morphological abnormalities within the sperm cells.

The liver is another target for the mycotoxin. It is one of the first organs where the compound passes through after ingestion. Here it causes a reduced expression of CYP1A proteins in rabbits, pigs and rats. CYP3A activity decreases in pigs too. These enzymes help metabolize drugs that pass through the liver. Decrease in the activity could lead to an increase of unmetabolized drugs in the plasma. This can have a dangerous effect on an animal's health.&lt;ref&gt;Goossens, J.; De Bock, L.; Osselaere, A.; Verbrugghe, E.; Devreese, M.; Boussery, K.; Van Bocxlaer, J.; De Backer, P.; Croubels, S., The mycotoxin T-2 inhibits hepatic cytochrome P4503A activity in pigs. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2013, 57, 54-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the mentioned effects happen when T-2 is ingested in high doses. Animals are able to metabolize the compound with enzymes from the CYP3A family, just like humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1101">The '''Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]]. It bans the open display of tobacco products in shops and bans the use of [[cigarette vending machines]]. The Act established the '''Scottish Tobacco Retailers Register'''.

The Act introduced stronger measures against shops who sell tobacco to people under 18. The legal age to carry tobacco products in Scotland is 16. If a police officer suspects that someone under 16 is in possession of cigarettes, tobacco or cigarette papers in a public place then they can confiscate the items.

'''Tobacco package warning messages''' are [[Warning label|warning messages]] that appear on the packaging of [[Cigarette pack|cigarette]]s and other [[tobacco products]] concerning their [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]]. They have been implemented in an effort to enhance the public's awareness of the harmful effects of smoking. In general, warnings used in different countries try to emphasize the same messages. Warnings for some countries are listed below. Such warnings have been required in [[tobacco advertising]] for many years.

The [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], adopted in 2003, requires such package warning messages to promote awareness against smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]],  Article 9 and 11&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review summarises that "There is clear evidence that tobacco package health warnings increase consumers’ knowledge about the health consequences of tobacco use." The warning messages "contribute to changing consumers’ attitudes towards tobacco use as well as changing consumers’ behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

[[File:Canadian Number 7 cigarette package scan.png|thumbnail|A Canadian ''Number 7'' cigarette package, with 1 of the 16 warnings found on packages between 2000 and 2011]]

Canada has had three phases of tobacco warning labels. The first set of warnings was introduced in 1989 under the Tobacco Products Control Act, and required warnings to be printed on all tobacco products sold legally in Canada. The set consisted of four messages printed in black-and-white on the front and back of the package, and was expanded in 1994 to include eight messages covering 25% of the front top of the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Tobacco Products Information Regulations (TPIR) were passed under the [[Tobacco Act (Canada)|Tobacco Act]]. The regulations introduced a new set of sixteen warnings. Each warning was printed on the front and back of the package, covering 50% of the surface, with a short explanation and a picture illustrating that particular warning, for example:

{{quote|'''WARNING'''&lt;br/&gt;'''CIGARETTES CAUSE LUNG CANCER'''&lt;br/&gt;85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking.&lt;br /&gt;80% of lung cancer victims die within three years.}}

accompanied by a picture of a human lung detailing cancerous growths.

Additionally, on the inside of the packaging or, for some packets, on a pull-out card, "health information messages" provide answers and explanations regarding common questions and concerns about quitting smoking and smoking-related illnesses. The side of the package also featured information on toxic emissions and constituent levels.&lt;ref name="Reid 2013 4–23"&gt;{{Citation

In 2011, the TPIR were replaced for cigarettes and little cigars with the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars). These regulations introduced the third and current set of 16 warnings in Canada. Currently, cigarette and little cigar packages in Canada must bear new graphic warning messages that cover 75% of the front and back of the package. The interior of each package contains 1 of 8 updated health warning messages, all including the number for a national quitline. The side of the package now bears 1 of 4 simplified toxic emission statements. These labels were fully implemented on cigarette and little cigar packages by June 2012 (though the 2000 labels still appear on other tobacco products). Canada also prohibits terms such as "light" and "mild" from appearing on tobacco packaging.&lt;ref name="Reid 2013 4–23"/&gt; The current labels were based on extensive research and a long consultation process that sought to evaluate and improve upon the warnings introduced in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In accordance with [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canadian law]] regarding products sold legally in Canada, the warnings are provided in both English and French. Imported cigarettes to be sold in Canada which do not have the warnings are affixed with sticker versions when they are sold legally in Canada.

Health Canada is also considering laws mandating [[plain cigarette packaging|plain packaging]], in which legal tobacco product packaging would still include warning labels, but brand names, fonts, and colors would be replaced with simple unadorned text, thereby reducing the impact of tobacco industry marketing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Chile ==
Starting in November 2006, all cigarette packages sold in Chile are required to have one of two health warnings, a graphic pictorial warning or a text-only warning. These warnings are replaced with a new set of two warnings each year.&lt;ref name=tobaccolabels.ca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccolabels.ca/countries/chile/|title=Chile|work=tobaccolabels.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== China ==
Under [[laws of the People's Republic of China]], "[[Law on Tobacco Monopoly]]" (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法) Chapter 4 Article 18 and "[[Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Tobacco Monopoly]]" (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法实施条例) Chapter 5 Article 29, cigarettes and cigars sold within the territory of China should indicate the grade of tar content and "Smoking is hazardous to your health" (吸烟有害健康) in the Chinese language on the packs and cartons.

In 2009, the warnings were changed.  The warnings which occupy not less than 30% of the front and back of cigarettes boxes shows "吸烟有害健康 尽早戒烟有益健康'' (Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking early is good for your health) in the front,  and "吸烟有害健康 戒烟可减少对健康的危害" ('Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking can reduce health risks) in the back.

The warnings were revised in October, 2016. The warnings occupy not less than 35% of the front and back of cigarettes boxes. The following warnings shows what is printed at the current time.
* In the front:
*: "本公司提示&lt;br&gt;吸烟有害健康&lt;br&gt;请勿在禁烟场所吸烟"
*:("The company suggested. Smoking is harmful to your health. Do not smoke in non-smoking places" in the Chinese language)
* In the back:
*: 尽早戒烟有益健康&lt;br&gt;戒烟可减少对健康的危害"
*:("Quitting smoking early is good for your health. Quitting smoking can reduce health risks" in the Chinese language)
* or
*: 劝阻青少年吸烟 &lt;br&gt;禁止中小学生吸烟
*:("Dissuade teenagers from smoking. Prohibit smoking of primary and middle school students" in the Chinese language)

In Egypt, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including a mouth cancer and gangrene) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== European Union ==
Cigarette packets and other tobacco packaging must include warnings in the same size and format and using the same approved texts (in the appropriate local languages) in all member states of the [[European Union]].

These warnings are displayed in black [[Helvetica]] bold on a white background with a thick black border. Ireland once prefaced its warnings with "Irish Government Warning", Latvia with "Veselības ministrija brīdina" (''Health Ministry Warning'') and Spain with "Las Autoridades Sanitarias Advierten (The Health Board Warns). In member states with more than one official language, the warnings are displayed in all official languages, with the sizes adjusted accordingly (for example in [[Belgium]] the messages are written in Dutch, French and German, in Luxembourg in French and German and in Ireland, in Irish and English). All cigarette packets sold in the European Union must display the content of [[nicotine]], [[tar]], and [[carbon monoxide]] in the same manner on the side of the packet.

In 2003, it was reported that sales of [[cigarette case]]s had surged, attributable to the introduction of more prominent warning labels on [[cigarette pack]]s by an EU directive in January 2003.&lt;ref name="daily-t"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3302893/Film-star-glamour-of-cigarette-cases-hides-truth-for-smokers.html|title=Film star glamour of cigarette cases hides truth for smokers|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|date=15 October 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, people choose to hide the warnings using various arguably "funny" stickers, such as "You could be hit by a bus tomorrow."&lt;ref name=daily-t/&gt;

The most recent EU legislation is the [[Tobacco Products Directive]], which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016.&lt;ref name=EU2014&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union: Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU)|url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/products_en|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marking shall appear on one third of the most visible part of the package.

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:Cig.packet.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Benson &amp; Hedges|Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette]] pack in the United Kingdom.]]

In 1971, tobacco companies printed on the left side of cigarette packets "WARNING by H.M. Government, SMOKING CAN DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH".

In 1991, the E.U. tightened laws on tobacco warnings. "TOBACCO SERIOUSLY DAMAGES HEALTH" was printed on the front of all tobacco packs. An additional warning was also printed on the reverse of cigarette packs.

In 2003, new E.U. regulations required one of the following general warnings must be displayed, covering at least 30% of the surface of the pack:
* Smoking kills
* Smoking seriously harms you and others around you

Additionally, one of the following additional warnings must be displayed, covering at least 40% of the surface of the pack:
* Smokers die younger
* Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes
* Smoking causes fatal lung cancer
* Smoking when pregnant harms your baby
* Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke
* Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking
* Smoking is highly addictive, don't start
* Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases
* Smoking can cause a slow and painful death
* Get help to stop smoking: [telephone]/[postal address]/[internet address]/consult your doctor/pharmacist
* Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence
* Smoking causes ageing of the skin
* Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility
* Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide

From October 2008, all cigarette products manufactured must carry picture warnings to the reverse. Every pack must have one of these warnings by October 2009.

Plain packaging, including prominent and standardised health warnings and minimal manufacturer information, became compulsory for all cigarette and hand-rolling tobacco packs manufactured after May 2016 and sold after May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Legislation: The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/829/contents/made|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hong Kong ==
[[File:HKSAR smoking warning.gif|thumb|Warning on HKSAR cigarette packages]]

Under [[Hong Kong Law]], Chap 371B ''Smoking (Public Health) (Notices) Order'', packaging must indicate the amount of [[nicotine]] and [[tar]] that is present in cigarette boxes in addition to graphics depicting different health problems caused by smoking in the size and ratio as prescribed by law. The warnings are to be published in both official languages, [[Traditional Chinese]] and English.

Warning begins with the phrase ''''{{lang|zh|香港特區政府忠告市民}} HONG KONG SAR GOVERNMENT WARNING'''' and then one of the following in all caps.

== India ==
Cigarette packets sold in [[India]] are required to carry graphical and textual health warnings. The warning must cover at least 85% of the surface of the pack, of which 60% must be pictorial and the remaining 25% contains textual warnings in English, Hindi or any other Indian language.

Until 2008,&lt;ref name="dnaindia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-tumours-ulcers-to-occupy-most-space-on-cigarette-packs-soon-2026522|title=Tumours, ulcers to occupy most space on cigarette packs soon|work=dna}}&lt;/ref&gt; cigarette packets sold in India were required to carry a written warning on the front of the packet with the text ''CIGARETTE SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH'' in English. Paan, gutkha and tobacco packets carried the warning ''TOBACCO IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH'' in [[Hindi]] and English. The law later changed. According to the new law, cigarette packets were required to carry pictorial warnings of a skull or scorpion along with the text ''SMOKING KILLS'' and ''TOBACCO CAUSES MOUTH CANCER'' in both Hindi and English.

''The Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules 2008'' requiring graphic health warnings came into force on 31 May 2008. Under the law, all tobacco products were required to display graphic pictures, such as pictures of diseased lungs, and the text ''SMOKING KILLS'' or ''TOBACCO KILLS'' in [[English language|English]], covering at least 40% of the front of the pack, and retailers must display the cigarette packs in such a way that the pictures on pack are clearly visible. In January 2012 controversy arose when it was discovered an image of [[England|English]] [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] [[John Terry]] was used on a warning label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16390907|title='John Terry' image appears in India anti-smoking drive |date=3 January 2012|work=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2014, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan announced that only 15% of the surface of a pack of cigarettes could contain branding, and that the rest must be used for graphic and text health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/91QwW1WWvxxwv8xDsFrbjL/India-tightens-rules-on-cigarette-pack-branding.html|title=Govt mandates health warning to cover 85% display on cigarettes packaging|work=livemint.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Ministry of Health amended the ''Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2008'' to enforce the changes effective from 1 April 2015.&lt;ref name="dnaindia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/indian-government-tightens-rules-health-warning-to-cover-85-space-on-tobacco-pack/|title=Indian government tightens rules, health warning to cover 85 per cent space on tobacco pack|date=16 October 2014|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/cigarette-packets-to-now-carry-health-warnings-covering-85-of-space/articleshow/44831164.cms|title=Cigarette packets to now carry health warnings covering 85% of space|work=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government decision to increase pictorial warnings on tobacco packets from April 1, was put on hold indefinitely, following the recommendations of a Parliamentary committee, which reportedly did not speak to health experts, but only spoke to tobacco lobby representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/panel-defers-to-lobbies-over-science-tobacco-warnings-put-on-hold/|title=Panel defers to lobbies over science, tobacco warnings put on hold|last=Ghosh|first=Abantika|date=1 April 2015|work=|newspaper=The Indian Express|access-date=2016-10-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2016, the health ministry ordered government agencies to enforce this new rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-tobacco-idUSKCN0X20YM|title=India steps up fight against cigarette firms over health warnings|date=5 April 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the intervention by the Parliamentary committee, NGO Health of Millions represented by [[Prashant Bhushan]] filed a petition in [[Supreme Court of India]], which asks the government to stop selling of loose cigarettes and publish bigger health warnings on tobacco packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/469968/sc8200hearing-tobacco-warning-today.html|title=SC hearing on tobacco warning today|last=|first=|date=6 April 2015|website=Deccan Herald|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, the [[Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993|''Tobacco Products Control Act'', 1993]] and its amendments (1999, 2007, 2009), stipulate that a warning related to the harmful effects (health, social, or economic) of tobacco smoking, or the beneficial effects of cessation, must be placed prominently on [[tobacco products]] covering 15% of the obverse, 25% of the reverse and 20% of the sides of packing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/Act83of1993.pdf|title=Tobacco Products Control Act No. 83 of 1993, Government Gazette No. 14916 Vol. 337|last=|first=|date=2 July 1993|website=[[South African Government]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/south-africa/pl-health-warnings|title=Health Warnings/Messages Features – Packing/Labelling – Tobacco Control Laws South Africa|last=|first=|date=22 September 2017|website=Tobacco Control Laws|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thailand ==
In Thailand, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including a tracheotomy and rotting teeth) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.&lt;ref name="Master Blaster"/&gt; A recent study showed that the warnings made Thai smokers think more often about the health risks of smoking and about quitting smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2006.confex.com/uicc/wctoh/techprogram/P6333.HTM|title=Evaluating the Effects of Warning Labels on Adult Smokers in Thailand: Findings from the ITC Thailand Survey|work=2006.confex.com|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States of America ==
[[File:Surgeon General's warning cigarettes.jpg|thumb|[[Surgeon General]]'s warning on a cigarette pack, 2012.]]

In 1966, the United States became the first nation in the world to require a health warning on cigarette packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/health/policy/22smoke.html| title = U.S. Releases Graphic Images to Deter Smokers | newspaper = New York Times| author = Duff Wilson| date = 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Satcher1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Satcher|first=David|title=Tobacco Use Among U.

In 1973, the Assistant Director of Research at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company wrote an internal memorandum regarding new brands of cigarettes for the youth market. He observed that, "psychologically, at eighteen, one is immortal" and theorized that "the desire to be daring is part of the motivation to start smoking." He stated, "in this sense the label on the package is a plus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teague|first=Claude E.|title=Research Planning Memorandum on Some Thoughts About New Brands of Cigarettes for the Youth Market|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/ict68d00/pdf|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Philip Morris U.S.A. purchased three brands of cigarettes from Liggett Group Inc. The brands were: Chesterfield, L&amp;M, and Lark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip Morris U.S.A.|title=Circular No. 719|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/cep67c00/pdf|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Philip Morris purchased the brands from Liggett, the packaging for those cigarettes included the statement "Smoking is Addictive".  After Philip Morris acquired the three Liggett brands, it removed the statement from the packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keane|first=Denise|title=Written Direct Testimony of Denise F. Keane|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/whk79a00/pdf|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the United States started the trend of labeling cigarette packages with warnings, today the country has one of the least restrictive labelling requirements on their packages.&lt;ref name=dumas&gt;Dumas, Bethany K. “An Analysis of the Adequacy of Federally Mandated Cigarette Package Warnings.” Ch. 11 of Language in the Judicial Process, ed. J. N. Levi and A. G. Walker. NY: Plenum Press Corp., 1990, 309–352. Reprinted Tennessee Law Review 59.2 (1992), 261–304.&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings are usually in small typeface placed along one of the sides of the cigarette packs with colors and fonts that closely resemble the rest of the package, so the warnings essentially are integrated and do not stand out with the rest of the cigarette package.&lt;ref name=dumas/&gt;

However, this is subject to change as the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] of 2009 requires color graphics with supplemental text that depicts the negative consequences of smoking to cover 50 percent of the front and rear of each pack. The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were required to appear on packaging by September 2012, though this was delayed by legal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health Groups Weigh In On Lawsuit Over Graphic Cigarette Labels |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/20/health-groups-graphic-cigarette-labels_n_972102.html |deadurl=yes |work=Huffington Post |date=20 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228043226/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/20/health-groups-graphic-cigarette-labels_n_972102.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, five tobacco companies filed a lawsuit against the FDA in an effort to reverse the new warning mandate. Tobacco companies claimed that being required to promote government anti-smoking campaigns by placing the new warnings on packaging violates the companies' free speech rights.&lt;ref name=BBCCigaretteLawsuit&gt;{{cite news|title=US cigarette makers sue over graphic warning labels|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14553228|work=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 August 2011|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[R.J. Reynolds]], [[Lorillard]], [[Commonwealth Brands Inc.]], Liggett Group LLC and [[Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company]] Inc. claimed that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/09/12/fda-defends-new-graphic-cigarette-labels/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nathan | last=Koppel | title=FDA Defends New Graphic Cigarette Labels | date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] lawyer, [[Floyd Abrams]], represented the tobacco companies in the case, contending that requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/big-tobacco-gets-top-first-amendment-lawyer-new-suit-134200|title=Big Tobacco Gets Top First Amendment Lawyer for New Suit|work=AdWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csnews.com/top-story-tobacco_cos._get_allies_in_warning_label_fight-59535.html|title=Tobacco Cos.

On 29 February 2012, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the labels violate the right to [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]] in the  [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/03/01/article/judge_blocks_graphic_images_on_cigarette_packages | work=Winston-Salem Journal | first=Richard | last=Craver | title=Judge blocks graphic images on cigarette packages | date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following month the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit]] upheld the majority of the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, including the part requiring graphic warning labels. In April 2013 the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal to this ruling, allowing the new labels to stand. As the original ruling against the FDA images was not actually reversed, the FDA will again need to go through the process of developing the new warning labels, and the timetable and final product remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/article_cb836c3c-ab6e-11e2-a089-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Graphic tobacco warning labels to remain, but look, timetable unknown|work=Winston-Salem Journal|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-tobacco-labels-idUSBRE82I0VX20120319|title=Court: Tobacco health labels constitutional|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/public-global-health/295255-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-tobacco-warnings|title=Supreme Court rejects challenge to tobacco warnings|work=The Hill|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://consumerist.com/2013/04/22/supreme-court-agrees-cigarette-warning-labels-dont-violate-big-tobaccos-free-speech/|title=Supreme Court Agrees: Cigarette Warning Labels Don’t Violate Big Tobacco’s Free Speech|work=Consumerist|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Smokeless Tobacco Warning Labels.jpg|thumb|The four warning label variants seen on various [[chewing tobacco]] products sold in the United States.]]

Effective June 2010, the following labels began to appear on smokeless tobacco products (also known as chewing tobacco) and their advertisements.
* WARNING: This product can cause mouth cancer.
* WARNING: This product can cause gum disease and tooth loss.
* WARNING: This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.
* WARNING: Smokeless tobacco is addictive.

The new warnings are required to comprise 30 percent of two principal display panels on the packaging; on advertisements, the health warnings must constitute 20 percent of the total area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/syn/html/ucm2023662 |title=Smokeless Tobacco Product Warning Labels |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venezuela ==
For many years in Venezuela, the only warning in cigarette packs was printed in a very small typeface along one of the sides:

"{{lang|es|Se ha determinado que el fumar cigarrillos es nocivo para la salud, Ley de impuesto sobre cigarrillos}}" (It has been determined that cigarette smoking is harmful to your health, Cigarette Tax Law) Since 14 September 1978

On 24 March 2005, another warning was introduced in every cigarette pack: "Este producto contiene alquitrán, nicotina y monóxido de carbono, los cuales son cancerígenos y tóxicos. No existen niveles seguros para el consumo de estas sustancias" (This product contains [[tar]], [[nicotine]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are carcinogenic and toxic. There are no safe levels for consumption of these substances".

1978's warning, was not removed, now every cigarette pack contains both warnings (one on each lateral).

In addition, since 24 March 2005, one of the following warnings is randomly printed very prominently, along with a graphical image, occupying the 100% of the back of the pack (40% for the text warning and 60% for the image):

* {{lang|es|Este producto es dañino para la salud y produce adicción}} (This product is hazardous to your health and is addictive)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpps.gob.ve/campanas/cigarrillo/images/imagen1.jpg |accessdate=6 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in Venezuela, tobacco advertising is strictly forbidden, so much so that the words tobacco, cigarette, cigar, etc. are not permitted in media such as radio and television and no one can smoke on television.

In the campaign called: "Venezuela 100% libre de humo" (Venezuela, 100% smoke-free), curiously, these warnings only appear on cigarette packs and not on other tobacco products (which only conserve the 1978 warning).

== Vietnam ==
In Vietnam, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including a tracheotomy and rotting teeth) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3719">The '''weathering hypothesis''' was first proposed by [[Arline Geronimus]] in 1992.

==Origin==
While working part-time at a school for pregnant teenagers in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Geronimus first noticed that the teens who came to the school tended to have far more health problems than her classmates at [[Princeton University]]. She thus began to wonder whether the health conditions of the teens at that clinic may have been caused by their environment. While in graduate school, she proposed the "weathering hypothesis". She chose the term [[weathering]] as a metaphor for the effects she perceived that exposure to stress was having on the health of marginalized people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/01/14/577664626/making-the-case-that-discrimination-is-bad-for-your-health |title=Making The Case That Discrimination Is Bad For Your Health |last=Demby |first=Gene |date=2018-01-14 |website=NPR |language=en |access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
