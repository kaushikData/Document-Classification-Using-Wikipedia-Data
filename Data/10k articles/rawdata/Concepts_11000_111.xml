==Description==
An '''algorave''' is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using [[live coding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="livecoding"/&gt; Algoraves can include a range of styles, including a complex form of minimal techno, and the movement has been described as a meeting point of hacker philosophy, geek culture, and clubbing.&lt;ref name="wired201309"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/09/play/algorave|title=Hacking meets clubbing with the 'algorave'|work=Wired UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Algorave logo.png|thumb|left|180px|Algorave logo (a [[spirangle]]).]]
Although live coding is commonplace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/168153-trip-report-on-dagstuhl-seminar-on-live-coding/fulltext|title=Trip Report on Dagstuhl Seminar on Live Coding|author=Mark Guzdial|date=26 September 2013|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; any algorithmic music is welcome which is "wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/05/11/algoraves-dancing-to-algorith.html|title=Algoraves: dancing to algorithms|work=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a corruption of the definition of rave music (“wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/part/V/crossheading/powers-in-relation-to-raves|title=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK's [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|Criminal Justice Act]]. Although algorave musicians have been compared with DJs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/77242/programmation-dj-musique-algorithme|title=Les programmeurs sont les nouveaux DJ|work=Slate.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are in fact live musicians or improvisers, creating music live, usually by writing or modifying code, rather than mixing recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diprosper.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/algoravestuding-the-relation-between-digital-and-analogue-ways/|title=Algorave|work=in-corporeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an algorave the computer musician may not be the main point of focus for the audience and instead attention may be centered on a screen that displays [[live coding]], that is the process of writing source code, so the audience can not just dance or listen to the music generated by the source code but also to see the process of programming.

==History==
Algorithmic approaches have long been applied in electronic dance music from the 1970s when [[Brian Eno]] established randomised musical practises which evolved into [[generative music]] over the course of his long career. This in turn influenced [[rave culture]] and [[techno]] of the 1990s by [[Farmers Manual]], [[Autechre]], and [[Aphex Twin]]. The [[Anti EP]] was an explicit response to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] - specifically the track "flutter" as a means of creating "non-repetitive beats" at raves which had been outlawed by the wording of the Act. The [[snare rush]] famously featured on the [[Girl/Boy EP]] of 1996 is an earlier form of digital algorhythmic coding and featured in [[drum and bass]] influenced electronic music of the early to mid 1990s, this approach later evolving into [[glitch]] music. Traditional use of algorithms include [[Maypole]] dancing, where they are applied to the dance itself as a form of [[Algorithmic Choreography]] and [[bell-ringing]]. The first self-proclaimed "algorave" was held in London as a warmup concert for the [[SuperCollider]] Symposium 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc2012.org.uk/2012/03/live-algorave-video-highlights/|title=Live AlgoRave – video highlights - SuperCollider Symposium 2012|work=sc2012.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?345648|title=RA: Supercollider 2012 Warm Up – Live Algorave at Nnnnn, London (2012)|work=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the name was first coined in 2011, after live coders [[Nick Collins (composer)|Nick Collins]] and [[Alex McLean]] tuned into a [[happy hardcore]] pirate radio station on the way to a performance in the UK.&lt;ref name="wired201309"/&gt; Since then, algorave has been growing into an international movement, with algoraves having been held mainly in Europe and Asia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/550866|title=Algorave ++ Noise|author=|date=|website=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and few events in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/492764|title=Algorave|author=|date=|website=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ArmadaDe Lindo|title=armada de lindo, august 9 2013|date=2014-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ScVcSLkis|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegridto.com/blog-post/5-things-you-missed-at-all-caps|title=The Grid TO|work=thegridto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivo2012.cenart.tv/ |title=/*vivo*/ 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908032423/http://vivo2012.cenart.tv/ |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[granular material]] is the steepest angle of descent or [[Strike and dip|dip]]  relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. The morphology of the material affects the angle of repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The angle of repose can also be affected by additions of solvents. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase the angle of repose, and related quantities such as the [[bearing capacity|soil strength]].

When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a [[cone (geometry)|conical]] pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the [[density]], [[surface area]] and shapes of the particles, and the [[coefficient of friction]] of the material. Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose.

The term has a related usage in [[mechanics]], where it refers to the maximum angle at which an object can rest on an [[inclined plane]] without sliding down. This angle is equal to the [[arctangent]] of the [[coefficient of static friction]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; between the surfaces.

== Applications of theory ==
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|280px|Talus cones on north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]], showing angle of repose for coarse [[sediment]]]]

The angle of repose is sometimes used in the design of equipment for the processing of particulate solids. For example, it may be used to design an appropriate [[chute (gravity)|hopper]] or [[silo]] to store the material, or to size a [[conveyor belt]] for transporting the material. It can also be used in determining whether or not a slope (of a stockpile, or uncompacted gravel bank, for example) will likely collapse; the [[scree|talus]] slope is derived from angle of repose and represents the steepest slope a pile of granular material will take. This angle of repose is also crucial in correctly calculating [[slope stability|stability]] in vessels.

It is also commonly used by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] as a factor in analysing [[avalanche]] danger in mountainous areas.{{citation needed |date=December 2016}}

== Measurement ==
There are numerous methods for measuring angle of repose and each produces slightly different results. Results are also sensitive to the exact methodology of the experimenter. As a result, data from different labs are not always comparable. One method is the [[triaxial shear test]], another is the [[direct shear test]].

If the coefficient of static friction is known of a material, then a good approximation of the angle of repose can be made with the following function. This function is somewhat accurate for piles where individual objects in the pile are minuscule and piled in random order.&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\theta)} \approx \mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of static friction, and ''θ'' is the angle of repose.

=== Methods in determining the angle of repose ===
The measured angle of repose may vary with the method used.

==== Tilting box method ====
This method is appropriate for fine-grained, non-cohesive materials with individual particle size less than 10&amp;nbsp;mm. The material is placed within a box with a transparent side to observe the granular test material. It should initially be level and parallel to the base of the box. The box is slowly tilted until the material begins to slide in bulk, and the angle of the tilt is measured.

==== Fixed funnel method ====
The material is poured through a funnel to form a cone. The tip of the funnel should be held close to the growing cone and slowly raised as the pile grows, to minimize the impact of falling particles. Stop pouring the material when the pile reaches a predetermined height or the base a predetermined width. Rather than attempt to measure the angle of the resulting cone directly, divide the height by half the width of the base of the cone. The inverse tangent of this ratio is the angle of repose.

==== Revolving cylinder method ====
The material is placed within a cylinder with at least one transparent end. The cylinder is rotated at a fixed speed and the observer watches the material moving within the rotating cylinder. The effect is similar to watching clothes tumble over one another in a slowly rotating clothes dryer. The granular material will assume a certain angle as it flows within the rotating cylinder. This method is recommended for obtaining the dynamic angle of repose, and may vary from the static angle of repose measured by other methods.

== Exploitation by antlion and wormlion (Vermileonidae) larvae ==
[[File:Antlion trap.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Sand pit trap of the antlion]]

The larvae of the [[antlion]]s and the unrelated wormlions [[Vermileonidae]] trap small insects such as ants by digging conical pits in loose sand, such that the slope of the walls is effectively at the critical angle of repose for the sand.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They achieve this by flinging the loose sand out of the pit and permitting the sand to settle at its critical angle of repose as it falls back. Thus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center where the predator that dug the pit lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. The larva assists this process by vigorously flicking sand out from the center of the pit when it detects a disturbance. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva flings also pelts the prey with so much loose, rolling material as to prevent it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.

'''Ataptatanū''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अतप्ततनू) – ''tapa'' (तप) means – 'to burn', 'heat up'; ''atapta'' (अतप्त) – means - 'not heated', 'cool', and ''tanū'' (तनू) – means - 'body', 'the physical self';  ''ataptatanū'' means – 'he whose body or mass is not prepared in fire', 'raw' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier-Williams Sabskrit-English Dictionary|url= http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/3.html }},&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound word, ''ataptatanū'', appears in the below cited mantra of the IX Mandala of the Rig Veda. In a [[sukta]] addressed to Pavmāna Somo Devatā, Rishi Pavitra prays:-

:पवित्रं ते विततं ब्रह्मणस्पते प्रभुर्गात्राणि पर्येषि विश्वतः |
:अतप्ततनूर्न तदामो अश्नुते श्रृतास इद्वहन्तस्तत्समाशत ||   ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.1) 

In this mantra, ''ataptatanūh'', refers to the one who has not subjected himself to the heat of tapas, ''tadāmah'' refers to one who is raw and who therefore, ''aśunate'' - cannot experience the highest bliss because his body is not yet properly prepared to receive the knowledge he seeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda with commentary in Hindi of Swami Dayananda Saraswati|publisher=Arya Samaj, Jamnagar|page=272|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Satyarth Prakash]] (Light of Truth), Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]] explains that ''ataptatanū'' does not refer to branding with fire of one’s body which fact is clarified by Rishi Pavitra in the subsequent mantra which reads:-

:तपोष्पवित्रं विततं दिवस्पदे शोचन्तो अस्य तन्तवो वयस्थिरन् |
:अवन्त्यस्य पवीतारमाशवो दिवस्पृष्ठमधि तिष्ठन्ति चेतसा ||

and which means –

: " O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Holy in nature canst not be approached by a human soul that has not been purified by tapa (or tapasya by means of thorough control of the senses, truthful speech, subjugation of the animal in man (instinct), conquest of the lower self, the practice of yoga, association with good men – all these constitute tapasya), and is therefore, not spiritually regenerate; it is only those, whose souls have been cleansed through righteous conduct and devotion to virtue, that can see Thee Who art All Holy. " ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.2) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light of Truth-Satyarth Prakash|author=Dayananda Saeaswati|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=369|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/250453797/359/PAGE-369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapa]] or ''tapasya'', is practical discipline; according to the [[Bhagavada Gita]] (XVII.14), revering the gods, the twice-born, elders, teachers and wise men, purity, celibacy, and non-violence these are the ''tapasya'' of the body, of speech and of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita|publisher=Islamkotob|page=240|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zh2xVJmYNoKauQSkn4D4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The finishing phase of a scholar’s higher education was called ''tapasya'' in the time of [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna Charitra|author=Alo Shome|publisher=V&amp;amp;S publishers|page=55|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ASNmhKlL0ioC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7CKxVLTfHYayuASjr4CQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gandhi]] considered ''tapasya'' to be the test of love, ''[[ahimsa]]'', self-suffering and self-sacrifice, essentials in the quest for truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=wisdom in Action|author=Raghavan Iyer|publisher=Theosophy Trust|page=254|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SrmqJTBK_f4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uCSxVLCWM8aLuASxk4KQDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7492">{{Network Science}}
In [[network science]], a '''biased random walk on a graph''' is a time path process in which an evolving variable jumps from its current state to one of various potential new states; unlike in a pure [[random walk]], the probabilities of the potential new states are unequal.

Biased random walks on a graph provide an approach for the [https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-0-8176-4788-9 structural analysis] of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graphs]] in order to extract their symmetries when the network is too complex or when it is not large enough to be analyzed by [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. The concept of biased random walks on a graph has attracted the attention of many researchers and data companies over the past decade especially in the transportation and [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Roberta Sinatra, Jesús Gómez-Gardeñes, Renaud Lambiotte, Vincenzo Nicosia, and Vito Latora|title=Maximal-entropy random walks in complex networks with limited information|journal=Physical Review E|date=March 2011|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.83.030103 |pmid=21517435|volume=83|issue=3|pages=030103|arxiv=1007.4936|bibcode=2011PhRvE..83c0103S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model ==
There have been written many different representations of the biased random walks on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s based on the particular purpose of the analysis. A common representation of the mechanism for [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graphs]] is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J. Gómez-Gardeñes |author2=V. Latora|title=Entropy rate of diffusion processes on complex networks|journal=Physical Review E|date=Dec 2008 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.78.065102 |pmid=19256892|volume=78|issue=6|pages=065102| arxiv=0712.0278| bibcode=2008PhRvE..78f5102G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graph]], a walker takes a step from the current node, &lt;math&gt;j,&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt; Assuming that each node has an attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i,&lt;/math&gt; the probability of jumping from node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij}^\alpha=\frac{\alpha_i A_{ij}}{\sum_{k} \alpha_k A_{kj}},&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the topological weight of the edge going from &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the steps of the walker are biased by the factor of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which may differ from one node to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=R. Lambiotte, R. Sinatra, J.-C. Delvenne, T.S. Evans, M. Barahona, V. Latora|title=Flow graphs: interweaving dynamics and structure| journal = Physical Review E|date=Dec 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.84.017102|pmid=21867345|volume=84|issue=1|pages=017102|arxiv=1012.1211|bibcode=2011PhRvE..84a7102L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the network, the attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted differently. It might be implied as the attraction of a person in a [[social network]], it might be [[betweenness centrality]] or even it might be explained as an intrinsic characteristic of a node. In case of a [http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/markov/WalkGraph.html fair random walk on graph] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one for all the nodes.

In case of shortest paths random walks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanchard, Volchenkov, D|title=Mathematical Analysis of Urban Spatial Networks| date=2008|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87829-2| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233971652| journal=Understanding Complex Systems|isbn=978-3-540-87828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through the node &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;. In fact the walker prefers the nodes with higher [[betweenness centrality]] which is defined as below:

:&lt;math&gt;C(i)=\tfrac{\text{Total number of shortest paths through } i}{\text{Total number of shortest paths}}&lt;/math&gt;

Based on the above equation, the recurrence time to a node in the biased walk is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Volchenkov D |author2=Blanchard P|title=Fair and biased random walks on undirected graphs and related entropies|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser|page=380|url=http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/1997352|isbn=9780817649036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">In [[topology]], a discipline within mathematics, the '''Brown–Gitler spectrum''' is a [[Spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] whose [[cohomology]] is a certain [[cyclic module]] over the [[Steenrod algebra]].&lt;ref name="ncatlab.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Brown-Gitler%20spectrum|title=Brown–Gitler spectrum in nLab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown–Gitler spectra are defined by the [[isomorphism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GoerssOnBrownGitler.pdf|title=Brown–Gitler Spectra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Sigma^n A/ \{ \operatorname{Sq}^i : 2i &gt; n\} A \cong G(n). &lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

The concept was introduced by mathematicians [[Edgar H. Brown]] and [[Samuel Gitler Hammer|Samuel Gitler]] in a 1973 paper.&lt;ref name="ncatlab.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Edgar H., Jr. | last1=Brown| author1-link=Edgar H.

'''Bóndi''' (also '''húsbóndi''',&lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse (2001), ''Viking Age Iceland''. Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0-14-029115-5}} p. 28 ''Húsbóndi'' means ''householder''; the English word ''husband'' is a derivation of the word.&lt;/ref&gt; (pl.) '''bændr''' in [[Old Norse]]) was the Norse core of society, formed by farmers and [[Master craftsman|craftsmen]] in the Scandinavian [[Viking Age]], and constituted a widespread middle class. They were free men and enjoyed rights such as the use of weapons and the privilege to join the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]] as farm owners landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Holman (2003), ''Historical Dictionary of the Vikings'', Scarecrow Press, {{ISBN|0-8108-6589-0}} pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randi Bj W. Rdahl (2011), ''The Incorporation and Integration of the King's Tributary Lands into the Norwegian Realm C. 1195–1397'', BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-20613-2}} p. 24, 224, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The profile is specified in ''[[Rígsthula]]'', a Scandinavian legend describing the god [[Ríg (Norse god)|Ríg]] lying with three couples to procreate and give birth to the three social classes: [[thrall]]s, karls (or bændr) and [[earl]]s. The poem describes the image and behavior as it should be, and the type of work expected at each.

== Karl ==
The [[Norse mythology]] cites Karl as a result of the illicit relationship between god [[Heimdallr|Heimdal]] and mortal Amma. Karl and his wife Snor would be progenitors of the peasants and freemen.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, John (2008), ''Los vikingos, cultura y mitología'', Köln, Alemania {{ISBN|978-3-8365-0276-4}} p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The '''odalsbóndi''' (owner with hereditary possessions) could give up some of their land to other karls in exchange for loyalty and unconditional support whenever necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Velasco, Manuel (2012) ''Breve Historia de los Vikingos'' (versión extendida), Ed. Nowtilus, {{ISBN|978-84-9967-345-5}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term ''karl'' in some ancient writings denoting a free man status of low social class without access to family ties with upper castes or royalty.&lt;ref&gt;''The saga of King Hrolf Kraki'', trad. [[Jesse Byock]], Penguin Classics, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-14-043593-1}} p. 79 note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sailors and traders ==
The bóndi had parallel activities; were great sailors, merchants, and [[Vikings]]; in areas further north also hunters and fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', Oxford University Press, 1973, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; With their [[longship|snekke]] for war and [[knarr]] to trade, Vikings virtually dominating the seas in northern Europe. Sometimes hackers and other traders, according to circumstances. It is in 873, despite the mutual distrust between the Vikings and the [[Carolingian Empire]], both parts came to an agreement that the merchants could cross borders in order to buy and sell goods in good will. [[Birka]] and [[Hedeby]] become two important enclaves and trade routes of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Cohat (1989), ''Los vikingos, reyes de los mares'', collection "[[Aguilar Universal]]●Historia" (nº 5). Madrid: Aguilar, S. A. de Ediciones, {{ISBN|978-84-03-60057-7}}, {{p.|84|88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iceland ==
In the [[icelandic Commonwealth]], a bóndi figure was subject to the authority of a [[goði]] so their rights as free men were subject by law to a minimum in properties (a cow, a boat or a network for each family member) and establish a formal relationship with the goði, thereafter a bóndi formally considered a follower and his vote as ''Þingmaðr'' ("men of thing") was influenced by the will of goði in the [[Althing]]. These conditions were regulated by the [[law of Iceland|Icelandic law]] collected in the ''[[Grágás]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse (1993), ''Feud in the Icelandic Saga'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-08259-1}} p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''coincidence point''' (or simply '''coincidence''') of two [[function (mathematics)|mappings]] is a point in their common [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] having the same image.

Formally, given two mappings
:&lt;math&gt;f,g \colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
we say that a point ''x'' in ''X'' is a ''coincidence point'' of ''f'' and ''g'' if ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Coincidence theory (the study of coincidence points) is, in most settings, a generalization of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] theory, the study of points ''x'' with ''f''(''x'') = ''x''. Fixed point theory is the special case obtained from the above by letting ''X = Y'' and taking ''g'' to be the [[identity mapping]].

Just as fixed point theory has its [[fixed-point theorem]]s, there are [[theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of coincidence points for pairs of mappings. Notable among them, in the setting of [[manifold]]s, is the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz coincidence theorem]], which is typically known only in its special case formulation for fixed points.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Congruence bias''' is a type of [[cognitive bias]] similar to [[confirmation bias]]. Congruence bias occurs due to people's overreliance on directly testing a given [[hypothesis]] as well as neglecting indirect testing.

==Examples==
Suppose that, in an [[experiment]]al setting, a subject is presented with two buttons and told that pressing one of those buttons, but not the other, will open a door. The subject adopts the hypothesis that the button on the left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing the button on the left; an indirect test would be pressing the button on the right. The latter is still a valid test because once the result of the door's remaining closed is found, the left button is proven to be the desired button. (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, ''[[#CITEREFBrunerGoodnowAustin1956|A Study of Thinking]]''.)

It is possible to take this idea of direct and indirect testing and apply it to more complicated experiments in order to explain the presence of a congruence bias in people. In an experiment, a subject will test his own usually naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.

The classic example of subjects' congruence bias was discovered by [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]] ([[#CITEREFWason1960|1960]], [[#CITEREFWason1968|1968]]).  Here, the experimenter gave subjects the number sequence "2, 4, 6", telling the subjects that this sequence followed a particular rule and instructing subjects to find the rule underlying the sequence logic. Subjects provided their own number sequences as tests to see if they could ascertain the rule dictating which numbers could be included in the sequence and which could not. Most subjects respond to the task by quickly deciding that the underlying rule is "numbers ascending by 2", and provide as tests only sequences concordant with this rule, such as "3, 5, 7," or even "pi plus 2, plus 4, plus 6". Each of these sequences follows the underlying rule the experimenter is thinking of, though "numbers ascending by 2" is not the actual criterion being used. However, because subjects succeed at repeatedly testing the same singular principle, they naively believe their chosen hypothesis is correct. When a subject offers up to the experimenter the hypothesis "numbers ascending by 2" only to be told he is wrong, much confusion usually ensues. At this point, many subjects attempt to change the wording of the rule without changing its meaning, and even those who switch to indirect testing have trouble letting go of the "+ 2" convention, producing potential rules as idiosyncratic as "the first two numbers in the sequence are random, and the third number is the second number plus two". Many subjects never realize that the actual rule the experimenter was using was simply just to list ascending numbers, because of the subjects' inability to consider indirect tests of their hypotheses.

==Cognitive basis==
Wason attributed this failure of subjects to an inability to consider alternative hypotheses, which is the root of the congruence bias. [[Jonathan Baron]] explains that subjects could be said to be using a "congruence heuristic", wherein a hypothesis is tested only by thinking of results that would be found if that hypothesis is true. This heuristic, which many people seem to use, ignores alternative hypotheses.

Baron suggests the following heuristics to avoid falling into the congruence bias trap:
# Ask "How likely is a yes answer, if I assume that my hypothesis is false?" Remember to choose a test that has a high probability of giving some answer if the hypothesis is true, and a low probability if it is false.
# "Try to think of alternative hypotheses; then choose a test most likely to distinguish them—a test that will probably give different results depending on which is true." An example of the need for the heuristic could be seen in a doctor's attempting to diagnose [[appendicitis]]. In that situation, assessing a [[white blood cell]] count would not assist in diagnosis because an elevated white blood cell count is associated with a number of maladies.

'''Digital painting''' is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as [[watercolor]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[impasto]], etc. are applied using digital tools by means of a [[computer]], a [[digitizing tablet]] and [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], and [[software]]. Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium as opposed to a more modern style like digital. Digital painting differs from other forms of [[digital art]], particularly [[computer-generated art]], in that it does not involve the computer rendering from a model.  The artist uses painting techniques to create the digital painting directly on the computer. All digital painting programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various brushes and paint effects.  Included in many programs are brushes that are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing.  There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint which portray the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital 'watercolor' painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corel.com/servlet/ContentServer/us/en/Product/1166553941991&lt;/ref&gt; In most digital painting programs, the users can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape.  This ability is very important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital painting.

Digital painting thrives mostly in production art. It is most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video games. Digital painting software such as [[Corel Painter]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[ArtRage]], [[GIMP]], [[Krita]] and [[openCanvas]] give artists a similar environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing palettes, and a multitude of color options.
There are various types of digital painting, including [[impressionism]], realism, and watercolor. There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting.  While digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand. Some artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such as the character that is unique to every physically made object.  Many artists post blogs and comment on the various differences between digitally created work and traditionally created artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vindicated13.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/art-traditional-vs-digital/ Art: Traditional vs. Digital « Vindicated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/digital/1061392/ deviantART Forum: Traditional painting vs Digital painting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with traditional painting==

The main difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear process. That is, an artist can often arrange his painting in layers that can be edited independently. Also, the ability to undo and redo strokes frees the artist from a linear process. But digital painting is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality. The [[digital artist]] has at his disposal several tools not available to the traditional painter.  Some of these include: a virtual palette consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools.  A [[graphics tablet]] allows the artist to work with precise hand movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface. Even the traditional surface has changed for digital painting. Instead of a canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s surface, or a click of pen.  Tablets can be pressure sensitive, allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the screen.  There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of pressure sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wacom.com/intuos/12x19.cfm Intuos3 12x19 - Product Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Sketchpad===
[[Image:Wacom Pen-tablet.jpg|thumb|Many artists prefer using graphics tablets to create digital paintings instead of using a mouse.]]
The earliest graphical manipulation program was called [[Sketchpad]].  Created in 1963 by [[Ivan Sutherland]], a grad student at [[MIT]], Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT ([[cathode ray tube]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/4 The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created.  Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.  WACOM is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6” all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick. Other brands of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso, Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://0.tqn.com/d/performingarts/1/0/9/7/-/-/GraphicsTabletComparisonChart.jpg Comparison chart of graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://painting.about.com/lr/graphics_tablet/1917/1/ Links to many graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/graphicstablets.htm Sue Chastain, editor about graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all Windows and Macintosh software.

===Tablets===
The idea of using a [[graphics tablet|tablet]] to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the [[RAND tablet]] that was used to program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9536.html Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end [[CAD]] ([[Computer Aided Design]]) systems as well as bundled with [[Personal computer|PC]]'s and PC based CAD software like [[AutoCAD]].

===MacPaint===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MacpaintWP.png|thumb|MacPaint 1.0]] --&gt;
The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program [[MacPaint]]. This program’s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the [[Apple Lisa]].  The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/31/science/personal-computers-software-for-the-macintosh-plenty-on-the-way.html?sec=technology&amp;pagewanted=2 Personal Computers; Software For The Macintosh: Plenty On The Way - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4BlmsN4q2I&amp;feature=related YouTube - Apple Lisa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of MacPaint's universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer which was equipped with one other program called [[MacWrite]].  It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa.  The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/5- The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.png|thumb|Adobe Photoshop CS3]] --&gt;
Another early image manipulation program was [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by [[Thomas Knoll]] at the [[University of Michigan]] as monochrome picture display program.  With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop.  The Knolls agreed on a deal with [[Adobe systems]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. [[Adobe systems]] had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the productions of digital paintings.  Illustrator introduced the uses of [[Bezier curves]] which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their [[vector graphics|vector drawings]].

===Kid Pix===
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called [[Kid Pix]], which made it easier for children to use MacPaint. The program was originally created in black in white, and after several revisions was released in color in 1991.  Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pixelpoppin.com/kidpix/ Kid Pix: The Early Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-based painting programs===
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites which support  painting digitally online. 
The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly use the client's web browser to handle some of the processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing software. Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

'''Earth orbit rendezvous''' ('''EOR''') is a potential methodology for conducting round trip human flights to the Moon, involving the use of [[space rendezvous]] to assemble, and possibly fuel, components of a translunar vehicle in [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;"LOW EARTH ORBIT RENDEZVOUS STRATEGY FOR LUNAR MISSIONS" http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc06papers/158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It was considered and ultimately rejected in favor of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) for [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo Program]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program" http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, it was planned to be used for [[Project Constellation]], until that program’s [[Barack Obama space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center|cancellation in October 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F. (October 2006). "Constellation Program Overview" http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemini and Agena target vehicle==
The [[Agena target vehicle]] (ATV) was used for testing Earth orbit rendezvous in the NASA [[Gemini Program]]. [[Gemini 6]] and [[Gemini 7]] rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, [[Gemini 8]] successfully docked  with the Agena on March 16, 1966. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved other objectives in later Gemini launches, including docked orbital maneuvering ([[Gemini 10]] and [[Gemini 11]]), inspection of the abandoned Gemini 8 ATV (Gemini 10) and space walks ([[Gemini 12]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124970031|title=Spaceflight : the complete story from Sputnik to shuttle -- and beyond|last=Sparrow|first=Giles|date=2007|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd|year=2007|isbn=9781405318181|location=London|pages=110|oclc=124970031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apollo==
[[File:Apollo Earth Orbit Rendezvous - 10 launches required.jpg|thumb|200px|1961 sketch showing 10 C-1 launches required to assemble in Earth orbit an Apollo lunar landing mission.]]
The EOR proposal for Apollo consisted of using a series of small [[rocket]]s half the size of a [[Saturn V]] to put different components of a [[spacecraft]] to go to the Moon in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]], then assemble them in orbit.  Experiments of [[Project Gemini]] involving docking with the [[Agena target vehicle]] were designed partly to test the [[Logical possibility|feasibility]] of this program.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

In the end, NASA employed the [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] for the [[Project Apollo|Apollo Program]]: a  Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the [[Apollo Command Module|Apollo Command]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Modules]] into low Earth orbit, and then the Saturn V third stage would fire again ([[Trans-lunar injection]]) to send both spacecraft to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Constellation==
This mode had been revived for [[Project Constellation]] as the [[Earth Departure Stage]] (EDS) and [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] (LSAM), which would be launched into low Earth orbit on the [[Ares V]] rocket.  The EDS and Altair would  be met by the separately launched [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] (CEV). Once joined in low Earth orbit, the three would then travel out to the Moon and the Orion/Altair combination would fly a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] flight pattern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">An '''edict of toleration''' is a declaration, made by a government or ruler and states, that members of a given [[religion]] will not be persecuted for engaging in their religious practices and traditions. The edict implies tacit acceptance of the religion rather than its endorsement by the ruling power.

== Edicts of toleration in history ==

===Ancient times===
*539 B.C. – The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], a clay document issued by Achaemenid [[Persia]]n monarch [[Cyrus the Great]] declaring the restoration of the cult of [[Marduk]] in [[Babylon]] and the restorations of the temples of many peoples, including the [[Jews]].
*311 A.D. – The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 by the Roman Tetrarchy of Galerius, Constantine and Licinius, officially ending the [[Diocletian]] persecution of Christianity.
*313 – Roman Emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] that legalized Christianity across the whole [[Imperium Romanum|Empire]].
*361 or 362 - Julian the Apostate, Roman emperor, issued a new edict[[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion]] that legalized/ recognized all forms of Christianity, as well as Judaism and Paganism, across his empire.

===Middle Ages===
*1436 – The [[Compacts of Basel]] (valid for the [[Crown of Bohemia]], previously declared in 1420 and approved by the [[Council of Basle]] in 1433) were formally accepted by Catholics and Utraquists (moderate [[Hussites]]) at an assembly in Jihlava and agreed by King and Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], introducing a limited toleration and stating that "the word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons"

===Early modern period===
*1562 – The [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] was an edict of limited toleration issued by [[Catherine de' Medici]] (the [[regent]] for the young [[Charles IX of France]]) that ended insistent persecution of non-Catholics (mostly [[Huguenots]]).  The persecution was a result of the [[Concordat of Bologna]] (1516). A massacre of Huguenots a few weeks later began open hostilities in the French [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562-1598).
*1568 – The [[Edict of Torda]] (or Turda), also known as the Patent of Toleration (Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience), was an attempt by King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II Sigismund]] of [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Hungary]] to guarantee religious freedom in his realm. Specifically, it broadened previous grants (to Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists) to include the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian Church]], and allowed toleration (not legal guarantees) for other faiths.
* 1573 – The [[Warsaw Confederation]] made all Christian confessions equal in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
* 1579 – The [[Union of Utrecht]] included a decree of toleration allowing personal freedom of religion. An additional declaration allowed provinces and cities that wished to remain Catholic to join the Union.
* 1598 – The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued by the [[King of France]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was the formal religious settlement which ended the first era of the French Wars of Religion. The Edict granted to French [[Huguenots]] legal recognition as well as limited religious freedoms, including: freedom of public worship, the right of assembly, rights of admission to public offices and universities, and permission to maintain fortified towns. The Edict of Nantes, however, would be revoked in 1685 by Henry IV's grandson, [[Louis XIV]], who once again proclaimed Protestantism to be illegal in France through the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].
* 1609 – The [[Letter of Majesty]] by King of Bohemia and Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], valid for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Duchies of Silesia]], introducing freedom of religion and religious toleration for all (including non-privileged classes, i.e. peasants etc.)
* 21 April 1649 – [[Maryland Toleration Act]] in the early American colony [[Province of Maryland]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was passed by Maryland's colonial assembly mandating religious tolerance for Catholicism. It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the [[British North American colonies]] and created the first legal limitations on [[hate speech]] in the world. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for [[English Catholics]], sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The Maryland Toleration Act influenced related laws in other colonies and was an important predecessor to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which enshrined religious freedom in American law over a century later.
*16 September 1664 – Edict of Toleration in the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (now in [[Germany]]), tolerance of the Protestant denominations with each other
*29 October 1685 – [[Edict of Potsdam]], for reform of Huguenots in Lutheran [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Kingdom]]
*1689 – [[Parliament]] in [[England]] passes the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] protecting [[Protestants]] with [[Roman Catholics]] intentionally excluded
* 1692 – The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] issued the [[Chinese Rites controversy#Reception in China|Chinese Edict of Toleration]] on 22 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

*29 March 1712 – Tolerance Act of [[Ernst Casimir]] in [[Büdingen]]. It guaranteed ''vollkommene Gewissensfreiheit'' (complete [[freedom of conscience]]) and demanded in return, the civil authorities and subjects both in their homes to behave as honorable, decent and Christian. The real aim was to counteract the war and plague which had caused the population decline.
*17 June 1773 – Tolerance Edict of [[Catherine II]] of Russia, in response to domestic political disputes with the Muslim [[Tatars]]. In the tolerance edict, she promised the toleration of all religious denominations in the [[Russian Empire]], except for the large number of Jews who came under Russian rule after the [[First partition of Poland]].
*1781/82 – A [[Patent of Toleration]] and linked [[1782 Edict of Tolerance]] (for Jews) issued by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], extended religious freedom to non-Catholic Christians living in [[Habsburg lands]], including: Lutherans, Calvinists, and the Greek Orthodox. However, in the end, Joseph's rescinded his own toleration patent while on his deathbed.
*1784 – Tolerance Edict of Elector Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, meant toleration of Protestants in the [[Electorate of Trier]].

[[File:Berijam tiger sign.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Tiger]] as flagship species for a campaign in India]]
In [[conservation biology]], a '''flagship species''' is a species chosen to raise support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. Definitions have varied, but they have tended to focus on the strategic goals and the [[socio-economic]] nature of the concept, to support the [[marketing]] of a conservation effort. The species need to be popular, to work as symbols or icons, and to stimulate people to provide money or support.

Species selected since the idea was developed in 1980s include widely recognised and charismatic species like the [[black rhinoceros]], the [[Bengal tiger]], and the [[Asian elephant]]. More locally significant species like the [[Chesapeake blue crab]] and the [[Pemba flying fox]] have suited a cultural and social context.

Utilizing a flagship species has limitations. It can skew management and conservation priorities, which may  conflict. Stakeholders may be negatively affected if the flagship species is lost. The use of a flagship may have limited effect, and the approach may not protect the species from extinction: all of the top ten charismatic groups of animal including tigers, lions, elephants and giraffes are [[endangered]].

== Definitions ==

[[File:JCBCP logo.png|thumb|upright|[[Zanzibar red colobus]] as flagship species for a conservation organization in [[Zanzibar]]]]

The term flagship is linked to the [[metaphor]] of representation. In its popular usage, flagships are viewed as ambassadors or icons for a conservation project or movement. The geographer Maan Barua noted that metaphors influence what people understand and how they act; that mammals are disproportionately chosen; and that biologists need to come to grips with language to improve the public's knowledge of conservation.&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | title=Mobilizing metaphors: the popular use of keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation| volume=20 | issue=7 | year=2011 | doi=10.1007/s10531-011-0035-y | pages=1427–1440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several definitions have been advanced for the flagship species concept and for some time there has been confusion even in the academic literature.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Verissimo | first=Diogo | last2=MacMillan | first2=Douglas C. | last3=Smith | first3=Robert J. | title=Toward a systematic approach for identifying conservation flagships | journal=Conservation Letters | volume=4 | issue=1 | date=2010-11-29 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2010.00151.x | pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the latest definitions focus on the strategic, socio-economic, and marketing character of the concept.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ducarme2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ducarme |first=Frédéric |last2=Luque |first2=Gloria M. |last3=Courchamp |first3=Franck |title=What are "charismatic species" for conservation biologists ? |url=http://biologie.ens-lyon.fr/ressources/bibliographies/m1-11-12-biosci-reviews-ducarme-f-1c-m.xml |journal=BioSciences Master Reviews |year=2012 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship species projects have sometimes been successful in saving the species and its habitat, as with the American [[bald eagle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bald Eagles {{!}} Life History and Conservation Success |url=https://www.fws.gov/midwest/Eagle/recovery/index.html |publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[manatee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |authorlink1=Sean B.

== Choosing species ==
Chosen flagship species include the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris''), the [[giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''), the [[Golden lion tamarin]] (''Leontopithecus rosalia''), the [[African elephant]] (''Loxodonta sp.'') and [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus'').&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barua Mutiny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | last2=Tamuly | first2=Jatin | last3=Ahmed | first3=Riyaz Akhtar | title=Mutiny or Clear Sailing?

Some flagship species are [[keystone species]], like the African lion, a [[apex predator|top predator]]: it used to control the populations of large herbivores, protecting ecosystems across the entire landscape. However, the lion's ability to serve as a keystone species is decreasing as its population and range decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The African lion: what faster decline of apex predator means for ecosystems |url=http://theconversation.com/the-african-lion-what-faster-decline-of-apex-predator-means-for-ecosystems-49688 |publisher=The Conversation |accessdate=18 April 2018 |date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaleKoprowski2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hale | first=Sarah L. | last2=Koprowski | first2=John L. | title=Ecosystem-level effects of keystone species reintroduction: a literature review | journal=Restoration Ecology | volume=26 | issue=3 | pages=439–445 | date=February 2018 | doi=10.1111/rec.12684}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] uses flagship species as one of its species classification categories, along with keystone and [[indicator species]]. It chooses between these when selecting a priority species to represent the conservation threats facing a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Species Programe: how WWF classifies species {{!}} Know your flagship, keystone, priority and indicator species |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/flagship_keystone_indicator_definition/|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] |accessdate=18 April 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship species can represent an environmental feature (e.g. a species or ecosystem), cause (e.g. climate change or ocean acidification), organization (e.g. NGO or government department) or geographic region (e.g. state or protected area).&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Veríssimo | first=Diogo | last2=MacMillan | first2=Douglas C. | last3=Smith | first3=Robert J. | title=Marketing diversity: a response to Joseph and colleagues | journal=Conservation Letters | volume=4 | issue=4 | date=2011-04-01 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2011.00175.x | pages=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barua Ambio"/&gt;

Flagship species can be selected according to many different methodologies, such as [[social marketing]], [[environmental economics]], and [[conservation biology]], depending on what is [[value (economics)|valued]] by the audience they try to target,&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt; and the goals of the project, such as conservation awareness, fundraising, [[ecotourism]] promotion, community-based conservation, and promotion of funded research.&lt;ref name="Barua Ambio"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | last2=Root-Bernstein | first2=Meredith | last3=Ladle | first3=Richard J. | last4=Jepson | first4=Paul | title=Defining Flagship Uses is Critical for Flagship Selection: A Critique of the IUCN Climate Change Flagship Fleet | journal=AMBIO | volume=40 | issue=4 | date=2011-01-04 | doi=10.1007/s13280-010-0116-2 | pmid=21809786 | pages=431–435| pmc=3357738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the differences in recommendations made for flagship species selection targeting different target audiences such as local communities&lt;ref name="Bowen-Jones 2002" /&gt; and tourists.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Seychelles"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Veríssimo | first=D. | last2=Fraser | first2=I. | last3=Groombridge | first3=J. | last4=Bristol | first4=R. | last5=MacMillan | first5=D.

== Limitations ==
[[File:5000 tz shillings front.jpg|thumb|left|5000 Tanzanian shillings bank note with [[Black rhinoceros]] as flagship for the country's wildlife]]
The use of flagship species has some limitations:&lt;ref name="Courchamp2018"/&gt;
* They can skew the management and conservation priorities in their favour, to the detriment of more threatened but less charismatic species.&lt;ref name="Simberloff"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Simberloff | first=Daniel | title=Flagships, umbrellas, and keystones: Is single-species management passé in the landscape era? | journal=Biological Conservation | volume=83 | issue=3 | year=1998 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(97)00081-5 | pages=247–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The management of different flagships can conflict.&lt;ref name="Simberloff" /&gt;
* The disappearance of the flagship can have negative impacts on the attitudes of the conservation stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Simberloff" /&gt;
* They may have limited impact on the behaviour of donors, if the donors cannot dedicate much time to processing the campaign message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Veríssimo |first=Diogo |last2=Campbell |first2=Hamish A. |last3=Tollington |first3=Simon |last4=MacMillan |first4=Douglas C. |last5=Smith |first5=Robert J. |date=2018-01-25 |title=Why do people donate to conservation?

Leaving aside the impact on other species, charisma does not seem to protect even charismatic species against extinction. All ten of the most charismatic groups{{efn|Elephant includes African savannah, African forest, and Asian species; giraffe has been split into four species.}} of animal identified in a 2018 study, namely tiger, lion, elephant, giraffe, leopard, panda, cheetah, polar bear, wolf, and gorilla, are currently [[endangered]]; only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population. The researchers suggest that the widespread use of images of these animals has given the public the impression that the animals are abundant, obscuring their high risk of imminent extinction. They note that this remains true despite the intense focus of conservation efforts on these particular species.&lt;ref name="Courchamp2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Courchamp |first1=F. |last2=Jaric |first2=I. |last3=Albert |first3=C. |last4=Meinard |first4=Y. |last5=Ripple |first5=W.

This has been termed 'flagship mutiny', and is exemplified by the Asian elephant in countries where there is human-elephant conflict.&lt;ref name="Barua Mutiny"/&gt;

== Other types ==

Conservation flagships can be used at broader levels, for example as ecosystems like coral reefs, rainforests or protected areas like the Serengeti or Yellowstone. Some recent initiatives have developed flagships based on the conservation value of particular areas or species. Examples of these are the EDGE project run by the [[Zoological Society of London]] and the Hotspots run by [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt;
More recently, work in microbiology has started to use flagship species in a distinct way. This work relates to the biogeography of micro-organisms and uses particular species because "eyecatching "flagships" with conspicuous size and/or morphology are the best distribution indicators".&lt;ref name="Foissner 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foissner |first1=Wilhelm |title=Two new "flagship" ciliates (Protozoa, Ciliophora) from Venezuela: Sleighophrys pustulata and Luporinophrys micelae |journal=European Journal of Protistology |date=April 2005 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=99–117 |doi=10.1016/j.ejop.2004.10.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0932473904001026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foissner 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Foissner, W. |author2=Stoeck, T. |year=2006 |title=''Rigidothrix goiseri'' nov gen., nov spec.

"'''Frenemy'''" (less commonly spelled "'''frienemy'''") is an [[oxymoron]] and a [[portmanteau]] of "[[friendship|friend]]" and "[[enemy]]" that refers to "a person with whom one is friendly, despite a fundamental dislike or rivalry" or "a person who combines the characteristics of a friend and an enemy".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"frenemy, n."&amp;nbsp;''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web. 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe personal, geopolitical and commercial relationships both among individuals and groups or institutions. The word has appeared in print as early as 1953 in an article titled "Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies?" by the American gossip columnist [[Walter Winchel]] in the [[Nevada State Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Winchell |authorlink=Walter Winchell |title=Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies? |work=[[Reno Gazette-Journal|Nevada State Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=19 May 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy |last=Cavendish |authorlink=Walter Winchell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/8250216/The-best-of-frenemies.html|title=The best of frenemies|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==
A ''[[Businessweek]]'' article stated that frenemies in the workplace are common, due to increasingly informal environments and the "abundance of very close, intertwined relationships that bridge people's professional and personal lives ... [while] it certainly wasn't unheard of for people to socialize with colleagues in the past, the sheer amount of time that people spend at work now has left a lot of people with less time and inclination to develop friendships outside of the office."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070614_437227.htm Frenemies at Work], Liz Ryan, BusinessWeek, June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California golden trout''', or simply the '''golden trout ''' (''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita''), is a [[subspecies]] of the [[rainbow trout]] native to [[California]]. The golden trout is native to Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the [[Kern River]]), Volcano Creek (tributary to Golden Trout Creek), and the [[South Fork Kern River]]. It is the state fish of California.

The California golden trout is closely related to two other [[rainbow trout]] subspecies. The [[Little Kern golden trout]] (''O. m. whitei''), found in the [[Little Kern River]] basin, and the [[Kern River rainbow trout]] (''O. m. gilberti''), found in the [[Kern River]] system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the "golden trout complex".&lt;ref&gt;Inland Fishes of California, By Peter B. Moyle. Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wind River 08 042.jpg|Right|thumb|Golden trout caught in a high mountain lake of the [[Wind River Range]].]]

==Taxonomy==
Originally the golden trout was described as a subspecies of the salmon species, with a name ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita'',&lt;ref name=cof/&gt; and it is still often considered a subspecies (now called ''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita'') along with several other rainbow trout subspecies commonly known as [[redband trout]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[FishBase]] and the [[Catalog of Fishes]] however now (2014) list ''O. aguabonita'' as an independent species rather than as subspecies of ''O. mykiss''.&lt;ref name=cof&gt;W. Eschmeyer (2014) [http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatget.asp?spid=10603 aguabonita, Salmo mykiss] Catalog of Fishes. California Academy of Sciences. (accessed 3 Nov 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase|Oncorhynchus|aguabonita|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, while [[ITIS]] lists ''O. m. whitei''  and ''O. m. gilberti'' as subspecies of ''O. mykiss'',&lt;ref name=itis&gt;{{ ITIS | id=161989 | taxon=Oncorhynchus mykiss | accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''O. aguabonita'' instead is listed as a full species.&lt;ref name=itis-mykiss-aguabonita/&gt;&lt;ref name=itis-aguabonita&gt;{{ ITIS | id=161987 | taxon=Oncorhynchus aguabonita | accessdate=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The golden trout has golden flanks with red, horizontal bands along the lateral lines on each side and about 10 dark, vertical, oval marks (called "parr marks") on each side.  Dorsal, lateral and anal fins have white leading edges. In their native habitat, adults range from {{convert|6|to|12|in|cm}} long. Fish over {{convert|12|in|cm}} are considered large. Golden trout that have been transplanted to lakes have been recorded up to {{convert|11|lbs|kg}}.

The golden trout should be distinguished from the similarly named [[Rainbow trout|golden rainbow trout]], also known as the palomino trout. The golden rainbow is a color variant of the rainbow trout.&lt;ref&gt;S. Dobosz, K. Kohlmann, K. Goryczko, H. Kuzminski. "Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout". ''[[Journal of Applied Ichthyology]]'', Volume 16, Issue 3 pp. 117–120, June 2000 {{doi|10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00147.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden trout is commonly found at elevations from {{convert|6890|ft|m}} to {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], and is native only to [[California]]'s southern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. Outside of its native range in California, Golden trout are more often found in cirques and creeks in wilderness areas around 10,500–12,000"+, often beyond 12,500"+ passes that are not passable without crampons, ice axes, and ropes until after the Fourth of July.&lt;ref name=Plan/&gt; Their preferred water temperature is {{convert|58|to|62|F|C}} but they can tolerate temperatures in degraded streams on the Kern Plateau as high as {{convert|70|F|C}} so long as those waters cool during the night.&lt;ref name=Plan/&gt; The only other species of fish indigenous to the native range of California golden trout is the [[Sacramento sucker]] (''Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis'').&lt;ref name=Pister/&gt;

=== Record catches ===

The Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Department state record golden trout measured {{convert|28|in|cm|abbr=on}} and weighed {{convert|11.25|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, caught in Cook Lake, Wyoming in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wyoming's Record Fish | publisher=Wyoming Game and Fish Department | url=http://wgfd.wyo.gov/web2011/FISHING-1000210.aspx | date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IGFA]] "All-Tackle Length Record" for ''O. m. aguabonita'' measured {{convert|53|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=flip}} caught in Golden Lake, Wyoming in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackleLength&amp;cn=Trout,%20golden IGFA World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

''O. m. aguabonita'' is native to the southern Sierra Nevada, including the upper reach and tributaries of the South Fork of the Kern River, and Golden Trout Creek and its tributaries.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; It has been introduced in hundreds of lakes and streams outside the native range, though most of these populations did not last or hybridized with cutthroat trout and other subspecies of rainbow trout.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Distribution data that may be incomplete or inaccurate includes the Canadian province of Alberta, and the US states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt;

==History==
In 1892 the California golden trout was originally described by [[David Starr Jordan]], the first President of [[Stanford University]], as ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita''. The fish was named after the Agua Bonita Waterfall where the first specimens were collected, at the mouth of Volcano Creek, at the creek's confluence with the Kern River.&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal |title=A description of the golden trout of Kern River, California, ''Salmo mykiss agua-bonita'' |author=David Starr Jordan |journal=Proceedings of the United States National Museum |volume=xv |issue=916 |date=1892-07-24 |pages=481–483 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/14131 |accessdate=2012-10-16 |doi=10.5479/si.00963801.15-916.481}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later they were listed as ''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita'' in [[Robert J. Behnke|Behnke's]] ''Native trout of western North America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Native trout of western North America. Monograph No. 6 |authorlink=Robert J. Behnke |author=Robert J. Behnke |publisher=American Fisheries Society |year=1992 |isbn=9780913235799 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Stewart Edward White communicated to his friend President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], that overfishing could lead to extinction of the golden trout. In White's novel ''The Mountains'', he wrote about the threatened golden trout on California’s Kern Plateau. Roosevelt shared White’s concern and, through U.S. Fish Commissioner George M. Bowers, dispatched biologist [[Barton Warren Evermann]] of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries to study the situation. In 1906 Evermann published ''The Golden Trout of the Southern High Sierras''.&lt;ref name=Evermann&gt;{{cite book |title= The golden trout of the southern high Sierras |authors=Barton Warren Evermann, Oliver Peebles Jenkins, Chancey Juday |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1906 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_golden_trout_of_the_southern_high_Si.html?id=Zds_AAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on morphology, Evermann accurately described four forms of this native fish: ''Salmo roosevelti'' from Golden Trout (Volcano) Creek, ''Salmo aguabonita'' from nearby South Fork of the Kern River, ''Salmo whitei'' (named in recognition of Stewart Edward White) from the Little Kern River, and ''Salmo gilberti'', the Kern River rainbow.&lt;ref name=Pister&gt;{{cite journal |title=California Golden Trout: Perspectives on Restoration and Management |author=Edwin Philip Pister |journal=Fisheries |volume=35 |number=11 |pages=550–553 |doi=10.1577/1548-8446-35.11.550|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies have since clarified three groups of trout native to the Kern River: California golden trout (''O. m. aguabonita'') native to the South Fork Kern River and Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River mainstem but the historic course of the South Fork Kern River and now only separated from it by a lava flow and ridge of sediment), Little Kern River golden trout (''O. m. whitei''), and Kern River rainbow trout (''O. m. gilberti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|title=Systematics, genetics and conservation of golden trout.

==Conservation==
Years of [[overfishing|overexploitation]], mismanagement and competition with [[introduced species|exotic species]] have brought golden trout to the brink of being designated as "[[Threatened species|threatened]]".{{citation needed | reason=Designated by whom? Which subspecies? Circumstances of "brink" of designation? | date=December 2013}} Introduced [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') outcompete them for food, introduced [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta'') prey on them and introduced rainbow trout (''O. mykiss'') hybridize with them, damaging the native gene pool through [[introgression]]. Populations have been in steady decline for decades.

In 1978 the [[Golden Trout Wilderness]] was established within [[Inyo National Forest]] and [[Sequoia National Forest]], protecting the upper watersheds of the Kern River and South Fork Kern River.

In September 2004, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] signed an agreement with federal agencies to work on restoring back-country habitat, heavily damaged by overgrazing from cattle and sheep, as part of a comprehensive conservation strategy.&lt;ref name=Plan&gt;{{cite report |title=Conservation Assessment and Strategy for the California Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita) Tulare County, California |authors=Stanley J. Stephens, Christy McGuire, Lisa Sims |publisher=California Department of Fish and Game |date=2004-09-17 |url=http://www.tucalifornia.org/cgtic/GTCAssessmnt&amp;Strategy9-04.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719005821/http://www.tucalifornia.org/cgtic/GTCAssessmnt%26Strategy9-04.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Endangered Species Act|US Endangered Species Act]] (USESA) designated the subspecies ''O. m. whitei'' as LT, or Listed Threatened, since 1978, under the name ''Oncorhynchus aguabonita whitei''.&lt;ref name=natureserve-whitei/&gt;

===Subspecies designations===
[[NatureServe]] has designated the following [[NatureServe Conservation Status]] for the three subspecies:

* [[Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita|''Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita''—Golden trout]] (G5T1): [[Critically endangered|Critically Imperiled]], last reviewed in 2013.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita&gt;{{cite web | title=Comprehensive Report Species – Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita | url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Oncorhynchus+mykiss+aguabonita | website=NatureServe Explorer | publisher=NatureServe Inc. | accessdate=27 December 2013 | last=Hammerson | first=G | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threat is hybridization and introgression with stocked rainbow trout.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Other threats include competition with non-native brown trout and rainbow trout, predation by brown trout, habitat degradation from cattle grazing, and possibly expanding beaver populations in the native range.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Genetic studies showed hybridization with stocked rainbow trout in almost all known wild populations analyzed to as of 2003.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt; Non-hybridized populations are restricted to less than 1% of their native range, and confinement to these areas for long periods create a significant risk of inbreeding depression, and loss of heterozygosity and genetic variance.&lt;ref name=natureserve-aguabonita/&gt;

==Translocations outside of endemic range==
For sportfishing, the California golden trout underwent many twentieth century translocations into multiple Western states and established populations survive in California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, Colorado, and Wyoming. Populations in the high-elevation lakes in the [[Ruby Mountains]], Nevada, have died out.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web |title=''Oncorhynchus aguabonita'' (Golden Trout) |author=Pam Fuller and Matt Neilson |publisher=USGS Nonindigenous aquatic species (NAS) database |date=2012-03-29 |url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=889 |accessdate=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current status in other states where the California golden trout were planted (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon) lacks documentation.

==Chuck Yeager and the New Mexico population==
When [[Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager]] introduced one of his commanding officers, [[General]] Irving "Twig" Branch, to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] populations of golden trout, Branch ordered Yeager and [[Clarence E. Anderson|Bud Anderson]] to introduce the species to the mountain streams of [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="yeagerbio_348-351"&gt;[[Chuck Yeager|Yeager, Chuck]] and [[Leo Janos|Janos, Leo]]. ''Yeager: An Autobiography''. Pages 348-351 (paperback). New York: Bantam Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0-553-25674-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Mexico populations have also died out.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

In his second autobiography, ''Press On'', Yeager details his annual fishing trips to catch golden trout which he extols as one of the best game fish and best eating fish to be found.

{{About||the arguments in political science theory|greed versus grievance|issues related to labour disputes|Grievance (labour)}}

In general, '''grievance''' (from class. lat. ''gravis'': heavy) is a [[wrong]] or [[wikt:hardship|hardship]] suffered, real or supposed, which forms legitimate grounds of [[complaint]]. In the past, the word meant [[Oppression|oppressive]] state of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and politics==

}}

The revolt of English barons in the early thirteenth century which led to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 was partly motivated by grievances against abuses by [[John of England|King John]]. This right to [[Petition]] the king, for grievances, was affirmed in the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] is mainly an enumeration of the colonists' grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

'''Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims''' is one of the National Memorial Halls in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].

==Overview==
The Hall was founded by the Japanese national government to mourn the atomic bomb victims in 2002. It was designed by [[Kenzo Tange]].  There is [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims|another National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] built for the same purpose.

The Hall is in [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] near [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] across the "Motoyasu River" by "Motoyasu Bridge".  The Hall curators are collecting atomic bomb memories and stories from the survivors to mourn the victims, as the survivors are aging. They are also collecting names and photographs of atomic bomb victims for the same purpose and for the same reason. From the collection, they are developing a project to "read the stories of the atomic bombing".

Admission is free of charge.

'''''Idios kosmos''''' comes from Greek and means private world. It exists with, and is opposite to, '''''koinos kosmos''''' (shared world). ''Idios kosmos'' is the view of the world that is developed from personal experience and knowledge and is therefore unique; however, it can be difficult to tell the difference between it and ''koinos kosmos''.

The two phrases come from the [[Diels–Kranz numbering system|Diels-Kranz]] fragment B89 of [[Heraclitus]]: ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι τοῖς ἐγρηγορόσιν ἕνα καὶ κοινὸν κόσμον εἶναι τῶν δὲ κοιμωμένων ἕκαστον εἰς ἴδιον ἀποστρέφεσθαι  ("Heraclitus said that the waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.")

The idea of ''idios kosmos'' is an important part of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s views on [[schizophrenia]], as expressed in his 1964 essay "Schizophrenia &amp; 'The Book of Changes'", drawing on personal experience with the [[I Ching]].

'''Jacek Tylicki''' (born 1951 in [[Sopot]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) is a Polish artist who settled in [[New York City]] in 1982. Tylicki works in the field of [[land art]], [[installation art]], and [[site-specific art]]. His [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] projects often raise social and environmental issues.

==Works==
Starting in 1973, Tylicki began sending sheets of canvas or paper into the [[wind]], [[river]]s, or [[forest]]s and leaving them for a long while in a natural environment, thus forcing upon nature an attitude previously reserved to the artist: the creation of forms. The project is often called ''natural art''.
 
In the years 1974–1990, he initiated the idea of an anonymous artist by issuing a periodical called ''Anonymous Artists'' where artists could present their art without revealing their own names.

In 1985 he created an [[Installation art|installation]] called ''Chicken Art''. Tylicki transformed the [[Now Gallery]] in [[Manhattan]] to a hen house in which live chickens watched realistic paintings of chickens, chicks and roosters hanging on the gallery walls. Tylicki declared: 

{{quote|text=For a chicken the most beautiful is chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the 1987 project entitled "Chicken &amp; Art", cited in: Leszek Brogowski. "Jacek Tylicki and the new ethos of Art," in ''Projekt Visual Art Magazine,'' nr. 202-203, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another installation was the ''Free Art'', where Tylicki invited well-known artists, including [[Mark Kostabi]] and [[Rodney Greenblat]], to give away their art to the public for free. [[Video art|Video]] and [[photography]] play an important role in his work as a record of its elusiveness and transience.

}}'''Joy Bale Boone''' (October 29, 1912 – October 3, 2002) was an American poet best known for her devotion to the arts. She was also active in the [[women's liberation movement]] throughout her life. Although she was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] Boone spent most of her life in [[Kentucky]].

==Life and career==
Boone became interested in poetry at a very young age. As a young girl, she attended the Chicago Latin School and then went on to [[Roycemore School]] for girls. Boone received inspiration as a young girl from poet [[Harriet Monroe]], who lived just a few blocks away from her as a child. Bale Boone came to Kentucky to begin her career in writing after she met her husband, Shelby Garnett Bale. The two met in Chicago while Garnett Bale was attending medical school at [[Northwestern University]]. They were married in 1934. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in both New York and Louisville while Garnett Bale finished his residencies.

In 1944, Boone formed the League of Women Voters in Hardin County, Kentucky. and served as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale Boone's first job in Kentucky came in 1945 as a book reviewer for the [[Louisville Courier-Journal]]. In 1964, Boone went on to found the literary magazine ''Approaches''. She held the position of editor of the magazine until 1975. She was also the editor for the 1964 and 1967 ''Contemporary Poetry'' collections. Bale Boone has had many individual poems published, but her most significant work was ''The Storm's Eye: A Narrative in Verse Celebrating Cassius Marcellus Clay, Man of Freedom 1810–1903.'' Her two collections of poetry include: ''Never Less Than Love'' (1972) and ''Even Without Love'' (1992). Boone received the Distinguished Kentuckian Award from [[KET]] in 1974. She also received the Sullivan Award from the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1969. Finally, in 1997, Boone was honored by being named the [[Poet Laureate of Kentucky]].&lt;!--"Poet Laureate History." Kentucky Arts Council. Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives and the Kentucky Arts Council, 9 August 2010. Accessed 24 November 2010.--&gt;&lt;ref name="artscouncil1"&gt;[http://artscouncil.ky.gov/Poet/Poet_History.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124145407/http://artscouncil.ky.gov/Poet/Poet_History.htm |date=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone spent most her life in [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]] with her first husband, physician Shelby Garnett Bale. The couple had four sons and two daughters. Shelby Garnett Bale (Senior) died in 1972. In 1975, Boone married [[George Street Boone]] of Elkton. After marrying, she spent many years residing in [[Elkton, Kentucky]] where she continued to write and actively serve the state of Kentucky through the arts.

After suffering from an illness for some time, Boone died in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]] on Tuesday, October 3, 2002, at the age of 89.

==The arts==
Boone dedicated her life to the arts. Throughout her life, she served on numerous committees and boards in hopes that more people would have the opportunity to experience the arts in the way that she had. She served as President of the Friends of Kentucky Libraries; in this role, she spearheaded the creation of the bookmobile, which is still used today to deliver books to those who are unable to come to the library. She served on many other boards and committees, these include: the Kentucky Educational Television Advisory Board, Kentucky Council on Higher Education (now the [[Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education]]), Editorial Board of the [[University Press of Kentucky]], the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]], chair of the Robert Penn Warren Committee at [[Western Kentucky University]], board member the Robert Penn Warren Circle at [[Duke University]], director of the Thomas Clark Foundation of the University Press of Kentucky, and the Gaines Center for the Humanities at the [[University of Kentucky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Langkawi Declaration on the Environment''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the issue of [[environmental sustainability]].  It was issued on October 21, 1989 at [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]], during the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).

The declaration covers a wide range of topics related to the environment, blaming 'past neglect in managing the natural environment and resources'.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |date=21 October 1989 |title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment 1989 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064714/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists what the Heads of Governments perceived to be the main environmental problems: the [[greenhouse effect]], damage to the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], [[marine pollution]], [[land degradation]], and species [[extinction]].  These, the declaration affirmed, were issues that transcended national borders, and hence required the involvement of international organisations, such as the Commonwealth, to coordinate strategies to solve them.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

A key agreement in the formulation of the agreement was the pledge by [[developed country|developed countries]] not to connect future international [[development aid]] to commitment to environmental sustainability or introduce [[trade barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Law and the Conservation of Biological Diversity |last=Bowman |first=Michael |author2=Redgwell, Catherine  |year=1996 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location= |isbn=978-90-411-0863-0 |pages=239 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'),&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt; and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments.

Amongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

* Support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and recommend the Commonwealth's own report on [[climate change]].
* Promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].
* Promote [[afforestation]] and sustainable forest management in developing countries, and the conservation of [[Old growth forest|virgin forest]] to protect [[biodiversity]].
* Restrict non-[[sustainable fisheries]], including banning tangle nets and pelagic driftnet fishing, as part of a general trend amongst international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrust.org/dnpaper/intllaw.html |date=May 1994 |title=International Law Governing Driftnet Fishing on the High Seas |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Earthtrust]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''Linearity''' is the property of a mathematical relationship or function which means that it can be graphically represented as a straight [[Line (geometry)|line]]. Examples are the relationship of [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] across a [[resistor]] ([[Ohm's law]]), or the [[mass]] and [[weight]] of an object. [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Proportionality]] implies linearity, but linearity does not imply proportionality.

==In mathematics==
In [[mathematics]], a [[linear map]] or [[linear function]] ''f''(''x'') is a function that satisfies the following two properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwards, Harold M.|title=Linear Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=9780817637316|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylFR4h5BIDEC&amp;pg=PA78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Additive map|Additivity]]: {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'' + ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'')}}.
* [[Homogeneous function|Homogeneity]] of degree 1: {{nowrap|1=''f''(α''x'') = α''f''(''x'')}} for all α.

The homogeneity and additivity properties together are called the superposition principle. It can be shown that additivity implies homogeneity in all cases where α is [[Rational number|rational]]; this is done by proving the case where α is a natural number by [[mathematical induction]] and then extending the result to arbitrary rational numbers. If ''f'' is assumed to be continuous as well, then this can be extended to show homogeneity for any real number α, using the fact that rationals form a dense subset of the reals.

In this definition, ''x'' is not necessarily a [[real number]], but can in general be a member of any [[vector space]]. A more specific definition of [[linear function#As a polynomial function|linear function]], not coinciding with the definition of linear map, is used in elementary mathematics.

The concept of linearity can be extended to linear [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s. Important examples of linear operators include the [[derivative]] considered as a [[differential operator]], and many constructed from it, such as [[del]] and the [[Laplacian]].  When a [[differential equation]] can be expressed in linear form, it is generally straightforward to solve by breaking the equation up into smaller pieces, solving each of those pieces, and summing the solutions.

[[Linear algebra]] is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of vectors, vector spaces (also called linear spaces), linear transformations (also called linear maps), and systems of linear equations.

The word '''linear''' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''linearis'', which means ''pertaining to or resembling a line''.  For a description of linear and nonlinear equations, see ''[[linear equation]]''. [[Nonlinear]] equations and functions are of interest to [[physicist]]s and [[mathematician]]s because they can be used to represent many natural phenomena, including [[chaos theory|chaos]].

===Linear polynomials===
{{main|linear equation}}

In a different usage to the above definition, a [[polynomial]] of degree 1 is said to be linear, because the [[graph of a function]] of that form is a line.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Stewart (mathematician)|Stewart, James]] (2008). ''Calculus: Early Transcendentals'', 6th ed., Brooks Cole Cengage Learning. {{isbn|978-0-495-01166-8}}, Section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the reals, a [[linear equation]] is one of the forms:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = m x + b\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is often called the [[slope]] or [[gradient]]; ''b'' the [[y-intercept]], which gives the point of intersection between the graph of the function and the ''y''-axis.

Note that this usage of the term ''linear'' is not the same as in the section above, because linear polynomials over the real numbers do not in general satisfy either additivity or homogeneity. In fact, they do so [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 0}}. Hence, if {{nowrap|''b'' ≠ 0}}, the function is often called an '''affine function''' (see in greater generality [[affine transformation]]).

===Boolean functions===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for which there exist &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, \ldots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b_1, \ldots, b_n \in \{0,1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A Boolean function is linear if one of the following holds for the function's [[truth table]]:
# In every row in which the truth value of the function is [[Truth value#Classical logic|T]], there are an odd number of Ts assigned to the arguments, and in every row in which the function is [[Truth value#Classical logic|F]] there is an even number of Ts assigned to arguments. Specifically, {{nowrap|1=''f''(F, F, ..., F) = F}}, and these functions correspond to [[linear map]]s over the Boolean vector space.
# In every row in which the value of the function is T, there is an even number of Ts assigned to the arguments of the function; and in every row in which the [[truth value]] of the function is F, there are an odd number of Ts assigned to arguments. In this case, {{nowrap|1=''f''(F, F, ..., F) = T}}.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference.

[[Negation]], [[Logical biconditional]], [[exclusive or]], [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], and [[contradiction]] are linear functions.

==Physics==
In [[physics]], ''linearity'' is a property of the [[differential equations]] governing many systems; for instance, the [[Maxwell equations]] or the [[diffusion equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Evans | first1=Lawrence C. | title=Partial differential equations | origyear=1998 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-03/S0273-0979-00-00868-5/S0273-0979-00-00868-5.pdf | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | edition=2nd | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-4974-3 |mr=2597943 | year=2010 | volume=19 | doi=10.1090/gsm/019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linearity of a [[differential equation]] means that if two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are solutions of the equation, then any [[linear combination]] {{nowrap|''af'' + ''bg''}} is, too.

In instrumentation, linearity means that for every change in the variable you are observing, you get the same change in the output of the measurement apparatus - this is highly desirable in scientific work. In general, instruments are close to linear over a useful certain range, and most useful within that range.  In contrast, human senses are highly nonlinear- for instance, the brain totally ignores incoming light unless it exceeds a certain [[absolute threshold]] number of photons.

==Electronics==
In [[electronics]], the linear operating region of a device, for example a [[transistor]], is where a [[dependent variable]] (such as the transistor collector [[Electric current|current]]) is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to an [[independent variable]] (such as the base current). This ensures that an analog output is an accurate representation of an input, typically with higher amplitude (amplified). A typical example of linear equipment is a [[high fidelity]] [[audio amplifier]], which must amplify a signal without changing its waveform. Others are [[linear filter]]s, [[linear regulator]]s, and [[linear amplifier]]s in general.

In most [[Science|scientific]] and [[Technology|technological]], as distinct from mathematical, applications, something may be described as linear if the characteristic is approximately but not exactly a straight line; and linearity may be valid only within a certain operating region—for example, a high-fidelity amplifier may distort a small signal, but sufficiently little to be acceptable (acceptable but imperfect linearity); and may distort very badly if the input exceeds a certain value, taking it away from the approximately linear part of the [[transfer function]].&lt;ref name=Whitaker&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Jerry C.|title=The RF transmission systems handbook|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-0973-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5UHVIqEWdQC&amp;pg=SA11-PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral linearity===
{{main |Integral linearity}}
{{over-quotation |section |lengthy=y |date=September 2014}}
For an electronic device (or other physical device) that converts a quantity to another quantity, Bertram S. Kolts writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Linearity and Monotonicity |first=Bertram S. |last=Kolts |publisher=analogZONE |date=2005 |url=http://www.analogzone.com/nett1108.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204065155/http://www.analogzone.com/nett1108.pdf |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Understanding Linearity and Monotonicity |first=Bertram S. |last=Kolts |journal=Foreign Electronic Measurement Technology |year=2005 |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=30–31 |url=http://caod.oriprobe.com/articles/9294129/Understanding_Linearity_and_Monotonicity.htm |accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are three basic definitions for integral linearity in common use: independent linearity, zero-based linearity, and terminal, or end-point, linearity. In each case, linearity defines how well the device's actual performance across a specified operating range approximates a straight line. Linearity is usually measured in terms of a deviation, or non-linearity, from an ideal straight line and it is typically expressed in terms of percent of [[full scale]], or in ppm (parts per million) of full scale. Typically, the straight line is obtained by performing a least-squares fit of the data. The three definitions vary in the manner in which the straight line is positioned relative to the actual device's performance. Also, all three of these definitions ignore any gain, or offset errors that may be present in the actual device's performance characteristics.

Many times a device's specifications will simply refer to linearity, with no other explanation as to which type of linearity is intended. In cases where a specification is expressed simply as linearity, it is assumed to imply independent linearity.

Independent linearity is probably the most commonly used linearity definition and is often found in the specifications for [[Multimeter|DMM]]s and [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]s, as well as devices like [[potentiometer]]s. Independent linearity is defined as the maximum deviation of actual performance relative to a straight line, located such that it minimizes the maximum deviation. In that case there are no constraints placed upon the positioning of the straight line and it may be wherever necessary to minimize the deviations between it and the device's actual performance characteristic.

Zero-based linearity forces the lower range value of the straight line to be equal to the actual lower range value of the device's characteristic, but it does allow the line to be rotated to minimize the maximum deviation. In this case, since the positioning of the straight line is constrained by the requirement that the lower range values of the line and the device's characteristic be coincident, the non-linearity based on this definition will generally be larger than for independent linearity.

For terminal linearity, there is no flexibility allowed in the placement of the straight line in order to minimize the deviations. The straight line must be located such that each of its end-points coincides with the device's actual upper and lower range values. This means that the non-linearity measured by this definition will typically be larger than that measured by the independent, or the zero-based linearity definitions. This definition of linearity is often associated with ADCs, [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]s and various sensors.

A fourth linearity definition, absolute linearity, is sometimes also encountered. Absolute linearity is a variation of terminal linearity, in that it allows no flexibility in the placement of the straight line, however in this case the gain and offset errors of the actual device are included in the linearity measurement, making this the most difficult measure of a device's performance. For absolute linearity the end points of the straight line are defined by the ideal upper and lower range values for the device, rather than the actual values. The linearity error in this instance is the maximum deviation of the actual device's performance from ideal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Military tactical formations==
In [[formation (military)|military tactical formations]], "linear formations" were adapted from phalanx-like formations of [[pike (weapon)|pike]] protected by handgunners towards shallow formations of handgunners protected by progressively fewer pikes. This kind of formation would get thinner until its extreme in the age of Wellington with the '[[The Thin Red Line (1854 battle)|Thin Red Line]]'. It would eventually be replaced by [[skirmisher|skirmish order]] at the time of the invention of the [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[rifle]] that allowed soldiers to move and fire independently of the large-scale formations and fight in small, mobile units.

==Art==
'''Linear''' is one of the five categories proposed by Swiss art historian [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] to distinguish "Classic", or [[Renaissance art]], from the [[Baroque]]. According to Wölfflin, painters of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries ([[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] or [[Albrecht Dürer]]) are more linear than "[[painterly]]" Baroque painters of the seventeenth century ([[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]) because they primarily use outline to create [[shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art |last=Wölfflin |first=Heinrich |editor-last=Hottinger |editor-first=M.D. |publisher=Dover |location=New York |year=1950 |pages=18–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linearity in art can also be referenced in [[digital art]]. For example, [[hypertext fiction]] can be an example of [[nonlinear narrative]], but there are also websites designed to go in a specified, organized manner, following a linear path.

==Music==
In music the '''linear''' aspect is succession, either [[interval (music)|interval]]s or [[melodic|melody]], as opposed to [[simultaneity (music)|simultaneity]] or the [[Interval (music)|vertical]] aspect.

==Measurement==
In measurement, the term "linear foot" refers to the number of feet in a straight line of material (such as lumber or fabric) generally without regard to the width.  It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "lineal feet"; however, "lineal" is typically reserved for usage when referring to ancestry or heredity.[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictL.html] The words "linear"[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/l/l0180100.html] &amp; "lineal" [http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/l/l0180300.html]
both descend from the same root meaning, the [[Latin]] word for line, which is "linea".

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix field''' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] as elements. In [[field (mathematics)|field theory]] we come across two type of fields: [[finite field]] and [[infinite set|infinite]] field. There are several examples of matrix fields of finite and infinite order. In general, corresponding to each field of numbers there is a matrix field. 

There is a finite matrix field of order ''p'' for each positive [[prime]]&amp;nbsp;''p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=S. K.|title=Matrix Field of Finite and Infinite Order|journal=International Research Journal of Pure Algebra|volume=5|issue=12|pages=214–216 | year=2015 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can find several finite matrix field of [[order theory|order]] p for any given positive prime p. In general, corresponding to each finite field there is a matrix field. However any two finite fields of equal order are algebraically equivalent. The [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of a [[finite field]] can be represented by matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| | last=Lidl | first=Rudolf | last2=Niederreiter | first2=Harald | author2-link = Harald Niederreiter | title=Introduction to finite fields and their applications| edition=1st | year=1986 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0-521-30706-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way one can construct a finite matrix field.

Contrary to the general case for matrix multiplication, multiplication is [[commutative property|commutative]] in a matrix field (if the usual operations are used). Since addition and multiplication of matrices have all needed properties for field operations except for commutativity of multiplication, one way to verify if a set of matrices is a field with the usual operations of matrix sum and multiplication is to check wether 

# the neutral elements for sum and multiplication (that is, the [[zero matrix]] and the [[identity matrix]]) are included; 
# the set is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition and multiplication; and 
# multiplication is commutative. 

However, it may be possible to construct fields of matrices using other operations -- in which case it would be necessary to verify all properties of the operations in the set in order to guarantee that it is a field.

==Examples==
1. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[diagonal matrices]] of [[square matrix|order]] n over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational]] ([[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]) [[number]]s is a matrix field of infinite order under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices.

2. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all diagonal matrices of order two over the field of [[integer]]s modulo ''p'' (a positive prime) forms a finite matrix field of order ''p'' under [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of matrices modulo ''p''.

3. (a negative example) It does not suffice for multiplication to commute in order to obtain a field of matrices. Take the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; -- that is, matrices filled with zeroes except for the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th row, which is filled with the same real constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
These matrices are commutative for multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
b      &amp; b      &amp; \cdots &amp; b \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
b      &amp; b      &amp; \cdots &amp; b \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a      &amp; a      &amp; \cdots &amp; a \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ab      &amp; ab      &amp; \cdots &amp; ab \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp;        &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
0      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is no neutral element for multiplication, since this needs to be the identity matrix, and it is not included in the set, so this is ''not'' a matrix field.

4. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all matrices of order two of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
over the [[real number|real numbers]] (or over any other [[field (mathematics)|field]]), with the usual operations of matrix sum and matrix multiplication.
The zero matrix (&lt;math&gt;a=b=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the identity matrix (&lt;math&gt;a=1, b=0&lt;/math&gt;) are included. Summing two of these matrices results in another matrix of the same form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a+x &amp; c(b+y) \\
b+y &amp; a+x
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The same is true for multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
bcy+ax &amp; c(ay+bx) \\
ay+bx  &amp; bcy+ax
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, multiplication is commutative for these matrices:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
bcy+ax &amp; c(ay+bx) \\
ay+bx  &amp; bcy+ax
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x &amp; yc \\
y &amp; x
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

5. As a particular case of example 4, taking &lt;math&gt;c=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; ranging over the reals, one obtains the field of matrices of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
which is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[complex number|complex numbers]]: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the real part of the number, while &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; correspods to the imaginary part. So the number &lt;math&gt;2+3i&lt;/math&gt;, for example, would be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; -3 \\
3 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
One can easily verify, for example, that &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}^2
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
and also, by computing a [[matrix exponential]], that [[euler's identity|Euler's identity, &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}=-1&lt;/math&gt;]] is also valid:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\pi &amp; 0 \\
0   &amp; \pi
\end{pmatrix}}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
6. As another particular case of example 4, a field of matrices 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; bc \\
b &amp; a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; [[square-free element|square-free]] and &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; rationals is isomorphic to the [[quadratic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{c}]&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">The '''meson bomb''' was a proposed [[nuclear weapon]] that would derive its destructive force from [[meson]] interactions with [[fissionable material]] like [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea behind the bomb was rejected by most scientists, but during the [[Cold War]], American intelligence managed to trick the [[Soviet Union]] into conducting research on this topic, which resulted in several years of wasted labor by one of the Soviet nuclear weapon research bureaus.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Origins==
Mesons ([[hadron]]ic [[subatomic particle]]s composed of one [[quark]] and one [[antiquark]], bound together by the [[strong interaction]]) were proposed to form a nuclear weapon as early as the 1940s. Early speculation suggested that the resulting bomb would be the most powerful nuclear weapon yet to have been developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EL4PAAAAIAAJ|year=1948|publisher=Science Service|page=99|quote=The new tests do not, in all probability, involve any radically new and novel bombs, such as the hydrogen-helium bomb or the meson bomb about which there has been some speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iowa Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZgiAQAAMAAJ|year=1945|publisher=Iowa State College|page=160|quote=If mesons could be produced in quantity, they might provide a "meson bomb," thousands of times as powerful as today's atom bomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt; American  physicist [[Ernest Lawrence]] used the potential military applications of mesons to obtain funding for its {{convert|184|inch|adj=on}} [[synchrocyclotron]] built between 1940 and 1946 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Carried by History: Cesar Lattes, Nuclear Emulsions, and the Discovery of the Pi-meson|journal = Physics in Perspective|date = 2014-03-29|issn = 1422-6944|pages = 3–36|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00016-014-0128-6|language = en|first = Cássio Leite|last = Vieira|first2 = Antonio Augusto Passos|last2 = Videira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, the scientific consensus was that construction of such a bomb would be impossible; and in 1968 physicist [[M. Stanley Livingston]] wrote that "no responsible scientists would attempt to justify support in this field with predictions of an 'anti-matter engine,' or a super 'meson bomb,' or a 'hyper-drive' for spaceships."&lt;ref name="Livingston1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Stanley Livingston|title=Particle Physics: The High-energy Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIEKAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet research==
In the 1960s, however, the Soviet Union became convinced that the United States had already developed the meson bomb, and devoted considerable resources to developing its own. In 1994, Russian physicist and chief constructor of nuclear weapons bureau [[KB-11]] (Design Bureau No. 11, set up in 1946) [[Arkadiy Brish]] stated that their work on the meson bomb was prompted by intelligence. Even though physicists [[Yuliy Borisovich Khariton]] and [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] agreed that the reports were nonsensical, the directors of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] decided to pursue this line of research, which resulted in several years of fruitless labor. Brish attributed this to American [[disinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We Copied the Charge Design, Not the Bomb Itself, Maintains Professor Arkadiy Brish, Doctor of Technical Sciences, One of the Developers of Soviet Nuclear Weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7765">In [[mathematics]] (especially [[category theory]]), a '''multicategory''' is a generalization of the concept of [[category (math)|category]] that allows morphisms of multiple [[arity]]. If morphisms in a category are viewed as analogous to [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, then morphisms in a multicategory are analogous to functions of several variables. Multicategories, are also sometimes called [[Operad theory#Operad without permutations|operads]], or colored operads.

== Definition ==

A (non-symmetric) multicategory consists of
* a collection (often a [[proper class]]) of ''objects'';
* for every [[finite sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i \in n}&lt;/math&gt; of objects (for von Neumann ordinal &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) and object ''Y'', a set of ''morphisms'' from &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i \in n}&lt;/math&gt; to ''Y''; and
* for every object ''X'', a special identity morphism (with ''n'' = 1) from ''X'' to ''X''.
Additionally, there are composition operations: Given a sequence of sequences &lt;math&gt;((X_{ij})_{i \in n_j})_{j \in m}&lt;/math&gt; of objects, a sequence &lt;math&gt;(Y_i)_{i \in m}&lt;/math&gt; of objects, and an object ''Z'': if
* for each &lt;math&gt;j \in m&lt;/math&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;(X_{ij})_{i \in n_j}&lt;/math&gt; to ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;; and
* ''g'' is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;(Y_i)_{i \in m}&lt;/math&gt; to ''Z'':
then there is a composite morphism &lt;math&gt;g(f_i)_{i \in m}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;(X_{ij})_{i \in n_j, j \in m}&lt;/math&gt; to ''Z''. This must satisfy certain axioms:
* If ''m'' = 1, ''Z'' = ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''g'' is the identity morphism for ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''g''(''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;;
* if for each &lt;math&gt;i \in m&lt;/math&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, &lt;math&gt;X_{0i} = Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity morphism for ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g(f_i)_{i \in m} = g&lt;/math&gt;; and
* an [[associativity]] condition: if for each &lt;math&gt;k \in m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j \in n_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;(W_{ijk})_{i \in o_{jk}}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g\left(f_j(e_{ij})_{i \in n_j}\right)_{j \in m} = g(f_i)_{i \in m}(e_{ij})_{i \in n_j, j \in m}&lt;/math&gt; are identical morphisms from &lt;math&gt;(W_{ijk})_{i \in o_{jk}, j \in n_k, k \in m}&lt;/math&gt; to ''Z''.

== Comcategories ==

A ''comcategory'' (co-multi-category) is a totally ordered set O of objects, a set A of ''multiarrows'' with two functions

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{head}:A\rightarrow O,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ground}:A\rightarrow O^\%,&lt;/math&gt;

where O&lt;sup&gt;%&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all finite ordered sequences of elements of O. The dual image of a multiarrow f may be summarized

&lt;math&gt;f:\mathrm{head}(f) \Leftarrow \mathrm{ground}(f).&lt;/math&gt;

A comcategory C also has a ''multiproduct'' with the usual character of a composition operation. C is said to be associative if there holds a ''multiproduct axiom'' in relation to this operator.

Any multicategory, symmetric ''or'' non-symmetric, together with a total-ordering of the object set, can be made into an equivalent comcategory.

A ''multiorder'' is a comcategory satisfying the following conditions.

* There is at most one multiarrow with given head and ground.
* Each object x has a unit multiarrow.
* A multiarrow is a unit if its ground has one entry.

Multiorders are a generalization of partial orders (posets), and were first introduced (in passing) by Tom Leinster.&lt;ref name="leinster"&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Tom Leinster
 | year = 2004
 | title = Higher Operads, Higher Categories
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 | arxiv = math/0305049
 | bibcode = 2004hohc.book.....L
 }}, Example 2.1.7, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

There is a multicategory whose objects are (small) [[set (math)|set]]s, where a morphism from the sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the set ''Y'' is an [[binary function|''n''-ary function]],
that is a function from the [[Cartesian product]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''.

There is a multicategory whose objects are [[vector space]]s (over the [[rational number]]s, say), where a morphism from the vector spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the vector space ''Y'' is a [[multilinear operator]], that is a [[linear transformation]] from the [[tensor product]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''.

More generally, given any [[monoidal category]] '''C''', there is a multicategory whose objects are objects of '''C''', where a morphism from the '''C'''-objects ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the '''C'''-object ''Y'' is a '''C'''-morphism from the monoidal product of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Y''.

An [[operad]] is a multicategory with one unique object; except in degenerate cases, such a multicategory does not come from a monoidal category.

Examples of multiorders include ''pointed multisets'' {{OEIS|1=A262671}}, ''integer partitions'' {{OEIS|1=A063834}}, and ''combinatory separations'' {{OEIS|1=A269134}}. The triangles (or compositions) of any multiorder are morphisms of a (not necessarily associative) category of ''contractions'' and a comcategory of ''decompositions''. The contraction category for the multiorder of ''multimin partitions'' {{OEIS|1=A255397}} is the simplest known category of multisets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiseman|first1=Gus|title=Comcategories and Multiorders|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m0s6DGTBkDW9gvMuFmJHvy6oLGRAbQ7okAZcOPZawp0/pub|publisher=Google Docs|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Multicategories are often incorrectly considered to belong to higher category theory, as their original application was the observation that the operators and identities satisfied by higher categories are the objects and multiarrows of a multicategory. The study of n-categories was in turn motivated by applications in algebraic topology and attempts to describe the homotopy theory of higher dimensional manifolds. However it has mostly grown out of this motivation and is now also considered to be part of pure mathematics.[https://www.quora.com/What-does-Tom-Leinster-mean-by-Higher-category-theory-has-its-own-existence]

The correspondence between contractions and decompositions of triangles in a multiorder allows one to construct an associative algebra called its ''incidence algebra''. Any element that is nonzero on all unit arrows has a compositional inverse, and the ''Möbius function'' of a multiorder is defined as the compositional inverse of the zeta function (constant-one) in its incidence algebra.

== History ==

Multicategories were first introduced under that name by [[Jim Lambek]] in "Deductive systems and categories II" (1969)&lt;ref name="Lambek1969"&gt;.{{cite book | last=Lambek | first=Joachim | title=Lecture Notes in Mathematics | chapter=Deductive systems and categories II.

'''North east down''' ('''NED'''), also known as '''local tangent plane''' ('''LTP'''), is a geographical coordinate system for representing [[State vector (geographical)|state vectors]] that is commonly used in [[aviation]].  It consists of three numbers: one represents the position along the northern axis, one along the eastern axis, and one represents vertical position.  Down is chosen as opposed to up in order to comply with the [[right-hand rule]].  The origin of this coordinate system is usually chosen to be a point on the surface of the geoid below the aircraft's center of gravity. However, care must be taken since, if the aircraft is accelerating (turning or accelerating linearly), then the NED coordinates are no longer inertial coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems|last = Cai|first = Guowei|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-85729-634-4|location = |pages = 27|last2 = Chen|first2 = Ben M.|last3 = Lee|first3 = Tong Heng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NED coordinates are similar to [[ECEF]] in that they're Cartesian, however they can be more convenient due to the relatively small numbers involved, and also because of the intuitive axes. NED and ECEF coordinates can be related with the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unmanned Rotorcraft Systems|last = Cai|first = Guowei|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-85729-634-4|location = |pages = 32|last2 = Chen|first2 = Ben M.|last3 = Lee|first3 = Tong Heng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf p_{\mathrm{NED}} = R^T (\mathbf p_{\mathrm{ECEF}} - \mathbf p_{\mathrm{Ref}})
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security''''' is a book written by [[Daniel J. Solove]] regarding the [[nothing to hide argument]] regarding [[privacy]]. It was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2011.

==Summary==
The book, written for a general audience, includes some material that had been adapted by law review articles written by Solove. Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "the average reader may find some discussions of the law difficult to follow."&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;Kessler, Raymond G. "[http://www.lpbr.net/2011/09/nothing-to-hide-false-tradeoff-between.html Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security]" (book review) ([https://www.webcitation.org/6HdSAyXhk Archive]). ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]''. Volume 21, Issue 9. p. 514-517. Retrieved on June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has twenty one chapters in four parts.&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt; The parts are "How We Should Assess and Balance the Values of Privacy and Security", "How the Law Should Address Matters of National Security", "How the Constitution Should Protect Privacy" and "How the Law Should Cope With Changing Technology".&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Tony Doyle wrote in a book review published in the ''[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]'' that "Overwhelmingly ''Nothing to Hide'' is a carefully argued, hysteria-free book" and that the author "makes a strong case for the profound social value of privacy, the siege it is currently under, and how to preserve it."&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Hartzog wrote in the ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' that the thesis of his book review is "[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove]]'s polemic is a strong and desperately needed collection of frames that counterbalances the "nothing to hide" argument and other refrains so often used in privacy disputes."&lt;ref&gt;Hartzog, p. 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Keller wrote in ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'' that the book is "Interesting for those with a passing interest in privacy, security, or legal rhetoric, yet well researched enough to recommend to privacy and security scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J.M. "Solove, Daniel J.: Nothing to hide: the false tradeoff between privacy and security." ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]''. 49.5 (Jan. 2012): p. 980. Available at Academic ASAP Infotrac, Expanded Academic ASAP Infotrac, General OneFile, Literature Resource Center, and Popular Magazines, all by [[Gale Cengage Learning]] (document number: GALE|A276134746).&lt;/ref&gt;

Delmus E. Williams of the ''[[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]'' argues that while Solove "writes well" and "offers solid support for those who would argue that we need more protection for personal privacy" he argues that the book "does not claim to a balanced, and thoughtful readers will want to find other sources if they hope to understand counter arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Delmus E. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133311002357 Nothing to Hide: the Tradeoff between Privacy and Security, Daniel J. Solove (Ed.). Yale University Press, New Haven, CT (2011), 245 pp. $25.00] {{ISBN|978-0-300-17231-7}}" (book review). ''[[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]]''. Volume 38, Issue 1, January 2012, Pages 72. Available at [[SciVerse]], [[ScienceDirect]].&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "Being so short, some readers might find it wanting in details, examples and explanations. However, this work is one very, very, good place to start."&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

'''PDCA''' ('''plan–do–check–act''' or '''plan–do–check–adjust''') is an [[iterative]] four-step [[management]] method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tague |first=Nancy R. |date=2005 |origyear=1995 |chapter=Plan–Do–Study–Act cycle |title=The quality toolbox |edition=2nd |location=Milwaukee |publisher=[[ASQ Quality Press]] |pages=390–392 |isbn=0873896394 |oclc=57251077 |chapterurl=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/project-planning-tools/overview/pdca-cycle.html |accessdate=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''[[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] circle'''/'''cycle'''/'''wheel''', the '''[[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] cycle''', the '''control circle'''/'''cycle''', or '''plan–do–study–act''' ('''PDSA'''). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA.&lt;ref&gt;Foresight University, The Foresight Guide, Shewhart's Learning and Deming's Quality Cycle, [http://www.foresightguide.com/shewhart-and-deming/]&lt;/ref&gt; The added "O" stands for ''observation'' or as some versions say: "Observe the current condition." This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on [[lean manufacturing]] and the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rother |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Rother |date=2010 |title=[[Toyota Kata|Toyota kata: managing people for improvement, adaptiveness, and superior results]] |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0071635238 |oclc=318409119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDCA cycle, with Ishikawa’s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:PDCA Process.png|thumb|350px|right|Continuous quality improvement with PDCA]]

===Plan===
The planning phase involves assessing a current process, or a new process, and figuring out how it can be improved upon. Knowing what types of outputs are desired helps to develop a plan to fix or improve the process. It is often easier to plan smaller changes during this phase of the plan so that they can be easily monitored and the outputs are more predictable. Establish the objectives and necessary to deliver results in accordance with the expected output (the target or goals)

===Do===
The do phase allows the plan from the previous step to be enacted. Small changes are usually tested, and data is gathered to see how effective the change is.

===Check===
During the check phase, the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the PDCA cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others, and if said changes can be improved as well.

Example: Gap analysis, or Appraisals

===Act===
If the '''check phase''' shows that the '''plan phase''' which was implemented in '''do phase''' is an improvement to the prior standard (baseline), then that becomes the new standard (baseline) for how the organization should '''act''' going forward (new standards are thus said to be ''enACTed''). Instead, if the '''check phase''' shows that the '''plan phase''' which was implemented in '''do phase''' is not an improvement, then the existing standard (baseline) will remain in place. In either case, if the '''check phase''' showed something different than expected (whether better or worse), then there is some more learning to be done... and that will suggest potential future PDCA cycles. Note that some who teach PDCA assert that the '''act phase''' involves making adjustments or corrective actions, but generally it would be counter to PDCA thinking to propose and decide upon alternative changes without using a proper '''plan phase''', or to make them the new standard (baseline) without going through '''do''' and '''check''' steps.

===Adjust===
The adjust phase is the alternative version of the act phase. Once PDCA has been run multiple times, the process generally has enough information for it to be considered a new standard. This is usually completed in the act phase. The adjust phase allows the process to continue to be monitored after the changes have been implemented and fix them accordingly. Doing this lets the PDCA cycle truly be for continuous improvement instead of changing a process and letting it become inefficient again.

==About==
PDCA was made popular by [[W. Edwards Deming]], who is considered by many to be the father of modern [[Quality management|quality control]]; however, he always referred to it as the "Shewhart cycle". Later in Deming's career, he modified PDCA to "Plan, Do, Study, Act" (PDSA) because he felt that "check" emphasized inspection over analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aguayo |first=Rafael |date=1990 |title=Dr. Deming: the American who taught the Japanese about quality |series=A Lyle Stuart book |location=Secaucus, NJ |publisher=Carol Pub. Group |page=76 |isbn=0818405198 |oclc=22347078 |ref=harv}} Also published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The PDSA cycle was used to create the model of know-how transfer process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubickis |first1=Mikus |last2=Gaile-Sarkane |first2=Elīna |date=December 2017 |title=Transfer of know-how based on learning outcomes for development of open innovation |journal=Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4 |doi=10.1186/s40852-017-0053-4 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40852-017-0053-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dubberly |first=Hugh |date=2008 |origyear=2004 |title=How do you design?: a compendium of models |url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/how-do-you-design.html |website=dubberly.com |accessdate=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of PDCA is based on the [[scientific method]], as developed from the work of [[Francis Bacon]] (''[[Novum Organum]]'', 1620). The scientific method can be written as "hypothesis–experiment–evaluation" or as "plan–do–check". [[Walter A. Shewhart]] described manufacture under "control"—under statistical control—as a three-step process of specification, production, and inspection.&lt;ref name="Shewhart 1939"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shewhart |first=Walter Andrew |authorlink=Walter A. Shewhart |year=1986 |origyear=1939 |title=Statistical method from the viewpoint of quality control |location=New York |publisher=Dover |isbn=0486652327 |oclc=13822053 |ref=harv}} Reprint. Originally published: Washington, DC: Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} He also specifically related this to the scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, and evaluation. Shewhart says that the statistician "must help to change the demand [for goods] by showing [...] how to close up the tolerance range and to improve the quality of goods."&lt;ref name="Shewhart 1939"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Clearly, Shewhart intended the analyst to take action based on the conclusions of the evaluation. According to Deming, during his lectures in Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese participants shortened the steps to the now traditional ''plan, do, check, act''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming |first=W. Edwards |authorlink=W. Edwards Deming |year=1986 |title=Out of the crisis |page=88 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Center for Advanced Engineering Study |isbn=0911379010 |oclc=13126265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming preferred ''plan, do, study, act'' because "study" has connotations in English closer to Shewhart's intent than "check".&lt;ref name="MoenNorman"&gt;{{cite web |first1= Ronald |last1=Moen |first2=Clifford |last2=Norman |title=Evolution of the PDCA cycle |url=http://www.westga.edu/~dturner/PDCA.pdf |website=westga.edu |publisher=Paper delivered to the Asian Network for Quality Conference in Tokyo on September 17, 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PDCA-Multi-Loop.png|thumb|400px|right|Multiple iterations of the PDCA cycle are repeated until the problem is solved.]]A fundamental principle of the scientific method and PDCA is iteration—once a hypothesis is confirmed (or negated), executing the cycle again will extend the knowledge further. Repeating the PDCA cycle can bring its users closer to the goal, usually a perfect operation and output.&lt;ref name="MoenNorman"/&gt;

Another fundamental function of PDCA is the "hygienic" separation of each phase, for if not properly separated measurements of effects due to various simultaneous actions (causes) risk becoming confounded.&lt;ref name="Berengueres 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berengueres |first=José |title=The Toyota production system re-contextualized |year=2007 |location=Tokyo |publisher=José Berengueres |isbn=1847534775 |oclc=906982187 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDCA (and other forms of scientific problem solving) is also known as a system for developing critical thinking. At Toyota this is also known as "Building people before building cars".&lt;ref name="Liker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Liker |first=Jeffrey K. |title=The Toyota way: 14 management principles from the world's greatest manufacturer |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=0071392319 |oclc=54005437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota and other [[lean manufacturing]] companies propose that an engaged, problem-solving workforce using PDCA in a culture of critical thinking is better able to innovate and stay ahead of the competition through rigorous problem solving and the subsequent innovations.&lt;ref name="Liker"/&gt;

Deming continually emphasized iterating towards an improved system, hence PDCA should be repeatedly implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} One can envision an open coil spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is based on the belief that our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the PDCA—scientific method—provides feedback to justify guesses (hypotheses) and increase knowledge. Rather than enter "[[analysis paralysis]]" to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With improved knowledge, one may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). The aim of the PDCA cycle is to bring its users closer to whatever goal they choose.&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"/&gt;{{rp|160}}

When PDCA is used for complex projects or products with a certain controversy, checking with external stakeholders should happen before the Do stage, since changes to projects and products that are already in detailed design can be costly; this is also seen as Plan-Check-Do-Act.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Rate of change, that is, rate of improvement, is a key competitive factor in today's world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} PDCA allows for major "jumps" in performance ("breakthroughs" often desired in a Western approach), as well as [[kaizen]] (frequent small improvements).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the United States a PDCA approach is usually associated with a sizable project involving numerous people's time,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and thus managers want to see large "breakthrough" improvements to justify the effort expended. However, the scientific method and PDCA apply to all sorts of projects and improvement activities.&lt;ref name="Toyota Kata"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''partial function''' from ''X'' to ''Y'' (sometimes written as {{math|''f'' : ''X'' ↛ ''Y''}} or {{math|''f'': ''X'' ⇸ ''Y''}}) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f'': ''X''{{′}} → ''Y''}}, for some proper [[subset]] ''X''{{′}} of&amp;nbsp;''X''. It generalizes the concept of a function {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} by not forcing ''f'' to map ''every'' element of ''X'' to an element of ''Y'' (only some proper subset ''X''{{′}} of ''X''). If {{nowrap|1=''X''{{′}} = ''X''}}, then ''f'' is called a '''total function''' and is equivalent to a function. Partial functions are often used when the exact [[domain of a function|domain]], ''X'', is not known (e.g. many functions in [[computability theory]]{{examples|date=September 2017}}).

Specifically, we will say that for any {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, either:
* {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} (it is defined as a single element in ''Y'') or
* ''f''(''x'') is undefined.

For example, we can consider the [[square root]] function restricted to the [[integer]]s
:&lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n) = \sqrt{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''g''(''n'') is only defined for ''n'' that are [[square number|perfect squares]] ({{nowrap|i.e., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...}}). So, {{nowrap|1=''g''(25) = 5}}, but ''g''(26) is undefined.

== Basic concepts ==
There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the [[domain of a function|domain]] of a partial function. Most mathematicians, including [[recursion theory|recursion theorists]], use the term "domain of ''f''" for the set of all values ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') is defined (''X&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' above). But some, particularly [[category theory|category theorists]], consider the domain of a partial function ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' to be ''X'', and refer to ''X&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' as the '''domain of definition'''.  Similarly, the term [[range (mathematics)|range]] can refer to either the [[codomain]] or the ''image'' of a function.

A partial function is said to be [[injective]] or [[surjective]] when the total function given by the restriction of the partial function to its domain of definition is injective or surjective respectively.  A partial function may be both injective and surjective (and thus [[bijection|bijective]]).

Because a function is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term [[partial bijection]] denotes a partial function which is injective.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014-251"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An injective partial function may be inverted to an injective partial function, and a partial function which is both injective and surjective has an injective function as inverse. Furthermore, a total function which is injective may be inverted to an injective partial function.

The notion of [[transformation (function)|transformation]] can be generalized to partial functions as well. A '''partial transformation''' is a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''A'' ⇸ ''B''}}, where both ''A'' and ''B'' are [[subset]]s of some set ''X''.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014-251"/&gt;

==Total function==
'''Total function''' is a [[synonym]] for [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. The use of the adjective "total" is to suggest that it is a special case of a partial function (specifically, a total function with domain ''X'' is a special case of a partial function over ''X'').  The adjective will typically be used for clarity in contexts where partial functions are common, for example in [[computability theory]].

==Function spaces==
The set of all partial functions {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' ⇸ ''Y''}} from a set ''X'' to a set ''Y'', denoted by {{nowrap|[''X'' ⇸ ''Y'']}}, is the union of all total functions defined on subsets of ''X'' with same codomain ''Y'':
:&lt;math&gt;[X\not\to Y] =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\limits_{D \subseteq{X}} [D \to Y]&lt;/math&gt;, 
the latter also written as &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\limits_{D\subseteq{X}} Y^D&lt;/math&gt;. In finite case, its cardinality is
:&lt;math&gt;|[X\not\to Y]| =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(|Y|+1)^{|X|}&lt;/math&gt;,
because any partial function can be extended to a total function by any fixed value ''c'' not contained in ''Y'', so that the codomain is {{nowrap|''Y'' ∪ {''c''}}}, an operation which is injective (unique and invertible by restriction).

==Discussion and examples==
The first diagram above represents a partial function that is ''not'' a total function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set.  Whereas, the second diagram represents a total function since every element on the left-hand set is associated with exactly one element in the right hand set.

===Natural logarithm===
Consider the [[natural logarithm]] function mapping the [[real number]]s to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is not a real number, so the natural logarithm function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, but it is a partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the [[positive reals]] (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a total function.

===Subtraction of natural numbers===
Subtraction of [[natural numbers]] (non-negative [[integers]]) can be viewed as a partial function:

:&lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\not\to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x - y.&lt;/math&gt;

It is defined only when &lt;math&gt;x \ge y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Bottom element===

In [[denotational semantics]] a partial function is considered as returning the [[bottom element]] when it is undefined.

In [[computer science]] a partial function corresponds to a subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever. The [[IEEE floating point]] standard defines a [[not-a-number]] value which is returned when a floating point operation is undefined and exceptions are suppressed, e.g. when the square root of a negative number is requested.

In a [[programming language]] where function parameters are [[statically typed]], a function may be defined as a partial function because the language's [[type system]] cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the true domain.

===In category theory===

In [[category theory]], when considering the operation of [[morphism]] composition in [[concrete categories]], the composition operation &lt;math&gt;\circ : \operatorname{hom}(C) \times \operatorname{hom}(C) \to \operatorname{hom}(C)&lt;/math&gt; is a total function if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ob}(C)&lt;/math&gt; has one element. The reason for this is that two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:U\to V&lt;/math&gt; can only be composed as &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Y=U&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the codomain of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must equal the domain of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The category of sets and partial functions is [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to but not [[Isomorphism of categories|isomorphic]] with the category of [[pointed set]]s and point-preserving maps.&lt;ref name="KoslowskiMelton2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jürgen Koslowski and Austin Melton|title=Categorical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4186-3|page=10|author=Lutz Schröder|chapter=Categories: a free tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; One textbook notes that "This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding “improper,” “infinite” elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology ([[one-point compactification]]) and in [[theoretical computer science]]."&lt;ref name="KoblitzZilber2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neal Koblitz|author2=B. Zilber|author3=Yu. I. Manin|title=A Course in Mathematical Logic for Mathematicians|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0615-1|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of sets and partial bijections is equivalent to its [[Opposite category|dual]].&lt;ref name="Borceux1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Borceux|title=Handbook of Categorical Algebra: Volume 2, Categories and Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2v9q0m5XAC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44179-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the prototypical [[inverse category]].&lt;ref name="Grandis2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Grandis|title=Homological Algebra: The Interplay of Homology with Distributive Lattices and Orthodox Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWqhelao4KsC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2012|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4407-06-9|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In abstract algebra===
[[Partial algebra]] generalizes the notion of [[universal algebra]] to partial [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]]. An example would be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], in which the multiplicative inversion is the only proper partial operation (because [[division by zero]] is not defined).&lt;ref name="RosenbergSabidussi1993"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Ivo G. Rosenberg and Gert Sabidussi|title=Algebras and Orders|year=1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-2143-9|author=Peter Burmeister|chapter=Partial algebras – an introductory survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all partial functions (partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]s) on a given base set, ''X'', forms a [[regular semigroup]] called the semigroup of all partial transformations (or the partial transformation semigroup on ''X''), typically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{PT}_X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="CliffordPreston1967"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred Hoblitzelle Clifford|author2=G. B. Preston|title=The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups.

===Charts and atlases for manifolds and fiber bundles===
Charts in the [[Atlas (topology)|atlases]] which specify the structure of [[manifold]]s and [[fiber bundle]]s are partial functions. In the case of manifolds, the domain is the point set of the manifold. In the case of fiber bundles, the domain is the total space of the fiber bundle. In these applications, the most important construction is the [[Atlas (topology)#Transition maps|transition map]], which is the composite of one chart with the inverse of another. The initial classification of manifolds and fiber bundles is largely expressed in terms of constraints on these transition maps.

The reason for the use of partial functions instead of total functions is to permit general global topologies to be represented by stitching together local patches to describe the global structure. The "patches" are the domains where the charts are defined.

The '''philosophy of perception''' is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of [[sense data|perceptual data]], in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world.&lt;ref name="Bonjour"&gt;cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ BonJour, Laurence (2007): "Epistemological Problems of Perception." ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', accessed 1.9.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Any explicit account of perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of [[ontological]] or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] views. Philosophers distinguish [[Internalism|internalist]] accounts, which assume that perceptions of objects, and [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about them, are aspects of an individual's mind, and [[Externalism|externalist]] accounts, which state that they constitute real aspects of the world external to the individual.&lt;ref name="Bonjour" /&gt; The position of [[naïve realism]]—the 'everyday' impression of physical objects constituting what is perceived—is to some extent contradicted by the occurrence of perceptual illusions and hallucinations&lt;ref&gt;cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/ Crane, Tim (2005): "The Problem of Perception."

==Categories of perception==
We may categorize perception as ''internal'' or ''external''.
* Internal perception ([[proprioception]]) tells us what is going on in our bodies; where our limbs are, whether we are sitting or standing, whether we are depressed, hungry, tired and so forth.
* External or sensory perception ([[exteroception]]), tells us about the world outside our bodies. Using our senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, we perceive colors, sounds, textures, etc. of the world at large. There is a growing body of knowledge of the mechanics of sensory processes in [[cognitive psychology]].
* Mixed internal and external perception (e.g., emotion and certain moods) tells us about what is going on in our bodies and about the perceived cause of our bodily perceptions.

The philosophy of perception is mainly concerned with exteroception.

==Scientific accounts of perception==

An object at some distance from an observer will reflect light in all directions, some of which will fall upon the corneae of the [[Human eye|eyes]], where it will be focussed upon each [[retina]], forming an image. The disparity between the electrical output of these two slightly different images is resolved either at the level of the [[lateral geniculate]] nucleus or in a part of the [[visual cortex]] called 'V1'. The resolved data is further processed in the visual cortex where some areas have specialised functions, for instance area V5 is involved in the modelling of motion and V4 in adding colour. The resulting single image that subjects report as their experience is called a 'percept'. Studies involving rapidly changing scenes show the percept derives from numerous processes that involve time delays.&lt;ref&gt;see Moutoussis and Zeki (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[fMRI]] studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/brain-decoding-reading-minds-1.13989|title=Brain decoding: Reading minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that dreams, imaginings and perceptions of things such as faces are accompanied by activity in many of the same areas of brain as are involved with physical sight. Imagery that originates from the senses and internally generated imagery may have a shared [[ontology]] at higher levels of cortical processing.

[[Sound]] is analyzed in term of pressure waves sensed by the [[cochlea]] in the ear. Data from the eyes and ears is combined to form a 'bound' percept. The problem of how this is produced, known as the [[binding problem]].

Perception is analyzed as a [[cognitive process]] in which [[information processing]] is used to transfer information into the mind where it is related to other information. Some psychologists propose that this processing gives rise to particular mental states ([[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]) whilst others envisage a direct path back into the external world in the form of action (radical [[behaviourism]]). Behaviourists such as [[John B. Watson]] and [[B.F. Skinner]] have proposed that perception acts largely as a process between a stimulus and a response but have noted that [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s "[[ghost in the machine]] of the brain" still seems to exist. "The objection to inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they are not relevant in a functional analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 1953&lt;/ref&gt; This view, in which experience is thought to be an incidental by-product of information processing, is known as [[epiphenomenalism]].

Contrary to the behaviouralist approach to understanding the elements of cognitive processes, [[gestalt psychology]] sought to understand their organization as a whole, studying perception as a process of [[figure-ground (perception)|figure and ground]].

==Philosophical accounts of perception==
Important philosophical problems derive from the [[epistemology]] of perception—how we can gain knowledge via perception—such as the question of the nature of [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers DJ. (1995) "Facing up to the hard problem of consciousness." ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2, 3, 200–219&lt;/ref&gt; Within the biological study of perception naive realism is unusable.&lt;ref&gt;Smythies J. (2003) "Space, time and consciousness." ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, 3, 47–64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside biology modified forms of naive realism are defended. [[Thomas Reid]], the eighteenth-century founder of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]], formulated the idea that sensation was composed of a set of data transfers but also declared that there is still a direct connection between perception and the world. This idea, called direct realism, has again become popular in recent years with the rise of [[postmodernism]].

The succession of data transfers involved in perception suggests that [[sense data]] are somehow available to a perceiving subject that is the substrate of the percept. Indirect realism, the view held by [[John Locke]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], proposes that we can only be aware of [[mental representation]]s of objects. however this may imply an infinite regress (a perceiver within a perceiver within a perceiver...), though a finite regress is perfectly possible.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards JC. (2008) "Are our spaces made of words?" ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 15, 1, 63–83.&lt;/ref&gt; It also assumes that perception is entirely due to data transfer and information processing, an argument that can be avoided by proposing that the percept does not depend wholly upon the transfer and rearrangement of data. This still involves basic ontological issues of the sort raised by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;Woolhouse RS and Franks R. (1998) ''GW Leibniz, Philosophical Texts'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke, [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and others, which remain outstanding particularly in relation to the [[binding problem]], the question of how different perceptions (e.g. color and contour in vision) are "bound" to the same object when they are processed by separate areas of the brain.

Indirect realism (representational views) provides an account of issues such as perceptual contents,&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S.: The Contents of Visual Experience. New York: Oxford University Press. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[qualia]], dreams, imaginings, [[hallucinations]], illusions, the resolution of [[binocular rivalry]], the resolution of [[multistable perception]], the modelling of motion that allows us to watch TV, the sensations that result from direct brain stimulation, the update of the mental image by saccades of the eyes and the referral of events backwards in time. Direct realists must either argue that these experiences do not occur or else refuse to define them as perceptions.

Idealism holds that reality is limited to mental qualities while skepticism challenges our ability to know anything outside our minds. One of the most influential proponents of idealism was [[George Berkeley]] who maintained that everything was mind or dependent upon mind. Berkeley's idealism has two main strands, [[phenomenalism]] in which physical events are viewed as a special kind of mental event and [[subjective idealism]]. [[David Hume]] is probably the most influential proponent of skepticism.

A fourth theory of perception in opposition to naive realism, [[enactivism]], attempts to find a middle path between direct realist and indirect realist theories, positing that [[cognition]] arises as a result of the dynamic interplay between an organism's sensory-motor capabilities and its environment. Instead of seeing perception as a passive process determined entirely by the features of an independently existing world, enactivism suggests that organism and environment are structurally coupled and co-determining. The theory was first formalized by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch in "The Embodied Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Varela F, Thompson E, Rosch E (1991) "The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience" MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial representation==
An aspect of perception that is common to both realists and anti-realists is the idea of mental or [[Visual space|perceptual space]]. [[David Hume]] concluded that things appear extended because they have attributes of colour and solidity. A popular modern philosophical view is that the brain cannot contain images so our sense of space must be due to the actual space occupied by physical things. However, as René Descartes noticed, perceptual space has a projective geometry, things within it appear as if they are viewed from a point. The phenomenon of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] was closely studied by artists and architects in the Renaissance, who relied mainly on the 11th century polymath, [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham), who affirmed the visibility of perceptual space in geometric structuring projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La perception de la profondeur: Alhazen, Berkeley et [[Merleau-Ponty]]|author=[[Nader El-Bizri]]|journal=Oriens-Occidens, CNRS|volume=5|year=2004|publisher=[[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]|pages=171–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place|author=Nader El-Bizri|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy]]|volume=17|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=57–80|doi=10.1017/s0957423907000367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians now know of many types of projective geometry such as complex [[Minkowski space]] that might describe the layout of things in perception (see Peters (2000)) and it has also emerged that parts of the brain contain patterns of electrical activity that correspond closely to the layout of the retinal image (this is known as [[retinotopy]]). How or whether these become conscious experience is still unknown (see McGinn (1995)).

Positive [[charge (physics)|charges]] in [[ions]] are achieved by stripping away [[electrons]] orbiting the atomic nuclei, where the total number of electrons removed is related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of [[molecular bond]]s,&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt; though this process is distinctly different from [[Chemistry|chemical processes]] of [[Metal ions in aqueous solution|ion interactions in liquids]] or the behaviour of shared ions in [[metal]]s.

==History==

The word ''plasma'' comes {{ety|grc|''πλάσμα''&amp;#8203;|moldable substance}}&lt;ref name="πλάσμα"/&gt; or 'jelly',&lt;ref name=Itpp1995&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldston |first1=R.J. |last2=Rutherford |first2=P.H. |date=1995 |title=Introduction to Plasma Physics |page=1−2 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-7503-0183-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7kM7yEFUGnAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chen+%22introduction+to+plasma+physics%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the behaviour of the Ionised atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma. Very simply, each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons. Plasma was first identified in a [[Crookes tube]], and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").&lt;ref&gt;Crookes presented a [[lecture]] to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 {{cite web |url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709162459/http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |archivedate=9 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }} {{cite web |url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212651/http://tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |archivedate=13 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this "[[cathode ray]]" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J.J. Thomson]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Announced in his evening lecture to the [[Royal Institution]] on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in {{cite journal|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|volume=44|issue=269|pages=293–316|title=J.

The term "plasma" was coined by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="langmuir1928"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Langmuir | first1 = I. | title = Oscillations in Ionized Gases | doi = 10.1073/pnas.14.8.627 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 627–637 | year = 1928 | pmid =  16587379| pmc =  1085653| bibcode = 1928PNAS...14..627L | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/14/8/627 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170707054853/http://www.pnas.org/content/14/8/627 | archivedate = 7 July 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewi Tonks]] and Harold Mott-Smith, both of whom worked with Irving Langmuir in the 1920s, recall that Langmuir first used the word "plasma" in analogy with blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=Lewi |last=Tonks |title=The birth of "plasma" |year=1967 |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=35 |pages=857–858 |doi=10.1119/1.1974266|bibcode=1967AmJPh..35..857T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, Sanborn C.|chapter=Chapter 1: A Short History of Gaseous Electronics|editors=HIRSH, Merle N. e OSKAM, H.

Langmuir described the plasma he observed as follows:
:"''Except near the electrodes, where there are ''sheaths'' containing very few electrons, the ionised gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name ''plasma'' to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.''"&lt;ref name="langmuir1928" /&gt;

===Definition===

Plasma is a [[state of matter]] in which an ionised gaseous substance becomes highly [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrically conductive]] to the point that long-range [[electromagnetism|electric and magnetic fields]] dominate the behaviour of the matter.&lt;ref name="Chen, Francis F. 2016 2–3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Plasma Physics and controlled fusion | author=Chen, Francis F. | year=1984 | publisher=Springer International Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages=2–3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate=15 January 2018 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781475755954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freidberg, Jeffrey P. 2008 121"&gt;{{cite book | title=Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy | author=Freidberg, Jeffrey P. | year=2008 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | page=121 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224204205/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | archivedate=24 December 2016 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781139462150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma state can be contrasted with the [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|other states]]: [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

Plasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero). Although these particles are unbound, they are not "free" in the sense of not experiencing forces. Moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field, and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges. In turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical &amp; Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}

===Temperature===
Plasma temperature is commonly measured in [[kelvins]] or [[electronvolt]]s and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.

In most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric fields]]. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].

====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====
{{main|Degree of ionization}}
{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}
For plasma to exist, [[ionization|ionisation]] is necessary. The term "plasma density" by itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization|degree of ionisation]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies. The degree of ionisation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of ions and &lt;math&gt;n_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state{{Explain|date=August 2018}} &lt;math&gt;\langle Z\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the ions through &lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of electrons.

In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei}&lt;/math&gt; is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} = \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.

* The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &gt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=49 |chapter=Chapter 3: Plasmas |isbn=978-0471078289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &lt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;.

Most of "technological" (engineered) plasmas are weakly ionized gases.

====Thermal vs. nonthermal (cold) plasmas====
{{main|Nonthermal plasma}}
{{see also|Anisothermal plasma}}
Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as "thermal" or "non-thermal" (also referred to as "cold plasmas"). 

* ''Thermal plasmas'' have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 

* ''Nonthermal plasmas'' on the other hand are non-equilibrium ionized gases, with two temperatures: ions and neutrals stay at a low temperature (sometimes [[room temperature]]), whereas electrons are much hotter. (&lt;math&gt;T_e \gg T_n&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0-12-014520-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 p. 99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202013244/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 |date=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A kind of common nonthermal plasma is the [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor gas]] within a [[fluorescent lamp]], where the "electrons gas" reaches a temperature of 10,000 kelvins while the rest of the gas stays barely above room temperature, so the [[Electric light|bulb]] can even be touched with hands while operating.

A particular and unusual case of "inverse" nonthermal plasma is the very high temperature plasma produced by the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]], where ions are much hotter than electrons.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

===Plasma potential===
[[File:Bliksem in Assen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Lightning]] as an example of plasma present at Earth's surface:
Typically, lightning discharges 30 kiloamperes at up to 100 megavolts, and emits radio waves, light, X- and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707164546/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html |date=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures can approach 30000 K and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Since plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.{{clarify|what role?|date=October 2017}} The average potential in the space between charged particles, independent of how it can be measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (&lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42854229|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.). Panel on Opportunities in Plasma Science and Technology.|year=|isbn=9780309052313|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51|oclc=42854229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorch |first=Søren |date=2007-04-13 |title=Magnetohydrodynamics |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |journal=Scholarpedia |language=en |volume=2 |issue=4|pages=2295 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2295 |issn=1941-6016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402043642/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |archivedate=2 April 2008 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2007SchpJ...2.2295D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetization===
Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\mathrm{coll}} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron gyrofrequency" and &lt;math&gt;v_{\mathrm{coll}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -v\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===
Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionised gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"

! [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Electrical conductivity]]
| '''Very low''': Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| '''Usually very high''': For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite.
|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Complex plasma phenomena==

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a [[complex system]]. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a [[fractal]] form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

===Filamentation===

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chin, S.

===Non-neutral plasma===
The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role.

===Dusty plasma/grain plasma===
A [[dusty plasma]] contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called ''complex plasmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morfill |first=G. E. |title= Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=81 |date=2009 |pages=1353–1404 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |first2=Alexei V. |last2=Ivlev |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impermeable plasma===
Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] plasma from the reactor walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alfvén |first1=H. |last2=Smårs |first2=E.|title= Gas-Insulation of a Hot Plasma |journal=Nature |volume=188 |date=1960 |pages=801–802 |doi=10.1038/188801a0|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..801A |issue=4753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was found that the external [[magnetic fields]] in this configuration could induce [[Kink instability|kink instabilities]] in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braams |first1=C.M. |title= Stability of Plasma Confined by a Cold-Gas Blanket |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=17 |issue=9 |date=1966 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.470|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..470B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no [[magnetic confinement]] using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of different [[nanostructures]] clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=Mélinon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Plasma modeling}}
To completely describe the state of a plasma, all of the
particle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down.
However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.
Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which
there are two main types:

===Fluid model===
Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.

===Kinetic model===
Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.
In magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.

==Artificial plasmas==
Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:
*The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave
*The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (&lt; 10&amp;nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (≈1&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)
*The degree of ionisation within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionised
*The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (&lt;math&gt;T_e = T_i = T_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;), non-thermal or "cold" plasma (&lt;math&gt;T_e \gg T_i = T_{gas}&lt;/math&gt;)
*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma
*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Generation of artificial plasma===
[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]
[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]
Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.&lt;ref name="Hippler" /&gt; For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).

The [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized|ionised]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20 successive sets of collisions",&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros" /&gt; mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).

====Electric arc====
[[File:Cascade-process-of-ionization.svg|thumb|Cascade process of ionisation. Electrons are "e−", neutral atoms "o", and cations "+".|left]]
[[File:Townsend Discharge.svg|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron.]]
With ample current density and ionisation, this forms a luminous [[electric arc]] (a continuous electric discharge similar to [[lightning]]) between the electrodes.{{#tag:ref|The material undergoes various "regimes" or stages (e.g. saturation, breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased under the voltage-current relationship. The voltage rises to its maximum value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations of the various stages; while the current progressively increases throughout.&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |pages=1587–1593 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} [[Electrical resistance]] along the continuous electric arc creates [[heat]], which dissociates more gas molecules and ionises the resulting atoms (where degree of ionisation is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence: [[solid]]-[[liquid]]-[[gas]]-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma.{{#tag:ref|Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionised at 3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;|group="Note"}} A thermal plasma is in [[thermal equilibrium]], which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, [[electrical energy]] is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by [[elastic collision]] (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionised and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain "cold".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of industrial/commercial plasma===
Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry.

*''[[Glow discharge]] plasmas'': non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes.

====Atmospheric pressure====
*''[[Arc discharge]]:'' this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies.

*"[[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma]]:" is a [[nonthermal plasma]] generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT). This generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired.

===MHD converters===
{{main|magnetohydrodynamic converter|magnetohydrodynamic generator|magnetohydrodynamic drive}}
{{see also|Electrothermal instability}}
A world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study [[magnetohydrodynamic converter]]s in order to bring [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD power conversion]] to market with commercial power plants of a new kind, converting the [[kinetic energy]] of a high velocity plasma into [[electricity]] with no [[moving parts]] at a high [[efficiency]]. Research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] around vehicles or projectiles, in order to soften and mitigate [[shock wave]]s, lower thermal transfer and reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]].

Such ionized gases used in "plasma technology" ("technological" or "engineered" plasmas) are usually ''weakly ionized gases'' in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/690642377|title=Plasma scattering of electromagnetic radiation : theory and measurement techniques|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier|others=Froula, Dustin H.|year=|isbn=978-0080952031|edition=1st ed., 2nd|location=Burlington, MA|pages=273|oclc=690642377}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal "cold" plasmas. In the presence of magnetics fields, the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves [[Magnetohydrodynamics#Ideal_and_resistive_MHD|resistive magnetohydrodynamics]] with low [[magnetic Reynolds number]], a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require [[dyadic tensor]]s in a [[n-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[phase space]]. When used in combination with a high [[Hall effect|Hall parameter]], a critical value triggers the problematic [[electrothermal instability]] which limited these technological developments.

[[Image:PricePointGraph.svg|Price points A, B, and C, along a [[demand curve]] (where P is price and Q represents demand)|framed]]

'''Price points''' are [[price]]s at which [[demand]] for a given [[Product (business)|product]] is supposed to stay relatively high.

==Characteristics==
Introductory [[microeconomics]] depicts a [[demand curve]] as downward-sloping to the right and either linear or gently convex to the origin. The downwards slope generally holds, but the model of the curve is only [[piecewise]] true, as price surveys indicate that demand for a product is not a [[linear function]] of its price and not even a [[smooth function]]. Demand curves resemble a series of waves rather than a straight line. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The diagram shows price points at the points labeled A, B, and C. When a vendor increases a price beyond a price point (say to a price slightly above ''price point B''), sales volume decreases by an amount more than proportional to the price increase. This decrease in quantity-demanded more than offsets the additional revenue from the increased unit-price. As a result, total revenue (price multiplied by quantity-demanded) decreases when a firm raises its price beyond a price point. Technically, the [[price elasticity of demand]] is low (inelastic) at a price lower than the price point (steep section of the demand curve), and  high (elastic) at a price higher than a price point (gently sloping part of the demand curve). [[Business entity|Firm]]s commonly set prices at existing price-points as a [[marketing strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Causes==
There are three main reasons for price points to appear:

# [[Consumer theory#Price effect as sum of substitution and income effects|Substitution]] price points
#* price points occur at the price of a close substitute
#* when an item's price rises above the cost of a close substitute, the quantity demanded drops sharply{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# [[Customary pricing|Customary price]] points
#* the [[Market (economics)|market]] grows accustomed to paying a certain amount for a type of product
#* increasing the price beyond this amount will cause sales to drop dramatically{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
# Perceptual price points (also referred to as "[[psychological pricing]]" or as "odd-number pricing")
#* raising a price above 99 cents will cause demand to fall disproportionately because people perceive $1.00 as a significantly higher price&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Increased Consumer Sales Response Through Use of 99-Ending Prices|last = Schindler|first = Robert M.|date = 1996|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kibarian|first2 = Thomas M.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 187–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oligopoly pricing==
In relation to customary price points, [[oligopolies]] can also generate price points. Such price points do not necessarily result from  [[collusion]], but as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will mostly likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). This effect can potentially produce a kinked demand-curve where the kink lies at the point of the current price-level in the market.
These results depend on the elasticity of the demand curve{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and on the properties of each market.

'''Psychical nomadism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] term that refers to the practice of taking as one needs from any moral, religious, political, ethical, or whatever system, and leaving behind the parts of that system found to be unappealing. 

It is one of the main characteristics of the [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]] by [[Hakim Bey]], but the notion was previously discussed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''Nomadology and the War Machine'',  by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in ''Driftworks'' and by various authors in the "Oasis" issue of ''Semiotext(e)''.

Psychic nomadism facilitates the construction of ad hoc reference frames in which to situate the temporary actions required by [[Temporary Autonomous Zone|TAZ]].

Bey in his essay explains why he chose the name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"We use the term "psychic nomadism" here rather than "urban nomadism," "nomadology," "driftwork," etc., simply in order to garner all these concepts into a single loose complex, to be studied in light of the coming- into-being of the TAZ."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He states that there is a paradox where our modern society’s false unity blurs all [[cultural diversity]] and any place is as good as another.

Bey describes psychic nomadism's tactical qualities along with Deleuze and Guattari's sensibilities about the war machine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“These nomads practice the razzia, they are corsairs, they are viruses; they have both need and desire for TAZs, camps of black tents under the desert stars, interzones, hidden fortified oases along secret caravan routes, 'liberated' bits of jungle and bad-land, no-go areas, black markets, and underground bazaars.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bey also discusses these nomads in terms of [[the Internet]] and [[cyberspace]]. His poetry foreshadows ideas that appear in CAE’s ''[http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ The Electronic Disturbance]'' and later in [[electronic civil disobedience]]. With the words “cyberspace” and “hallucination” used interchangeably, we can see [[William Gibson]]'s [[cyberpunk]] novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) being combined with Deleuze and Guattari.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“These nomads chart their course by strange stars, which might be luminous clusters of data in cyberspace, or perhaps hallucinations. Lay down a map of the land; over that, set a map of political change; over that, a map of the Net, especially the counter-Net with its emphasis on clandestine information-flow and logisitics - and finally, over all, the 1:1 map of the creative imagination, aesthetics, values. The resultant grid comes to life, animated by unexpected eddies and surges of energy, coagulations of light, secret tunnels, and surprises.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] usually involving [[sexual intercourse]] or other forms of [[sexual penetration]] carried out against a person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, [[coercion]], [[Abusive power and control|abuse of authority]], or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an [[intellectual disability]] or is below the legal [[age of consent]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual violence chapter 6 |publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]'' |date=2002 |access-date=5 December 2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''rape'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''sexual assault.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Petrak |editor1-first=Jenny |editor2-last=Hedge |editor2-first=Barbara |title=The Trauma of Sexual Assault Treatment, Prevention and Practice. |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |isbn=978-0-470-85138-8 |page=2 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6KZfQ6cSVHoC |page=2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in [[Azerbaijan]] to 92.9 in [[Botswana]] with 6.3 in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls "Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses".] United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |title=Violence against women |website=World Health Organization |language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and [[Rape of males by males|male-on-male]] and [[Lesbian rape|female-on-female]] [[prison rape]]s are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]][https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons.

More men (54%) than women (28%) reported an incident that was classified as rape."&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., [[war rape]]) and [[sexual slavery]] can occur during international conflict. These practices are [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.

People who have been raped can be [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] and develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="aaets"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaets.org/article178.htm |title=Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Rape Survivors |publisher=The American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress |year=1995 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.

== Etymology ==

The term ''rape'' originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[wikt:Special:Search/rapere|''rapere'']] (supine stem ''raptum''), "to snatch, to grab, to carry off".&lt;ref name = "cor"&gt;Corinne J. Saunders, ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kei"&gt;Keith Burgess-Jackson, ''A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 14th century, the term has come to mean "to seize and take away by force".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' |date= |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, the carrying off of a woman by force, with or without intercourse, constituted "raptus".&lt;ref name = "Kei"/&gt; In [[Medieval English]] law the same term could refer to either kidnapping or rape in the modern sense of "sexual violation".&lt;ref name = "cor"/&gt; The original meaning of "carry off by force" is still found in some phrases, such as "rape and pillage", or in titles, such as the stories of the [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Rape of the Sabine Women]] and [[Europa (mythology)|The Rape of Europa]] or the poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', which is about the theft of a lock of hair.

== Definitions ==
=== General ===
{{Main|Types of rape|Laws regarding rape}}
{{See also|Rape by gender}}
Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as [[sexual intercourse]], or other forms of [[sexual penetration]], committed by a perpetrator against a victim without their [[consent]].&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=ed. by Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition= 1st publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and legal professions.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; It has varied historically and culturally.&lt;ref name="Book04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier |first1=S. L. |title="I Have Heard Horrible Stories...": Rape Victim Advocates' Perceptions of the Revictimization of Rape Victims by the Police and Medical System |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=14 |issue=7 |year=2008 |pages=786–808 |issn=1077-8012 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320245|pmid=18559867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''rape'' had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In [[Roman law]], it or ''raptus'' was classified as a form of ''crimen vis'', "crime of assault".&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]], ''Institutiones'' [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary on Roman Law'', pp. 667 (''raptus'') and 768 (''vis'') [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=iklePELtR6QC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raptus'' described the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time.

Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed their definition from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or [[Oral sex|oral penetration]] by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent.

Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines rape as a form of [[sexual assault]],&lt;ref name="WHO2002"&gt;{{cite web |title=WORLD REPORT ON VIOLENCE AND HEALTH |publisher=World Health Organization |page=149 |date=2002 |access-date=5 December 2015 |editor1-last=Krug |editor1-first=Etienne G. |displayeditors=etal |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42495/1/9241545615_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of [[sexual violence]]. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity that may or may not include rape, including [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).&lt;ref name = cdcstats&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv_surveillance_definitionsl-2009-a.pdf |accessdate=6 June 2017 |date=2014 |publisher=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Sexual Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, Version 2.0. |last1=Basile |first1=KC |last2=Smith |first2=SG |last3=Breiding |first3=MJ |last4=Black |first4=MC |last5=Mahendra |first5=RR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Markovchick |first=Vincent |title=Emergency medicine secrets |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2016 |isbn=9780323355162 |pages=516–520 |chapter=Sexual Assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries or jurisdictions differentiate between rape and sexual assault by defining rape as involving penile penetration of the vagina, or solely penetration involving the penis, while other types of non-consensual sexual activity are called sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalbfleisch |first1=Pamela J. |last2=Cody |first2=Michael J. |title=Gender Power and Communication in Human Relationships |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |pages= |accessdate=April 30, 2013 |isbn=978-1-136-48050-8 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=LyMo1RUJwj0C |page=218}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ken Plummer |title=Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |pages=187–191 |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |isbn=978-1-134-92242-0 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OSO3q4XEfz4C |page=189}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, for example, emphasizes penile penetration, requiring that the sexual assault must have been committed by use of a penis to qualify as rape.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk, rape"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk/[[UK Statute Law Database]] |year=2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News, rape"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Tom de Castella, Jon Kelly |title=Assange case: How is rape defined? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19333439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] defines rape as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive".&lt;ref name="Book04" /&gt; In other cases, the term ''rape'' has been phased out of legal use in favor of terms such as ''sexual assault'' or ''criminal sexual conduct''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msu.edu/~sdclub/resources/criminal%20code.doc |title=Criminal code |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===

Victims of rape or sexual assault come from a wide range of [[gender]]s, ages, [[sexual orientation]]s, ethnicitities, geographical locations, cultures and degrees of impairment or disability. Incidences of rape are classified into a number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault. These include [[date rape]], [[gang rape]], [[marital rape]], [[incest|incestual rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[prison rape]], [[acquaintance rape]], [[war rape]] and [[statutory rape]]. Forced sexual activity can be committed over a long period of time with little to no physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/rape |title=UCSB's SexInfo |publisher=Soc.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosdahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosdahl |first=Caroline |title=Textbook of basic nursing |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60547-772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly2011" /&gt;

=== Consent ===

Lack of consent is key to the definition of rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;  Consent is affirmative "informed approval, indicating a freely given agreement" to sexual activity.&lt;ref name="cdcstats" /&gt; It is not necessarily expressed verbally, and may instead be overtly implied from actions, but the absence of objection does not constitute consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gruber |first=Aya |date=December 2016 |title=Consent Confusion |url=http://scholar.law.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=articles |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=415–458|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an inability to consent on the part of the victim (such as people who are asleep, intoxicated or otherwise mentally compromised).&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/001/2011/en/ Rape and sexual violence: Human rights law and standards in the International Criminal Court] . Amnesty International 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual intercourse with a person below the [[age of consent]], i.e., the age at which legal competence is established, is referred to as statutory rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;

[[Duress]] is the situation when the person is threatened by force or violence, and may result in the absence of an objection to sexual activity. This can lead to the presumption of consent.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org" /&gt; Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim. Even [[blackmail]] may constitute duress. [[Abuse of power]] may constitute duress. For instance, in the Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman ''"By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353]. Philippine Law. Approved: September 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person ''under circumstances which are coercive''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English%5CAnnualReports%5Ca-54-315.pdf Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999)] March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Marital rape, or spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|partner rape]], [[domestic violence]], and sexual abuse. Once widely accepted or ignored by law, spousal rape is now denounced by international conventions and is increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women'' stated that (pg 113): "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 states. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offense in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf |title=VAW/for printer/1/14/0 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, several other states have outlawed marital rape (for example [[Thailand]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Thailand passes marital rape bill |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19930702&amp;id=_xYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6288,228462 |title=The Daily Gazette&amp;nbsp;— Google News Archive Search |publisher= |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, it is not clear if marital rape may or may not be prosecuted under ordinary rape laws. In the absence of a spousal rape law, it may be possible to bring prosecution for acts of forced sexual intercourse inside marriage by prosecuting, through the use of other criminal offenses (such as assault based offenses), the acts of violence or criminal threat that were used to obtain submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Search |url=http://www.aware.org.sg/rape/ |title=Rape &amp; Sexual Assault &amp;#124; AWARE Singapore |publisher=Aware.org.sg |accessdate=2014-02-12|date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent may be complicated by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulick |first1=Don |title=No |journal=Language &amp; Communication |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=139–151 |issn=0271-5309 |doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(02)00043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that men consistently perceive women's actions as more sexual than they intend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-rape/#MenRea|title=Mens rea|chapter=Feminist Perspectives on Rape|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, verbalized 'no' to sex may be interpreted as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"/&gt;

== Motives ==
{{further|Causes of sexual violence}}
The WHO states that the principal factors that lead to the perpetration of sexual violence against women, including rape, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |website=who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* beliefs in family honor and sexual purity;
* attitudes of [[male entitlement|male sexual entitlement]];
* weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

No single facet explains the motivation for rape; the underlying motives of rapists can be multi-faceted. Several factors have been proposed: [[anger]],&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, Janet R.

American [[clinical psychologist]] [[David Lisak]], co-author of a 2002 study of undetected rapists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lisak |first1=David |last2=Miller |first2=Paul M. |author-link1=David Lisak |title=Repeat rape and multiple offending among undetected rapists |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=73–84 |journal=[[Violence &amp; Victims]] |doi=10.1891/vivi.17.1.73.33638 |date=February 2002 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/2002/00000017/00000001/art00006 |ref=harv |pmid=11991158}} [http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/cache/documents/1348/134851.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; says that compared with non-rapists, both undetected and convicted rapists are measurably more angry at women and more motivated by a desire to dominate and control them, are more impulsive, disinhibited, anti-social, [[hypermasculine]], and less empathic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lisak |first=David |author-link=David Lisak |title=Understanding the predatory nature of sexual violence |journal=Sexual Assault Report |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=49–64 |url=http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/sar.html |date=March–April 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |ref=harv }} [http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SARUnderstandingPredatoryNatureSexualViolence.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual aggression is often considered a masculine identity characteristic of manhood in some male groups and is significantly correlated to the desire to be held higher in esteem among male peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petty GM, Dawson B |title=Sexual aggression in normal men: incidence, beliefs and personality characteristics |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90109-8 |year=1989 |volume=10 |pages=355–362 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been correlated with gang or group membership as well as having other delinquent peers.&lt;ref name="Ouimette PC 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ouimette PC, Riggs D |title=Testing a mediational model of sexually aggressive behavior in nonincarcerated perpetrators |journal=Violence and Victims |year=1998 |volume=13 |pages=117–130 |pmid=9809392 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borowsky IW 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky IW, Hogan M, Ireland M |title=Adolescent sexual aggression: risk and protective factors |journal=Pediatrics |year=1997 |volume=100 |pages=E7 |doi=10.1542/peds.100.6.e7 |issue=6 |pmid=9382908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gang rape is often perceived by male perpetrators as a justified method of discouraging or punishing what they consider as immoral behavior among women for example wearing short skirts or visiting bars. In some areas in [[Papua New Guinea]], women can actually be punished by public gang rape usually through permission by elders.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins C.

== Effects ==
One metric used by the WHO to determine the severity of global rates of coercive, forced sexual activity was the question "Have you ever
been forced to have sexual intercourse against your will?" Asking this question produced higher positive response rates than being asked, whether they had ever been abused or raped.&lt;ref name="Krug2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krug |title=Rapport mondial sur la violence et la santé |year=2002 |publisher=Organisation mondiale de la santé |location=Genève |isbn=978-92-4-154561-7 |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During the assault, a person will respond with [[fight or flight response|fight, flight]], [[freze (rape)|freeze]], friend (sometimes called fawn),&lt;ref&gt;Matley, Eliza. Presenting the Key to Learning: Comfort Corners. ''"Trauma Responses: Fight, Flight, Freeze or Fawn?"''

They may consolidate with time and sleep.&lt;ref name="Psych2013rev" /&gt;  A man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during the experience of the rape.

Trauma symptoms may not show until years after the sexual assault occurred.

Another effect of rape and sexual assault is the stress created in those who study rape or counsel the survivors. This is called [[vicarious traumatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines for the prevention and management of vicarious trauma among researchers of sexual and intimate partner violence |url=http://www.svri.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2016-06-02/SVRIVTguidelines.pdf |publisher=Sexual Violence Research Initiative |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical ===

The presence or absence of physical injury may be used to determine whether a rape has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=G |title=The (in)significance of genital injury in rape and sexual assault. |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |date=August 2015 |volume=34 |pages=173–8 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2015.06.007 |pmid=26165680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who have experienced sexual assault yet have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K.

While penetrative rape generally does not involve the use of a condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and [[disease transmission]], both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of [[sex worker]]s or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning and the use of the condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.&lt;ref name="condom"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/nyregion/rapists-and-condoms-is-use-a-cavalier-act-or-a-way-to-avoid-disease-and-arrest.html |title=Rapists and Condoms; Is Use a Cavalier Act or a Way to Avoid Disease and Arrest? |first=Craig |last=Wolff |date=August 22, 1994 |newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victim blaming, secondary victimization and other mistreatment ===
{{Main|Victim blaming|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}
Society's treatment of victims has the potential to exacerbate their trauma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; This refers to the [[just-world hypothesis|just world fallacy]] and [[Rape myth|rape myth acceptance]] that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, [[flirting]] or wearing sexually [[provocation (legal)|provocative]] clothing) may encourage rape.&lt;ref&gt;Pauwels, B.

Women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Usually, these are cultures where there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205184952/http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archivedate=2005-02-05 |title=Attitudes to sexual violence |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rape victims are blamed more when they resist the attack later in the rape encounter rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth &amp; Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard &amp; Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, &amp; Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges &amp; McGr ail, 1989; Check &amp; Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, &amp; Pinto, 1991; L'Armand &amp; Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault &amp; Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims really want to have sex because they know their attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed."&lt;ref name = bud2001/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These include the idea that power is reserved to men whereas women are meant for sex and objectified, that women want forced sex and to be pushed around,&lt;ref name="neumann"&gt;Neumann, S., Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities.

For females, victim-blaming correlates with fear. Many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors might look at the woman on the witness stand and believe she had done something to entice the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmainteractive.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27312&amp;Itemid=3158 |title=EMMA&amp;nbsp;— Most Londoners Believe Rape Victims are to Blame |publisher=Emmainteractive.com |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese culture, victim blaming often is associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the women’s fault and her virtue is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

==== Honor killings and forced marriages ====

In many cultures, those who are raped have a high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. This can be perpetrated by the rapist, friends, or relatives of the rapist. The intent can be to prevent the victim from reporting the rape.&amp;nbsp;Other reasons for threats against the those assaulted is to punish them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.&amp;nbsp;The relatives of the person who has been raped may wish to prevent "bringing shame" to the family and may also threaten them. This is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |journal=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
[[File:Non genital injuries to women who are sexually assaulted.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Non-genital injuries to women who are sexually assaulted]]
In the US, [[victims' rights]] include the right to have a victims advocate preside over every step of the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency department|Emergency room]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=mci2017&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas K. |last=McInerny |date=2017 |title=Textbook of Pediatric Care - 2nd Edition |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |isbn=978-1-58110-966-5}}  [http://online.statref.com/Do STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for [[informed consent]].

=== Non-genital injuries ===

====Physical assessment====
Many rapes do not result in serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K. M. |title=Heterogeneity of Existing Research Relating to Sexual Violence, Sexual Assault and Rape Precludes Meta-analysis of Injury Data |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |year=2013 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=447–459 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2013.02.002|pmid=23756514 |hdl=10147/296808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[medical treatment|medical response]] to sexual assault is a complete assessment. This general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the [[emergency room]] staff. Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless the person who was assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and complete assessment.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hockett |first1=Jericho M. |last2=Saucier |first2=Donald A. |title=A systematic literature review of "rape victims" versus "rape survivors": Implications for theory, research, and practice |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=25 |year=2015 |pages=1–14 |issn=1359-1789 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2015.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, [[human bites|bites]],&lt;ref name="NYJH" /&gt; broken teeth, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[bruising]], [[laceration]]s and scratches. In more [[violent]] cases, the victim may need to have gunshot wounds or [[stab wound]]s treated.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;  The loss of consciousness is relevant to the medical history.&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt;  If abrasions are found, [[immunization]] against [[tetanus]] is offered if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

====Diagnostic testing====
After the general assessment and treatment of serious injuries, further evaluation may include the use of additional diagnostic testing such as [[x-rays]], [[computer-aided tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]] image studies and blood work. The presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, [[perineum]], and [[anus]].&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt;

====Forensic sampling====
{{Main|Rape investigation}}
Victims have the right to refuse any evidence collection. Victims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff. After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then [[Forensic science|forensic examination]] proceeds along with the gathering of evidence that can be used to identify and document the injuries.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt; Such [[evidence]]-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the [[caregiver]]s of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff.&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced [[Counsel|social support staff]] are made available to the patient and family.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Barbara |title=Williams gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-07-171672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the patient or the caregivers, (typically parents) agree, the medical team utilizes standardized sampling and testing usually referred to a forensic evidence kit or "[[rape kit]]".&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; The patient is informed that submitting to the use of the rape kit does not [[obligation|obligate]] them to file [[criminal charges]] against the perpetrator. The patient is discouraged from bathing or showering for the purpose of obtaining samples from their hair.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Evidence gathered within the past 72 hours is more likely to be valid.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; The sooner that samples are obtained after the assault, the more likely that evidence is present in the sample and provide valid results. Once the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin. Staff will encourage the presence of a rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

During the medical exam, evidence of bodily secretions is assessed. Dried semen that is on clothing and skin can be detected with a fluorescent lamp.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Semen fluoresces best at wavelengths of 420 and 450 nm, when viewed through orange goggles. A Wood lamp emits light at only 360-nm wavelength. Therefore specialized alternate light sources that emit wavelengths at 420 and 450 nm, such as a Bluemaxx, should be used. Although this type of lamp will improve the detection of dried semen, many other substances will fluoresce as well; thus, confirmation of semen cannot be made with this method.", McInerny (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  Notes will be attached to those items on which semen has been found. These specimens are marked, placed in a paper bag,&lt;ref&gt;This practice discourages the growth of microorganisms which could alter analysis. Cybulska&lt;/ref&gt; and be marked for later analysis for the presence of seminal vesicle-specific antigen.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"/&gt;

Though technically, medical staff are not part of the legal system, only trained medical personnel can obtain evidence that is admissible during a trial. The procedures have been standardized. Evidence is collected, signed, and locked in a secure place to guarantee that legal evidence procedures are maintained. This is known as the [[chain of evidence]] and is a legal term that describes a carefully monitored procedure of evidence collection and preservation. Maintaining the Chain of evidence from the medical examination, testing and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] sampling from its origin of collection to court allows the results of the sampling to be admitted as evidence.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; The use of photography is often used for documentation.&lt;ref name="VAW2013" /&gt;&lt;!-- p 95 --&gt;

===After the examination===
Some physical effects of the rape are not immediately apparent. Follow up examinations also assess the patient for [[tension headaches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], sleep pattern disturbances, gastrointestinal irritability, chronic pelvic pain, menstrual pain or irregularity, pelvic inflammatory disease, multiple yeast infections, sexual dysfunction, premenstrual distress, fibromyalgia, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, burning during urination, and generalized vaginal pain.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

Women are typically offered [[contraceptive]] medications because about 5% of male-on-female rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis"&gt;{{cite book |author=Varcarolis, Elizabeth |year=2013 |title=Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing |location=St. Louis |publisher=Elsevier |pages=439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genital injuries ===

An internal pelvic exam is not recommended for sexually immature or prepubescent girls due to the probability that internal injuries do not exist in this age group. An internal exam may be recommended if significant bloody discharge is observed, though.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; A complete [[pelvic exam]] for rape ([[anal rape|anal]] or vaginal) is conducted. An [[dentistry|oral exam]] is done if there have been [[injurie]]s to the mouth, teeth, gums or [[pharynx]]. Though the patient may have no complaints about [[genital pain]] signs of trauma can still be assessed. Prior to the complete bodily and genital exam, the patient is asked to undress, standing on a white sheet that collects any [[debris]] that may be in the clothing. The clothing and sheet are properly bagged and labeled along with other samples that can be removed from the body or clothing of the patient. Samples of [[fiber]]s, mud, hair, leaves are gathered if present. Samples of [[body fluid|fluids]] are collected to determine the presence of the perpetrator's [[saliva]] and [[semen]] that may be present in the patients mouth, [[vagina]] or [[rectum]]. Sometimes the victim has [[Abrasion (medical)|scratched]] the perpetrator in defense and fingernail scrapings can be collected.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Injuries to the genital areas can be swelling, lacerations, and bruising.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health &amp; physical assessment in nursing|last=Donita|first=D'Amico|publisher=|others=Barbarito, Colleen|isbn=9780133876406|edition= 3rd|location=Boston|pages=664|oclc=894626609|date = 2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common genital injuries are [[Rectal pain|anal injury]], labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]] and fossa.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Bruises, tears, abrasions, inflammation and lacerations may be visible. If a foreign object was used during the assault, x-ray visualization will identify retained fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr6ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Forensic Gynaecology|last=Dalton|first=Maureen|date=2014-10-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107064294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genital injuries are more prevalent in [[post-menopausal]] women and [[prepubescent]] girls. Internal injuries to the [[cervix]] and vagina can be visualized using [[colposcopy]]. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to children who have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal. [[Scar]]ring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Several studies have explored the association between skin color and genital injury among rape victims. Many studies found a difference in rape-related injury based on race, with more injuries being reported for white females and males than for black females and males. This may be because the dark skin color of some victims obscures bruising. Examiners paying attention to victims with darker skin, especially the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis, can help remedy this.&lt;ref&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infections ===

The presence of a sexually contracted infection can not be confirmed after rape because it cannot be detected until 72 hours afterwards.&lt;ref name = marc2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcdante |first=Karen |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4557-5980-4}}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--no page numbers--&gt;

The person who was raped may already have a sexually transmitted bacterial, viral and other infections and if diagnosed, it is treated.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic antibiotic treatment for [[vaginitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] may be done. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection. [[Immunization]] against [[Hepatitis B vaccination|hepatitis B]] is often considered.&lt;ref name = marc2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cybulska |first1=Beata |title=Immediate medical care after sexual assault |journal=Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=141–149 |issn=1521-6934 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2012.08.013|pmid=23200638 }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After prophylactic treatment is initiated, further testing is done to determine what other treatments may be necessary for other infections transmitted during the assault.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt; These are:

* Serum [[hepatitis B]] surface antigen assay

The transmission of HIV is frequently a major concern of the patient.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered. Routine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex is estimated to be 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection-Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV in the United States |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=21 January 2005 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm |accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected.&lt;ref name="NYJH"&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV Clinical Resource: HIV Prophylaxis for Victims of Sexual Assault |publisher=Office of the Medical Director, New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute in Collaboration with Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Disease |url=http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/ |accessdate=2015-12-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130135/http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/|archivedate=2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing at the time of the initial exam does not typically have forensic value if patients are sexually active and have an STI since it could have been acquired prior to the assault. Rape shield laws protect the person who was raped and who has positive test results. These laws prevent having such evidence used against someone who was raped. Someone who was raped may be concerned that a prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity. There may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime. In nonsexually active patients, an initial, baseline negative test that is followed by a subsequent STI could be used as evidence, if the perpetrator also had an STI.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt;

Treatment failure is possible due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baarda |first1=Benjamin I. |last2=Sikora |first2=Aleksandra E. |title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=6 |pages=1190 |year=2015 |issn=1664-302X |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|pmid=26579097 |pmc=4620152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional and psychiatric ===

Psychiatric and emotional consequences can be apparent immediately after rape and it may be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref name=VAW2013&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence Against Women |date=April 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Violence Against Women |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ovw/241903.pdf |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatable emotional and psychiatric disorders may not become evident after the rape. These can be [[Eating disorder|eating]] disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive thoughts, fear of crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal, sexual disorders,(including fear of engaging in sexual activity), mood disorders, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, nightmares, fear of situations that remind the patient of the rape and fear of being alone,&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[numbness]] and emotional distance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Victims are able to receive help by using a telephone hotline, [[counseling]], or shelters.&lt;ref name="Rosdahl" /&gt; Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept,&lt;ref name="Recovering from sexual assault" /&gt; but support groups, usually accessed by [[List of anti-sexual assault organizations in the United States|organizations]] are available to help in recovery. Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.&lt;ref name="Bud2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Budrionis |first=Rita |title=The sexual abuse victim and sexual offender treatment planner, with DSM-5 updates |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-119-07481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are clinicians who are specially trained in the treatment of those who have experienced rape and sexual assault/abuse. Treatment can be lengthy and be challenging for both the counselor and the patient. Several treatment options exist and vary by accessibility, cost, or whether or not insurance coverage exists for the treatment. Treatment also varies dependent upon the expertise of the counselor—some have more experience and or have specialized in the treatment of sexual trauma and rape. To be the most effective, a treatment plan should developed based upon the struggles of the patient and not necessarily based upon the traumatic experience. An effective treatment plan will take the following into consideration: current stressors, coping skills, physical health, interpersonal conflicts, self-esteem, family issues, involvement of the guardian, and the presence of mental health symptoms.
&lt;ref name="Bud2015" /&gt;

The degree of success for emotional and psychiatric treatments is often dependent upon the terminology used in the treatment, i.e. redefining the event and experience. Labels used like "rape victim" and "rape survivor" to describe the new identities of women who have been raped suggest that the event is the dominant and controlling influence on her life. These may have an effect on supportive personnel. The consequences of using these labels needs to be assessed.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; Positive outcomes of emotional and psychiatric treatment for rape exist; these can be an improved self-concept, the recognition of growth, and implementing new coping styles.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

A perpetrator found guilty by the court is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saleh |first=Fabian |title=Sex offenders identification, risk assessment, treatment, and legal issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-517704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain the origins of the abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.&lt;ref name="Kelly2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Gary |title=Sexuality today |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-07-353199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD|post traumatic stress disorder]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

Most rape research and reports of rape are limited to male-female forms of rape. Research [[Rape of males|on male-on-male and female-on-male rape]] is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors. This could obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such sexually aggressive peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwartney-Gibbs PA, Stockard J, Bohmer S |title=Learning courtship aggression: the influence of parents, peers and personal experiences- |journal=[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]] |year=1983 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=276–282 |doi=10.2307/583540 |jstor=583540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== False accusation ==
{{Main|False accusation of rape}}

A false accusation of rape is the reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of false rape allegations, but it's generally agreed by scholars that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M. (1993). ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title=Statistics about sexual violence|last=|first=|date=2015|website=National Sexual Violence Resource Center|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lisak2010/&gt; In most cases, a false accusation will not name a specific suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana M |title=Confronting Myths About Sexual Assault: A Feminist Analysis of the False Report Literature False Reports |journal=Family Relations |date=February 2017 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=46 – 60 |doi=10.1111/fare.12235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight percent of 2,643 sexual assault cases were classified as false reports by the police in one study. The researchers noted that much of these classifications were based on the personal judgments and [[bias]]es of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a [[false allegation]]. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation, which requires "strong evidential grounds" of a false allegation or a "clear and credible" retraction by the complainant, reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that "one cannot take all police designations at face value" and that "[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf|title=A gap or a chasm?

Another large-scale study was conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan &amp; Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases and found 15.1% of complaints were withdrawn, 46.4% were marked "no further police action", and 2.1% of the total were "clearly" classified by police as false reports.

FBI reports consistently put the number of "unfounded" rape accusations around 8%. The unfounded rate is higher for forcible rape than for any other Index crime. The average rate of unfounded reports for Index crimes is 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015318/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_97/96CRIME/96crime2.pdf Crime Index Offenses Reported].

Other studies have suggested that the rate of false allegations in America may be higher. A nine-year study by Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] in a small metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States claimed that 41% of rape accusations were false.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanin |first=E.J. |title=An alarming national trend: False rape allegations |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=23 |number=1 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] states that "Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape". He further states that Kanin's study has significantly poor systematic methodology and had no independent definition of a false report. Instead, Kanin classified reports that the police department classified as false also as false.&lt;ref name="VAW2"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318.full.pdf+html |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |pages=1318&amp;ndash;1334 |pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion for falsehood was simply a denial of a polygraph test of the accuser.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; A 1998 report by the [[National Institute of Justice]] found that DNA evidence excluded the primary suspect in 26% of rape cases and concluded that this "strongly suggests that postarrest and postconviction DNA exonerations are tied to some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/dnaevid.pdf |last1=Connors |first1=Edward |last2=Lundregan |first2=Thomas |last3=Miller |first3=Neal |last4=McEwen |first4=Tom |title=Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science: Case Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish Innocence After Trial |publisher=National Institute of Justice |date=June 1996 |pages=xxviii–xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study also noted that analyzed samples involved a specific subset of rape cases (e.g. those where "there is no consent defense").

{{Main|History of rape}}

=== Definitions and evolution of laws ===
Virtually all societies have had a concept of the crime of rape. Although what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by a man, on a woman or a girl, not his wife. The [[actus reus]] of the crime, was, in most societies, the insertion of the penis into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way sexuality was conceptualized in many societies rejected the very notion that a woman could force a man into sex&amp;nbsp;— women were often seen as passive while men were deemed to be assertive and aggressive. Sexual penetration of a male by another male fell under the legal domain of [[sodomy]].

[[Rape law]]s existed to protect [[virgin]]al daughters from rape. In these cases, a rape done to a woman was seen as an attack on the estate of her father because she was his property and a woman's virginity being taken before marriage lessened her value; if the woman was married, the rape was an attack on the husband because it violated his property.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teela Sanders|title=Sex Offenses and Sex Offenders|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012|page=82|accessdate=28 January 2017|isbn =978-0190213633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb5LDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yllö"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Kersti Yllö, M.

From the classical antiquity of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] into the [[Colonialism|Colonial period]], rape along with arson, [[treason]] and murder was a [[capital offense]]. "Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular." In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. "In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself."&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100–1450", Trisha Olson, ''Journal of Law and Religion'', 22 JLREL 63 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist.&lt;ref name="Eckman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eckman |first=Zoe |url=http://medievalists.net/files/11020201.pdf |title=An Oppressive Silence: The Evolution of the Raped Woman in Medieval France and England |journal=Historian: Journal of the Undergraduate History Department at New York University |volume=50 |year=2009 |pages=68–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on-male concepts of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: ''stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, in the early times, also included adultery); ''vis'', a physical assault for purpose of lust; and ''iniuria'', a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned ''Lex Iulia'' specifically criminalized ''per vim stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, but only if the victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (''[[ingenui|ingenuus]]''), and carried potential sentence of death or exile.  ''Iniuria'' was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than their owner.) [[Augustus]] Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute ''Lex Iulia de vi publica'', which bears his family name, ''Iulia''. It was under this statute rather than the adultery statute of ''Lex Iulia de adulteriis'' that Rome prosecuted this crime.&lt;ref&gt;James Fitzjames Stephen, ''A History of the Criminal Law of England'', p. 17 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=jecTHASFYeUC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was made into a "public wrong" (''iniuria publica'') by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' p. 30 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8qE1zFHyGXoC }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, James A., "Rape and Seduction in Medieval Canon Law", in ''Sexual Practices and the Medieval Church'', edited by Vern L. Bullough and James Brundage, Buffalo, 1982, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between "active" (penetrative) and "passive" (receptive) partners, and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these charges applied to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as [[Lex Scantinia]] covered at least some forms of male-on-male ''stuprum'', and [[Quintillian]] mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces – about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay – as a normal penalty for ''stuprum'' upon an ''ingenuus''. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=mjgl |title=Roman Rape: An Overview of Roman Rape Laws from the Republican Period to Justinian's Reign |author=Nghiem L. Nguyen |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Justinian]] continued the use of the statute to prosecute rape during the sixth century in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]] [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm ''Institutiones'']&lt;/ref&gt; By [[late antiquity]], the general term ''raptus'' had referred to abduction, [[elopement]], robbery, or rape in its modern meaning. Confusion over the term led ecclesiastical commentators on the law to differentiate it into ''raptus seductionis'' (elopement without parental consent) and ''raptus violentiae'' (ravishment). Both of these forms of ''raptus'' had a civil penalty and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although ''raptus violentiae'' also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basil of Caesarea]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cclxxi.html ''Letters''] circa 374 AD&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a husband could not be charged with raping his wife until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/3975175/spousal-rape-case-history/ |title=When Spousal Rape First Became a Crime in the U.S. |last=Rothman |first=Lily |website=Time|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, in some states in the US, a white woman having consensual sex with a black man was considered rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Challenge of Defining Rape |date=11 October 2014 |last=Urbina |first=Ian |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/sunday-review/being-clear-about-rape.html?_r=0|access-date= 5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1930s, rape was considered a [[sex crime]] that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935–1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill "sexual [[psychopaths]]" began making its way into popular opinion. Men caught for committing rape were no longer sentenced to prison but admitted to mental health hospitals where they would be given medication for their illness.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997&gt;Maschke, Karen J. ''The Legal Response to Violence against Women''. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. {{ISBN|9780815325192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only men deemed insane were the ones considered to have committed rape, no one considered the everyday person to be capable of such violence.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Transitions in women's roles in society were also shifting, causing alarm and blame towards rape victims. Because women were becoming more involved in the public (i.e. searching for jobs rather than being a housewife), some people claimed that these women were "loose" and looking for trouble. Giving up the [[gender role]]s of mother and wife was seen as defiant against traditional values while immersing themselves within society created the excuse that women would "not [be] entitled to protection under the traditional guidelines for male-female relationships".&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Until the 19th century, many jurisdictions required [[ejaculation]] for the act to constitute the offense of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts other than vaginal intercourse did not constitute rape in [[common law]] countries and in many other societies. In many cultures, such acts were illegal, even if they were consensual and performed between married couples (see [[sodomy laws]]). In England, for example, the [[Buggery Act 1533]], which remained in force until 1828, provided for the death penalty for "[[buggery]]". Many countries criminalized "non-traditional" forms of sexual activity well into the modern era: notably, in the US state of [[Idaho]], sodomy between consensual partners was punishable by a term of five years to life in prison as late as 2003, and this law was only ruled to be inapplicable to married couples in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/idaho.htm |last=Painter |first=George |title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States - Idaho |website=Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in many countries, the definition of the actus reus has been extended to all forms of penetration of the vagina and anus (e.g. penetration with objects, fingers or other body parts) as well as insertion of the penis in the mouth.

In the United States, before and during the [[American Civil War]] when [[chattel slavery]] was widespread, the law focused primarily on rape as it pertained to black men raping white women. The penalty for such a crime in many jurisdictions was death or castration. The rape of a black woman, by any man, was considered legal.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997 /&gt; As early as the 19th century, American women were criticized if they "stray[ed] out of a [dependent] position...fought off [an] attacker...[or] behaved in too self reliant a manner..." in which case "the term rape no longer applied".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Arnold, Marybeth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5055">'''Redistributive change''' is a [[legal theory]] of [[economic justice]] in the context of [[U.S. law]] that promotes the recognition of [[poverty]] as a [[suspect classification|classification]], like [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[religion]], that should likewise draw extra [[Strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] from the courts in matters pertaining to [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=Bazelon&gt;{{cite web

The theory was discussed in academia in the wake of ''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]'', a 1970 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case, which decided that [[due process]], such as a notice and a [[fair hearing]], were required when dealing with the deprivation of a government benefit (such as a [[medical license]]) or an [[entitlement]] (such as [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare payments]]).&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt;  However, attempts to promote redistributive change through the courts gained no traction, and the result of ''Goldberg v. Kelly'' was, thus, limited in scope.&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt; 

One of the goals, in light of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', was to promote equality in [[Education in the United States|school funding]], but this was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973), which ruled that there was no inherent [[right to education]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Helfrich&gt;{{cite web

Board, a major issue ends up being redistribution -- how do we get more money into the schools, and how do we actually create equal schools and equal educational opportunity? Well, the court in a case called San Antonio v. Rodriguez in the early '70s basically slaps those kinds of claims down, and says, 'You know what, we as a court have no power to examine issues of redistribution and wealth inequalities. With respect to schools, that's not a race issue, that's a wealth issue and something we can't get into.'

'''Robert Christian Hansen''' (February 15, 1939 – August 21, 2014), known in the media as the "'''Butcher Baker'''", was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least 17 women in and around [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], hunting them down in the wilderness with a [[Ruger Mini-14]] and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983 and was sentenced to 461 years and a [[life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref name="anchorage"&gt;[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment 'Butcher Baker' Robert Hansen moved to Anchorage for medical treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040249/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment |date=June 27, 2014 }}, ''Alaska Dispatch''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klint|first1=Chris|title=Serial Killer Robert Hansen Dies in Anchorage|url=http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/serial-killer-robert-hansen-dies-in-anchorage/27664412|accessdate=August 21, 2014|agency=KTTU News|publisher=NBC|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Hansen was born in [[Estherville]], [[Iowa]], in 1939. He was the son of a [[Danish people|Danish]] immigrant and followed in his father's footsteps as a baker. In his youth, he was skinny and painfully shy, afflicted with a [[stutter]] and severe [[acne]] that left him permanently scarred. Shunned by the attractive girls in school, he grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge. Throughout childhood and adolescence, Hansen was described as being quiet and a loner and he had an unhealthy relationship with his domineering father. He started to practice both hunting and [[archery]] and often found refuge in these pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hansen enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve]] and served for one year before being discharged. He later worked as an assistant drill instructor at a police academy in [[Pocahontas, Iowa]]. There, he began a relationship with a younger woman. He married her in the summer of 1960.

On December 7, 1960, he was arrested for [[arson|burning down]] a [[Pocahontas County, Iowa|Pocahontas County]] Board of Education school bus garage, for which he served 20 months of a three-year prison sentence in [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Oro|first= Rachel|title=Robert Hansen, convicted serial killer in Alaska, dies at 75|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/robert-hansen-dies-at-75-convicted-alaska-serial-killer/2014/08/22/cf2d2acc-2989-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005374/combined|title=''The Frozen Ground''|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife filed for divorce while he was incarcerated. Over the next few years, he was jailed several times for [[petty theft]]. In 1967, he moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], with his second wife, whom he had married in 1963 and with whom he had two children. In Anchorage, he was well liked by his neighbors and set several local hunting records.

On June 13, 1983, 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escaped from Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; while he was trying to load her into his [[Piper Super Cub]].&lt;ref name="Body Exhumed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newton|first1=Jennifer|title='We just want her to be identified': Body of Alaska serial killer victim exhumed 30 years after she was found dead|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2743173/Body-Alaska-serial-killers-victim-exhumed.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Mail Online|publisher=Daily Mail|date=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told police he had offered her $200 to perform oral sex but that, when she got into the car, he pulled a gun on her and drove her to his home in [[Muldoon, Anchorage|Muldoon]]. There, he held her captive, [[torture|torturing]], [[rape|raping]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] her. She mentioned that, after he chained her by the neck to a post in the house's basement, Hansen took a nap on a nearby couch.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

When he awoke, he put her in his car and took her to [[Merrill Field]] airport, where he told her that he intended to "take her out to his cabin" (a shack in the [[Knik River]] area of the [[Matanuska Valley]] accessible only by boat or [[bush plane]]). Paulson, crouched in the back seat of the car with her wrists cuffed in front of her body, waited to escape until Hansen was busy loading the airplane's cockpit. While Hansen's back was turned, Paulson crawled out of the back seat, opened the driver's side door and ran toward nearby Sixth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She later told police that she had left her blue sneakers on the passenger side floor of the sedan's backseat, as evidence that she had been in the car. Hansen panicked and chased her, but Paulson made it to Sixth Avenue first and managed to flag down a passing truck. The driver, Robert Yount, alarmed by her disheveled appearance, stopped and picked her up. He drove her to the Mush Inn, where she jumped out of the truck and ran inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushinn.com/index.html |title=Mush Inn Motel|website=www.mushinn.com|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she pleaded with the clerk to phone her boyfriend at the Big Timber Motel, the truck driver continued on to work, where he called the police to report the barefoot, handcuffed woman.

When [[Anchorage Police Department]] officers arrived at the Mush Inn, they were told that the young woman had taken a cab to the Big Timber Motel. APD officers arrived at Room 110 of the Big Timber Motel and found Cindy Paulson, still handcuffed and alone. She was taken to APD [[headquarters]], where she described the perpetrator. Hansen, when questioned by APD officers, denied the accusation, stating that Paulson was just trying to cause some trouble because he would not pay her [[extortion]] demands. Although Hansen had several prior run-ins with the law, his meek demeanour and humble occupation as a baker, along with a strong alibi from his friend John Henning, kept him from being considered as a serious suspect and the case went [[cold case|cold]].

Detective Glenn Flothe of the [[Alaska State Troopers]] had been part of a team investigating the discovery of several bodies in and around [[Anchorage]], [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] and the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] area. The first of the bodies was found by construction workers near Eklutna Road. The body, dubbed "[[Eklutna Annie]]" by investigators, has never been identified. Later that year, the body of Joanna Messina was discovered in a gravel pit near Seward and in 1982, the remains of 23-year-old Sherry Morrow were discovered, in a shallow grave near the [[Knik River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Flothe now had three bodies and what looked like one killer.

He contacted [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Special Agent [[Roy Hazelwood]] and requested help with a [[offender profiling|criminal psychological profile]], based on the three recovered bodies. Hazelwood thought that the killer would be an experienced hunter with low [[self-esteem]], have a history of being rejected by women and would feel compelled to keep "souvenirs" of his murders, such as a victim's jewelry. He also suggested that the assailant might stutter. Using this profile, Flothe investigated possible suspects until he reached Hansen, who fit the profile and owned a plane.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by Paulson's testimony and Hazelwood's profile, Flothe and the APD secured a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to search Hansen's plane, cars and home. On October 27, 1983, investigators uncovered jewelry belonging to some of the missing women, as well as an array of firearms in a corner hideaway of Hansen's attic. Also found was an aviation map with little "x" marks on it, hidden behind Hansen's [[headboard (furniture)|headboard]].

When confronted with the evidence found in his home, Hansen denied it as long as he could but he eventually began to blame the women and tried to justify his motives. Eventually, confessing to each item of evidence as it was presented to him, he admitted to a spree of attacks against Alaskan women starting in 1971. Hansen's earliest victims were young women, usually between 16 and 19 and not sex workers, unlike the victims who led to his discovery.

==Known victims==

Hansen is known to have raped and assaulted over 30 Alaskan women. He is also responsible for murdering at least 17, ranging in age from 16 to 41.&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohr|first1=David|title=Hunting Humans|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/robert_hansen/2.html|website=crimelibrary.com|accessdate=June 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182421/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/robert_hansen/2.html|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were:

* Megan Emerick, 17 (denied, but suspected because of x on aviation map, body not found)
* Mary Thill, 22 (denied, but suspected because of x on aviation map, body not found)

Of these 17 women, Hansen was only formally charged with the murder of four - Sherry Morrow, Joanna Messina, Eklutna Annie and Paula Goulding. He was also charged with the kidnapping and rape of Cindy Paulson.

== Imprisonment ==
[[File:SpringCreekEntrance.jpg|thumb|[[Spring Creek Correctional Center]], where Hansen was incarcerated for many years]]
Once arrested, Hansen was charged with [[assault]], [[kidnapping]], multiple weapons offenses, and [[theft]] and [[insurance fraud]]. The last charge was related to a claim filed with the insurance company over alleged theft of some trophies, whose funds he used to purchase the Super Cub. At trial, he claimed he later recovered the trophies in his backyard but forgot to inform the insurer.

Only after [[ballistics|ballistics tests]] returned a match between bullets found at the crime scenes and Hansen's rifle, did he enter into a [[plea bargain]]. He pleaded guilty to the four homicides the police had evidence for (Morrow, Messina, Goulding and Eklutna Annie) and provided details about his other victims, in return for serving his sentence in a federal prison, along with no publicity in the press. Another condition of the plea bargain was his participation in deciphering the markings on his aviation map and locating his victims' bodies. He confirmed the police theory of how the women were abducted, adding that he would sometimes let a potential victim go if she convinced him that she wouldn't report him to police. He indicated that he began killing in the early 1970s.

He showed investigators 17 grave sites, in and around [[Southcentral Alaska]], 12 of which were unknown to investigators. There remained marks on his map that he refused to give up, including three in [[Resurrection Bay]], near Seward (authorities suspect two of these marks belong to the graves of Mary Thill and Megan Emrick, whom Hansen has denied killing). The remains of 12 (of a probable 21) victims were exhumed by the police and returned to their families. Hansen was sentenced by [[jury]] to 461 years plus life in prison, without the possibility of parole. He was first imprisoned at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1988, he was returned to Alaska and briefly incarcerated at [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]] Correctional Center in [[Juneau]]. He was also imprisoned at [[Spring Creek Correctional Center]] in [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] until May 2014, when he was transported to the [[Anchorage Correctional Complex]] for health reasons.&lt;ref name="anchorage" /&gt;

==Death==
Hansen died at the age of 75, at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage on August 21, 2014, due to undisclosed, lingering health conditions.&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"/&gt;

==Media adaptations==

===Film===
* [[John Cusack]] portrayed Hansen in the film ''[[The Frozen Ground]]'' (2013), opposite [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sergeant Jack Halcombe (a character based on Glenn Flothe) and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as victim Cindy Paulson.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staskiewics|first= Keith|title=Serial Killer on the Big Screen|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20515639,00.html|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
*''[[Naked Fear]]'' (2007) directed by Thom Eberhardt and starring Danielle De Luca is loosely based on characteristics apparent in the real-life modus operandi of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen.

===Television===
Documentaries:
* ''[[The FBI Files]]'' episode, "Hunter's Game" (1999), depicts Hansen's murderous rampage.
* ''[[Crime Stories (TV series)|Crime Stories]]'' featured a full 2007 episode of the case.
* The ''Alaska: Ice Cold Killers'' episode "Hunting Humans" (January 25, 2012) on [[Investigation Discovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2177877/combined|title=''Alaska: Ice Cold Killers'' episode 'Hunting Humans'|website=IMDb|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered the Hansen case.
* ''[[Hidden City (TV series)|Hidden City]]'' season 1, episode 12 ("Anchorage: Robert Hansen's Most Dangerous Game, the Legend of Blackjack Sturges, Eskimo Hu"; airdate February 21, 2012), on the [[Travel Channel]], covered the Hansen case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=TVGuide|title=Anchorage: Robert Hansen's Most Dangerous Game, the Legend of Blackjack Sturges, Eskimo Hu|date=February 21, 2012|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/hidden-city-2012/episode-12-season-1/anchorage-robert-hansens-most-dangerous-game-the-legend-of-blackjack-sturges-eskimo-hu/347657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV series:
* "Mind Hunters" and "The Woods", two 2005 episodes of the [[CBS]] TV series ''[[Cold Case]]'', were inspired by Hansen's crimes.
* In [[Criminal Minds (season 5)|''Criminal Minds'' season 5]], episode 21 ("Exit Wounds"; airdate May 12, 2010), Hansen is referred to by name.
* Hansen's crimes also inspired [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', season 13]], episode 15 ("[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)#Episodes|Hunting Ground]]"; airdate February 22, 2012), which depicts a serial killer who hunts women like wild game before killing them.

'''Robert Singleton''', also known as Bob Singleton (born 1936), is a civil rights activist. He and his wife [[Helen Singleton]] are known for being part of the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] together in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]]. He currently teaches economics at [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount Universit&lt;nowiki/&gt;y]], where he has been for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and education==
Robert was born and raised in Philadelphia. He joined the army and served in Europe. When he came back from war, he went to school at the University of California, Los Angeles. This is where studied economics and also went for his undergraduate. In 1964, he received his Ph.D. and then went on to teach at UCLA for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert began his activism at UCLA when he ran for president of their chapter for the NAACP. During his time on campus, he became inspired by the speakers that came and spoke, including James Farmer, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and Langston Hughes, each of whom helped him realize the injustices in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first joined the sit-ins, where he met other activists and helped them organize events where they would find food and clothing, get sharecroppers to vote, and organize the freedom rider to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned, the NAACP had been kicked out of the school, so it was replaced with a CORE group, of which he was chair.

==Freedom Rides==
Robert Singleton and his wife are most known for the Freedom Rides that they took part of in Jackson, Mississippi. The south ignored the ruling that the U.S Supreme Court made about public transportation not being segregated because segregation was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they protested against segregation on public transportation. On July 30, 1961, when they got to Mississippi, Robert, his wife, and the other riders were arrested and sent to Parchmen Penitentiary. The conditions in the prison were harsh. They were put in maximum security, separated from each other, and placed next to the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Three months after the freedom rides they were to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Eric|title=UCLA to honor alumni who fought segregation as Freedom Riders|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-to-honor-alumni-who-fought-segregation-as-freedom-riders|publisher=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and Helen Singleton were among the few married couples who participated in the Freedom Rides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Schur–Weyl duality''' is a mathematical theorem in [[representation theory]] that relates irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the [[general linear group|general linear]] and [[symmetric group|symmetric]] groups. It is named after two pioneers of representation theory of [[Lie group]]s, [[Issai Schur]], who discovered the phenomenon, and [[Hermann Weyl]], who popularized it in his books on [[quantum mechanics]] and [[classical groups]] as a way of classifying representations of [[unitary group|unitary]] and general linear groups.

Schur–Weyl duality can be proven using the [[double centralizer theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Etingof, Pavel |author2=Golberg, Oleg |author3=Hensel, Sebastian |author4=Liu, Tiankai |author5=Schwendner, Alex |author6=Vaintrob, Dmitry |author7=Yudovina, Elena |title=Introduction to representation theory. With historical interludes by Slava Gerovitch|year=2011|zbl=1242.20001}}, Theorem 5.18.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schur–Weyl duality forms an archetypical situation in representation theory involving two kinds of [[symmetry]] that determine each other. Consider the [[tensor]] space

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' factors.

The [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''k'' letters [[group action|acts]] on this space (on the left) by permuting the factors,

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_k) = v_{\sigma^{-1}(1)}\otimes v_{\sigma^{-1}(2)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma^{-1}(k)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The general linear group ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of invertible ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrices acts on it by the simultaneous [[matrix multiplication]],

: &lt;math&gt; g(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_k) = gv_1\otimes gv_2\otimes\cdots\otimes gv_k, \quad g\in GL_n. &lt;/math&gt;

These two actions [[Equivariant map|commute]], and in its concrete form, the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that under the joint action of the groups ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the tensor space decomposes into a direct sum of tensor products of irreducible modules for these two groups that determine each other,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n = \sum_D \pi_k^D\otimes\rho_n^D. &lt;/math&gt;

The summands are indexed by the [[Young diagram]]s ''D'' with ''k'' boxes and at most ''n'' rows, and representations &lt;math&gt;\pi_k^D&lt;/math&gt; of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with different ''D'' are mutually non-isomorphic, and the same is true for representations &lt;math&gt;\rho_n^D&lt;/math&gt; of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The abstract form of the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that two algebras of operators on the tensor space generated by the actions of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are the full mutual [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]]s in the algebra of the endomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}_\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Suppose that ''k'' = 2 and ''n'' is greater than one. Then the Schur–Weyl duality is the statement that the space of two-tensors decomposes into symmetric and antisymmetric  parts, each of which is an irreducible module for ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n = S^2\mathbb{C}^n \oplus \Lambda^2\mathbb{C}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of two elements and has two irreducible representations, the [[trivial representation]] and the [[sign representation]]. The trivial representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to the symmetric tensors, which are invariant (i.e. do not change) under the permutation of the factors, and the sign representation corresponds to the skew-symmetric tensors, which flip the sign.

'''Seiko Mikami'''  ([[Kanji]]:{{lang|ja|三上 晴子}}) was a Japanese artist known for her large-scale [[interactive art]] installations. Mikami was born in [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], [[Japan]], in 1961, and she stepped into the art scene in the mid-1980s with large-scale art that studied [[information society]] and the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami Project v.1|url=http://www.art-it.asia/u/admin_ed_pics/f4o3H5vQ1VldwERNiL6x/?lang=ja|website=ART iT|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to the United States in 1991, she studied computer science at the [[New York Institute of Technology]], which lead her art to focus on the interaction between electronics and the human perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://v2.nl/archive/people/seiko-mikami/|website=V2_|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a professor in the Department of Information Deisgn at [[Tama University]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami Project v.1|url=http://artscape.jp/exhibition/art-flash-news/2015/10115269_19232.html|website=artscape|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikami died from cancer on January 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adriaansens|first1=Alex|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://v2.nl/lab/blog/seiko-mikami-196120132015-1|website=V2_|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gravicells==
Unveiled in 2004, a collaboration between Mikami and the architect Sota Ichikawa resulted in ''Gravicells'', an interactive installation originally housed at the [[Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media]] (YCAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: YCAM presents Interactive Art Installation|url=http://www.idd.tamabi.ac.jp/~mikami/Gravity&amp;Resistance/outline2.html|publisher=Tama University|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece serves as a means for encountering the existence of [[gravity]] in a manner one could not experience in his or her daily life, and how the world, our bodies, and our perception are all influenced by gravity in complex and almost delicate ways. When the space is encountered by multiple participants, the visual interactions of the projection between them helps the users achieve a sense of each other. This artwork thus functions as almost an external human sensory function, encouraging awareness of ourselves and others in ways not previously approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spielmann|first1=Yvonne|title=Perceptual-responsive environments: sense and sensibility in Japanese media artist Seiko Mikami’s installations|journal=Journal of Aethsetics and Culture|date=2012|volume= 4|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center of the installation space rests a six-by-six-meter paneled floor; these panels are laced with sensors that can detect your weight, tilt, and velocity. This information is continuously collected and analyzed, and is then translated into deformations in the lines projected on the floor near the visitor. [[GPS]] data of the location in which the installation is housed also affects the projected environment and the lines will change according to shifts in the location's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gravicells - gravity and resistance|url=http://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/feature/2008/Openspace2008/Works/gravicells.html|website=Intercommunication Center|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire of Codes==
One of Mikami's most notable works, ''Desire of Codes'', was commissioned by and created at YCAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/37069/seiko-mikami/|website=e-flux|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring the individual’s existence in public and in private, ''Desire of Codes'' emphasizes the increasingly less blurred line between the individual as defined by information and the individual as flesh and blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Takei|first1=Mariko|title=Seiko Mikami|url=http://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/04/seiko_mikami.html|website=SHIFT|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in a space normally devoted to theatrical performances, this interactive piece consists of three parts:

# 90 Wriggling Wall Units: Ninety tentacle-like devices that rotate towards the passerby are placed across a large wall. These devices each have their own camera and microphone, and the data they record is sent to the work’s [[database]], and this information is eventually used in part 3.
# 6 Multiperspective Search Arms: Six ‘search arms’ with cameras and projectors hang from the ceiling and follow the movement of the visitors. These arms also record information about the visitors and upload this to the database. Eventually the arms may project enlarged images of the visitor on the floor near visitor themselves.
# Compound Eye Detector Screen: Many hexagonal facets are projected onto a circular screen, and each facet contains either one of the video recordings made by a wall unit or surveillance footage taken from various public places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desire of Codes|url=http://special.ycam.jp/doc/work/index_en.html|publisher=YCAM|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main three parts, the [[soundscape]] of the area in which the work resides is also altered: the noise generated by visitors as well as the artwork’s own mechanical sounds are mixed and played back, which further emphasizes the indistinction between one's own encoded existence and physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Christine|title=SPATIAL POLITICS: THE (NON)DESTINATIONS OF AUGMENTED REALITY ART (PART II)|journal=Afterimage|volume= 38 Issue 3|issue=Nov/Dec 2010|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-esteem]] can be defined as how favorably individuals evaluate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. &amp; Bushman, B. (2008). Social Psychology and Human Nature (1st Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. .&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leary, self-esteem is the relationship between one’s real self and one’s ideal self, feeding off of favorable behaviors.&lt;ref name="leary1999"&gt;Leary, M.R. (1999) Making Sense of Self-Esteem. Current Directions in Psychological Science 8 (1), 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"&gt;Adler, N &amp; Stewart, J ( 2004) Self-Esteem. Research Network on SES &amp; Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"/&gt; There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal includes to satisfy the inherent need to feel good about one self. Another one would be to minimize social rejection .&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, D. B., Wood, J. V., &amp; Holmes, J. G. (2007). Testing sociometer theory: Self-esteem and the importance of acceptance for social decision-making. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(3), 425-432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem is also known as A way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J. (1980). Prestige and self-esteem: A biosocial interpretation. In D. R. Omark, F. F. Strayer, &amp; D. G. Freedman (Eds.), Dominance relations: An ethological view of human conflict and social interaction (pp. 319–332). New York: Garland STPM Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is known to protect people from fear that has potential of arising from the prospect of death- terror management theory.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem helps motivate people to achieve their goals- high self-esteem leading to coping in situations and low self-esteem leading to avoidance.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt;

==Evolutionary perspectives==
===Sociometer theory===
{{Main|Sociometer}}
The sociometer theory was developed by Mark Leary (1999)&lt;ref name="leary1999"/&gt; to explain the functions of self-esteem. A sociometer is a measure of how desirable one would be to other people - this is influenced by one’s self-esteem. They suggested that self-esteem has evolved to monitor one’s social acceptance and is used as a gauge for avoiding social devaluation and rejection.
The sociometer theory is strongly grounded in evolutionary theories which suggest that survival depends on social acceptance for reasons such as protection, reciprocal behaviours and most importantly reproduction. The monitoring of one's acceptance via self-esteem is therefore crucial in order to achieve these kinds of social interactions and be better able to compete for the social benefits of them.

Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2003) expanded on Leary’s work and suggested that the sociometer’s function was not only to ensure that an individual was not excluded from their social group but also to rate the strength of the social group compared to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., &amp; Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary-psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher &amp; M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and his colleagues stated that a sociometer is a measure of how a person is desirable by the people and this is oftentimes influenced through a person's self-esteem.

===Self-determination theory===
{{Main|Self-determination theory}}
Self-determination theory (SDT) states that man is born with an intrinsic motivation to explore, absorb and master his surroundings and that true high self-esteem is reported when the basic psychological nutrients, or needs, of life (relatedness, competency and autonomy) are in balance Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology.

===Ethological perspective===
The ethological perspective (Barkow, 1980) suggests that self-esteem is an adaptation that has evolved for the purpose of maintaining dominance in relationships. It is said that human beings have evolved certain mechanisms for monitoring dominance in order to facilitate reproductive behaviours such attaining a mate. Because attention and favorable reactions from others were associated with being dominant, feelings of self-esteem have also become associated with social approval and deference. From this perspective, the motive to evaluate oneself positively in evolutionary terms is to enhance one’s relative dominance (Leary, 1999).

Leary et al. (2001) tested the idea of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem. Trait self-esteem appeared to be related to the degree to which participants felt accepted by specific people in their lives, but not to the degree to which participants thought those individuals perceived them as dominant. Acceptance and dominance appeared to have independent effects on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M.R., Cottrell, C.A. &amp; Phillips, M. (2001) Deconfounding the effects of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 81(5), 898-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{Main|Terror management theory}}
The terror management theory, developed by [[Sheldon Solomon]] at al. (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S., Greenberg, J., &amp; Pyszczynski, T. (1991). A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 24, 93–159.&lt;/ref&gt; which in relation to self-esteem states that having self-esteem helps protect individuals from the fear they experience at the prospect of their own death. It is suggested that people are constantly searching for ways to enhance their self-esteem in order to quell unconscious death anxiety. This internalisation of cultural values is also a key factor in Terror Management Theory (TMT) in which self-esteem is seen as a culturally based construction derived from integrating specific contingencies valued by society into one's own ‘worldview’. High self-esteem promotes positive affect and personal growth, psychological well-being and coping as a buffer against anxiety in the knowledge of our eventual certain death, and reduces defensive anxiety related behaviour. Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology. Terror management theory, based primarily on the writings of Ernest Becker (1962, 1971, 1973, 1975) and Otto
Rank (1936, 1941), posits that self-esteem is sought because it provides protection against the fear of death (Greenberg, Pyszczynski,
&amp; Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pyszczynski,1991a). From this perspective, the fear of death is rooted
in an instinct for self-preservation that humans share with other species. Jones, E. McGreggor, H. Pyszczynski, T. Simon, L. &amp; Solomon, S. (1997). Terror Management
Theory and Self –Esteem Reduces Mortality Salience Effects. Personality and Social Psychology 72, 24-36

==Success==
Some researchers believe that having a high self-esteem facilitates goal achievement.
Bednar, Wells, and Peterson (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Bednar, R., Wells, G., &amp; Peterson, S. (1989). Self-esteem: Paradoxes and innovations in clinical theory and practice. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that self-esteem is a form of subjective feedback about the adequacy of the self. This feedback (self-esteem) is positive when the individual copes well with circumstances and is negative when he or she avoids threats. In turn, self-esteem affects subsequent goal achievement; high self-esteem increases coping, and low self-esteem leads to further avoidance (Leary, 1999).

===Illusion of control===
{{Main|Illusion of control}}
Illusion of control is the tendency for human beings to believe they can control, or at least influence, outcomes that they demonstrably have no influence over, a mindset often seen in those who gamble (Langer, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E. J. &amp; Roth, J. (1975). Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 34, 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for individuals who are not gamblers Taylor and Brown (1988) suggest it may serve to be a function of self-esteem. Belief that there is a level of control over the situation a person is in, may lead to an increased level of motivation and performance in a self-regulating manner.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one will work harder to become successful if they believe they have control over their success. A high self-esteem would be needed for this belief of control and so the need for a sense of control may be a function of self-esteem.
When applying sociometer theory, it suggests that the illusion of control is an adaptive response in order to self-regulate behaviour to cultural norms and thereby provide an individual with an increased level of self-esteem. In social psychology, the illusion of control is grouped with two other concepts and termed as the ‘positive illusions’.

[[File:William Powell Frith The signal 1858.jpg|thumb|right|In "The Signal" painting by [[William Powell Frith]], a woman waves a handkerchief as a signal to a person able to see this action, in order to convey a message to this person.]]

In [[communication system]]s, [[signal processing]], and [[electrical engineering]], a '''signal''' is a function that "conveys [[information]] about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon".&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;  A signal may also be defined as an "observable change in a quantifiable entity".&lt;ref&gt;Pragnan Chakravorty, "What Is a Signal? [Lecture Notes]," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 175–77, Sept. 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195&lt;/ref&gt; In the physical world,  any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space (such as an image) is potentially a signal that might provide information on the status of a physical system, or convey a [[message]] between observers, among other possibilities.&lt;ref name=Note/&gt; The ''[[IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing]]'' states that the term "signal" includes [[audio signal|audio]], [[video]], speech, [[image]], communication, geophysical, sonar, radar, medical and musical signals.&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; In a later development, a signal is redefined as an "observable change in a quantifiable entity";&lt;ref name=PC/&gt; here, anything which is only a function of space, such as an image, is excluded from the category of signals. Also, it is stated that a signal may or may not contain any information.

In nature, signals can take the form of any action by one organism able to be perceived by other organisms, ranging from the release of chemicals by plants to alert nearby plants of the same type of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of the presence of danger or of food. Signaling occurs in organisms all the way down to the cellular level, with [[cell signaling]]. [[Signaling theory]], in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for [[evolution]] is the ability for animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a [[sensor]], and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a [[transducer]]. For example, a [[microphone]] converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] does the reverse.&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;

The formal study of the information content of signals is the field of [[information theory]]. The information in a signal is usually accompanied by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]]. The term ''noise'' usually means an undesirable random disturbance, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with the desired signal (such as [[crosstalk]]). The prevention of noise is covered in part under the heading of [[signal integrity]]. The separation of desired signals from a background is the field of [[Detection theory|signal recovery]],&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst/&gt; one branch of which is [[estimation theory]], a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.

Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the design, study, and implementation of systems involving [[Data transmission|transmission]], [[data storage device|storage]], and [[Information processor|manipulation of information]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals; [[electronic engineering]] and [[computer engineering]] as examples; while [[Industrial design|design engineering]] developed to deal with functional design of [[User interface|user–machine interfaces]].

==Definitions==
Definitions specific to sub-fields are common. For example, in [[information theory]], a ''signal'' is a codified message, that is, the sequence of states in a communication channel that encodes a message. In the context of [[signal processing]], signals are analog and digital representations of analog physical quantities.

In terms of their spatial distributions, signals may be categorized as point source signals (PSSs) and distributed source signals (DSSs).&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;

In a communication system, a ''transmitter'' encodes a ''message'' to create a signal, which is carried to a ''receiver'' by the [[communications channel]].  For example, the words "[[Mary had a little lamb]]" might be the message spoken into a [[telephone]]. The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical signal. The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds.

In telephone networks, [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]], for example [[common-channel signaling]], refers to phone number and other digital control information rather than the actual voice signal.

Signals can be categorized in various ways.  The most common distinction is between discrete and continuous spaces that the functions are defined over, for example discrete and continuous time domains.  [[Discrete-time signal]]s are often referred to as ''[[time series]]'' in other fields.  [[Continuous-time signal]]s are often referred to as ''continuous signals''.

A second important distinction is between discrete-valued and continuous-valued.  Particularly in [[digital signal processing]], a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]] may be defined as a sequence of discrete values, typically associated with an underlying continuous-valued physical process. In [[digital electronics]], digital signals are the continuous-time waveform signals in a digital system, representing a bit-stream.

Another important property of a signal is its  [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] or [[information content]].&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

== Analog and digital signals ==
[[File:Imagen 4.png|thumb|A digital signal has two or more distinguishable waveforms, in this example, high voltage and low voltages, each of which can be mapped onto a digit. Characteristically, noise can be removed from digital signals provided it is not too large.]]
Two main types of signals encountered in practice are ''[[analog (signal)|analog]]'' and ''[[Digital signal|digital]]''. The figure shows a digital signal that results from approximating an analog signal by its values at particular time instants.  Digital signals are ''[[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]]'', while analog signals are continuous.

===Analog signal===
{{main|Analog signal}}
An analog signal  is any [[continuous signal]] for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., ''analogous'' to another time varying signal.   For example, in an analog [[audio signal]], the instantaneous [[voltage]] of the signal varies continuously with the [[Sound pressure|pressure]] of the sound waves. It differs from a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]], in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete values]] which can only take on one of a finite number of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|title=Digital signals|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302055200/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|title=Analog vs. Digital - learn.sparkfun.com|website=learn.sparkfun.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705100418/https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|archivedate=2017-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term analog signal usually refers to [[electrical signal]]s; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.
   
An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information.  In an electrical signal, the [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], or [[frequency]] of the signal may be varied to represent the information.
   
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], position, or [[pressure]].  The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a [[transducer]].   For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, [[sound]]) strike the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone.  The voltage or the current is said to be an "analog" of the sound.

Other types of digital signals can represent [[three-valued logic]] or higher valued logics.

Alternatively, a digital signal may be considered to be the sequence of codes represented by such a physical quantity.&lt;ref name=Khanna&gt;Vinod Kumar Khanna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vf2qXAbn58oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is+a%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%20a%22&amp;f=false Digital Signal Processing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217234501/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vf2qXAbn58oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is+a%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2017-12-17 }}, 2009: A digital signal is a special form of discrete-time signal which is discrete in both time and amplitude, obtained by permitting each value (sample) of a discrete-time signal to acquire a finite set of values (quantization), assigning it a numerical symbol according to a code ... A digital signal is a sequence or list of numbers drawn from a finite set.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical quantity may be a variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of an [[optics|optical]] or other [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic field]], acoustic pressure, the [[magnetization]] of a [[magnetic storage]] media, etcetera. Digital signals are present in all [[digital electronics]], notably computing equipment and [[data transmission]].

[[File:Imagen 4.png|thumb|A received digital signal may be impaired by [[noise]] and [[distortion]]s without necessarily affecting the digits]]
With digital signals, system noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect system operation whereas noise always degrades the operation of [[analog signals]] to some degree.

Digital signals often arise via [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] of analog signals, for example, a continually fluctuating voltage on a line that can be digitized by an [[analog-to-digital converter]] circuit, wherein the circuit will read the voltage level on the line, say, every 50&amp;nbsp;[[microseconds]] and represent each reading with a fixed number of bits. The resulting stream of numbers is stored as digital data on a discrete-time and quantized-amplitude signal.  [[Computer]]s and other [[Digital data|digital]] devices are restricted to discrete time.

=== Time discretization{{anchor|Discretization}} ===
[[File:Sampled.signal.svg|right|thumb|Discrete-time signal created from a continuous signal by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]]]
One of the fundamental distinctions between different types of signals is between [[Continuous signal|continuous]] and [[Discrete-time signal|discrete time]].  In the mathematical abstraction, the domain of a continuous-time (CT) signal is the set of real numbers (or some interval thereof), whereas the domain of a discrete-time (DT) signal is the set of [[integer]]s (or some interval).  What these integers represent depends on the nature of the signal; most often it is time.

If for a signal, the quantities are defined only on a discrete set of times, we call it a [[discrete-time signal]]. A simple source for a discrete time signal is the [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] of a continuous signal, approximating the signal by a sequence of its values at particular time instants.

A discrete-time real (or complex) signal can be seen as a function from (a subset of) the set of integers (the index labeling time instants) to the set of [[real numbers|real]] (or [[complex numbers|complex]]) numbers (the function values at those instants).

A continuous-time real (or complex) signal is any real-valued (or complex-valued) [[mathematical function|function]] which is defined at every time ''t'' in an interval, most commonly an infinite interval.

=== Amplitude quantization{{anchor|Quantization}} ===
[[File:Digital.signal.svg|right|thumb|Digital signal resulting from approximation to an analog signal, which is a continuous function of time]]
If a signal is to be represented as a sequence of numbers, it is impossible to maintain exact precision - each number in the sequence must have a finite number of digits.  As a result, the values of such a signal belong to a [[finite set]]; in other words, it is [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]]. Quantization is the process of converting a continuous analog audio signal to a digital signal with discrete numerical values.

== Examples of signals ==

Signals in nature can be converted to electronic signals by various [[sensor]]s. Some examples are:

* ''[[motion (physics)|Motion]]''.  The motion of an object can be considered to be a signal, and can be monitored by various sensors to provide electrical signals.&lt;ref name= Lu/&gt; For example, [[radar]] can provide an electromagnetic signal for following aircraft motion.  A motion signal is one-dimensional (time), and the range is generally three-dimensional.  Position is thus a 3-vector signal; position and orientation of a rigid body is a 6-vector signal. Orientation signals can be generated using a [[gyroscope]].&lt;ref name= gyro/&gt;
* ''[[Sound]]''.  Since a sound is a [[oscillation|vibration]] of a medium (such as air), a sound signal associates a [[pressure]] value to every value of time and three space coordinates. A sound signal is converted to an electrical signal by a [[microphone]], generating a [[voltage]] signal as an analog of the sound signal, making the sound signal available for further signal processing. Sound signals can be [[sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] at a discrete set of time points; for example, [[compact disc]]s (CDs) contain discrete signals representing sound, recorded at 44,100 samples per [[second]]; each sample contains data for a left and right channel, which may be considered to be a 2-vector signal (since CDs are recorded in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]). The CD encoding is converted to an electrical signal by [[Blu-ray Disc#Laser and optics|reading]] the information with a [[laser]], converting the sound signal to an optical signal.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;
* ''[[Image]]s''.  A picture or image consists of a brightness or color signal, a function of a two-dimensional location. The object's appearance is presented as an emitted or reflected electromagnetic wave, one form of electronic signal. It can be converted to voltage or current waveforms using devices such as the [[charge-coupled device]].  A 2D image can have a continuous spatial domain, as in a traditional photograph or painting; or the image can be discretized in space, as in a [[raster scanning|raster scanned]] [[digital image]].  Color images are typically represented as a combination of images in three [[primary colors]], so that the signal is vector-valued with dimension three.
* ''[[Video]]s''.  A video signal is a sequence of images.  A point in a video is identified by its two-dimensional position and by the time at which it occurs, so a video signal has a three-dimensional domain.  Analog video has one continuous domain dimension (across a [[scan line]]) and two discrete dimensions (frame and line).
* Biological ''[[membrane potential]]s''.  The value of the signal is an [[electric potential]] ("voltage").  The domain is more difficult to establish.  Some [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[organelle]]s have the same membrane potential throughout; [[neuron]]s generally have different potentials at different points.  These signals have very low energies, but are enough to make nervous systems work; they can be measured in aggregate by the techniques of [[electrophysiology]].

Other examples of signals are the output of a [[thermocouple]], which conveys temperature information, and the output of a [[pH meter]] which conveys acidity information.&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;

==Signal processing==
{{main|Signal processing}}
[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|400px|Signal transmission using electronic signals]]

A typical role for signals is in signal processing. A common example is signal transmission between different locations. The embodiment of a signal in electrical form is made by a [[transducer]] that converts the signal from its original form to a [[waveform]] expressed as a [[Electric current|current]] (''I'') or a [[voltage]] (''V''), or an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waveform]], for example, an [[Free-space optical communication|optical signal]] or [[radio transmission]]. Once expressed as an electronic signal, the signal is available for further processing by electrical devices such as [[Amplifier|electronic amplifiers]] and [[electronic filters]], and can be transmitted to a remote location by [[Transmitter|electronic transmitters]] and received using [[Receiver (radio)|electronic receivers]].

==Signals and systems==
In [[Electrical engineering]] programs, a class and field of study known as "signals and systems" (S and S) is often seen as the "cut class" for EE careers, and is dreaded by some students as such. Depending on the school, undergraduate EE students generally take the class as juniors or seniors, normally depending on the number and level of previous [[linear algebra]] and [[differential equation]] classes they have taken.&lt;ref name="McMahon s and s"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0-07-147578-5 |url= https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071475788?selectObb=new|title= Signals &amp; Systems Demystified|author= David McMahon |location=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field studies input and output signals, and the mathematical representations between them known as systems, in four domains: Time, Frequency, ''s'' and ''z''. Since signals and systems are both studied in these four domains, there are 8 major divisions of study. As an example, when working with continuous time signals (''t''), one might transform from the time domain to a frequency or ''s'' domain; or from discrete time (''n'') to frequency or ''z'' domains. Systems also can be transformed between these domains like signals, with continuous to ''s'' and discrete to ''z''.

Although S and S falls under and includes all the topics covered in this article, as well as [[Analog signal processing]] and [[Digital signal processing]], it actually is a subset of the field of [[Mathematical model]]ing. The field goes back to RF over a century ago, when it was all analog, and generally continuous. Today, software has taken the place of much of the analog circuitry design and analysis, and even continuous signals are now generally processed digitally. Ironically, digital signals also are processed continuously in a sense, with the software doing calculations between discrete signal "rests" to prepare for the next input/transform/output event.

In past EE curricula S and S, as it is often called, involved circuit analysis and design via mathematical modeling and some numerical methods, and was updated several decades ago with [[Dynamical system]]s tools including differential equations, and recently, [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangians]]. The difficulty of the field at that time included the fact that not only mathematical modeling, circuits, signals and complex systems were being modeled, but physics as well, and a deep knowledge of electrical (and now electronic) topics also was involved and required.

Today, the field has become even more daunting and complex with the addition of circuit, systems and signal analysis and design languages and software, from [[MATLAB]] and [[Simulink]] to [[NumPy]], [[VHDL]], [[PSpice]], [[Verilog]] and even [[Assembly language]]. Students are expected to understand the tools as well as the mathematics, physics, circuit analysis, and transformations between the 8 domains.

Because mechanical engineering topics like friction, dampening etc. have very close analogies in signal science (inductance, resistance, voltage, etc.), many of the tools originally used in ME transformations (Laplace and Fourier transforms, Lagrangians, sampling theory, probability, difference equations, etc.) have now been applied to signals, circuits, systems and their components, analysis and design in EE. Dynamical systems that involve noise, filtering and other random or chaotic attractors and repellors have now placed stochastic sciences and statistics between the more deterministic discrete and continuous functions in the field. (Deterministic as used here means signals that are completely determined as functions of time).

EE taxonomists are still not decided where S&amp;S falls within the whole field of signal processing vs. circuit analysis and mathematical modeling, but the common link of the topics that are covered in the course of study has brightened boundaries with dozens of books, journals, etc. called Signals and Systems, and used as text and test prep for the EE, as well as, recently, computer engineering exams.&lt;ref name="Signals and systems"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0073380681 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-Analysis-Transform-Methods/dp/0073380687/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378056574&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=signals+and+systems|title= Signals and Systems: Analysis Using Transform Methods &amp; MATLAB|author= M.J.

'''''Solar Collector''''' is an [[interactive art|interactive]] [[light art]] installation in [[Cambridge, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It was commissioned by the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Region of Waterloo]] and designed by [[Gorbet Design Inc.]]  The sculpture consists of twelve [[aluminum]] shafts lined with [[solar panel]]s and high-intensity [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. Each shaft is arranged to optimize its exposure to the [[sun]] at a particular time of year.  The shortest, most acutely angled shaft is perpendicular to the sun at the [[Summer solstice]] (June 21) and the tallest shaft is perpendicular to the sun at the [[Winter solstice]] (December 21). Energy collected and stored during the day powers a nightly show.  The general public interacts with the sculpture via its website where they design patterns and routines for the LEDs which are combined to create the nightly shows.

There are two main approaches to SDC: ''principles-based'' and ''rules-based.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Felix, and Elliott, Mark|date=2015|title=Principles- Versus Rules-Based Output Statistical Disclosure Control In Remote Access Environments|url=http://www.iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/iqvol_39_2_ritchie.pdf|journal=IASSIST Quarterly v39 pp5-13|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principles-based systems, disclosure control attempts to uphold a specific set of fundamental principles—for example, "no person should be identifiable in released microdata". Rules-based systems, in contrast, are evidenced by a specific set of rules that a person performing disclosure control follows, after which the data are presumed to be safe to release. Using this taxonomy, proposed by Ritchie and Elliot in 2013, disclosure control based on [[differential privacy]] can be seen as a principles-based approach, whereas controls based on de-identification, such as the US [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]'s Privacy Rule's Safe Harbor method for de-identifying [[protected health information]] can be seen as a rule-based system.

== Necessity ==
Many kinds of [[Social research|social]], economic and health research use potentially sensitive data as a basis for their research, such as survey or [[Census]] data, tax records, health records, educational information, etc. Such information is usually given in confidence, and, in the case of [[Secondary data|administrative data]], not always for the purpose of research.

Researchers are not usually interested in information about one single person or business; they are looking for trends among larger groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adrn.ac.uk/protecting-privacy/safe-results/|title=ADRN » Safe results|website=adrn.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data they use is, in the first place, linked to individual people and businesses, and SDC ensures that these cannot be identified from published data, no matter how detailed or broad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/statistics/methodology-quality/methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/|title=Government Statistical Services: Statistical Disclosure Control|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that at the end of data analysis, the researcher somehow singles out one person or business through their research. For example, a researcher may identify the exceptionally good or bad service in a geriatric department within a hospital in a remote area, where only one hospital provides such care. In that case, the data analysis 'discloses' the identity of the hospital, even if the dataset used for analysis was properly [[Anonymity|anonymised]] or de-identified.

Statistical disclosure control will identify this disclosure risk and ensure the results of the analysis are altered to protect confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Templ|first=Matthias|date=2014|title=International Household Survey Network|url=http://www.ihsn.org/home/sites/default/files/resources/ihsn-working-paper-007-Oct27.pdf|journal=IHSN Working Paper|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a balance between protecting confidentiality and ensuring the results of the data analysis are still useful for [[Statistics|statistical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/index.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/general-methodology/statistical-disclosure-control/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-05|title=Archived: ONS Statistical Disclosure Control|date=|website=|publisher=Office for National Statistics|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules-based SDC ==
In rules-based SDC, a rigid set of rules is used to determine whether or not the results of data analysis can be released. The rules are applied consistently, which makes it obvious what kinds of output are acceptable. However, because the rules are inflexible, either disclosive information may still slip through, or the rules are overrestrictive and may only allow for results that are too broad for useful analysis to be published.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] uses a rules-based approach to releasing statistics and research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/census/2001/background/methodology.pdf|title=Census 2001 - Methodology|date=2001|website=|publisher=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency|access-date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles-based SDC ==
In principles-based SDC, both the researcher and the output checker are trained in SDC. They receive a set of rules, which are rules-of-thumb rather than hard rules as in rules-based SDC. This means that in principle, any output may be approved or refused. The rules-of-thumb are a starting point for the researcher and explain from the beginning which outputs would be deemed safe and non-disclosive, and which outputs are unsafe. It is up to the researcher to prove that any 'unsafe' outputs are non-disclosive, but the checker has the final say. Since there are no hard rules, this requires specialist knowledge on disclosure risks from both the researcher and the checker. It encourages the researcher to produce safe results in the first place. However, this also means that the outcome may be inconsistent and uncertain. It requires extensive training and a high understanding of statistics and data analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[UK Data Service]] employs a principles-based approach to statistical disclosure control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.46/2013/Topic_3_Afkhami.pdf|title=Statistical Disclosure Control Practice in the Secure Access of the UK Data Service|last=Afkhamai|first=Reza|date=2013|website=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|publisher=|access-date=March 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
Many contemporary statistical disclosure control techniques, such as generalization and cell suppression, have been shown to be vulnerable to attack by a hypothetical data intruder. For example, Cox showed in 2009 that Complementary cell suppression typically leads to "over-protected" solutions because of the need to suppress both primary and complementary cells, and even then can lead to the compromise of sensitive data when exact intervals are reported.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Cox, Vulnerability of Complementary Cell Suppression to Intruder Attack, Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality (2009) 1, Number 2, pp. 235–251 http://repository.cmu.edu/jpc/vol1/iss2/8/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23954">'''Survivorship bias''' or '''survival bias''' is the [[logical error]] of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of [[selection bias]].

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence ([[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|correlation proves causality]]). For example, if three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education. This could be true, but the question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who "survived" the top-five selection process

==Examples==

=== In business, finance and economics ===
In finance, survivorship bias is the tendency for failed companies to be excluded from performance studies because they no longer exist. It often causes the results of studies to skew higher because only companies which were successful enough to survive until the end of the period are included. For example, a [[mutual fund]] company's selection of funds today will include only those that are successful now. Many losing funds are closed and merged into other funds to hide poor performance. In theory, 90% of extant funds could truthfully claim to have performance in the first quartile of their peers, if the peer group includes funds that have closed. {{Citation needed|reason=Where did the '90%' come from?|date=April 2017}}

In 1996, Elton, Gruber, and Blake showed that survivorship bias is larger in the small-fund sector than in large mutual funds (presumably because small funds have a high probability of folding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elton |last2=Gruber |last3=Blake |year=1996 |title=Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance |journal=[[Review of Financial Studies]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=1097–1120 |doi=10.1093/rfs/9.4.1097 }} In this paper the researchers eliminate survivorship bias by following the returns on all funds extant at the end of 1976. They show that other researchers have drawn spurious conclusions by failing to include the bias in regressions on fund performance.&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the size of the bias across the U.S. mutual fund industry as 0.9% per annum, where the bias is defined and measured as:

{{quote|"Bias is defined as average α for surviving funds minus average α for all funds"

(Where [[Alpha (investment)|α]] is the risk-adjusted return over the [[S&amp;P 500]]. This is the standard measure of mutual fund out-performance).}}

Additionally, in quantitative [[backtesting]] of market performance or other characteristics, survivorship bias is the use of a current index membership set rather than using the actual constituent changes over time. Consider a backtest to 1990 to find the average performance (total return) of S&amp;P 500 members who have paid dividends within the previous year. To use the current 500 members only and create a historical equity line of the total return of the companies that met the criteria would be adding survivorship bias to the results. S&amp;P maintains an index of healthy companies, removing companies that no longer meet their criteria as a representative of the large-cap U.S. stock market. Companies that had healthy growth on their way to inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 would be counted as if they were in the index during that growth period, which they were not. Instead there may have been another company in the index that was losing market capitalization and was destined for the S&amp;P 600 Small-cap Index that was later removed and would not be counted in the results. Using the actual membership of the index and applying entry and exit dates to gain the appropriate return during inclusion in the index would allow for a bias-free output.

When something becomes a non-survivor, it is either completely eliminated, or whatever voice it has is muted to zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-08-11/success-stories-how-survivorship-bias-tricks-entrepreneurs|title=How Survivorship Bias Tricks Entrepreneurs|author=Karen E. Klein|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|''The Black Swan'']], financial writer [[Nassim Taleb]] called the data obscured by survivorship bias "silent evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taleb |first= Nassim Nicholas |date= 2010 |title= The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable | edition= 2nd |url= |location= New York |publisher= Random House |page= 101 |isbn= 9780679604181|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In history ===
[[Diogenes]] was asked concerning paintings of those who had escaped shipwreck: "Look, you who think the gods have no care of human things, what do you say to so many persons preserved from death by their especial favour?", to which Diogenes replied: "Why, I say that their pictures are not here who were cast away, who are by much the greater number." &lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Mumm has described how survival bias leads historians to study organisations that are still in existence more than those which have closed. This means large, successful organisations such as the Women's Institute, which were well organised and still have accessible archives for historians to work from, are studied more than smaller charitable organisations, even though these may have done a great deal of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Philanthropic Cultures, in Women, Gender and Religious Cultures in Britain, 1800-1940, Eds Sue Morgan and Jacqueline deVries .|last=Mumm|first=Susan|publisher=London: Routledge|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In manufacturing and goods production ===
{{unsourced-section|date=April 2017}}
A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer than similar contemporary items. (This perception is reflected in the common expression "They don't make 'em [them] like they used to"). Again, because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items which were built to last will have survived into the present day.  Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive.  All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.  

Though survivorship bias may explain a significant portion of the common perception that older manufacturing processes were more rigorous, there are other processes that may explain that perception, such as [[planned obsolescence]] and [[overengineering]].  It is difficult to directly compare and determine whether manufacturing has become overall better or worse.  Manufactured goods are constantly changing, the same items are rarely built for more than a single generation, and even the raw materials change from one era to the next.  Capabilities and processes in materials science, technology, manufacturing, and testing have all advanced immensely since the 20th century, undoubtedly raising the potential for similar increases in durability, but pressures on production costs and time have also increased, resulting in manufacturing shortcuts that often result in less durable products.  Overall, the contemporary consumer probably {{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}} has access to and experiences a much wider range of product durability than past generations.   Again, bias arises from the fact that historical goods of poor quality are no longer visible, and only the best produced items of the past survive to today.

=== In architecture and construction ===

Just as new buildings are being built every day and older structures are constantly torn down, the story of most civil and urban architecture involves a process of constant renewal, renovation, and revolution.  Only the most (subjectively, but popularly determined) beautiful, most useful, and most structurally sound buildings survive from one generation to the next.  This creates another selection effect where the ugliest and weakest buildings of history have long been eradicated from existence and thus the public view, and so it leaves the visible impression, seemingly correct but factually flawed, that all buildings in the past were both more beautiful and better built.

=== In highly competitive careers ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Whether it be movie stars, or athletes, or musicians, or CEOs of multibillion-dollar corporations who dropped out of school, popular media often tells the story of the determined individual who pursues their dreams and beats the odds.  There is much less focus on the many people that may be similarly skilled and determined but fail to ever find success because of factors beyond their control or other (seemingly) random events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/success-stories-how-survivorship-bias-tricks-entrepreneurs|title=How Survivorship Bias Tricks Entrepreneurs|author=Karen E. Klein|publisher=Bloomberg Business|date=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This creates a false public perception that anyone can achieve great things if they have the ability and make the effort.  The overwhelming majority of failures are not visible to the public eye, and only those who survive the selective pressures of their competitive environment are seen regularly.

=== In the military ===

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018|talk=In the military}}

[[File:Survivorship-bias.png|thumb|The damaged portions of returning planes show locations where they can take a hit and still return home safely; those hit in other places do not survive. (Image shows hypothetical data.)]]
During World War II, the statistician [[Abraham Wald]] took survivorship bias into his calculations when considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire.&lt;ref name=Wald1943&gt;Wald, Abraham. (1943). ''A Method of Estimating Plane Vulnerability Based on Damage of Survivors''. Statistical Research Group, Columbia University.  ''[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~swu6/documents/A_Reprint_Plane_Vulnerability.pdf CRC 432&amp;nbsp;— reprint from July 1980]''. Center for Naval Analyses.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the Center for Naval Analyses had conducted a study of the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions, and had recommended that armor be added to the areas that showed the most damage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|talk=In the military}} Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had ''survived'' their missions—the bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|talk=In the military}} The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed{{r|Wald1943|p=88}}, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost. His work is considered seminal in the then-fledgling discipline of [[operational research]].&lt;ref name=Mangel1984&gt;{{cite journal

===In cats===
In a study performed in 1987 it was reported that cats who fall from less than six stories, and are still alive, have greater injuries than cats who fall from higher than six stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3692980 |year=1987 |last1=Whitney |first1=WO |last2=Mehlhaff |first2=CJ |title=High-rise syndrome in cats |volume=191 |issue=11 |pages=1399–403 |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petplace.com/cats/highrise-syndrome-in-cats/page1.aspx Highrise Syndrome in Cats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this might happen because cats reach [[terminal velocity]] after righting themselves at about five stories, and after this point they relax, leading to less severe injuries in cats who have fallen from six or more stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~barneye/kitty.html Falling Cats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712033200/http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~barneye/kitty.html |date=2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' newspaper column proposed that another possible explanation for this phenomenon&lt;ref name="VisserSchnitzer2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Schnitzer|first2=Stefan A.|last3=Muller-Landau|first3=Helene C.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=de Kroon|first5=Hans|last6=Comita|first6=Liza S.|last7=Hubbell|first7=Stephen P.|last8=Wright|first8=S.

Cats that die in falls are less likely to be brought to a veterinarian than injured cats, and thus many of the cats killed in falls from higher buildings are not reported in studies of the subject.&lt;ref name=straightdope&gt;{{cite web

===In tropical trees===
Tropical vines and lianas are often viewed as macro-parasites of trees that reduce host tree survival. The proportion of trees infested with lianas was observed to be much greater in shade-tolerant, heavy wooded, slow-growing tree species while light-demanding, lighter wooded and fast-growing species are often liana free. Such observations led to the expectation that lianas have stronger negative effects on shade-tolerant species &lt;ref name="Schnitzer2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schnitzer|first1=S|title=The ecology of lianas and their role in forests|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=5|year=2002|pages=223–230|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, further investigations revealed that liana infestation is far more harmful to light-demanding fast-growing tree species where liana infestation greatly decreases survival such that the observable sample is biased towards those that survived and are liana-free &lt;ref name="VisserSchnitzer2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Schnitzer|first2=Stefan A.|last3=Muller-Landau|first3=Helene C.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=de Kroon|first5=Hans|last6=Comita|first6=Liza S.|last7=Hubbell|first7=Stephen P.|last8=Wright|first8=S.

Hence, the observable sample of trees with lianas in their crown is skewed due to survivorship bias.

===In studies of evolution===

Large groups of organisms called [[clades]] that survive a long time are subject to various survivorship biases such as the "[[push of the past]]", generating the illusion that clades in ''general'' tend to originate with a high rate of [[Genetic divergence|diversification]] that then slows through time.&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a general experimental flaw ==

Survivorship bias (or survivor bias) is a statistical [[artifact (error)|artifact]] in applications outside [[finance]], where studies on the remaining population are fallaciously compared with the historic average despite the survivors having unusual properties.  Mostly, the unusual property in question is a track record of success (like the successful funds).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

For example, the [[parapsychology]] researcher [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] believed he had identified the few individuals from hundreds of potential subjects who had powers of [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]. His calculations were based on the [[improbability]] of these few subjects guessing the [[Zener cards]] shown to a partner by chance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

A major criticism which surfaced against his calculations was the possibility of unconscious survivorship bias in subject selections. He was accused of failing to take into account the large effective size of his sample (all the people he rejected as not being "strong [[telepath]]s" because they failed at an earlier testing stage). Had he done this he might have seen that, from the large sample, one or two individuals would probably achieve the track record of success he had found purely by chance.

Writing about the Rhine case in ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'', [[Martin Gardner]] explained that he did not think the experimenters had made such obvious mistakes out of [[statistical]] naïveté, but as a result of subtly disregarding some poor subjects. He said that, without trickery of any kind, there would always be some people who had improbable success, if a large enough sample were taken. To illustrate this, he speculates about what would happen if one hundred professors of [[psychology]] read Rhine's work and decided to make their own tests; he said that survivor bias would winnow out the typical failed experiments, but encourage the lucky successes to continue testing. He thought that the common [[null hypothesis]] (of no result) would not be reported, but:
{{quote|Eventually, one experimenter remains whose subject has made high scores for six or seven successive sessions. Neither experimenter nor subject is aware of the other ninety-nine projects, and so both have a strong delusion that ESP is operating.}}

He concludes:

{{quote|The experimenter writes an enthusiastic paper, sends it to Rhine who publishes it in his magazine, and the readers are greatly impressed.}}

If enough [[scientist]]s study a phenomenon, some will find [[statistically significant]] results by chance, and these are the experiments submitted for publication. Additionally, papers showing positive results may be more appealing to editors.&lt;ref name="ioannidis2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ioannidis |first=J. P. A. |year=2005 |title=Why Most Published Research Findings Are False |journal=[[PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=e124 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 |pmid=16060722 |pmc=1182327}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is known as ''positive results bias'', a type of [[publication bias]]. To combat this, some editors now call for the submission of "negative" scientific findings, where "nothing happened".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Survivorship bias is one of the issues discussed in the provocative 2005 paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False".&lt;ref name="ioannidis2005"/&gt;

== In business law ==

Survivorship bias can raise [[false advertising|truth-in-advertising]] problems when the success rate advertised for a product or service is measured with respect to a population whose makeup differs from that of the target audience whom the company offering that product or service targets with advertising claiming that success rate.  These problems become especially significant when
# the advertisement either fails to disclose the existence of relevant differences between the two populations or describes them in insufficient detail;
# these differences result from the company's deliberate "pre-screening" of prospective customers to ensure that only customers with traits increasing their likelihood of success are allowed to purchase the product or service, especially when the company's selection procedures or evaluation standards are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]; and
# the company offering the product or service charges a fee, especially one that is non-refundable or not disclosed in the advertisement, for the privilege of attempting to become a customer.

For example, the advertisements of online dating service [[EHarmony|eHarmony.com]] pass this test because they fail the first two prongs but not the third:  They claim a success rate significantly higher than that of competing services while generally not disclosing that the rate is calculated with respect to a viewership subset who possess traits that increase their likelihood of finding and maintaining relationships and lack traits that pose obstacles to their doing so (1), and the company deliberately selects for these traits by administering a lengthy [[EHarmony#Criticism|pre-screening process]] designed to reject prospective customers who lack the former traits or possess the latter ones (2), but the company does not charge a fee for administration of its pre-screening test, with the effect that its prospective customers face no "downside risk" other than losing the time and expending the effort involved in completing the pre-screening process (negating 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/12/AR2007051201350.html |title=They Met Online, but Definitely Didn't Click |first=Paul |last=Farhi |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Nature of the Judicial Process''''' is a legal classic written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]], and [[New York Court of Appeals]] [[Chief Justice]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in 1921.  It was compiled from [[The Storrs Lectures]] delivered at [[Yale Law School]] earlier that year.

==Summary==

The central question of ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' is how judges should decide cases. Cardozo’s answer is that judges should do what they have always done in the Anglo-American legal tradition, namely, follow and apply the law in easy cases, and make new law in hard cases by balancing competing considerations, including the paramount value of social welfare. Cardozo identifies four leading methods of legal analysis: (1) the method of logic (or “analogy,” or “philosophy”), which seeks to extend legal principles in ways that preserve logical consistency; (2) the method of history (or “evolution”), which adverts to the historical origins of the legal rule or concept; (3) the method of custom (or “tradition”), which views social customs as helpful guides to community values and settled expectations; and (4) the method of sociology, which looks to considerations of reason, justice, utility, and social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921, pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods may have their “preponderating value”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular cases. No simple test or rigid formula can decide which method should prevail in a given case.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; But in difficult cases where a legal rule is outmoded or the law contains “gaps” that must be filled, judges should frankly play the role of legislators and let “the welfare of society fix the path.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardozo admits that there are risks in judicial lawmaking. To minimize these, he points to a number of factors that significantly limit judicial discretion. First, judges may make new law only “interstitially,” that is, when the law contains gaps or a legal rule is clearly obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, judges in their exercise of judicial review should never strike down a law unless it is “so plainly arbitrary and oppressive that right-minded men and women could not reasonably regard”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; it otherwise. Finally, when judges invoke norms such as “reason,” “justice,” or “social advantage” when employing the method of sociology, they should look to community standards rather than to their own personal values.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-American system of law, Cardozo remarks, a judge “is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final balance, a judge’s freedom to innovate is insignificant “compared with the bulk and pressure of the rules that hedge him on every side.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 136-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In claiming that judges do and must make law, Cardozo was siding with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and other American “proto-realists” of his day who were challenging the traditional “oracular” or “mechanical” or “formalist” view of judicial reasoning. On that view, judges never make law, they simply discover pre-existing law and apply it. According to strict formalists, there are no hard cases where the law is silent, or ambiguous, or vague, or contradictory, or couched in broad generalities. Rather, the law is clear, consistent, and complete; all legal questions have a single correct answer; and judges are (in Blackstone's phrase) “living oracles” who deduce inexorable legal conclusions from indisputable legal axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Samuel Summers, ''Instrumentalism and American Legal Theory''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 138-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism was not Cardozo’s only target in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. He also attacked radical critics of formalism, such as John Chipman Gray, who claimed that judges have immense freedom and rejected the very idea of law as a set of binding rules. Gray and other proto-realists of the time tried to demystify law and view it with hard-headed pragmatism. They argued that since judges are the ultimate arbiters of law, “law” in the final analysis is whatever judges say it is (or what they predictably will say it is in the future). Cardozo argued that this isn’t an “analysis” of law, but a denial that any true law exists. The proto-realists confuse right with power. Judges may have the power to ignore settle legal standards, but they do not have the right. Moreover, the attempt to identify law with judicial rulings ignores the fact that the great majority of legal questions have clear, uncontroversial answers that guide everyday conduct and are never litigated in courts.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' established Cardozo “as one of the leading jurists of his time”&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward White, ''The American Judicial tradition: Profiles of Leading American Judges.'' Expanded ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; and “has become a classic of legal education."&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Its continuing appeal is due, in part, to its self-effacing tone, its lapidary prose, and its attempt to strike a happy medium between legal formalism and radical realist theories that wholly reject traditional views of law, legal reasoning, judicial restraint, and the rule of law.

The great success of Cardozo’s ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' created demand for further reflections on the law.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In two later works, ''The Growth of Law'' (1924) and ''The Paradoxes of Legal Science'' (1927), Cardozo refined, deepened, and to some extent modified the views of law laid out in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''.

==Notable quotations==

* The great generalities of the constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age. (17)

* Nothing is stable. Nothing absolute. All is fluid and changeable. There is an endless “becoming.” We are back with Heraclitus. (28)

* The final cause of law is the welfare of society. (66)

* A constitution states or ought to state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future. (83)

* The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders. (92)

* The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. (141)

* We shall have to feel our way here as elsewhere in the law. Somewhere between worship of the past and exaltation of the present, the path of safety will be found. (160)

* I was much troubled in spirit, in my first years upon the bench, to find how trackless was the ocean on which I had embarked. I sought for certainty. I was oppressed and disheartened when I found that the quest for it was futile. I was trying to reach land, the solid land of fixed and settled rules, the paradise of a justice that would declare itself by tokens plainer and more commanding than its pale and glimmering reflections in my own vacillating mind and conscience. (166)

* The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by. (168)

* The future . . . is yours. We have been called to do our parts in an ageless process. Long after I am dead and gone, and my little part in it is forgotten, you will be here to do your share, and to carry the torch forward. I know that the flame will burn bright while the torch is in your keeping. (179-80)

[[File:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|thumb|right|An idealised portrait of Jakob Böhme]]

'''Theosophy''', also known as '''Christian theosophy''' and '''Boehmian theosophy''', refers to a range of positions within [[Christianity]] which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of [[divinity]] and the origin and purpose of the universe.
They have been characterized as [[mystical]] and [[occult]]ist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forward, to the East: Mapthali Herz Imber's Perception of Kabbalah|last=Huss|first=Boaz|year=2013|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|page=398|doi=10.1080/14725886.2013.826464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy is considered part of [[Western esotericism]], which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and salvation.

The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher [[Jakob Böhme]].

In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the [[Theosophical Society]], an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt; "Following a period of obscurity, it was then revived at the end of the nineteenth century by the Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky" Partridge, C. (2013). Understanding the Dark Side. Chester: University of Chester. page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

==Etymology and terminology==
Theosophy comes from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|theosophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}), which combines ''{{lang|grc|theos}}'' (θεός), "God"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott: ''Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|grc|sophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|σοφία}}), "wisdom". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theosophy |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/theosophy |website=Encylopedia.com |publisher=Encylopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymological meaning is thus "wisdom of God."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} 

The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]]:{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name = "Lobel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''theosophoi'' are "those knowing divine things".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "theosophos" (θεόσοφος) "wise in divine things" was applied by [[Iamblichus]] to the [[gymnosophists]] (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian [[yogi]]s or [[sadhu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]] (''De mysteriis'' 7.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of esotericism such as [[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Antoine Faivre|Faivre]] differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by [[Helena Blavatsky]] by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt;

Antoine Faivre suggested that it be called "Boehmian theosophy".{{sfn|Faivre|1998|p=116}}

==Historical development==
{{see also|Transcendent theosophy}}
===Antiquity and medieval ending c. 1450 CE===
The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name = "Lobel" /&gt; The 13th century work ''[[Summa philosophiae]]'' attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]] made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Origen]] were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
During the [[Renaissance]], use of the term diverged to refer to [[gnostic]] knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century ''Theosophia'' by [[Johannes Arboreus]] provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.&lt;ref name="Faivre1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and [[Pietism]] arose in response to the orthodoxy of the [[Lutheran Reformation]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=87}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[I]n the first decades of the seventeenth century, the German cobbler Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) wrote an oeuvre of impressive depth and originality that has become foundational for one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism: Christian theosophy. In a heartfelt attempt to understand how a good God could have created a world so full of evil and suffering, Böhme developed a dramatic visionary cosmogony filled with alchemical and Paracelsian references, that described the 'birth of God' himself out of the unfathomable mysteries of the ''Ungrund''."|source=— Religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} }}

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic [[Jakob Boehme]] (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word "theosophy", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13, see also p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Boehme gave the word "theosophy" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating [[nature]] with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=10–11 Faivre's list of 17th century theosophers in North-Western Europe (including Germany) consists of roughly ten names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1618–1699), [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637), [[John Pordage]] (1608–1681), [[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), [[Henry More]] (1614–1687), [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646–1719), and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] (1616–1680).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=10-11 Henry More is added to the list by Faivre with some reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying [[active imagination]] in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OED|1989|}} v. XVII, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in [[ancient Egypt]], and to [[Neo-Platonism]], and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term "theosophy" was still "practically absent" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=47 (Diderot is the one exception Faivre mentions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Jakob Brucker]] (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work {{cite book|title=Historia critica philosophia}} (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word ''theosophy'' was often used in conjunction with {{clarify span|panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.|explain=panosophy vs. pansophy?|date=January 2015}} The term ''theosophy'' is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Robert Hindmarsh]], a printer with a Methodist background, formed a "Theosophical Society" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Hindmarsh, Robert, ''Rise and Progress of The New Jerusalem Church In England, America and Other Parts,'' Hoderson and Sons, London 1861; {{ISBN|1-4021-3146-1}}.

Groups such as the [[Martinist Order]] founded by [[Papus]] in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: "although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemeth IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that "Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=23}}

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the "theosophic current" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought  (i.e., [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], Neo-Alexandrian [[hermetism|Hermeticism]], [[Christian Kabbalah]], Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the "prognostications" of [[Paracelsus]]), [[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|philosophia occulta]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faivre noted that there are "obvious similarities" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier  theosophy "belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type", while that of modern Theosophy "reveals a more universal aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences "are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern theosophy retains its western Hermetic motive, logic and end.... The continuities are greater than the differences." Handbook of the Theosophical Current , Olav Hammer, Mikael Rothstein, BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9789004235977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. [[Antoine Faivre]] notes, "the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail."&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

''Theosophy'':
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind.  
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==

The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] described Christian theosophy as "one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} 

===Academic study===

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=31, also xxx.(Preface)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] and Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=6}}
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic ''Naturphilosophie'' and therefore creates an "ideal" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=11}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1225">'''Transferable utility''' is a concept in [[Cooperative game|cooperative]] [[game theory]] and in [[economics]]. [[Utility]] is ''transferable'' if one player can losslessly transfer part of its utility to another player. Such transfers are possible if the players have a common [[currency]] that is valued equally by all. Note that being able to transfer [[cash]] [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] does not imply that utility is transferable: wealthy and poor players may derive a different utility from the same amount of money.

Transferable utility is assumed in many [[cooperative game]]s, where the [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] are not given for individual players, but only for coalitions. In this case the assumption implies that irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff, members of the coalition enjoy the same total [[utility]].

[[File:UML logo.svg|frameless|right|UML logo]]
The '''Unified Modeling Language''' ('''UML''') is a general-purpose, developmental,  [[modeling language]] in the field of [[software engineering]], that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed by [[Grady Booch]], [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]] at [[Rational Software]] in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 UML was also published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as an approved ISO standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32620 |title=ISO/IEC 19501:2005 - Information technology - Open Distributed Processing - Unified Modeling Language (UML) Version 1.4.2 |publisher=Iso.org |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32624 |title=ISO/IEC 19505-1:2012 - Information technology - Object Management Group Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML) - Part 1: Infrastructure |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:OO Modeling languages history.jpg|thumb|320px|History of object-oriented methods and notation]]

=== Before UML 1.0 ===

UML has been evolving since the second half of the 1990s and has its roots in the [[object-oriented programming]] methods developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The timeline (see image) shows the highlights of the history of object-oriented modeling methods and notation.

It is originally based on the notations of the [[Booch method]], the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE), which it has integrated into a single language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Rational Software Corporation]] hired [[James Rumbaugh]] from [[General Electric]] in 1994 and after that the company became the source for two of the most popular object-oriented modeling approaches of the day:&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Zendler (1997) ''Advanced Concepts, Life Cycle Models and Tools for Objeckt-Oriented Software Development''. p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Rumbaugh's [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[Grady Booch]]'s method. They were soon assisted in their efforts by [[Ivar Jacobson]], the creator of the [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE) method, who joined them at Rational in 1995.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book

=== UML 1.x ===

Under the technical leadership of those three (Rumbaugh, Jacobson and Booch), a consortium called the [[UML Partners]] was organized in 1996 to complete the ''Unified Modeling Language (UML)'' specification, and propose it to the Object Management Group (OMG) for standardisation. The partnership also contained additional interested parties (for example [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]]). The UML Partners' UML 1.0 draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997 by the consortium. During the same month the UML Partners formed a group, designed to define the exact meaning of language constructs, chaired by [[Cris Kobryn]] and administered by Ed Eykholt, to finalize the specification and integrate it with other standardization efforts. The result of this work, UML 1.1, was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ad/97-08-11 |title=UML Specification version 1.1 (OMG document ad/97-08-11) |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first release a task force was formed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to improve the language, which released several minor revisions, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/ |title=UML |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards it produced (as well as the original standard) have been noted as being ambiguous and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Génova et alia 2004 "Open Issues in Industrial Use Case Modeling"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml-forum.com/docs/papers/CACM_Jan02_p107_Kobryn.pdf |title=Will UML 2.0 Be Agile or Awkward? |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cardinality notation ====

As with database Chen, Bachman, and ISO [[ER diagram]]s, class models are specified to use "look-across" [[Cardinality (data modeling)|cardinalities]], even though several authors ([[Merise]],&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Tardieu, Arnold Rochfeld and René Colletti La methode MERISE: Principes et outils (Paperback - 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Elmasri &amp; Navathe&lt;ref&gt;Elmasri, Ramez, B. Shamkant, Navathe, Fundamentals of Database Systems, third ed., Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park, CA, USA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odZK99osY1EC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;img=1&amp;pgis=1&amp;dq=genova&amp;sig=ACfU3U3tDC_q8WOMqUJW4EZCa5YQywoYLw&amp;edge=0 ER 2004 : 23rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Shanghai, China, 8-12 November 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527133330/https://books.google.com/books?id=odZK99osY1EC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;img=1&amp;pgis=1&amp;dq=genova&amp;sig=ACfU3U3tDC_q8WOMqUJW4EZCa5YQywoYLw&amp;edge=0 |date=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) prefer same-side or "look-here" for roles and both minimum and maximum cardinalities. Recent researchers (Feinerer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-inf_4582.pdf |title=A Formal Treatment of UML Class Diagrams as an Efficient Method for Configuration Management 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dullea et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/song/publications/p_DKE_03_Validity.pdf |title=James Dullea, Il-Yeol Song, Ioanna Lamprou - An analysis of structural validity in entity-relationship modeling 2002 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have shown that the "look-across" technique used by UML and ER diagrams is less effective and less coherent when applied to ''n''-ary relationships of order strictly greater than 2.

Feinerer says: "Problems arise if we operate under the look-across semantics as used for UML associations. Hartmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV17Hartmann.pdf |title="Reasoning about participation constraints and Chen's constraints" S Hartmann - 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigates this situation and shows how and why different transformations fail.", and: "As we will see on the next few pages, the look-across interpretation introduces several difficulties which prevent the extension of simple mechanisms from binary to ''n''-ary associations."

=== UML 2 ===

UML 2.0 major revision replaced version 1.5 in 2005, which was developed with an enlarged consortium to improve the language further to reflect new experience on usage of its features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.0/ |title=UML 2.0 |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although UML 2.1 was never released as a formal specification, versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 appeared in 2007, followed by UML 2.2 in February 2009. UML 2.3 was formally released in May 2010.&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/ |title=UML |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; UML 2.4.1 was formally released in August 2011.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; UML 2.5 was released in October 2012 as an "In progress" version and was officially released in June 2015.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; Formal version 2.5.1 was adopted in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1 |title=UML 2.5.1 specification |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four parts to the UML 2.x specification:

* The Superstructure that defines the notation and semantics for diagrams and their model elements
* The Infrastructure that defines the core metamodel on which the Superstructure is based
* The [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL) for defining rules for model elements
* The UML Diagram Interchange that defines how UML 2 diagram layouts are exchanged

The current versions of these standards are&lt;ref name="Versions"&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG|title=OMG Formal Specifications (Modeling and Metadata paragraph)|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/#M&amp;M|accessdate = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* UML Superstructure version 2.4.1
* UML Infrastructure version 2.4.1
* OCL version 2.3.1
* UML Diagram Interchange version 1.0.

UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including elements such as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1/Superstructure/PDF |title=OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure. Version 2.4.1 |publisher=Object Management Group |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* any [[Activity (UML)|activities]] (jobs);
* individual [[Component (UML)|components]] of the system;
** and how they can interact with other [[Component-based software engineering|software components]];
* how the system will run;
* how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);
* external [[user interface]].

Although originally intended for object-oriented design documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation (as listed above),&lt;ref&gt;Satish Mishra (1997). [http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~hs/Lehre/2004-WS_SWQS/20050107_Ex_UML.ppt "Visual Modeling &amp; Unified Modeling Language (UML): Introduction to UML"]. Rational Software Corporation. Accessed 9 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and been found useful in many contexts.&lt;ref name="UML, Success Stories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml.org/uml_success_stories/index.htm|title=UML, Success Stories|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software development methods ===

UML is not a development method by itself;&lt;ref&gt;John Hunt (2000). ''The Unified Process for Practitioners: Object-oriented Design, UML and Java''. Springer, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85233-275-1}}. p.5.door&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was designed to be compatible with the leading object-oriented software development methods of its time, for example [[Object-modeling technique|OMT]], [[Booch method]], [[Objectory]] and especially [[Rational Unified Process|RUP]] that it was originally intended to be used with when work began at Rational Software.

=== Modeling ===

It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system. A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a system's model. The set of diagrams need not completely cover the model and deleting a diagram does not change the model. The model may also contain documentation that drives the model elements and diagrams (such as written use cases).

UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model:&lt;ref&gt;Jon Holt Institution of Electrical Engineers (2004). ''UML for Systems Engineering: Watching the Wheels'' IET, 2004, {{ISBN|0-86341-354-4}}. p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

* Static (or ''structural'') view: emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. It includes [[class diagram]]s and [[composite structure diagram]]s.
* Dynamic (or ''behavioral'') view: emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes [[sequence diagram]]s, [[activity diagram]]s and [[UML state machine|state machine diagrams]].

UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI) format.

In UML, one of the key tools for behavior modelling is the use-case model, caused by [[OOSE]]. Use cases are a way of specifying required usages of a system. Typically, they are used to capture the requirements of a system, that is, what a system is supposed to do.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Almendros-Jiménez, Jesús &amp; Iribarne, Luis. (2007). Describing Use-Case Relationships with Sequence Diagrams. Comput. J.. 50. 116-128. 10.1093/comjnl/bxl053. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagrams ==
{{UML diagram types}}

UML 2 has many types of diagrams, which are divided into two categories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some types represent ''structural'' information, and the rest represent general types of ''behavior'', including a few that represent different aspects of ''interactions''. These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following class diagram:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:UML diagrams overview.svg|center|600px|Hierarchy of UML 2.2 Diagrams, shown as a [[class diagram]]]]

These diagrams may all contain comments or notes explaining usage, constraint, or intent.

=== Structure diagrams ===

Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the [[software architecture]] of software systems. For example, the [[component diagram]] describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Policy Admin Component Diagram.PNG|[[Component diagram]]
BankAccount1.svg|[[Class diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Behavior diagrams ===

Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. As an example, the [[activity diagram]] describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Activity conducting.svg|[[Activity diagram]]
UML Use Case diagram.svg|[[Use case diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Interaction diagrams ===

Interaction diagrams, a subset of behavior diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled. For example, the [[sequence diagram]] shows how objects communicate with each other regarding a sequence of messages.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Metamodeling ==
{{Main article|Meta-Object Facility}}

[[File:M0-m3.png|thumb|320px|Illustration of the Meta-Object Facility]]

The Object Management Group (OMG) has developed a [[metamodeling]] architecture to define the UML, called the [[Meta-Object Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;Iman Poernomo (2006) "[http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/1259/1/acm-paper.pdf The Meta-Object Facility Typed]" in: ''Proceeding SAC '06 Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing''. pp. 1845-1849&lt;/ref&gt; MOF is designed as a four-layered architecture, as shown in the image at right. It provides a meta-meta model at the top, called the M3 layer. This M3-model is the language used by Meta-Object Facility to build metamodels, called M2-models.

The most prominent example of a Layer 2 Meta-Object Facility model is the UML metamodel, which describes the UML itself. These M2-models describe elements of the M1-layer, and thus M1-models. These would be, for example, models written in UML. The last layer is the M0-layer or data layer. It is used to describe runtime instances of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1/Infrastructure/PDF/ |title=UML 2.4.1 Infrastructure |publisher=Omg.org |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meta-model can be extended using a mechanism called [[stereotype (UML)|stereotyping]]. This has been criticised as being insufficient/untenable by [[Brian Henderson-Sellers]] and Cesar Gonzalez-Perez in "Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1.x and 2.0".&lt;ref name="UsesAbusesStereotype"&gt;B. Henderson-Sellers; C. Gonzalez-Perez (2006). "Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1.x and 2.0". in: ''Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems''. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==

UML has been marketed for many contexts.&lt;ref name="UML, Success Stories"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/uml-25-do-you-even-care/240163702?queryText=uml|title = UML 2.5: Do you even care?}} "UML truly is ubiquitous"&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been treated, at times, as a design [[no silver bullet|silver bullet]], which leads to problems. UML misuse includes overuse (designing every part of the system with it, which is unnecessary) and assuming that novices can design with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=984495|title = Death by UML Fever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered a large language, with many [[Syntax (programming languages)|constructs]]. Some people (including [[Ivar Jacobson|Jacobson]]) feel that UML's size hinders learning (and therefore, using) it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.infoq.com/interviews/Ivar_Jacobson|title = Ivar Jacobson on UML, MDA, and the future of methodologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Value-stream mapping''' is a [[lean product development|lean]]-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer with reduced lean wastes as compared to current map. A [[value stream]] focuses on areas of a firm that add value to a product or service, whereas a [[value chain]] refers to all of the activities within a company. At [[Toyota]], it is known as "material- and information-flow mapping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1999 | title = Learning to See: value-stream mapping to create value and eliminate muda | first1 = Mike  | last1 = Rother | first2 =  John | last2 = Shook | isbn = 0-9667843-0-8 | location = Brookline, Massachusetts | publisher = Lean Enterprise Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of value stream mapping ==
The purpose of value stream mapping is to identify and remove or reduce "waste" in value streams, thereby increasing the efficiency of a given value stream. Waste removal is intended to increase productivity by creating leaner operations which in turn make waste and quality problems easier to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/34-for-Quality-John-Bicheno/9780951382943|title=34 for Quality : John Bicheno : 9780951382943|last=Depository|first=Book|website=www.bookdepository.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying waste ==

=== Types of waste ===
Daniel T. Jones (1995) identifies seven commonly accepted types of waste. These terms are updated from the Toyota production system (TPS)'s original nomenclature:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235309659_The_seven_value_stream_mapping_tools|title=The seven value stream mapping tools|last=Hines|first=Peter|last2=Rich|first2=Nick|date=1997-01-01|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Faster-than-necessary pace''': creating too much of a good or service that damages production flow, quality, and productivity. Previously referred to as overproduction, and leads to storage and lead time waste. 
# '''Waiting''': any time goods are not being transported or worked on. 
# '''Conveyance''': the process by which goods are moved around. Previously referred to as transport, and includes double-handling and excessive movement. 
# '''Processing''': an overly complex solution for a simple procedure. Previously referred to as inappropriate processing, and includes unsafe production. This typically leads to poor layout and communication, and unnecessary motion. 
# '''Excess Stock''': an overabundance of inventory which results in greater lead times, increased difficulty identifying problems, and significant storage costs. Previously referred to as unnecessary inventory. 
# '''Unnecessary motion''': ergonomic waste that requires employees to use excess energy such as picking up objects, bending, or stretching. Previously referred to as unnecessary movements, and usually avoidable. 
# '''Correction of mistakes''': any cost associated with defects or the resources required to correct them. 

=== Waste removal operations ===
Monden (1994) identifies three types of operations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781461597162|title=Toyota Production System - An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time {{!}} Y. Monden {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Non-value adding operations (NVA)''': actions that should be eliminated, such as waiting.
# '''Necessary but non-value adding (NNVA)''': actions that are wasteful but necessary under current operating procedures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Value-adding (VA)''': conversion of processing of raw materials via manual labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Using the method==

[[File:Value Stream Mapping map 015.jpg|thumb|A paper value stream map.]]
Value-stream mapping has supporting methods that are often used in  [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] environments to analyze and design flows at the system level (across multiple processes).

Although value-stream mapping is often associated with manufacturing, it is also used in logistics, supply chain, service related industries, healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2011 | last = Graban | first = Mark | title = Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement | location = Boca Raton, Florida | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 9781439870433 | url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439870433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{

In a build-to-the-standard form, [[Shigeo Shingo]]&lt;ref name = shingo-smed&gt;{{cite book | year = 1985 | last = Shingo| first = Shigeo | author-link=Shigeo Shingo|title = A Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System | location = Stamford, Connecticut | publisher = Productivity Press | isbn = 0915299097 | url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9780915299034 | pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the value-adding steps be drawn across the centre of the map and the non–value-adding steps be represented in vertical lines at right angles to the value stream. Thus, the activities become easily separated into the value stream, which is the focus of one type of attention, and the 'waste' steps, another type. He calls the value stream the process and the non-value streams the operations. The thinking here is that the non–value-adding steps are often preparatory or tidying up to the value-adding step and are closely associated with the person or machine/workstation that executes that value-adding step. Therefore, each vertical line is the 'story' of a person or workstation whilst the horizontal line represents the 'story' of the product being created.

Value stream mapping is a recognised method used as part of [[Six Sigma]] methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;"Value Stream Mapping" Article Source: http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=90&amp;Itemid=222#&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In software engineering ===
The success of Lean in manufacturing and production has led to an interest in its adoption in software development. However, it was noted that the current literature on adoption of Lean in software development had a disconnect between the high-level principles and the concrete practices related to lean and agile software development. The literature also had a limited focus on wastes that were literally mapped from the categories identified for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Ali N.B., Operationalization of lean thinking through value stream mapping with simulation and FLOW [dissertation]. Karlskrona: Department of Software Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was ignoring the transformation that lean thinking has itself undergone and moved away from the focus on "removal of waste" to "creating and delivering value".&lt;ref&gt;Hines P, Holweg M, Rich N. Learning to evolve: A review of contemporary lean thinking. International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management. 2004;24(10):994-1011.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of value stream mapping as suggested by the pioneer authors of the field Womack and Jones&lt;ref&gt;Womack JP, Jones DT. Lean thinking: banish waste and create wealth in your corporation. Rev. and updat [] ed. London: Free Press Business; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; was identified as the missing link in the current literature on lean in software development.

Value-stream mapping analyzes both material (artifact) and information flow.&lt;ref&gt;Rother, Mike, and John Shook. Learning to see: value stream mapping to add value and eliminate muda. Lean Enterprise Institute, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The following two resources exemplify the use of VSM in the context of software process improvement in industrial settings:
* "Artifact analysis": analysis of software artifacts like requirements, use case, change request or defect report through the development process&lt;ref&gt;Ali NB, Petersen K, Breno Bernard Nicolau de França. Evaluation of simulation-assisted value stream mapping for software product development: Two industrial cases. ''[[Information and Software Technology]]''. 2015;68:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated analysis methods==
Hines and Rich (1997) defined seven value stream mapping tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1997 | first1 = Nick | last1 =  Rich | first2 = Ann | last2 = Esain | first3 = Nicola   | last3 = Bateman | title = Lean Evolution: Lessons from the Workplace | location =  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are:

'''[http://virion2010.com.au/ Virion]''' is a screen based [[digital art]] exhibition that links to public sites across [[Brisbane]], focused in the Kelvin Grove Urban Screen Network. The Virion Screen Project will be held from the 19 July – 1 of August.

==Premise==
Developed by [http://rachaelnp.wordpress.com/ Rachael Parsons], Virion will explore the [[internet]]’s potential to support a democratic, networked arts culture, by employing an open curatorial process that allows members of the [[general public]] to actively contribute to the exhibitions’ content and construction. Virion seeks to maximize &amp; diversify Brisbane audiences’ exposure to [[new media]] practices by screening works in non-traditional &amp; traditional locations each creating a unique viewing experience. Virion strives to make vital connections between [[contemporary art]], the general public and the local community and environment.

==Submissions==
Using the Virion Website [http://www.virion2010.com.au], internet users are invited to upload an image, short video work or sound work that will be exhibited during the [[exhibition]] both on selected screen sites and the Virion [[website]]. The exhibition is open to all users, there is no [[selection criteria]] (the exception being explicit material that may be inappropriate for public spaces) and each work is given equal showing time. Users are able to select the screen they want their work to be shown on [http://www.virion2010.com.au]. The ability to upload content will remain open during the exhibition period. Virion provides [[artist]]s the opportunity to display their work across a network of public screens and access a diverse audience. The exhibition is open to all users from professional and emerging artists to people experimenting with cameras and scanners.  Submissions may be in the form of digital stills or [[video]] files up to 1 minute each. Throughout the exhibition the audience is invited to respond and participate by contributing further content to the show. Sites will be updated progressively to include all work. Online Artist submissions are now open. To be included in the opening of the exhibition submissions must be received by July 14 [http://www.virion2010.com.au].

==Screens==
Each screen will play a compilation of diverse images and video that represent a wide &amp; integrated range of local and international art practices and styles.
