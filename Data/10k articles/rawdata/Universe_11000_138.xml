Sample is heated by a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser and temperature is measured from sample brightness by a pyrometer.]]

[[File:Schwebender Ball La Boom 16011999.jpg|thumb|Aerodynamic levitation of objects can be also a nice effect in party locations. Here a light ball flies in an air stream generated by a ventilator in the square box]]

'''Aerodynamic [[levitation]]''' is the use of gas pressure to levitate materials so that they are no longer in physical contact with any container. In scientific experiments this removes contamination and nucleation issues associated with physical contact with a container.

==Overview==
The term aerodynamic levitation could be applied to many objects that use gas pressure to counter the force of [[gravity]], and allow stable [[levitation]]. Helicopters and air hockey pucks are two good examples of objects that are aerodynamically levitated. However, more recently this term has also been associated with a scientific technique which uses a cone-shaped nozzle allowing stable levitation of 1-3mm diameter spherical samples without the need for active control mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul C. Nordine|author2=J. K. Richard Weber|author3=Johan G. Abadie|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|title=Properties of high-temperature melts using levitation|date=2000|volume=72|pages=2127–2136|doi=10.1351/pac200072112127|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerodynamic levitation as a scientific tool==
These systems allow spherical samples to be levitated by passing gas up through a diverging conical nozzle. Combining this with &gt;200W continuous [[carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser]] heating allows sample temperatures in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius to be achieved.

When heating materials to these extremely high temperatures levitation in general provides two key advantages over traditional furnaces. First, contamination that would otherwise occur from a solid container is eliminated. Second, the sample can be undercooled, i.e. cooled below its normal freezing temperature without actually freezing.

===Undercooling of liquid samples===
Undercooling, or [[supercooling]], is the cooling of a liquid below its equilibrium freezing temperature while it remains a liquid. This can occur wherever crystal [[nucleation]] is suppressed. In levitated samples, heterogeneous nucleation is suppressed due to lack of contact with a solid surface. Levitation techniques typically allow samples to be cooled several hundred degrees Celsius below their equilibrium freezing temperatures.

===Glass produced by aerodynamic levitation===
Since crystal nucleation is suppressed by levitation, and since it is not limited by sample conductivity (unlike electromagnetic levitation), aerodynamic levitation can be used to make glassy materials, from high temperature melts that cannot be made by standard methods. Several silica-free, aluminium oxide based glasses have been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|display-authors=6|author=J. K. Richard Weber|author2=Jean A. Tangeman|author3=Thomas S. Key|author4=Kirsten J.

In the last few years a range of [[in situ]] measurement techniques have also been developed. The following measurements can be made with varying precision:

[[electrical conductivity]],
[[viscosity]],
[[density]],
[[surface tension]],
[[specific heat capacity]],

In situ aerodynamic levitation has also been combined with:

X-ray [[synchrotron radiation]],
[[neutron scattering]],
[[NMR spectroscopy]]

'''Alexis Thérèse Petit''' ({{IPA-fr|pəti|lang}}; 2 October 1791, [[Vesoul]], [[Haute-Saône]] – 21 June 1820, [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] [[physicist]].

Petit is known for his work on the efficiencies of air- and steam-engines, published in 1818 ("Mémoire sur l’emploi du principe des forces vives dans le calcul des machines").  His well-known discussions with the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], founder of [[thermodynamics]], may have stimulated Carnot in his reflexions on [[heat engine]]s and [[thermodynamic efficiency]].

==Biography==
Petit was born in [[Vesoul]], [[Haute-Saône]]. At the age of 10, he proved that he was already capable of taking the difficult entrance exam to France's most prestigious scientific school of the time, the [[École Polytechnique]] of [[Paris]]. He was then placed in a preparatory school where he actually served as a "répétiteur" to help his own classmates digest the course material.  He duly entered Polytechnique at the lowest permissible age, in 1807, and graduated "hors-rang" in 1809 (which is to say that he clearly outranked all of his classmates).

After graduation, Petit stayed at Polytechnique as a faculty member, first as "répétiteur" in Analysis and Mechanics (1809) then in Physics (1810). He taught for some time at Lycée Bonaparte. At Polytechnique, he served as a substitute (1814) for [[Jean Henri Hassenfratz|Hassenfratz]] whom he would replace in 1815. He thus became the second professor of physics at Polytechnique and the youngest person ever to hold that position, at the age of 23.

Petit and [[François Arago]] were brothers-in-law because they married two sisters. In 1814, the two men collaborated on a paper entitled "Mémoire sur les variations que le pouvoir réfringent d’une même substance éprouve par l’effet gradué de la chaleur".

Petit first collaborated with [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] for the competition of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]] about refrigeration (1815). Petit is now probably best known for the surprising [[Dulong–Petit law]] concerning the [[specific heat capacity]] of [[metal]]s, which both men formulated together in 1819.  Petit also designed a special thermometer (using weights) to determine the thermal dilatation coefficients of several metals.

Petit died from tuberculosis at the age of 28, shortly after the passing of his wife. He was succeeded by [[Pierre Louis Dulong|Dulong]] as professor of physics at the Polytechnique (1820).

Roberto Piazza's 2016 paper&lt;ref name="2018-07-06_Piazza"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02270 The strange case of Dr. Petit and Mr. Dulong], Roberto Piazza, [[arXiv]], 2018-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Dulong–Petit law]] provides biographical and temperament details by contemporary and fellow physicist, [[Jules Jamin]]. “Petit had a lively intelligence, an elegant and easy speech, he seduced with an amiable look, got easily attached, and surrendered himself to his tendencies rather than governing them. He was credited with an instinctive scientific intuition, a power of premature invention, certain presages of an assured future that everyone foresaw and even desired, so great was the benevolence which he inspired. Dulong was the opposite: His language was thoughtful, his attitude serious and his appearance cold[. . . ] He worked slowly but with certainty, with a continuity and a power of will that nothing stopped, I should say with a courage that no danger could push back. In the absence of that vivacity of the mind which invents easily, but likes to rest, he had the sense of scientific exactness, the gusto for precision experiments, the talent of combining them, the patience of completing them, and the art, unknown before him, to carry them to the limits of accuracy[. . . ] Petit had more mathematical tendency, Dulong was more experimental; the first carried in the work more brilliant easiness, the second more continuity; One represented imagination, the other reason, which moderates and contains it.”

'''Appliance recycling''' consists of dismantling waste home appliances and scrapping their parts for reuse. Recycling appliances for their original or other purposes, involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components and destruction of the end-of-life equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading.&lt;ref name="buekens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buekens | first1 = A. | last2 = Yang | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Recycling of WEEE plastics: A review | url = | journal = The Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 415–434 | doi = 10.1007/s10163-014-0241-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate at which appliances are discarded has increased with technological advancement. This correlation directly leads to the question of appropriate disposal. The main types of appliances that are recycled are televisions, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. When appliances are recycled, they can be looked upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful and poison ecosystems.

The strength of appliance recycling legislation varies around the world.

For example recycling one [[refrigerator]] can save {{convert|10|lb}} of [[foam insulation]], and {{convert|300000|btu}} of energy.

==Disassembly==
A key part of appliance recycling is the manual dismantling of each product. The disassembly removes hazardous components, while sorting out reusable parts. Procedures vary from one appliance to the other. The amount of hazardous components able to be removed also depends on the type of appliance. Low removal rates of hazardous components reduce the recyclability of valuable materials. Each type of appliance has its own set of characteristics and components. This makes characterization of appliances essential to sorting and separating parts. Research on appliance dismantling has become an active area, intending to help recycling reach maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = J. | last2 = Lopez | first2 = B.N. | last3 = Liu | first3 = L. | last4 = Zhao | first4 = N. | last5 = Yu | first5 = K. | last6 = Zheng | first6 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Regional or global WEEE recycling. Where to go? | url = | journal = Waste Management | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 923–924 | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
There is a certain process used to recover materials from appliances. Parts are generally removed in order from largest to smallest. Metals are extracted first and then plastics. Materials are sorted by either size, shape, or [[density]]. Sizing is a good means of sorting to quicken future processing. It also classifies fractions that show composition. Materials report to larger or finer fractions based on original dimension, toughness, or brittleness.&lt;ref name="buekens"/&gt; Shape classification contributes to the dynamics of the material. Classification by density is important when it comes to determining the use of a material.

===Example===
Batteries and copper are sorted out first for quality control purposes. The materials are then compacted. Next, iron and steel (ferrous metals) are extracted using [[electromagnets]]. They are collected and made ready for sale. Then metals are separated from non-metals using eddy currents. [[Eddy currents]] are created by rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which induce metals to jump away from non-metals. Then water separation is used to sort plastics and glass from circuit boards and copper wires. Circuit boards and copper content is then sold. Plastics and glass are further compacted for reuse.&lt;ref name="weee"&gt;WEEE Recycling Process. (2014). Retrieved April 7, 2015, from Sims Recycling Solutions Centres 
website: http://www.simsrecycling.co.uk/Resources/WEEE-recycling-process
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling By Region==
Although appliance recycling is still quite new, countries have been making the effort to enact laws and regulations regarding the electric waste. Early addressing of waste home appliance recycling started with Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany.

===Europe===
In 2003 [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE) passed into [[European Law]]. It sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods.

===Japan===
{{See also|Recycling in Japan}}

By the 1950s and 60s Japan had already become a major producer of electric appliances. The first initiatives to recycle were launched in the 70s. Due to costs, disassembly was hardly achievable. The Home Appliance Recycling Law was enacted in 1998 and came into force in 2001, and recycling of waste electrics became a legal requirement under the Specific Household Appliance Recycling Law and the Law for Promotion of Effective Utilisation Resources.&lt;ref name="buekens"/&gt;  Appliance manufacturers are now required to finance the recycling of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/recycle/main/english/law/home.html|title=Home Appliance Recycling Law|date=22 May 2006|publisher=METI - Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Electric Home Appliances is a trade group that is responsible for orphaned products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informinc.org/japanepr.pdf|title=Electric Appliance Recycling in Japan|date=November 2003|publisher=INFORM|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China produces a significant share of the world’s appliances. This country also has a high influx of appliance waste. There has not been much progress in appliance recycling efficiency. China’s undeveloped dismantling and processing has led to elevated levels of toxins in waste appliance site vicinities.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = X. | last2 = Tanaka | first2 = M. | last3 = Matsui | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = Economic evaluation of optional recycling processes for waste electronic home appliances | url = | journal = Journal of Cleaner Production | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 53–60 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2008.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their appliance recycling methods require severe improvement.

===United States===
{{See also|Recycling in the United States|Electronic waste in the United States}}

The United States is the largest waste appliance producer in the world, however there is still no federal law requiring appliance recycling and its legislation varies between states. On a state level, many mandatory electronic recovery programs have been implemented. There are also several commercial appliance recyclers, for example, Appliance Recycling Centers of America (ARCA).  ARCA is a company based in Minneapolis, with a chain of recycling depots nationwide.

====California====
In 2003, the [[California Electronic Waste Recycling Act]] was signed. It established a new program for consumers to return, recycle, and ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of video display devices, such as televisions and computer monitors, that are hazardous wastes when discarded.&lt;ref name="electronic"&gt;Electronic Hazardous Waste. (2010). Retrieved from Department of Toxic Substances Control website: http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/ewaste/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, consumers began paying a 6-10 dollar fee when buying an electronic device. These fees are used to pay e-waste collectors and recyclers to cover their cost of managing [[e-waste]]. 
The EWRA classifies e-waste by dividing the products into two categories: electronic devices and covered electronic devices. Only covered electronic devices (CEDs) are included in the EWRA, however all electronic devices needed recycling measures to be taken. The CEDs include televisions and computers that have [[LCD]] displays or contain [[cathode ray tubes]].

===Australia===
Australia has the same approach as the U.S. at this moment. There are several commercial appliance recyclers in Australia, as well as some organisations that remove waste appliances and offer rebates, sponsored by the government. Some retailers like [[Appliances Online]] also remove and recycle customers' old appliances using services like Sims Metal Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recycling Appliances|url=http://www.appliancesonlineblog.com.au/company-news/recycling-appliances}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==EPR==
[[Extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) is defined as an environmental protection strategy that makes the manufacturer of the appliance responsible for its entire life cycle and especially for the “take-back”, recycling and final disposal of the product.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Essentially, manufacturers must now finance product treatment and recycling. Countries where this strategy has been adopted for waste appliances are: Switzerland (1998), Denmark (1999), Netherlands (1999), Norway (1999), Belgium (2001), Japan (2001), Sweden (2001) and Germany (2005), but it has also been expanded through legislation among certain South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Countries in which EPR has long been established, demonstrate that the combination of government legislation and sound company practices can produce a higher take-back and recycling rate. An example of this is the Sony Corporation in Japan, achieving a 53% recycling rate.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Other ways countries approach the issue of waste appliances is either by offering recycling facilities or banning importation. Almost all countries, at least offer facilities that aid in appliance recycling. Many implement extended producer responsibility, in addition to recycling facilities.

The '''Atomic Industrial Forum''' ('''AIF''') was an industrial policy organization for the commercial development of nuclear power nuclear energy.

==History==

===1950s===
The Atomic Industrial Forum history dates to Autumn 1952, when it was being first organized:

:I would propose that those industrial concerns, institutions and individuals that are today actively engaged in atomic energy research, development and operations form — voluntarily and without governmental urging or subsidy — a national association of atomic industries.
::-- T. Keith Glennan, President of the [[Case Institute of Technology]] and founding member, AIF Board of Directors, November 1952

In response, some 30 industrialists, engineers, and educators met in January 1953 to establish the forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nei.org/About-NEI/History |title=History |publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute |accessdate=2015-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AIF was formally incorporated on April 10, 1953 in [[New York City]], and marked the beginning of the commercial nuclear power industry in the [[United States]]The first Executive Director of AIF was Charles Robbins.

As a  profit trade association the AIF advocated the peaceful uses of atomic energy and increasing the role of the private sector in its development. Its first order of business was to advocate revising the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] to allow and foster the commercial ownership of non weapons nuclear facilities, such as production of radioactive isotopes and nuclear power plants. AIF established strong working relationships with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. AIF's efforts helped to achieve the passage of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] which resulted in the growth of a commercial nuclear industry. AIF was organized on the basis of an executive committee, the annual election of officers and a permanent operations staff, headed by an Executive Director, Mr. Charles Robbins.

===1960s===
In 1963 AIF established an international public information program. Working with other forums around the world, the program sought, through publications, workshops, exhibitions, speeches and outreach, to foster and achieve better understanding of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Its first program director was Charles B.Yulish.

Both the government and private sectors involvement in atomic energy grew steadily; eventually, more that 125 commercial nuclear power plants provided 20 percent of America's electricity.
At the same time there were increasing debates on safeguards and regulation. The Atomic Energy Commission, which both promoted, developed and regulated nuclear development, was split into two agencies—the Energy Research and Development Agency, now the Department of Energy, and the independent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Administration. 
 
As new challenges and opportunities evolved, new industry efforts and resources were required to address these matters.

===1980s===
In 1987 the AIF was reconfigured into  the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues, and the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), founded in 1979. In 1994 these two organizations were again reorganized and re-purposed. The Nuclear Energy Institute and the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC conducted public affairs, and the nuclear division of the [[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI),  was responsible for issues involving nuclear fuel supply and management, and the economics of nuclear energy.

===2000s===
In 2011, the Nuclear Energy Institute became the leading organization representing the nuclear industry. NEI headquarters is in Washington, DC.

'''British wildwood''', or simply 'the wildwood', is the wholly [[natural landscape]] which developed across major parts of England after the last ice age. This woodland was not yet affected by human intervention, and was home to many species which are not now found in England, such as elk and brown bears. Over centuries, starting in the Neolithic period, this wildwood gradually gave way to open plains and fields as human populations increased and began to exploit and develop the land to their advantage. Much of the areas of woodland that remain in England descend from the original wildwood but are now in a semi-natural state due to being managed and controlled, for example as a source of timber. These are known as ancient woodland. True wildwood is thought to be no longer extant in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/environment/woodland/ancient-woodland |title=Ancient Woodland |publisher=Exmoor National Park, UK |accessdate=4 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307200856/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/environment/woodland/ancient-woodland |archivedate=7 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://south-coast-central.co.uk/wildwood.htm |title=An Introduction to Britain's Lost Wildwood |publisher=South Coast Central: A Guide To England's South-Central Region |accessdate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This article uses UK English --&gt;
'''Coral reef fish''' are [[fish]] which live amongst or in close relation to [[coral reef]]s. Coral reefs form complex [[ecosystem]]s with tremendous [[biodiversity]]. Among the myriad inhabitants, the fish stand out as colourful and interesting to watch. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs.

Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the surface area of the world oceans, but still they provide a home for 25 percent of all marine fish species. Reef habitats are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99% of the world oceans.

However, loss and degradation of coral reef habitat, increasing [[Marine pollution|pollution]], and [[overfishing]] including the use of [[destructive fishing practices]], are threatening the survival of the coral reefs and the associated reef fish.

== Overview ==
[[File:Orange-lined Triggerfish3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In the foreground is an [[orange-lined triggerfish]] displaying spines. [[Triggerfish]] have mouths that crush shells. Orange-lined triggerfish are particularly aggressive. The black and white fish are [[three-stripe damsel]]fish and the unstriped fish are [[Chromis viridis|blue-green chromis]] damselfish. If the triggerfish attacks, the damselfish will hide in the nearby [[pillar coral]]. If the triggerfish wants to hide, it will squeeze into a coral crevice and lock itself in place with its spines.]]
 
[[Coral reef]]s are the result of thousands of years of [[coevolution]] among algae, invertebrates and fish. They have become crowded and complex environments, and the fish have evolved many ingenious ways of surviving.&lt;ref name=MoyleCech555&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2003, p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Most fishes found on coral reefs are [[ray-finned fishes]], known for the characteristic sharp, bony rays and spines in their fins.&lt;ref name=MoyleCech555 /&gt; These spines provide formidable defences, and when erected they can usually be locked in place or are [[venomous fish|venomous]]. Many reef fish have also evolved [[cryptic coloration]] to confuse predators.&lt;ref name=MoyleCech561&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2003, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reef fish have also evolved complex [[Adaptive behavior (ecology)|adaptive behaviours]]. Small reef fish get protection from predators by hiding in reef crevices or by [[shoaling and schooling]]. Many reef fish confine themselves to one small neighbourhood where every hiding place is known and can be immediately accessed. Others cruise the reefs for food in shoals, but return to a known area to hide when they are inactive.  Resting small fish are still vulnerable to attack by crevice predators, so many fish, such as [[triggerfish]], squeeze into a small hiding place and wedge themselves by erecting their spines.&lt;ref name=MoyleCech561 /&gt;

As an example of the adaptations made by reef fish, the [[yellow tang]] is a [[herbivore]] which feeds on benthic turf algae. They also provide cleaner services to marine turtles, by removing algal growth from their shells. They do not tolerate other fish with the same colour or shape. When alarmed, the usually placid yellow tang can erect spines in its tail and slash at its opponent with rapid sideways movements.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Diversity and distribution==
[[File:Reef building corals.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Distribution of coral reefs]]

[[Coral reef]]s contain the most diverse fish assemblages to be found anywhere on earth, with perhaps as many as 6,000–8,000 species that can be found dwelling within coral reef ecosystems of the world's oceans.&lt;ref name=LiskeMyers&gt;Liske and Myers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms that first led to, and continue to maintain, such concentrations of fish species on coral reefs has been widely debated over the last 50 years.  While many reasons have been proposed, there is no general scientific consensus on which of these is the most influential, but it seems likely that a number of factors contribute.  These include the rich habitat complexity and diversity inherent in coral reef ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the influence of substrate variables on coral reef fish communities.  Luckhurst, B.E. and K. Luckhurst, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Similarity and Diversity Among Coral Reef Fish Communities: A Comparison between Tropical Western Atlantic (Virgin Islands) and Tropical Central Pacific (Marshall Islands) Patch Reefs. Gladfelter et al. 1980&lt;/ref&gt; the wide variety and temporal availability of food resources available to coral reef fishes,&lt;ref&gt;Food Habits of Reef Fishes of the West Indies, Randall, J.E. 1967&lt;/ref&gt; a host of pre and post larval settlement processes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinebiology.org/fishecology.htm Coral Reef Fish Ecology], Buchheim, J.&lt;/ref&gt; and as yet unresolved interactions between all these factors.

There are two major regions of coral reef development recognized; the Indo-Pacific (which includes the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as the Red Sea), and the tropical western Atlantic (also known as the "wider" or "greater" Caribbean).  Each of these two regions contains its own unique coral reef fish fauna with no natural overlap in species.  Of the two regions, the richest by far in terms of reef fish diversity is the Indo-Pacific where there are an estimated 4,000–5,000 species of fishes associated with coral reef habitats.  Another 500–700 species can be found in the greater Caribbean region.&lt;ref name=LiskeMyers /&gt;

}}

===Body shape===
Most reef fishes have body shapes that are different from open water fishes. Open water fish are usually built for speed in the open sea, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish are operating in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability is more important than straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads.&lt;ref name=Alevizon&gt;Alevizon WS (1994) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1559920777 "Pisces Guide to Caribbean Reef Ecology"]  Gulf Publishing Company {{ISBN|1-55992-077-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reef fish, such as [[butterflyfish]] and [[Pomacanthidae|angelfishes]], have evolved bodies which are deep and laterally compressed like a pancake. Their pelvic and pectoral fins are designed differently, so they act together with the flattened body to optimise manoeuvrability.&lt;ref name=Alevizon /&gt;

Coral reef fishes exhibit a huge variety of dazzling and sometimes bizarre colours and patterns. This is in marked contrasts to open water fishes which are usually [[countershading|countershaded]] with silvery colours.

The patterns have different functions. Sometimes they camouflage the fish when the fish rests in places with the right background. Colouration can also be used to help species recognition during mating. Some unmistakable contrasting patterns are used to warn predators that the fish has venomous spines or poisonous flesh.&lt;ref name=Alevizon /&gt;

The [[foureye butterflyfish]] gets its name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of each side of the body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]{{FishBase_species |genus=Chaetodon |species=capistratus |year=2009 |month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in a [[predator]] thinking the fish is bigger than it is, and confusing the back end with the front end. The butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eyespot closer to the predator than the head.  Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eyespot tricks the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. When escape is not possible, the butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge.  This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is too spiny to make a comfortable meal.

The psychedelic ''[[Synchiropus splendidus]]'' (right) is not easily seen due to its bottom-feeding habit and its small size, reaching only about 6&amp;nbsp;cm. It feeds primarily on small crustaceans and other invertebrates, and is popular in the aquarium trade.

Just as some prey species evolved cryptic colouration and patterns to help avoid predators, some [[ambush predator]]s evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The [[tassled scorpionfish]] is an ambush predator that looks like part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; Another ambush predator is the [[striated frogfish]] (right). They lie on the bottom and wave a conspicuous worm-like lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;in) long, they can also inflate themselves like [[pufferfish|puffers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Antennarius | species = striatus | month = January | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frogfish.ch/species-arten/Antennarius-striatus.html ''Antennarius striatus''] www.frogfish.ch.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gobies]] avoid predators by tucking themselves into coral crevices or partly burying themselves in sand. They continually scan for predators with eyes that swivel independently. The camouflage of the tassled scorpionfish can prevent gobies from seeing them until it's too late.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

The [[clown triggerfish]] has strong jaws for crushing and eating sea urchins, crustaceans and hard-shell molluscs. Its [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] (lower) surface has large, white spots on a dark background, and its [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] (upper) surface has black spots on yellow.&lt;ref name=FishbaseCT&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Balistoides|species=conspicillum|year=2010|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a form of [[countershading]]: from below, the white spots look like the lighted surface of the water above; and from above, the fish blends more with the coral reef below. The brightly painted yellow mouth may deter potential predators.&lt;ref name=dakin&gt;{{cite book|title=The Macmillan book of the Marine Aquarium|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Publishing Company]]|location=New York|last=Dakin|first=Nick|year=1992|pages=177|isbn = 0-02-897108-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeding strategies==
Many reef fish species have evolved different feeding strategies accompanied by specialized mouths, jaws and teeth particularly suited to deal with their primary food sources found in coral reef ecosystems. Some species even shift their dietary habits and distributions as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Nicholas|author2=Russ, G|title=Ontogenetic shifts in the habitat associations of butterflyfishes (F. Chaetodontidae)|journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|date=2012|volume=94|issue=4|pages=579–590|doi=10.1007/s10641-011-9964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not surprising, given the huge variety in the types of prey on offer around coral reefs.&lt;ref name=Alevizon /&gt;

For example, the primary food source of [[butterflyfish]]es are the coral [[polyp]]s themselves or the appendages of [[polychaete]]s and other small invertebrate animals. Their mouths protrude like forceps, and are equipped with fine teeth that allow them to nip off such exposed body parts of their prey. [[Parrotfish]]es eat [[algae]] growing on reef surfaces, utilizing mouths like beaks well adapted to scrape off their food. Other fish, like [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], are generalized feeders with more standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to forage on a wide range of animal prey types, including small fishes and invertebrates.&lt;ref name=Alevizon /&gt;

===Generalized carnivores===
[[File:RedSnapper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red snapper (fish)|Red snapper]], are generalized reef feeders with standard jaw and mouth structures that allow them to eat almost anything, though they prefer small fish and [[crustacean]]s.]]

[[Carnivore]]s are the most diverse of feeding types among coral reef fishes. There are many more carnivore species on the reefs than [[herbivore]]s. Competition among carnivores is intense, resulting in a treacherous environment for their prey. Hungry predators lurk in ambush or patrol every part of the reef, night and day.&lt;ref name=PBS3&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/partners.html Coral Reef Connections: Partners] US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fishes associated with reefs are generalized carnivores that feed on a variety of animal prey. These typically have large mouths that can be rapidly expanded, thereby drawing in nearby water and any unfortunate animals contained within the inhaled water mass. The water is then expelled through the gills with the mouth closed, thereby trapping the helpless prey&lt;ref name=Alevizon /&gt; For example, the [[bluestripe snapper]] has a varied [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], feeding on [[fish]]es, [[shrimp]]s, [[crab]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, [[cephalopod]]s and [[planktonic]] [[crustaceans]], as well as [[plant]] and [[algae]] material. Diet varies with age, location and the prevalent prey items locally.&lt;ref name = "AllenFAO"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = G.R. | title = FAO Species Catalogue Vol. 6: Snappers of the World; An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Lutjanid Species Known to Date | publisher = FAO | year = 1985 | location = Rome | pages = 207 | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ac481e/ac481e00.htm | isbn = 92-5-102321-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goatfish]] are tireless [[benthic]] feeders, using a pair of long [[chemosensory]] [[barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s (whiskers) protruding from their chins to rifle through the sediments in search of a meal.

===Specialised carnivores===
Large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] of [[forage fish]], such as [[surgeonfish]] and [[cardinalfish]], move around the reef feeding on tiny [[zooplankton]]. The forage fish are, in turn, eaten by larger fish, such as the bigeye trevally. Fish receive many benefits from [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling behaviour]], including defence against predators through better predator detection, since each fish is on the lookout. Schooling fish have developed remarkable displays of precise choreography which confuse and evade predators. For this they have evolved special pressure sensors along their sides, called [[lateral line]]s, that let them feel each other's movements and stay synchronized.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

[[Bigeye trevally]] also form schools. They are swift predators who patrol the reef in hunting packs. When they find a school of forage fish, such as cardinalfish, they surround them and herd them close to the reef. This panics the prey fish, and their schooling becomes chaotic, leaving them open to attack by the trevally.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Coral Reef Connections: Predators and Prey] US [[Public Broadcasting Service]].

The [[titan triggerfish]] can move relatively large rocks when feeding and is often followed by smaller fishes that feed on leftovers. They also use a jet of water to uncover [[sand dollar]]s buried in sand.

[[Barracuda]] are ferocious predators on other fishes, with razor-sharp conical teeth which make it easy for them to rip their prey to shreds. Barracuda patrol the outer reef in large schools, and are extremely fast swimmers with streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

[[Porcupinefish]] are medium to large sized, and are usually found swimming among or near coral reefs. They inflate their body by swallowing water, reducing potential predators to those with much bigger mouths.

Fish can not groom themselves. Some fish specialise as [[cleaner fish]], and establish [[cleaning station]]s where other fish can come to have their parasites nibbled away. The "resident fish doctor and dentist on the reef is the [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]".&lt;ref name=PBS3 /&gt; The bluestreak is marked with a conspicuous bright blue stripe and behaves in a stereotypical way which attracts larger fish to its cleaning station. As the bluestreak snacks on the parasites it gently tickles its client. This seems to bring the larger fish back again for regular servicing.&lt;ref name=PBS3 /&gt;

The [[Synodus variegatus|reef lizardfish]] secretes a mucus coating which reduces drag when they swim and also protects it from some parasites. But other parasites find the mucus itself good to eat. So lizardfish visit the cleaner wrasse, which clean the parasites from the skin, gills and mouth.&lt;ref name=PBS3 /&gt;

===Herbivores===
[[File:Maldives Surgeonfish, Acanthurus leucosternon.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Surgeonfish]] are among the most common of coral reef [[herbivore]]s, often feeding in [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]]. This may be a mechanism for overwhelming the highly aggressive defence responses of small territorial [[damselfish]]es that vigorously guard small patches of algae on coral reefs.&lt;ref name=Alevizon1976&gt;Mixed schooling and its possible significance in a tropical western Atlantic parrotfish and surgeonfish. WS Alevizon, Copeia 1976:797–798.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Herbivore]]s feed on plants. The four largest groups of coral reef fishes that feed on plants are the [[parrotfish]]es, [[damselfish]]es, [[rabbitfish]]es, and [[surgeonfish]]es. All feed primarily on [[microscopic]] and [[macroscopic]] [[algae]] growing on or near coral reefs.

[[Algae]] can drape reefs in kaleidoscopes of colours and shapes. Algae are [[primary producers]],  which means they are plants synthesising food directly from solar energy and carbon dioxide and other simple nutrient molecules. Without algae, everything on the reef would die. One important algal group, the bottom dwelling ([[benthic]]) algae, grows over dead coral and other inert surfaces, and provides grazing fields for [[herbivore]]s such as parrotfish.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

[[Parrotfish]] are named for their parrot-like beaks and bright colours. They are large herbivores that graze on the algae that grows on hard dead corals. Equipped with two pairs of crushing jaws and their beaks, they pulverize chunks of algae-coated coral, digesting the algae and excreting the coral as fine sand.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

Smaller parrotfish are relatively defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They have evolved to find protection by [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]], sometimes with other species like shoaling [[rabbitfish]]. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It is better to avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.&lt;ref name=PBS3 /&gt;

[[Damselfish]] are a group of species that feed on [[zooplankton]] and algae, and are an important reef [[forage fish]] for larger predators. They are small, typically five centimetres (two inches) long. Many species are aggressive towards other fishes which also graze on algae, such as [[surgeonfish]]. Surgeonfish sometimes use schooling as a countermeasure to defensive attacks by solitary damselfish.&lt;ref name=Alevizon1976 /&gt;

== Symbiosis ==
[[File:Hawkfish.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[hawkfish]], safely perched on [[Acropora]], surveys its surroundings]]

[[Symbiosis]] refers to two species that have a close relationship with each other. The relationship can be [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], when both species benefit from the relationship, [[Commensalism|commensalistic]], when one species benefits and the other is unaffected, and [[Parasitism|parasitistic]], when one species benefits, and the other is harmed.

An example of commensalism occurs between the [[hawkfish]] and [[fire coral]]. Thanks to their large, skinless pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on fire corals without harm. Fire corals are not true [[coral]]s, but are [[hydrozoa]]ns possessing stinging cells called [[nematocyst]]s which would normally prevent close contact. The protection fire corals offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings like a [[hawk]]. Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab [[crustacean]]s and other small [[invertebrate]]s as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.

A more bizarre example of commensalism occurs between the slim, eel-shaped pinhead [[pearlfish]] and a particular species of [[sea cucumber]]. The pearlfish enters the sea cucumber through its anus, and spends the day safely protected inside the seacucumbers [[alimentary tract]]. At night it emerges the same way and feeds on small crustaceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448066/pearlfish Pearlfish] (2010). In Encyclopædia Britannica.

[[Sea anemone]]s are common on reefs. The [[tentacle]]s of sea anemones bristle with tiny harpoons ([[nematocyst]]s) primed with [[toxin]]s, and are an effective deterrent against most predators. However, [[saddle butterflyfish]], which are up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm (12&amp;nbsp;in) long, have developed a resistance to these toxins. Saddle butterflyfish usually flutter gently rather than swim. But in the presence of their preferred food, sea anemones, this gentleness disappears, and the butterflyfish dash in and out, ripping off the anemone tentacles.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

There is a mutualistic relationship between sea anemones and [[clownfish]]. This gives the sea anemones a second line of defence. They are guarded by fiercely territorial [[clownfish]], who are also immune to the anemone toxins. To get their meal, butterflyfish must get past these protective clownfish who, although smaller, are not intimidated. An anemone without its clownfish will quickly be eaten by butterflyfish.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; In return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who are not immune to anemone stings. As a further benefit to the anemone, waste [[ammonia]] from the clownfish feed [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] found in the anemone's tentacles.&lt;ref&gt;Porat, D. &amp; Chadwick-Furman, N.

As with all fish, coral reef fish harbour [[Fish diseases and parasites|parasites]].&lt;ref name=Justine2010 /&gt; Since coral reef fish are characterized by high [[biodiversity]], parasites of coral reef fish show tremendous variety. Parasites of coral reef fish include [[nematode]]s, [[Platyhelminthes]] ([[cestodes]], [[digenea]]ns, and [[monogenea]]ns), [[leech]]es, parasitic crustaceans such as [[isopod]]s and [[copepod]]s,&lt;ref name=Justineetal2010a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Justineetal2010b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Justineatal2012 /&gt; and various microorganisms such as [[myxosporidia]] and [[microsporidia]].  Some of these fish parasites have heteroxenous [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]s (i.e. they have several [[host (biology)|hosts]]) among which [[shark]]s (certain cestodes) or [[mollusc]]s (digeneans). The high biodiversity of coral reefs increases the complexity of the interactions between [[parasite]]s and their various and numerous [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Numerical estimates of parasite biodiversity have shown that certain coral fish species have up to 30 species of parasites.&lt;ref name=Justine2010&gt;Justine, J.-L. 2010: Parasites of coral reef fish: how much do we know?

==Toxicity==
[[File:Pterois volitans Manado-e edit.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Head-on view of the beautiful but venomous  [[Pterois|lionfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase_species |genus=Pterois |species=volitans |year=2009 |month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many reef fish are toxic. Toxic fish are fish which contain strong [[toxin]]s in their bodies. There is a distinction between [[Venom#Venomous vs. poisonous|poisonous fish]] and [[venomous fish]]. Both types of fish contain strong toxins, but the difference is in the way the toxin is delivered. Venomous fish deliver their toxins (called [[venom]]) by biting, stinging, or stabbing, causing an [[envenomation]]. Venomous fish don't necessarily cause poisoning if they are eaten, since the venom is often destroyed in the digestive system. By contrast, poisonous fish contain strong toxins which are not destroyed by the digestive system. This makes them poisonous to eat.&lt;ref name="Biosearch"&gt;[http://www.greatbarrierreefs.com.au/biobits/biobits_venomous.htm Poisonous vs. Venomous fish: What's the difference?] Reef Biosearch. Retrieved 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Venomous fish carry their venom in venom glands and use various delivery systems, such as spines or sharp fins, barbs or spikes, and fangs. Venomous fish tend to be either very visible, using flamboyant colours to warn enemies, or skilfully camouflaged and maybe buried in the sand. Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom might have value for bottom dwelling fish by killing the bacteria that try to invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied. They are a yet to be tapped resource for [[bioprospecting]] to find drugs with medical uses.&lt;ref name="Grady"&gt;Grady, Denise [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/science/22fish.html?ei=5094&amp;en=3d2f666379306107&amp;hp=&amp;ex=1156219200&amp;partner=homepage&amp;pagewanted=print Venom Runs Thick in Fish Families, Researchers Learn] ''The New York Times'' 22 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most venomous known fish is the [[reef stonefish]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petplace.com"/&gt; It has a remarkable ability to camouflage itself amongst rocks. It is an [[ambush predator]] that sits on the bottom waiting for prey to come close. It does not swim away if disturbed, but erects 13 venomous spines along its back. For defence, it can shoot venom from each or all of these spines. Each spine is like a hypodermic needle, delivering the venom from two sacs attached to the spine. The stonefish has control over whether to shoot its venom, and does so when provoked or frightened.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt; The venom results in severe pain, paralysis and tissue death, and can be fatal if not treated. Despite its formidable defence, the stonefish does have predators. Some bottom feeding rays and sharks with crushing teeth feed on them, as does the [[Astrotia stokesii|Stokes' seasnake]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianmuseum.net.au/Reef-Stonefish-Synanceia-verrucosa-Bloch-Schneider-1801 Reef Stonefish, Synanceia verrucosa (Bloch &amp; Schneider, 1801)] [[Australian Museum]].

Unlike the stonefish which can shoot venom, the [[Pterois|lionfish]] can only release venom when something strikes its spines. Although not native to the US coast, lionfish have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York. They are attractive aquarium fish, sometimes used to stock ponds, and may have been washed into the sea during a hurricane. Lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt;

The [[spotted trunkfish]] is a reef fish which secretes a colourless [[ciguatera]] toxin from glands on its skin when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there's no immediate harm to divers. However, predators as large as [[nurse sharks]] can die as a result of eating a trunkfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Lactophrys|species=bicaudalis|year=2009|month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ciguatera toxins appear to accumulate in top predators of coral reefs.  Many of the Caribbean groupers and the barracuda for example may contain enough of this toxin to cause severe symptoms in humans who eat them.  What makes the situation particularly dangerous is that such species may be toxic only at certain sizes or locations, making it difficult to know whether or when they are or are not safe to eat. In some locations this leads to many cases of ciguatera poisoning among tropical islanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/science/ciguatera.htm Ciguatera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204201329/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/science/ciguatera.htm |date=2010-02-04 }}.

The [[Stargazer (fish)|stargazer]] buries itself in sand and can deliver electric shocks as well as venom. It is a delicacy in some cultures (the venom is destroyed when it is cooked), and can be found for sale in some [[fish market]]s with the electric organ removed. They have been called "the meanest things in creation".&lt;ref name="Grady"/&gt;

[[File:Triaenodon obesus moc.jpg|thumb|260px|right|alt=Photo of a swimming whitetip reef shark, facing three-quarters towards the camera|The [[whitetip reef shark]] almost exclusively inhabits coral reefs.]]

Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific are dominated by [[whitetip reef shark|whitetip]], [[blacktip reef shark|blacktip]] and [[grey reef shark]]. Coral reefs in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] are dominated by the [[Caribbean reef shark]]. These sharks are all species of [[requiem shark]], and all have the robust, streamlined bodies that are typical of the [[requiem shark]]. They are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Other species of reef sharks include the [[Galapagos shark]], the [[tawny nurse shark]] and [[hammerhead shark|hammerheads]].

The [[whitetip reef shark]] is a small shark usually less than {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. It is associated almost exclusively with coral reefs where it can be encountered around coral heads and ledges with high vertical relief, or over sandy flats, in [[lagoon]]s, or near drop-offs to deeper water.&lt;ref name="hobson"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hobson, E.S. |year=1963 |title=Feeding Behavior in Three Species of Sharks |journal=Pacific Science |volume=17 |pages=171–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; They prefer very clear water and rarely swim far from the bottom.&lt;ref name="randall"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Randall, J.E. |title=Contribution to the Biology of the Whitetip Reef Shark (''Triaenodon obesus'') |journal=Pacific Science |year=1977 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=143–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitetip reef sharks spend most of the daytime time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which usually rely on ram ventilation and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its [[gill]]s and lie still on the bottom. They have slender, lithe body, which allows them to wriggle into crevices and holes and extract prey inaccessible to other reef sharks. On the other hand, they are rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water.&lt;ref name="randall"/&gt;

The whitetip reef shark does not frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; They generally remain within a highly localized area. An individual shark may use the same cave for months to years.

The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to [[olfaction|olfactory]], [[acoustics|acoustic]], and electrical cues given off by potential prey.

The [[blacktip reef shark]] is typically about {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Shark researcher [[Leonard Compagno]] comments on the relationship between the three species.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The grey reef shark] ...shows [[microhabitat]] separation from the blacktip reef sharks; around islands where both species occur, the blacktip occupies shallow flats, while the grey reef shark is usually found in deeper areas, but where the blacktip is absent, the grey reef shark is commonly found on the flats... [The grey reef shark] complements the whitetip shark as it is far more adapt at catching off-bottom fish than the whitetip, but the later is far more competent in extracting prey from crevices and holes in reefs."&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Carcharhinus perezi bahamas.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Caribbean reef shark]] cruises a coral reef in the Bahamas.]]

The [[Caribbean reef shark]] is up to 3 metres (10&amp;nbsp;ft) long, one of the largest [[apex predator]]s in the reef [[ecosystem]]. Like the whitetip reef shark, they have been documented resting motionless on the sea bottom or inside caves, unusual behaviour for requiem sharks. Caribbean reef shark play a major role in shaping Caribbean reef communities. They are more active at night, with no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or [[fish migration|migration]].

[[File:Hydraulic dynamometer (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Early hydraulic dynamometer, with dead-weight torque measurement]]

A '''dynamometer''' or '''"dyno"''' for short, is a device for measuring [[force]], [[torque]], or [[Power (physics)|power]]. For example, the power produced by an [[Heat engine|engine]], [[Electric motor|motor]] or other rotating [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] can be calculated by simultaneously measuring torque and [[rotational speed]] ([[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]).

In addition to being used to determine the torque or power characteristics of a machine under test, dynamometers are employed in a number of other roles. In standard emissions testing cycles such as those defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], dynamometers are used to provide simulated road loading of either the engine (using an engine dynamometer) or full powertrain (using a chassis dynamometer). In fact, beyond simple power and torque measurements, dynamometers can be used as part of a testbed for a variety of engine development activities, such as the calibration of engine management controllers, detailed investigations into combustion behavior, and [[tribology]].

In the medical terminology, hand-held dynamometers are used for routine screening of grip and [[hand strength]], and the initial and ongoing evaluation of patients with hand trauma or dysfunction. They are also used to measure grip strength in patients where compromise of the cervical nerve roots or peripheral nerves is suspected.

In the [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], [[kinesiology]], and [[ergonomics]] realms, force dynamometers are used for measuring the back, grip, arm, and/or leg strength of athletes, patients, and workers to evaluate physical status, performance, and task demands. Typically the force applied to a lever or through a cable is measured and then converted to a moment of force by multiplying by the perpendicular distance from the force to the axis of the level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/courses/apa4311/dynamometry.pps health.uottawa.ca], Dynamometry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation of torque power (absorbing) dynamometers==
An absorbing dynamometer acts as a load that is driven by the prime mover that is under test (e.g. [[Pelton wheel]]). The dynamometer must be able to operate at any speed and load to any level of torque that the test requires.

Absorbing dynamometers are not to be confused with "inertia" dynamometers, which calculate power solely by measuring power required to accelerate a known mass drive roller and provide no variable load to the prime mover.

An absorption dynamometer is usually equipped with some means of measuring the operating torque and speed.

The power absorption unit (PAU) of a dynamometer absorbs the power developed by the prime mover. This power absorbed by the dynamometer is then converted into heat, which generally dissipates into the ambient air or transfers to cooling water that dissipates into the air. Regenerative dynamometers, in which the prime mover drives a DC motor as a generator to create load, make excess DC power and potentially - using a DC/AC inverter - can feed AC power back into the commercial electrical power grid.

Absorption dynamometers can be equipped with two types of control systems to provide different main test types.

===Constant force===
The dynamometer has a "braking" torque regulator - the power absorption unit is configured to provide a set braking force torque load, while the prime mover is configured to operate at whatever throttle opening, fuel delivery rate, or any other variable it is desired to test. The prime mover is then allowed to accelerate the engine through the desired speed or RPM range. Constant force test routines require the PAU to be set slightly torque deficient as referenced to prime mover output to allow some rate of acceleration. Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant. The constant varies depending on the units used.

===Constant speed===
If the dynamometer has a speed regulator (human or computer), the PAU provides a variable amount of braking force (torque) that is necessary to cause the prime mover to operate at the desired single test speed or RPM. The PAU braking load applied to the prime mover can be manually controlled or determined by a computer. Most systems employ eddy current, oil hydraulic, or DC motor produced loads because of their linear and quick load change abilities.

Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant, with the constant varying with the output unit desired and the input units used.

A ''motoring dynamometer'' acts as a motor that drives the equipment under test. It must be able to drive the equipment at any speed and develop any level of torque that the test requires. In common usage, AC or DC motors are used to drive the equipment or "load" device.

In most dynamometers [[Power (physics)|power]] (''P'') is not measured directly, but must be calculated from torque (''τ'') and angular velocity (''ω''){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} values or force (''F'') and linear velocity (''v''):
:&lt;math&gt;P=\tau\cdot\omega&lt;/math&gt;
:or
:&lt;math&gt;P=F \cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P'' is the power in [[watt]]s
::''τ'' is the torque in [[newton metre]]s
::''ω'' is the angular velocity in [[radian per second|radians per second]]
::''F'' is the force in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s
::''v'' is the linear velocity in [[metre per second|metres per second]]

Division by a conversion constant may be required, depending on the units of measure used.

For imperial units,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{hp}={\tau_\mathrm{lb \cdot ft}\cdot\omega_\mathrm{RPM} \over 5252}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P''&lt;sub&gt;hp&lt;/sub&gt; is the power in [[horsepower]]
::''τ''&lt;sub&gt;lb·ft&lt;/sub&gt; is the torque in [[foot-pound force|pound-feet]]
::''ω''&lt;sub&gt;RPM&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotational velocity in [[revolutions per minute]]

For metric units,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{kW}={\tau_\mathrm{N \cdot m}\cdot\omega_\mathrm{RPM} \over 9549}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P''&lt;sub&gt;kW&lt;/sub&gt; is the power in [[watt|kilowatts]]
::''τ''&lt;sub&gt;N·m&lt;/sub&gt; is the torque in [[newton metre]]s
::''ω''&lt;sub&gt;RPM&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotational velocity in [[revolutions per minute]]

==Detailed dynamometer description==
[[Image:Dynamometer01CJC.svg|thumb|right|Electrical dynamometer setup showing engine, torque measurement arrangement and tachometer]]
A dynamometer consists of an absorption (or absorber/driver) unit, and usually includes a means for measuring torque and rotational speed. An absorption unit consists of some type of rotor in a housing. The rotor is coupled to the engine or other equipment under test and is free to rotate at whatever speed is required for the test. Some means is provided to develop a braking torque between the rotor and housing of the dynamometer. The means for developing torque can be frictional, hydraulic, electromagnetic, or otherwise, according to the type of absorption/driver unit.

One means for measuring torque is to mount the dynamometer housing so that it is free to turn except as restrained by a torque arm. The housing can be made free to rotate by using [[trunnion]]s connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The torque arm is connected to the dyno housing and a [[weighing scale]] is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the torque arm measured from the center of the dynamometer. A [[load cell]] [[transducer]] can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signal]] that is proportional to torque.

Another means to measure torque is to connect the engine to the dynamo through a [[torque sensor|torque sensing]] coupling or torque transducer. A torque transducer provides an electrical signal that is proportional to the torque.

With electrical absorption units, it is possible to determine torque by measuring the current drawn (or generated) by the absorber/driver. This is generally a less accurate method and not much practiced in modern times, but it may be adequate for some purposes.

When torque and speed signals are available, test data can be transmitted to a [[data acquisition]] system rather than being recorded manually. Speed and torque signals can also be recorded by a [[chart recorder]] or [[plotter]].

==Types of dynamometers==
In addition to classification as absorption, motoring, or universal, as described above, dynamometers can also be classified in other ways.

A dyno that is [[coupling|coupled]] directly to an engine is known as an ''engine dyno''.

A dyno that can measure torque and power delivered by the power train of a vehicle directly from the drive wheel or wheels (without removing the engine from the frame of the vehicle), is known as a ''chassis dyno''.

Dynamometers can also be classified by the type of absorption unit or absorber/driver that they use. Some units that are capable of absorption only can be combined with a motor to construct an absorber/driver or "universal" dynamometer.

===Types of absorption units===
* [[eddy current brake|Eddy current]] (absorption only)
* Magnetic powder brake (absorption only)
* [[Hysteresis]] brake (absorption only)
* [[Electric motor]]/[[Electric generator|generator]] (absorb or drive)
* Fan brake (absorption only)
* [[Hydraulic]] brake (absorption only)
* Force lubricated, oil shear friction brake (absorption only)
* [[Water brake]] (absorption only)
* Compound dyno (usually an absorption dyno in tandem with an electric/motoring dyno)

===Eddy current type absorber===
Eddy current (EC) dynamometers are currently the most common absorbers used in modern chassis dynos. The EC absorbers provide a quick load change rate for rapid load settling. Most are air cooled, but some are designed to require external water cooling systems.

Eddy current dynamometers require an electrically conductive core, shaft, or disc moving across a magnetic field to produce resistance to movement. Iron is a common material, but copper, aluminum, and other conductive materials are also usable.

In current (2009) applications, most EC brakes use cast iron discs similar to vehicle disc brake rotors, and use variable electromagnets to change the magnetic field strength to control the amount of braking.

The electromagnet voltage is usually controlled by a computer, using changes in the magnetic field to match the power output being applied.

Sophisticated EC systems allow steady state and controlled acceleration rate operation.

===Powder dynamometer===
A powder dynamometer is similar to an eddy current dynamometer, but a fine magnetic powder is placed in the air gap between the rotor and the coil. The resulting flux lines create "chains" of metal particulate that are constantly built and broken apart during rotation, creating great torque. Powder dynamometers are typically limited to lower RPM due to heat dissipation problems.

===Hysteresis dynamometers===
Hysteresis dynamometers use a magnetic rotor, sometimes of AlNiCo alloy, that is moved through flux lines generated between magnetic pole pieces. The magnetisation of the rotor is thus cycled around its B-H characteristic, dissipating energy proportional to the area between the lines of that graph as it does so.

Unlike eddy current brakes, which develop no torque at standstill, the hysteresis brake develops largely constant torque, proportional to its magnetising current (or magnet strength in the case of permanent magnet units) over its entire speed range&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magtrol.com/manuals/hbmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Units often incorporate ventilation slots, though some have provision for forced air cooling from an external supply.

Hysteresis and Eddy Current dynamometers are two of the most useful technologies in small ({{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} and less) dynamometers.

===Electric motor/generator dynamometer===
[[Electric motor]]/[[electric generator|generator]] dynamometers are a specialized type of [[adjustable-speed drive]]. The absorption/driver unit can be either an [[alternating current]] (AC) motor or a [[direct current]] (DC) motor. Either an AC motor or a DC motor can operate as a generator that is driven by the unit under test or a motor that drives the unit under test. When equipped with appropriate control units, electric motor/generator dynamometers can be configured as universal dynamometers. The control unit for an AC motor is a [[variable-frequency drive]], while the control unit for a DC motor is a [[Adjustable-speed drive#DC drives|DC drive]]. In both cases, regenerative control units can transfer power from the unit under test to the electric utility. Where permitted, the operator of the dynamometer can receive payment (or credit) from the utility for the returned power via [[net metering]].

In engine testing, universal dynamometers can not only absorb the power of the engine, but can also drive the engine for measuring friction, pumping losses, and other factors.

Electric motor/generator dynamometers are generally more costly and complex than other types of dynamometers.

===Fan brake===
A fan is used to blow air to provide engine load. The torque absorbed by a fan brake may be adjusted by changing the gearing or the fan itself, or by restricting the airflow through the fan. It should be noted that, due to the low [[viscosity]] of air, this variety of dynamometer is inherently limited in the amount of torque that it can absorb.

===Force lubricated oil shear brake===
An oil shear brake has a series of friction discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs is attached to the load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit.  Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.&lt;ref name=shear&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ien.com/article/slashing-test-time/187285 |title=Slashing Test Time with Oil Shear Brake |work=Industrial Equipment News |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic brake===
The hydraulic brake system consists of a hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.

===Water brake-type absorber===
[[File:Tech-Talk_Animation_on_How_Water-Brakes_Work.webm|thumb|A  4-minute ‘how-it-works video’ tutorial explaining how engine-dynamometer water-brake absorbers work.]]
The [[water brake]] absorber is sometimes mistakenly called a "hydraulic dynamometer". Invented by British engineer [[William Froude]] in 1877 in response to a request by the [[Admiralty]] to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} About Us|publisher=Froude Hoffmann|accessdate=9 Jan 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302070601/http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; water brake absorbers are relatively common today. They are noted for their high power capability, small size, light weight, and relatively low manufacturing costs as compared to other, quicker reacting, "power absorber" types.

Their drawbacks are that they can take a relatively long period of time to "stabilize" their load amount, and that they require a constant supply of water to the "water brake housing" for cooling. In many parts of the country,{{Where|date=July 2011}} environmental regulations now prohibit "flow through" water, and so large water tanks must be installed to prevent contaminated water from entering the environment.

The schematic shows the most common type of water brake, known as the "variable level" type. Water is added until the engine is held at a steady RPM against the load, with the water then kept at that level and replaced by constant draining and refilling (which is needed to carry away the heat created by absorbing the horsepower). The housing attempts to rotate in response to the torque produced, but is restrained by the scale or torque metering cell that measures the torque.
[[Image:Dyno schematic.svg|frame|center|This schematic shows a water brake, which is actually a fluid coupling with a housing restrained from rotating&amp;mdash;similar to a water pump with no outlet.]]

===Compound dynamometers===
In most cases, motoring dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300&amp;nbsp;kW AC dynamometer can absorb 300&amp;nbsp;kW as well as motor at 300&amp;nbsp;kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor may be used in a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common emission test cycles and most engine development is approximately 3:1. Torque measurement is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of torque measurement in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.

==How dynamometers are used for engine testing==
Dynamometers are useful in the development and refinement of modern engine technology. The concept is to use a dyno to measure and compare power transfer at different points on a vehicle, thus allowing the engine or drivetrain to be modified to get more efficient power transfer. For example, if an engine dyno shows that a particular engine achieves {{convert|400|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}} of torque, and a chassis dynamo shows only {{convert|350|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}}, one would know that the drivetrain losses are nominal. Dynamometers are typically very expensive pieces of equipment, and so are normally used only in certain fields that rely on them for a particular purpose.

==Types of dynamometer systems==
[[Image:boxsterdyno.png|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 1]]
[[Image:dynograph96.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 2]]

A 'brake' dynamometer applies variable load on the prime mover (PM) and measures the PM's ability to move or hold the RPM as related to the "braking force" applied. It is usually connected to a [[computer]] that records applied braking torque and calculates engine power output based on information from a "load cell" or "strain gauge" and a speed sensor.

An 'inertia' dynamometer provides a fixed inertial mass load, calculates the power required to accelerate that fixed and known mass, and uses a computer to record RPM and acceleration rate to calculate torque. The engine is generally tested from somewhat above idle to its maximum RPM and the output is measured and plotted on a [[Graph of a function|graph]].

A 'motoring' dynamometer provides the features of a brake dyno system, but in addition, can "power" (usually with an AC or DC motor) the PM and allow testing of very small power outputs (for example, duplicating speeds and loads that are experienced when operating a vehicle traveling downhill or during on/off throttle operations).

==Types of dynamometer test procedures==
There are essentially 3 types of dynamometer test procedures:

# Steady state: where the engine is held at a specified RPM (or series of usually sequential RPMs) for a desired amount of time by the variable brake loading as provided by the PAU (power absorber unit). These are performed with brake dynamometers.
# Sweep test: the engine is tested under a load (i.e. inertia or brake loading), but allowed to "sweep" up in RPM, in a continuous fashion, from a specified lower "starting" RPM to a specified "end" RPM. These tests can be done with inertia or brake dynamometers.
# Transient test: usually done with AC or DC dynamometers, the engine power and speed are varied throughout the test cycle. Different test cycles are used in different jurisdictions. Chassis test cycles include the US light-duty UDDS, HWFET, US06, SC03, ECE, EUDC, and CD34, while engine test cycles include ETC, HDDTC, HDGTC, WHTC, WHSC, and ED12.

===Types of sweep tests===
#'''Inertia sweep''': an inertia dyno system provides a fixed inertial mass flywheel and computes the power required to accelerate the flywheel (the load) from the starting to the ending RPM. The actual rotational mass of the engine (or engine and vehicle in the case of a chassis dyno) is not known, and the variability of even the mass of the tires will skew the power results. The inertia value of the flywheel is "fixed", so low-power engines are under load for a much longer time and internal engine temperatures are usually too high by the end of the test, skewing optimal "dyno" tuning settings away from the optimal tuning settings of the outside world. Conversely, high powered engines commonly complete a "4th gear sweep" test in less than 10 seconds, which is not a reliable load condition{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as compared to operation in the real world. By not providing enough time under load, internal combustion chamber temperatures are unrealistically low and power readings - especially past the power peak - are skewed to the low side.
#'''Loaded sweep''', of the brake dyno type, includes:
## '''Simple fixed load sweep''': a fixed load - of somewhat less than the output of the engine - is applied during the test. The engine is allowed to accelerate from its starting RPM to its ending RPM, varying at its own acceleration rate, depending on power output at any particular rotational speed. Power is calculated using (rotational speed x torque x constant) + the power required to accelerate the dyno and engine's/vehicle's rotating mass.
## '''Controlled acceleration sweep''': similar in basic usage as the (above) simple fixed load sweep test, but with the addition of active load control that targets a specific rate of acceleration. Commonly, 20fps/ps is used.{{By whom|date=June 2011}}
#'''Controlled acceleration rate''': the acceleration rate used is controlled from low power to high power engines, and overextension and contraction of "test duration" is avoided, providing more repeatable tests and tuning results.

In every type of sweep test, there remains the issue of potential power reading error due to the variable engine/dyno/vehicle total rotating mass. Many modern computer-controlled brake dyno systems are capable of deriving that "inertial mass" value, so as to eliminate this error.{{Or|date=June 2011}}

A "sweep test" will almost always be suspect, as many "sweep" users ignore the rotating mass factor, preferring to use a blanket "factor" on every test on every engine or vehicle. Simple inertia dyno systems aren't capable of deriving "inertial mass", and thus are forced to use the same (assumed) inertial mass on every vehicle tested.

Using steady state testing eliminates the rotating inertial mass error of a sweep test, as there is no acceleration during this type of test.

===Transient test characteristics===
Aggressive throttle movements, engine speed changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual purpose of these tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain a significant amount of motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different emissions test results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.

===Engine dynamometer===
[[Image:TitanTestStand Rev2011.jpg|thumb|right|HORIBA engine dynamometer TITAN]]
An [[engine dynamometer]] measures power and torque directly from the engine's [[crankshaft]] (or [[flywheel]]), when the engine is removed from the vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the [[gearbox]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[differential (mechanics)|differential]].

===Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)===
{{main|Chassis dynamometer}}
[[Image:chassisdyno.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saab 96]] on chassis dynamometer]]
A [[chassis]] dynamometer, sometimes referred to as a rolling road,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolling Road Dyno|url=http://www.tuningtools.co.uk/rolling-road-dyno-sales.html|work=Tuning Tools|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures power delivered to the surface of the "drive roller" by the drive [[wheel]]s. The vehicle is often parked on the roller or rollers, which the car then turns, and the output measured thereby.

Modern roller-type chassis dyno systems use the "Salvisberg roller",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=10&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=salvisberg&amp;OS=salvisberg&amp;RS=salvisberg|title=United States Patent: D798762 - Watch strap link|author=|date=|website=uspto.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which improves traction and repeatability, as compared to the use of smooth or [[Knurling|knurled]] drive rollers. Chassis dynamometers can be fixed or portable, and can do much more than display RPM, horsepower, and torque. With modern electronics and quick reacting, low inertia dyno systems, it is now possible to tune to best power and the smoothest runs in real time.

Other types of chassis dynamometers are available that eliminate the potential for wheel slippage on old style drive rollers, attaching directly to the vehicle hubs for direct torque measurement from the axle.

[[Motor vehicle emissions]] development and homologation dynamometer test systems often integrate emissions sampling, measurement, engine speed and load control, data acquisition, and safety monitoring into a complete test cell system. These test systems usually include complex emissions sampling equipment (such as constant volume samplers and raw [[exhaust gas]] sample preparation systems) and analyzers. These analyzers are much more sensitive and much faster than a typical portable exhaust gas analyzer. Response times of well under one second are common, and are required by many transient test cycles. In retail settings it is also common to tune the air-fuel ratio using a wideband [[oxygen sensor]] that is graphed along with the RPM.

Integration of the dynamometer control system with automatic calibration tools for engine system calibration is often found in development test cell systems. In these systems, the dynamometer load and engine speed are varied to many engine operating points, while selected engine management parameters are varied and the results recorded automatically. Later analysis of this data may then be used to generate engine calibration data used by the engine management software.

Because of frictional and mechanical losses in the various drivetrain components, the measured rear wheel brake horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer.&lt;ref&gt;John Dinkel, "Chassis Dynamometer", ''Road and Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary'', (Bentley Publishers, 2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Graham-Desaguliers Dynamometer was invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] and mentioned in the writings of [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desagulier]] in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Allen W. and Daryl E. Miller, 1998, Movement Skill Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; Desaguliers modified the first dynamometers, and so the instrument became known as the Graham-Desaguliers dynamometer.

The Regnier dynamometer was invented and made public in 1798 by [[Edmé Régnier L'Aîné|Edmé Régnier]], a French rifle maker and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Régnier, Edmé. Description et usage du dynamomètre, 1798.&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent was issued (dated June 1817)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0YOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA757&amp;dq=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=L-XITq_lLaiB4ASfo5jcAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;f=false|title=The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopædia: Comprehending Practical Illustrations of the Machinery and Processes Employed in Every Description of Manufacuture of the British Empire|first=Luke|last=Hebert|date=7 April 2018|publisher=Kelly|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1EoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dXpBfYJsnJ&amp;sig=1RMSAuTtewKrTUHUSNaa55S_72k&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=bu7IToarB-n04QT1qKgw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;f=false|title=The Monthly Magazine|author=|date=7 April 2018|publisher=R.

[[Gaspard de Prony]] invented the [[de Prony brake]] in 1821.

[[Macneill's road indicator]] was invented by [[John Benjamin Macneill|John Macneill]] in the late 1820s, further developing Marriot's patented weighing machine.

Froude Hofmann, of Worcester, UK, manufactures engine and vehicle dynamometers. They credit [[William Froude]] with the invention of the hydraulic dynamometer in 1877, and say that the first commercial dynamometers were produced in 1881 by their predecessor company, [[Heenan &amp; Froude]].

In 1928, the German company "''[[Carl Schenck]] Eisengießerei &amp; Waagenfabrik''" built the first vehicle dynamometers for brake tests that have the basic design of modern vehicle test stands.

The eddy current dynamometer was invented by Martin and Anthony Winther around 1931, but at that time, DC Motor/generator dynamometers had been in use for many years. A company founded by the Winthers brothers, Dynamatic Corporation, manufactured dynamometers in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] until 2002. Dynamatic was part of [[Eaton Corporation]] from 1946 to 1995. In 2002, Dyne Systems of [[Jackson, Washington County, Wisconsin|Jackson, Wisconsin]] acquired the Dynamatic dynamometer product line. Starting in 1938, Heenan &amp; Froude manufactured eddy current dynamometers for many years under license from Dynamatic and Eaton.&lt;ref name="Winther, Eddy currents" &gt;{{Cite book

'''Electric energy consumption''' is the form of [[energy consumption]] that uses [[electric energy]]. Electric energy consumption is the actual energy demand made on existing electricity supply.

The total electricity consumption in 2012 was 20,900 TWh.

== Overview ==

Electric energy is most often measured either in [[joule|joules]] (J), or in [[watt hour|watt hours]] (W·h) representing a constant [[Power (physics)|power]] over a period of time.

: 1 W·s = 1 J
: 1 W·h = 3600 W·s = 3600 J

Electric and electronic devices consume electric energy to generate desired output (i.e., light, heat, motion, etc.). During operation, some part of the energy—depending on the [[electrical efficiency]]—is consumed in unintended output, such as waste heat.

Electricity has been generated in power stations since 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity Generation|url=http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/electricity-generation|website=Institute for Energy Research|publisher=Institute for Energy Research|accessdate=27 October 2015|language=English|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the steam turbine in 1883 to drive the electric generator started a strong increase of world electricity consumption.

In 2008, the world total of electricity production was 20.279 [[Kilowatt hour#Multiples|petawatt-hours]] (PWh). This number corresponds to an average power of 2.31 TW continuously during the year. The total energy needed to produce this power is roughly a factor 2 to 3 higher because a power plant's efficiency of [[Electricity generation#Production|generating electricity]] is roughly 30–50%. The generated power is thus in the order of 5&amp;nbsp;TW. This is approximately a third of the total energy consumption of 15&amp;nbsp;TW (''see [[world energy consumption]]'').

In 2005, the primary energy used to generate electricity was 41.60 Quadrillion BTU [12, 192 TWh] (Coal 21.01 quads [6,157 TWh], Natural Gas 6.69 quads [1,960 TWh], Petroleum 1.32 quads [387 TWh], Nuclear electric power 8.13 quads [2,383 TWh], Renewable energy 4.23 quads [1,240 TWh] respectively). The gross generation of electricity in that year was 14.50 Quads [4,250 TWh]; the difference, 27.10 Quads [7,942 TWh], was conversion losses. Among all electricity, 4.84 Quads [1,418 TWh] was used in residential area, 4.32 Quads [1,266 TWh] used in commercial, 3.47 Quads [1,017 TWh] used in industrial and 0.03 Quads [8.79 TWh] used in transportation.

'''1 Quad''' = 1 Quadrillion BTU = 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; BTU = '''293 TWh'''

16,816&amp;nbsp;TWh (83%) of electric energy was consumed by final users. The difference of 3,464&amp;nbsp;TWh (17%) was consumed in the process of generating power and lost in transmission to end users.

A sensitivity analysis on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy network model for electric demand estimation shows that employment is the most critical factor influencing electrical consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahedi|first1=Gholamreza|last2=Azizi|first2=Saeed|last3=Bahadori|first3=Alireza|last4=Elkamel|first4=Ali|last5=R.

=== World electricity consumption down in 2009 ===
[[File:Electricity Domestic Consumption.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Electricity Consumption in 2009&lt;br/&gt;Source: Enerdata Statistical Energy Review]]

At the world level, energy consumption was cut down by 1.5% during 2009, for the first time since World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yearbook.enerdata.net/electricity-domestic-consumption-data-by-region.html Enerdata Statistical Review 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
Except in Asia and Middle East, consumptions were reduced in all the world regions. In [[OECD]] countries, accounting for 53% of the total,
electricity demand scaled down by more than 4.5% in both Europe and North America while it shrank by above 7% in Japan. Electricity demand also dropped by more than 4.5% in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, driven by a large cut in Russian consumption. Conversely, in China and India (22% of the world's consumption), electricity consumption continued to rise at a strong pace (+6-7%) to meet energy demand related to high economic growth. In Middle East, growth rate was softened but remained high, just below 4%.

== World electricity consumption (2012) ==

The table lists the top 37 electricity consuming countries, which use 19,000 TWh/a. i.e. 90% of the consumption of all more than 190 countries. The total consumption (including the amount consumed by the power plants) and the energy sources to generate this electricity is given per country. The data are of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/key-world-energy-statistics-2014.html IEA World energy statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/ IEA Statistics search]&lt;/ref&gt; The last column contains the number of millions of inhabitants.

=== Consumption per head ===

Total consumption (2nd column) divided by number of inhabitants (last column) gives a country's consumption per head. In W-Europe this is between 5 and 8 MWh/a. (1 MWh equals 1000 kWh.) In Scandinavia, USA, Canada, Taiwan and South Korea it is much more, in developing countries much less. The worlds average is 3 MWh/a. A very low consumption per head, as in Indonesia, means that many inhabitants are not connected to the electricity grid, and this is the reason that the world's 7th and 8th most populous countries—[[Nigeria]] (177M) and [[Bangladesh]] (156M)—do not appear in the table.

=== 2012–2014 ===
From 2012 to 2014 worldwide electricity consumption increased 5%. Nuclear and fossil generated electricity rose 3%, renewable electricity 12%.

A small part of the renewables, solar and wind electricity, increased much more, 46%&lt;ref&gt;Compare World: [http://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/ IEA Statistics search], World, Electricity and Heat, 2012 and 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the strong growth since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyRenewablesTrends.pdf IEA Key Renewables Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil windpower inceased 140%, in China not only solar and wind increased fast, 81%, but also nuclear, 36%.

== Electricity generation and GDP (2009) ==

Listed countries are top 20 populous countries and/or top 20 [[GDP]] ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) countries and Saudi Arabia as of CIA [[World Factbook]] 2009. &lt;br&gt;
30 countries (exclude EU/[[International Energy Agency|IEA]]) in this table represent 77% of world population, 84% of world GDP, 83% of world electricity generation.&lt;br&gt;
Productivity per Electricity generation (concept similar to [[Energy intensity]]) can be measured by dividing GDP amount by the electricity generated. World average was $3.5 production/kWh.&lt;br&gt;
Electricity generation include Final consumption, in process consumption, and losses.

== Electricity scenarios until 2040 ==

In all scenarios, increasing efficiency will result in less electricity needed for a given demand of power and light. But demand will increase strongly on account of
* growing economy in developing countries and
* electrification of transport and heating. Combustion engines are replaced by electric drive and for heating less gas and oil, but more electricity is used, if possible with [[heat pump]]s.

As transport and heating become more climate-friendly, the environmental effect of energy consumption will be more determined by electricity. This is mainly supplied by burning fossil fuel which disturbs the natural [[carbon cycle]]. The scenarios arrive at very different results for the environment.

The [[International Energy Agency]] expects revision of subsidy for fossil fuel which amounted to 550 billion dollar in 2013, more than four times renewable energy subsidy. In this scenario&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/world-energy-outlook-2014---executive-summary.html IEA World energy outlook]&lt;/ref&gt; almost half of the increase in 2040 of electricity consumption is covered by more than 80% growth of renewable energy. Many new nuclear plants will be constructed, mainly to replace old ones. The nuclear part of electricity generation will increase from 11 to 12%. The renewable part goes up much, from 21 to 33%. The IEA warns that in order to restrict global warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C, the carbon dioxide emission&lt;ref&gt;by fossil fuel&lt;/ref&gt; must not exceed 1000 gigaton (Gt) from 2014. This limit is reached in 2040 and emissions will not drop to zero ever.

The [[World Energy Council]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/2013/world-energy-scenarios-composing-energy-futures-to-2050/ World energy scenarios]&lt;/ref&gt; sees world electricity consumption increasing to more than 40,000 TWh/a in 2040. The fossil part of generation depends on energy policy. It can stay around 70% in the so-called '''Jazz''' scenario where countries rather independently "improvise" but it can also decrease to around 40% in the '''Symphony''' scenario if countries work "orchestrated" for more climate friendly policy. Carbon dioxide emission, 32 Gt/a in 2012, will increase to 46 Gt/a in Jazz but decrease to 26 Gt/a in Symphony. Accordingly, until 2040 the renewable part of generation will stay at about 20% in Jazz but increase to about 45% in Symphony.

'''Elliott Company''' designs, manufactures, installs, and services [[turbo-machinery]] for [[Tractor unit|prime mover]]s and rotating machinery.  Headquartered in [[Jeannette, Pennsylvania]], Elliott Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japan-based company, [[Ebara Group (Japan)|Ebara Corporation]], and is a unit of Elliott Group, Ebara Corporation's worldwide turbomachinery business. Elliott Group employs more than 2000 employees worldwide at 32 locations, with approximately 900 in Jeannette.&lt;ref name="Trib Review"&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleynewsdispatch/s_691012.html Greensburg Tribune Profile of Elliott]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1901 as the Liberty Manufacturing Company to produce boiler cleaning equipment based on the patents of William Swan Elliott, the company incorporated as the Elliott Company in 1910. Elliott Company moved to the former Clifford-Capell Fan Works in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, in 1914 and has maintained a factory and offices there since.&lt;ref name="ElliottWebHistory"&gt;[http://www.elliott-turbo.com/History.asp Elliott Web History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott purchased the Kerr Turbine Company in 1924 and Ridgway Dynamo &amp; Engine Co. in 1926.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt;  These acquisitions allowed Elliott to begin manufacturing turbines and compressors and enter the rotating machinery market.

In the 1930s and during [[World War II]], Elliott supplied the [[United States Navy]] with some of the electric motors and generators used in [[fleet submarine]]s under the name '''Elliott Motor Company'''. Elliott's entry in the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]''&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/abbreviations.htm#Anchor-45546 Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824020721/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/abbreviations.htm |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows its name abbreviated as '''Ell''', and may be the source of a common misspelling of the company's name as ''Elliot''. The Elliott company's broader war contribution included turbines, generators, blowers, ejectors, heaters, and other warship and engine parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageresearch.com/War%20Facilities6.html World War II Industrial Facilities: Authorized Federal Funding States P-T] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118125655/http://www.heritageresearch.com/War%20Facilities6.html |date=January 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Elliott became the first American manufacturer to build a [[turbocharger]] for diesel engines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Elliott would go on to produce more than 40,000 diesel [[turbocharger]]s.

In 1957, the Elliott family sold the company to [[Carrier Corporation]], which, in turn, was sold to [[United Technologies Corporation]] in 1979.

In 1962, Elliott developed their Plant-Air-Package (PAP) line of products&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt; which was sold to Fusheng Group of Taiwan in 2003, and became the FS-Elliott company (Not affiliated with Elliott Company).  [http://www.fs-elliott.com/ FS-Elliott] is headquartered in Export Pa.&lt;ref&gt;FS-Elliott website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Elliott launched the first of 32 Service Centers located throughout the world. In 1987, the management of the Elliott Company returned the firm to independent operation through a [[management buyout]].&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt;

In 2000, Ebara Corporation of [[Tokyo, Japan]], an Elliott licensee, purchased Elliott. Ebara Corporation is a large  manufacturing and environmental services corporation whose shares are traded on the Nikkei Stock Exchange.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt;

In 2010, Elliott had its Centennial Celebration, 100 years in the name of Elliott Company, in Jeannette Pennsylvania. The celebration featured free food, games, and tents featuring Elliott history and memorabilia from personal collectors.

==Products==
Elliott currently designs and builds heavy-duty steam [[turbines]], air and gas [[compressors]], power recovery turbines and power generating equipment.  Elliott products are used in oil and gas fields, [[refineries]], chemical processing plants, [[steel mill]]s, electric generating stations, sugar and paper mills, and various [[mining]] operations.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebProducts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elliott-turbo.com/new/products.html |title=Elliott Company - Products |accessdate=2007-04-03 |date=2008 |work=Company Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319190056/http://www.elliott-turbo.com/new/products.html |archivedate=March 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compressors''': Elliott designs and manufactures multi-stage centrifugal air and gas compressors using EDGE technology.  They currently offer six different compressor types: M-line, MB-line, MBP-line, P-line, PH-line, and A-line.  Each compressor line is engineered to meet varying frame sizes, flow rates, and pressure capacities.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebProducts/&gt;

'''Steam Turbines/Expanders''': Elliott offers single-stage, multi-stage, single-valve, and multi-valve turbines ranging from 10 to {{convert|100000|hp}} and at varying operational speeds. Elliott also develops power recovery expander turbines used to drive compressors and generators in refinery fluid catalytic-cracking services.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebProducts/&gt;

'''Lube Oil Consoles and Dry Gas Seal Packages''': To complement its compressors and turbines, Elliott offers a range of lubrication, seal and piping, and other auxiliary systems. Many consoles are packaged to meet individual customer requirements.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebProducts/&gt;

'''Control Systems''': Elliott Digital Control Systems allow for the remote operation of turbo-machinery.  Some systems use graphical interfaces to make complex monitoring and control easier.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebProducts/&gt;

==Locations==
[[Jeannette, Pennsylvania]] is home to Elliott’s engineering and administration facilities, as well as the company's U.S. manufacturing center. This complex comprises 40 buildings on {{convert|102|acre}}. The production capabilities of this facility were increased by 50% through the company's “Factory 2000” initiative.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt;

'''Outside of the United States''':
Elliott operates sales and service offices in [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America and South America]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]].  Its Asia-Pacific manufacturing facility, owned and operated by the Ebara Corporation, is located in [[Sodegaura, Chiba]], [[Japan]] and serves customers in Asia, [[Australia]], and the Pacific region.&lt;ref name=ElliottWebHistory/&gt;

There is also a Houston, Texas location. (Renowned foreman James Leon Rodgers was based here.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">'''ErP, energy-related products,''' are products that use energy, or that do not use energy but have an indirect impact on energy consumption, such as water using devices, building insulation products, windows, etc. Compared to ErP, energy-using products (EuP) are products which are dependent of energy input (electricity etc.).
All ErP and EuP are subject to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] requirements.

==ErP Directive==
In November 2009, the Eco-Design Directive EuP was replaced with the new energy-related products directive (ErP) 2009/125/EC. The old directive for energy using products only covered products that used energy, such as washing machines or computers. The new ErP-Directive covers products under the old EuP Directive as well as products that are energy-related and do not directly use energy such as water-saving taps and showerheads. With this directive, the [[European Union]] regulator laid the groundwork for specific implementing measures affecting a broad range of EuP and ErP. The goal is the reduction of energy along the [[supply chain]]: from the design stage throughout production, transport, packaging and so on. Products that comply with this directive are easily recognized by carrying the [[CE mark]]ing. In this case, the CE mark covers product [[safety]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://export.gov/europeanunion/energyrelatedproducts/index.asp Eco-design and Energy Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable energy sources ==
Almost half of the [[electricity]] used in the country is provided by renewable energy sources. The main [[renewable resource]] is [[hydroelectric power]]. [[Latvia]] has laws that regulate the building of power plants and plans to sell electricity at higher prices. This is a stimulus for investment, especially taking into consideration the fact that Latvia cannot offer big subsidies in order to attract investment. A production quota is approved for each [[renewable energy]] source every year.&lt;ref&gt;Dvorak, J. (2012). Latvia. Encyclopedia of Energy, Salem Press. Vol 3, pp. 768–770&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business ==
Natural gas companies include [[Latvijas Gāze]].

'''Eurosolar''' is the non-profit European Association for Renewable Energy ({{lang-de|Europäische Vereinigung für Erneuerbare Energien}}) that conducts its work independently of [[Political party|political parties]], [[institution]]s, [[commercial enterprise]]s, and [[interest group]]s. Eurosolar develops and encourages political and economic [[action plan]]s and concepts for the introduction of [[renewable energy]]. The association has offices in 14 countries that include Austria, Italy, Turkey, and Ukraine. Eurosolar has approximately 2,500 members, close to 400 legal groups, {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and owns the ''Solar Age'' magazine, released on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurosolar.de/de/images/stories/pdf/media-daten-2010.pdf |title=Solar Age Media Information |date=30 July 2010 |work=Solar Age |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A history of the association is available.&lt;ref name="samuel-2013"&gt;

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

== Previous research experience ==
Fahy has over thirty years of experience in the field of [[cryopreservation]]. As a scientist with the [[American Red Cross]], he was the originator of the first practical method of cryopreservation by vitrification and the inventor of [[computer]]-based systems to apply this technology to whole [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Before joining Twenty-First Century Medicine, he was the chief scientist for Organ, Inc and of LRT, Inc. He was also Head of the Tissue Cryopreservation Section of the [[Blood transfusion|Transfusion]] and Cryopreservation Research Program of the [[National Naval Medical Center|U.S. Naval Medical Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] where he spearheaded the original concept of ice blocking agents.  In 2014, he was named a Fellow of the Society for Cryobiology in recognition of the impact of his work in low temperature biology.

== Education ==
A native of [[California]], Fahy holds a Bachelor of Science degree in [[Biology]] from the [[University of California, Irvine]] and a Ph.D. in [[pharmacology]] from the [[Medical College of Georgia|Medical College of Georgia in Augusta]].

He currently serves on the board of directors of two organizations and as a referee for numerous scientific journals and funding agencies, and holds 35 patents on cryopreservation methods, aging interventions,  transplantation, and other topics.

== Awards==
Greg Fahy was named as a Fellow of the Society for Cryobiology in 2014, and in 2010 he received the Distinguished Scientist Award for Reproductive Biology from the Reproductive Biology Professional Group of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.  More recently, he received the Cryopreservation Award from the International Longevity and Cryopreservation Summit held in Madrid, Spain in 2017 in recognition of his career in and dedication to the field of [[cryobiology]].  Dr. Fahy also received the Grand Prize for Medicine from INPEX in 1995 for his invention of computerized organ cryoprotectant perfusion technology.  In 2005, he was recognized as a Fellow of the American Aging Association.

'''Gérard Magnin''' (born 1951) was Executive Director of [[Energy Cities]] between 1994 and 2014, after having been the original founder of this European network that brings together about 1000 local authorities from 30 European countries. He has been Regional Director for the French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) in [[Franche-Comté]] region (FR) for ten years. Initially trained in electrical engineering, followed by economics and politics, he taught economic and social sciences for eight years.

A supporter of social innovation, he strives to integrate the energy and climate issue into the concerns of all of society’s stakeholders, especially those of local authorities. He regularly highlights the fact that the major innovations came from the field and that the networking of experiments and those responsible for them is a powerful factor for change. He continues to persuade national and European levels to acknowledge the fact that none of the EU objectives can be achieved without heavy involvement on behalf of the local authorities.

He was placed as a director on the board of [[Électricité de France|EDF]] under request of the French government, but resigned in 2016 prior to a vote that supported [[Hinkley Point C]] nuclear reactor which he called 'very risky'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heat wave''' is a  period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high [[humidity]], especially in [[oceanic climate]] countries.  While definitions vary,&lt;ref name=pmid15310900&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1098704 |pmid=15310900 |title=More Intense, More Frequent, and Longer Lasting Heat Waves in the 21st Century |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5686 |pages=994–7 |year=2004 |last1=Meehl |first1=G. A }}&lt;/ref&gt; a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual weather in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season. Temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be termed a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal [[climate]] pattern for that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040&lt;0762:OTDOAH&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2001 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=762–775 |title=On the Definition of a Heat Wave |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |last1=Robinson |first1=Peter J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot which may occur only once a century. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths from [[hyperthermia]], and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning. A heat wave is considered [[extreme weather]], and a danger because heat and sunlight may overheat the human body.  Heat waves can usually be detected using [[forecasting]] instruments so that a [[Alarm device|warning call]] can be issued.

== Definitions ==
A definition based on Frich et al.'s Heat Wave Duration Index is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by {{convert|5|C-change|0|lk=on}}, the normal period being 1961–1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frich |first= A. |author2=L.V. Alexander |author3=P. Della-Marta |author4=B. Gleason |author5=M. Haylock |author6=A.M.G. Klein Tank |author7=T. Peterson |date=January 2002 |title=Observed coherent changes in climatic extremes during the second half of the twentieth century |journal=Climate Research |volume= 19 |pages=193–212 |url=http://www.vsamp.com/resume/publications/Frich_et_al.pdf |doi=10.3354/cr019193|format=PDF|bibcode=2002ClRes..19..193F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formal, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] definition from the ''Glossary of Meteorology'' is:&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glickman |first=Todd S. |title=Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=June 2000 |location=Boston |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary |isbn=978-1-878220-49-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather.
:: To be a heat wave such a period should last at least one day, but conventionally it lasts from several days to several weeks. In 1900, A. T. Burrows more rigidly defined a “hot wave” as a spell of three or more days on each of which the maximum shade temperature reaches or exceeds {{convert|90|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}. More realistically, the comfort criteria for any one region are dependent upon the normal conditions of that area.

[[Image:Temperature anomalies 2007.gif|thumb|right|Temperature anomalies, March to May 2007]]
In the [[Netherlands]], a heat wave is defined as a period of at least 5 consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in [[De Bilt]] exceeds {{convert|25|°C|°F}}, provided that on at least 3 days in this period the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds {{convert|30|°C|°F}}. This definition of a heat wave is also used in [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]].

In [[Denmark]], a national heat wave (''hedebølge'') is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days of which period the average maximum temperature across more than fifty percent of the country exceeds {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} – the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] further defines a "warmth wave" (''varmebølge'') when the same criteria are met for a {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}} temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark_faar_varme-_og_hedeboelge |title=Danmark får varme- og hedebølge |language=da |publisher=[[Danish Meteorological Institute]] |work=dmi.dk |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723170544/http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark_faar_varme-_og_hedeboelge |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Sweden]], a heat wave is defined as at least 5 days in a row with a daily high exceeding {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/klimat/varmebolja-1.22372 |title=Värmebölja &amp;#124; Klimat &amp;#124; Kunskapsbanken &amp;#124; SMHI |language=sv |publisher=Smhi.se |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], definitions also vary by region; however, a heat wave is usually defined as a period of at least two or more days of excessively hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=heat+wave |title=Glossary - NOAA's National Weather Service |publisher=Weather.gov |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], a heat wave is typically defined as three consecutive days where the temperature reaches or exceeds {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}}, but not always as this ties in with humidity levels to determine a heat index threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Stephen|title=Half the country wilts under unrelenting heat|url=http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_hot_weather|publisher=Yahoo!|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716024044/http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_hot_weather|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same does not apply to drier climates. A heat storm is a Californian term for an extended heat wave. Heat storms occur when the temperature reaches {{convert|100|°F|°C|1}} for three or more consecutive days over a wide area (tens of thousands of square miles). The [[National Weather Service]] issues [[heat advisory|heat advisories]] and [[excessive heat warning]]s when unusual periods of hot weather are expected.

In [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], a heat wave is defined as five consecutive days at or above {{convert|35|°C|°F}}, or three consecutive days at or over {{convert|40|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/sa/20100115_First_Heatwave_SA_Jan.shtml |title=Extreme Heat Services for South Australia |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Bureau of Meteorology defines a heat wave as "three days or more of maximum and minimum temperatures that are unusual for the location".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australia Weather and Warnings|url = http://www.bom.gov.au/weather-services/about/heatwave-forecast.shtml|website = www.bom.gov.au|access-date = 2016-01-17|language = en |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the introduction of this new Pilot Heatwave Forecast there was no national definition that described heatwave or measures of heatwave severity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Met Office]] operates a Heat Health Watch system which places each Local Authority region into one of four levels. Heatwave conditions are defined by the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rising above the threshold for a particular region. The length of time spent above that threshold determines the particular level. Level 1 is normal summer conditions. Level 2 is reached when there is a 60% or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night. Level 3 is triggered when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night, and there is a 90% or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day. Level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels.  Each of the first three levels is associated with a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services, and Level 4 is associated with more widespread response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/heat-health/ |title=Heat-health watch |publisher=Met Office |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more general indicator that allows comparing heat waves in different regions of the World, characterized by different climates, has been recently developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124003 |title=Top ten European heatwaves since 1950 and their occurrence in the coming decades |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=124003 |year=2015 |last1=Russo |first1=Simone |last2=Sillmann |first2=Jana |last3=Fischer |first3=Erich M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used to estimate heat waves occurrence at the global scale from 1901 to 2010, finding a substantial and sharp increase in the amount of affected areas in the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.008 |pmid=27418520 |title=Global assessment of heat wave magnitudes from 1901 to 2010 and implications for the river discharge of the Alps |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=571 |pages=1330–9 |year=2016 |last1=Zampieri |first1=Matteo |last2=Russo |first2=Simone |last3=Di Sabatino |first3=Silvana |last4=Michetti |first4=Melania |last5=Scoccimarro |first5=Enrico |last6=Gualdi |first6=Silvio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
[[File:Heat Wave.jpg|thumb|High pressure in the upper atmosphere traps heat near the ground, forming a heat wave]]Heat waves form when high pressure aloft (from {{convert|10000|-|25000|ft|m|abbr=off}}) strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks. This is common in summer (in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres) as the jet stream 'follows the sun'. On the equator side of the jet stream, in the upper layers of the atmosphere, is the high pressure area.

Summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter. As a result, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface, warming and drying adiabatically. This warmer sinking air creates a high level inversion that acts as a dome capping the atmosphere, inhibiting convection, thereby trapping high humidity warm air below it.  Typically, convection is present along the periphery of the cap where the pressure becomes less.  This peripheral convection, however, can add to the high pressure dome by ventilating the upper level outflow of the thunderstorms into it.  The end result is a continual build-up of heat at the surface that people experience as a heat wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heat Index |publisher=US National Weather Service |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/hi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern United States a heat wave can occur when a high pressure system originating in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] becomes stationary just off the Atlantic Seaboard (typically known as a [[Bermuda High]]). Hot humid air masses form over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea while hot dry air masses form over the desert Southwest and northern Mexico. The SW winds on the back side of the High continue to pump hot, humid Gulf air northeastward resulting in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the Eastern States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Index |publisher=Pasquotank County, NC, U. S. Website |url=http://www.co.pasquotank.nc.us/departments/911/webpage/heatwaves.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318154040/http://www.co.pasquotank.nc.us/departments/911/webpage/heatwaves.htm |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western Cape]] Province of [[South Africa]], a heat wave can occur when a low pressure offshore and high pressure inland combine to form a [[Bergwind]]. The air warms as it descends from the Karoo interior, and the temperature will rise about 10&amp;nbsp;°C from the interior to the coast. Humidities are usually very low, and the temperatures can be over 40&amp;nbsp;°C in summer. The highest official temperatures recorded in South Africa (51.5&amp;nbsp;°C) was recorded one summer during a bergwind occurring along the Eastern Cape coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bergwind Info |publisher=1stweather.com |url=http://www.1stweather.com/regional/education/bergwind.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415080019/http://www.1stweather.com/regional/education/bergwind.shtml |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Hazards - Heat Wave|publisher=City of Cape Town, South Africa Website|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/DRM/Pages/HeatWave.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608111607/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/DRM/Pages/HeatWave.aspx|archivedate=8 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] boosts the probability of [[extreme weather]] events, like heat waves, far more than it boosts more moderate events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Has global warming brought an early summer to the US?  |journal=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21636-has-global-warming-brought-an-early-summer-to-the-us.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/science/earth/global-warming-makes-heat-waves-more-likely-study-finds.html ''Global Warming Makes Heat Waves More Likely, Study Finds''] 10 July 2012 [[NYT]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205276109 |pmid=22869707 |pmc=3443154 |title=Perception of climate change |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=109 |issue=37 |pages=E2415–23 |year=2012 |last1=Hansen |first1=J |last2=Sato |first2=M |last3=Ruedy |first3=R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
{{HeatTable}}
The ''[[heat index]]'' (as shown in the table above) is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature.
[[Hyperthermia]], also known as heat stroke, becomes commonplace during periods of sustained high temperature and humidity. Sweating is absent from 84–100%{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} of those affected. Older adults, very young children, and those who are sick or overweight are at a higher risk for heat-related illness. The chronically ill and elderly are often taking prescription medications (e.g., [[diuretic]]s, [[anticholinergic]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, and [[antihypertensive]]s) that interfere with the body's ability to dissipate heat.&lt;ref name=fema&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Heat |work=FEMA:Are You Ready? |url=http://www.fema.gov/areyouready/heat.shtm |accessdate=27 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805063519/http://www.fema.gov/areyouready/heat.shtm |archivedate=5 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat [[edema]] presents as a transient swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles and is generally secondary to increased [[aldosterone]] [[secretion]], which enhances water retention. When combined with peripheral vasodilation and [[vein|venous stasis]], the excess fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the extremities. The heat edema usually resolves within several days after the patient becomes acclimated to the warmer environment. No treatment is required, although wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema.

[[miliaria|Heat rash]], also known as prickly heat, is a [[maculopapular rash]] accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts. The sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture, producing small pruritic vesicles on an [[erythema]]tous base. Heat rash affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing. If this continues for a duration of time it can lead to the development of chronic [[dermatitis]] or a secondary [[bacteria]]l infection. Prevention is the best therapy. It is also advised to wear loose-fitting clothing in the heat. However, once heat rash has developed, the initial treatment involves the application of [[chlorhexidine]] lotion to remove any [[desquamation|desquamated]] skin. The associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines. If infection occurs a regimen of [[antibiotic]]s is required.

Heat cramps tend to occur after intense exertion. They usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non-electrolyte containing water. This is believed to lead to [[hyponatremia]] that induces cramping in stressed muscles. [[Fluid replacement|Rehydration]] with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief. Patients with mild cramps can be given oral .2% salt solutions, while those with severe cramps require [[intravenous therapy|IV]] [[isotonicity|isotonic]] fluids. The many [[sport drink]]s on the market are a good source of [[electrolyte]]s and are readily accessible.

[[Heat syncope]] is related to heat exposure that produces [[orthostatic hypotension]]. This hypotension can precipitate a near-syncopal episode. Heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating, which leads to [[dehydration]], followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced venous blood return in the face of decreased vasomotor control. Management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using [[oral rehydration therapy]] (sport drinks) or isotonic IV fluids. People who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time. They should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms. Wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee-bending movements can help promote venous blood return.

Heat exhaustion is considered by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke ([[hyperthermia]]). It may even resemble heat stroke, with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact. Heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Symptoms may include [[diarrhea]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[tachycardia]], [[malaise]], and [[myalgia]]. Definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids. Most patients will require fluid replacement with IV isotonic fluids at first. The salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known. After discharge from the hospital, patients are instructed to rest, drink plenty of fluids for 2–3 hours, and avoid the heat for several days. If this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke.

One public health measure taken during heat waves is the setting-up of air-conditioned public cooling centers.

=== Mortality ===
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2015}}
Heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in the United States. Between 1992 and 2001, deaths from excessive heat in the United States numbered 2,190, compared with 880 deaths from floods and 150 from [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hot Weather Tips and the Chicago Heat Plan |work=About.com |url=http://chicago.about.com/library/blank/bl_hot_weather_tips.htm |accessdate=27 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average annual number of fatalities directly attributed to heat in the United States is about 400.&lt;ref name="heat epidemiology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basu |first=Rupa |author2=Jonathan M. Samet |title=Relation between Elevated Ambient Temperature and Mortality: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence |journal=[[Epidemiologic Reviews]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=190–202 |year=2002 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/extract/24/2/190 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxf007 |pmid=12762092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1995 Chicago heat wave]], one of the worst in US history, led to approximately 739 heat-related deaths over a period of five days.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/129/3/173 Near-Fatal Heat Stroke during the 1995 Heat Wave in Chicago]''. ''Annals of Internal Medicine'' Vol. 129 Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Klinenberg has noted that in the United States, the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including [[lightning]], [[rainstorm|rain]], [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, and [[tornado]]es.&lt;ref name="Klinenberg"&gt;{{cite book | last = Klinenberg | first = Eric | title = Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago | url = http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/443213in.html | year = 2002 | publisher = Chicago University Press | location = Chicago, IL | isbn = 978-0-226-44321-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;''[http://slate.com/id/2068612/ Dead Heat: Why don't Americans sweat over heat-wave deaths?]'' By Eric Klinenberg. Slate.com. Posted Tuesday, 30 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the dangers, Scott Sheridan, professor of geography at Kent State University, found that less than half of people 65 and older abide by heat-emergency recommendations like drinking lots of water. In his study of heat-wave behavior, focusing particularly on seniors in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Toronto, and Dayton, Ohio, he found that people over 65 "don't consider themselves seniors." One of his older respondents said: "Heat doesn't bother me much, but I worry about my neighbors."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229102,00.html Floods, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Wildfires, Earthquakes... Why We Don't Prepare]'' By Amanda Ripley. Time. 28 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Agency for Health care Research and Quality, about 6,200 Americans are hospitalized each summer due to excessive heat, and those at highest risk are poor, uninsured or elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542519/ Most People Struck Down by Summer Heat Are Poor] Newswise, Retrieved on 9 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 70,000 Europeans died as a result of the [[2003 European heat wave]].&lt;ref name=pmid18241810&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2007.12.001 |pmid=18241810 |title=Death toll exceeded 70,000 in Europe during the summer of 2003 |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=331 |issue=2 |pages=171–8 |year=2008 |last1=Robine |first1=Jean-Marie |last2=Cheung |first2=Siu Lan K |last3=Le Roy |first3=Sophie |last4=Van Oyen |first4=Herman |last5=Griffiths |first5=Clare |last6=Michel |first6=Jean-Pierre |last7=Herrmann |first7=François Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern is now focusing on predicting the future likelihood of heat waves and their severity. In addition, because in most of the world most of those suffering the impacts of a heat wave will be inside a building, and this will modify the temperatures they are exposed to, there is the need to link climate models to building models. This means producing example time series of future weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eames |first=M. |last2=Kershaw |first2=T. J. |last3=Coley |first3=D. |date=2012 |title=A comparison of future weather created from morphed observed weather and created by a weather generator |journal=Building and Environment |volume=56 |issue= |pages=252–264 |doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.03.006 |url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/29652/1/Coley_Building%2DEnvironment_2012_56_252.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0143624410379934 |title=On the creation of future probabilistic design weather years from UKCP09 |journal=Building Services Engineering Research and Technology |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=127–142 |year=2010 |last1=Eames |first1=M |last2=Kershaw |first2=T |last3=Coley |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work has shown that future mortality due to heat waves could be reduced if buildings were better designed to modify the internal climate, or the occupants better educated about the issues, so they took action in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coley | first1 = D. | last2 = Kershaw | first2 = T.

; Underreporting and "Harvesting" effect
The number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to lack of reports and misreports.&lt;ref name="heat epidemiology"/&gt;  Part of the mortality observed during a heat wave, however, can be attributed to a so-called "[[Mortality displacement|harvesting effect]]", a term for a ''short-term forward mortality displacement''. It has been observed that for some heat waves, there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave. Such compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that heat affects especially those so ill that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref name=pmid11401757&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3454704 |pmid=11401757 |jstor=3454704 |title=The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=463 |year=2001 |last1=Huynen |first1=Maud M. T. E |last2=Martens |first2=Pim |last3=Schram |first3=Dieneke |last4=Weijenberg |first4=Matty P |last5=Kunst |first5=Anton E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk. As shown by the deadly [[2003 European heat wave#France|French heat wave]] in 2003, heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poumadère | first1 = M. | last2 = Mays | first2 = C. | last3 = Le Mer | first3 = S. | last4 = Blong | first4 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The 2003 Heat Wave in France: Dangerous Climate Change Here and Now | url = http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/majorhazards/activites/murcia_26-27oct2009/heatwave2003_poumadere2005.pdf| journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 1483–1494 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00694.x | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and sociological effects ===
In addition to physical [[stress (biology)|stress]], excessive heat causes psychological stress, to a degree which affects performance, and is also associated with an increase in violent crime.&lt;ref name="heat and stress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simister |first=John |author2=Cary Cooper |title=Thermal stress in the U.S.A.: effects on violence and on employee behaviour |journal=[[Stress and Health]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1002/smi.1029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level. In every society, [[crime]] rates go up when temperatures go up, particularly violent crimes such as assault, murder, and rape. Furthermore, in politically unstable countries, high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hsiang |first1=Solomon |last2=Burke |first2=Marshall |last3=Miguel |first3=Edward |title=Climate and Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Economics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=577–617 |year=2015 |doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, high temperatures have a significant effect on income. A study of [[counties in the United States]] found that economic [[productivity]] of individual days declines by about 1.7% for each degree Celsius above {{convert|15|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=Hsiang |last2=Tatyana |first2=Deryugina |title=Does the Environment Still Matter? Daily Temperature and Income in the United States |work=NBER Working Paper No. 20750 |date=December 2014 |doi=10.3386/w20750 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power outages ===
Abnormally hot temperatures cause electricity demand to increase during the peak summertime hours of 4 to 7 p.m. when air conditioners are straining to overcome the heat. If a hot spell extends to three days or more, however, nighttime temperatures do not cool down, and the thermal mass in homes and buildings retains the heat from previous days. This heat build-up causes air conditioners to turn on earlier and to stay on later in the day. As a result, available electricity supplies are challenged during a higher, wider, peak electricity consumption period.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use, which can create power outages, exacerbating the problem. During the [[2006 North American heat wave]], thousands of homes and businesses went without power, especially in California. In Los Angeles, electrical [[transformer]]s failed, leaving thousands without power for as long as five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Doan |first=Lynn |author2=Covarrubias, Amanda |title=Heat Eases, but Thousands of Southern Californians Still Lack Power |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=27 July 2006 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-heat27jul27,1,4111447.story |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|2009 South Eastern Australia Heat Wave]] caused the city of [[Melbourne, Australia]] to experience some major power disruptions which left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid.

=== Wildfires ===
If a heat wave occurs during a drought, which dries out vegetation, it can contribute to bushfires and wildfires. During the disastrous heat wave that [[European heat wave of 2003|struck Europe in 2003]], fires raged through Portugal, destroying over {{convert|3010|km2|sqmi}} or {{convert|301000|ha|acre}} of forest and {{convert|440|km2|sqmi}} or {{convert|44000|ha|acre}} of agricultural land and causing an estimated [[euro|€]]1&amp;nbsp;billion worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bell |first=M. |author2=A. Giannini |author3=E. Grover |author4=M. Hopp |author5=B. Lyon |author6=A. Seth  |title=Climate Impacts |work=IRI Climate Digest |publisher=[[The Earth Institute]] |date=September 2003 |url=http://iri.columbia.edu/climate/cid/Sep2003/impacts.html |accessdate=28 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High end [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]s have irrigation systems to back up [[crop]]s with.

=== Physical damage ===
Heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23315384 BBC News - Who, what, why: When does tarmac melt?]&lt;/ref&gt; water lines to burst, and power transformers to detonate, causing fires. See the [[2006 North American heat wave]] article about heat waves causing physical damage.

Heat waves can also damage rail roads, such as buckling and kinking rails, which can lead to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains. Sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or fish plate rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink. Sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like Southern USA, parts of Canada, the Middle East, etc.

In the [[2013 heatwave in England]], [[gritter]]s (normally only seen in snow) were sent out to grit melting tarmac roads.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

'''Henderson Station One (HMP&amp;L One)''' was a [[Fossil fuel power station|coal-fired power station]] owned and operated by the city of [[Henderson, Kentucky]].

Citing rising costs and mounting environmental regulations, Henderson Municipal Power and Light closed its 58-year-old Station One power plant on Water Street by December 31, 2008.&lt;ref name="Stinnet"&gt;Chuck Stinnet, [http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/aug/27/henderson-power-plant-close/ "Henderson power plant to close"] Courier Press, August 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It has since been replaced by Henderson Station Two (HMP&amp;L Two) as a part of [[Sebree Station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2061">'''Heterodiamond''' is a [[superhard material]] containing [[boron]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen]]  ('''BCN'''). It is formed at high temperatures and high pressures, e.g., by application of an explosive [[shock wave]] to a mixture of [[diamond]] and [[cubic boron nitride]] (c-BN). The heterodiamond is a polycrystalline material coagulated with nano-crystallites and the fine powder is tinged with deep bluish black. The heterodiamond has both the high hardness of diamond and the excellent heat resistance of cubic [[boron nitride|BN]]. These characteristic properties are due to the diamond structure combined with the [[Sp3 bond#sp3 hybrids|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] σ-bonds among carbon and the hetero atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Komatsu, T. |author2=Samedima, M. |author3=Awano, T. |author4=Kakadate, Y. |author5=Fujiwara, S. | title = Creation of Superhard B–C–N Heterodiamond Using an Advanced Shock Wave Compression Technology | journal = Journal of Materials Processing Technology | volume = 85 | issue = 1–3 | year = 1999 | pages = 69–73 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-0136(98)00263-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubic BC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N can be synthesized from graphite-like BC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N at pressures above 18 GPa and temperatures higher than 2200 K.

'''Kamptulicon''', whose name was derived from the Greek ''kamptos'' (“flexible”) + ''oulos'' (“thick”),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Floorcloth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a floor covering made from powdered [[Cork (material)|cork]] and [[natural rubber]].

First patented by Elijah Galloway in 1843, kamptulicon was first launched in public at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London, where it caused a sensation. Its promoters compared it to thick, soft leather, and lauded its ease of cleaning, water resistance, warmth, and sound-deadening qualities. Critics, however, pointed out that its grey-brown colour was unattractive. Attempts were made to brighten it up by stencilling patterns on it with oil paint, but these suffered from a lack of durability.

Kamptulicon was manufactured by sprinkling powdered cork on to thin bands of rubber, which was then rolled and rerolled until thoroughly mixed. It was then coated on one or both sides with [[linseed oil]] varnish or oil paint. Powdered [[sulphur]] was also sometimes mixed in, and the material then heated to produce a form of [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] kamptulicon.

As well as a floor covering, kamptulicon was also used as cushions in stamping presses, and as polishing wheels for metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffer|first=Raimund |authorlink= |title=A Practical Treatise on Caoutchouc and Gutta Percha |publisher=H. C. Baird |year=2003 |location=[[Philadelphia]] |pages=121–123 |url=https://archive.org/details/practicaltreatis00hoffrich |doi= |id= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, faced by stiff competition from the manufacturers of [[oilcloth]] coupled with huge increases in the price of natural rubber, kamptulicon production ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Jane |authorlink= |author2=Svendsen, Linda |title=Linoleum |publisher=Gibbs Smith |year=2003 |location= |pages=20–21 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=1-58685-303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kraftwerke Oberhasli AG''''' (KWO) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[energy supply]] company, based in [[Innertkirchen]] and operating several [[hydroelectric]] plants in the [[Oberhasli]] area of the [[Canton of Berne]]. It also operates a number of [[tourist attraction]]s in the same area, mostly with some relationship to its energy supply business. It uses the brands '''Grimselstrom''' and '''Grimselwelt''', the latter specifically for its tourism ventures. Both brands are named after the [[Grimsel Pass]] that forms the upper end of its operating area.&lt;ref name=gsff&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grimselstrom.ch/infos/grimselpower/facts-and-figures/ | title = Grimselstrom - Facts&amp;Figures | publisher = KWO | accessdate = 2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1925, the company had its first  power plant, ''Handeck 1'', online by 1932. Currently, KWO is operating nine plants, fed by the reservoirs of [[Grimselsee]], [[Oberaarsee]], [[Räterichsbodensee]], [[Gelmersee]] and [[Totensee]], with a total of 26 turbines giving a total maximum power output of 1.125 [[Gigawatt]]s. The company produces around 2,350 [[Gigawatt hour]]s of electricity annually, which represents about 7% of the country's total hydroelectric energy production.&lt;ref name=gspp&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grimselstrom.ch/electrical-energy/power-plants-and-dams/power-plants/ | title = Grimselstrom - Power Plants | publisher = KWO | accessdate = 2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gshist&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grimselstrom.ch/infos/grimselpower/history/ | title = Grimselstrom - History | publisher = KWO | accessdate = 2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also owns the [[Meiringen–Innertkirchen railway]], the [[Gelmerbahn|Gelmerbahn funicular]], and the [[Sidelhornbahn]], [[Triftbahn]] and [[Tällibahn]] aerial lifts. All of these were originally built to assist the construction and maintenance of its hydroelectric plants, but now provide transport for local residents and/or tourists. Additionally the Kraftwerke Oberhasli operates and maintains the [[Reichenbachfall Funicular]], although this is owned by the neighbouring [[EWR Energie]] company.&lt;ref name=gwtl&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grimselwelt.ch/grimsel-experience/transport-lifts/ | title = Grimselwelt - Transport Lifts | publisher = KWO | accessdate = 2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bzrf&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/thun/Kraftwerke-uebernehmen-Betrieb-der-ReichenbachfallBahn/story/17504782 | title = Kraftwerke übernehmen Betrieb der Reichenbachfall-Bahn | work = bernerzeitung.ch | publisher = Berner Zeitung | date = 2013-01-16 | accessdate = 2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15845">The '''minimum control speed''' ('''V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;''') of an [[aircraft]] (specifically an [[airplane]]) is a [[V speeds|V-speed]] that specifies the [[calibrated airspeed]] below which [[Stabilizer (aircraft)#Directional stabilization and control|directional]] or [[Ailerons|lateral]] control of the aircraft can no longer be maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt; only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the [[aircraft flight manual]] of all [[Airplane|multi-engine aircraft]]. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's [[vertical tail]] and [[flight control surfaces]], they have to take into account the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.

Minimum control speeds are typically established by [[flight test]]s&lt;ref name="USAFTPS2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a319982.pdf|title=Engine-Out Theory, Chapter 11|last=USAF Test Pilot School, Edwards Air Force Base, CA, USA|year=1992|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETPS2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Flight on Asymmetric Power|last=Empire Test Pilots' School, Boscombe Down, UK.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNTPS2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.usntpsalumni.com/Resources/Documents/USNTPS_FTM_103.pdf|title=Flight Test Manual USNTPS-FTM-No. 103, Fixed Wing Stability And Control, Theory and Flight Test Techniques, Chapter 6 – Asymmetric Power Flying Qualities|last=USNaval Test Pilot School|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an aircraft certification process.&lt;ref name="FAR232"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?gp=&amp;SID=3a49096c5e53bff7eae8902299a5a6aa&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14CIsubchapC.tpl|title=Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)|last=Federal Aviation Administration, USA.|work=Part 23 and Part 25, §&amp;nbsp;149|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easa.europa.eu/agency-measures/certification-specifications.php|title=Certification Specifications (CS)|last=European Aviation Safety Agency|work=CS-23 and CS-25, §&amp;nbsp;149|accessdate=Oct 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide a guide to the pilot in the safe operation of the aircraft.

[[File:Vmc Article Fig 1 - Overview of all Vmc's.png|thumb|Fig. 1. Overview of all existing minimum control speeds V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt; for all multi-engine aircraft types. In this article, V&lt;sub&gt;MC(A)&lt;/sub&gt; is used rather than V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt; for air minimum control speeds.]]Aviation regulations (such as [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]] and [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]])&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt; define several different V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic [[Aircraft flight control system|flight controls]] of the aircraft to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most important minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; is simply listed as V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt; in many aviation regulations and [[aircraft flight manual]]s.&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt; On the [[airspeed indicator]] of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722&amp;nbsp;kg, the V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by [[FAR 23]].&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt; 
Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific minimum control speeds, as V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt; will change depending on the stage of flight. Other defined V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s include minimum control speed on the ground (V&lt;sub&gt;MCG&lt;/sub&gt;) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (V&lt;sub&gt;MCL&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s exist for cases with either one or two engines inoperative on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt; and in military specifications.&lt;ref name=MILSPEC&gt;{{cite book|last=Military Specification MIL-F-8785C, superseded by MIL-STD-1797|title=Flying Qualities of Piloted Airplanes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minimum control speed when airborne ==

[[File:Vmc Article Fig 5 - Graph Vmc and sideslip.png|thumb|The effect of bank angle on V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; and sideslip when the left engine (No. 1) is inoperative and the other is at maximum thrust. The bank angle for zero sideslip is used for sizing the vertical tail and also during flight-testing to determine V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; in-flight.|left]]The [[vertical tail]] or [[Stabilizer (aircraft)#Directional stabilization and control|vertical stabilizer]] of a multi-engine aircraft plays a crucial role in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of [[slipstream]]s. Engineers designing the vertical tail must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum [[Banked turn|bank angle]] of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]].&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt;

V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; is also used to calculate the minimum [[V speeds#Regulatory V-speeds|takeoff safety speed]].&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt; A high V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; therefore results in higher takeoff speeds, and so longer runways are required, which is undesirable for airport operators.

== Factors influencing minimum control speed ==

Any factor that has influence on the balance of forces and on the yawing and rolling moments after engine failure might also affect V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s. When the vertical tail is designed and the V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; is measured, the worst-case scenario for all factors is taken into account. This ensures that the V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;s published in the [[Aircraft flight manual|AFMs]] guaranteed to be safe.

Heavier aircraft are more stable and more resistant to yawing moments, and therefore have lower V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avioconsult.com/downloads/Control%20and%20Performance%20During%20Asymmetrical%20Powered%20Flight.pdf|title=Control and Performance during Asymmetrical Powered Flight|last=Horlings|first=Harry|date=January 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|13}} The [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal_axis|longitudinal]] [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|centre of gravity]] affects the V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder will be able to provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|17
}} The [[Lateral axis|lateral]] centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; will increase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|17
}} The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; will be lower.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|16}} The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, if the [[P-factor]] of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; increases as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|15
}}

== Other minimal control speeds ==

=== Aircraft with more engines ===
Aircraft with four or more engines have not only a V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; (often called V&lt;sub&gt;MCA1&lt;/sub&gt; under these circumstances), where the critical engine alone is inoperative, but also a V&lt;sub&gt;MCA2&lt;/sub&gt; that applies when the engine inboard of the critical engine, on the same wing, is also inoperative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|15}} Civil aviation regulations (FAR, CS and equivalent) no longer require a V&lt;sub&gt;MCA2&lt;/sub&gt; to be determined,&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt;  although it is still required for military aircraft with four or more engines.&lt;ref name="MILSPEC" /&gt; On turbojet and turbofan aircraft, the outboard engines are usually equally critical. Three-engine aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] and [[Trislander|BN-2 Trislander]] do not have a V&lt;sub&gt;MCA2&lt;/sub&gt;; a failed centerline engine has no effect on V&lt;sub&gt;MC&lt;/sub&gt;.

When two opposing engines of aircraft with four or more engines are inoperative, there is no thrust asymmetry, hence there is no rudder requirement for maintaining steady straight flight; V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;s play no role. There may be less power available to maintain flight overall, but the minimum safe control speeds remain the same as they would be for an aircraft being flown at 50% thrust on all four engines.

Failure of a single inboard engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an inboard engine is closer to the aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of yawing moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is maintained at or above the published V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.

=== Ground ===

&lt;!-- The article [[V speeds]] links to this heading --&gt;
If an engine fails during [[taxiing]] or [[takeoff]], the thrust yawing moment will force the aircraft to one side on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated side force is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21
}} The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1&amp;nbsp;m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but without the use of nose wheel steering, is the minimum control speed on the ground (V&lt;sub&gt;MCG&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt;

=== Approach and landing ===&lt;!-- The article [[V speeds]] links to this heading --&gt;
The minimum control speed during approach and [[landing]] (V&lt;sub&gt;MCL&lt;/sub&gt;) is similar to V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt;, but the aircraft configuration is the landing configuration. V&lt;sub&gt;MCL&lt;/sub&gt; is defined for part 25 aircraft only in civil aviation regulations.&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS232"/&gt;  However, when maximum thrust is selected for a [[go-around]], the flaps will be selected up from the landing position, and V&lt;sub&gt;MCL&lt;/sub&gt; no longer applies, but V&lt;sub&gt;MCA&lt;/sub&gt; does.

=== Safe single-engine speed ===

&lt;!-- The article [[V speeds]] links to this heading --&gt;

Due to the inherent risks of operating at or close to VMC&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; with asymmetric thrust, and the desire to simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification V&lt;sub&gt;SSE&lt;/sub&gt; may be defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FAA-P-8740-19-Flying Light  Twins  Safely|page=45|url=http://www.midwestcorporateair.com/Flying%20Light%20Twins%20Safely.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;SSE&lt;/sub&gt; safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine inoperative, established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, one engine inoperative speed.&lt;ref name="FAR232"/&gt; This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FAA P-8740-66 Flying Light Twin Safely|page=6|url=https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/libview_normal.aspx?id=56412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non ideal compressible fluid dynamics''', abbreviated as '''NICFD''', is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]] studying the actual characteristics of dense vapors, supercritical flows and compressible two-phase flows, namely whereby the thermodynamic behavior of the fluid differs considerably from that of a [[perfect gas]]. At high [[reduced pressure]] and [[Reduced temperature|temperature]], close to the [[Saturation vapor curve|saturation curve]] the [[speed of sound]] is largely sensitive to [[density]] variations along [[Isentropic process|isentropes]]. Consequently, the fluid flow departs from the ideality assumption and under particular conditions may even exhibit non classical gas dynamic phenomena, whose nature is governed by the value of the fundamental derivative of gas-dynamics Γ. A non-monotonic [[Mach number]] trend along an expansion is typical for 0 &lt; Γ &lt; 1, while for Γ &lt; 0 values admit the occurrence of inverse gas-dynamics phenomena such as [[rarefaction]] [[shock wave]]s , splitting waves or even composite waves. Inverse gas-dynamics behavior has been theoretically predicted for heavy complex molecules in the vapor region,and a recent study discovered that two-phase rarefaction shock waves are physically realizable close to the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].

==Applications==
Application NICFD flows can be found in numerous fields. Basically, they are encountered in [[Organic Rankine cycle|Organic Rankine Cycle]] (ORC) turbogenerators, refrigerator, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] power system, pharmaceutical processes, transportation of [[fuel]]s at high-speed, and in [[transonic]] and [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[wind tunnel]]s.

It can form partly stable solid [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] with heavy [[alkali metal]]s.  They are more stable than [[nitratoborate]] salts.&lt;ref name="Titova1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Titova|first=K. V.|author2=V. Ya.

Perchloratoborates are analogous to [[perchloratoaluminate]]s ([Al(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).

Another related anion is the chloroperchloratoborate, Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Titova1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Titova|first=K. V.|author2=V. Ya.

Boron perchlorate itself is unstable above −5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Rosolovskii1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosolovskii|first=V. Ya.|author2=V. P. Babaeva|year=1971|title=Some properties of cesium perchloratoborate|journal=Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Division of Chemical Science|volume=20|issue=4|pages=792–794|issn=0568-5230|doi=10.1007/BF00853930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition==
On thermal decomposition the alkali perchloratoborate salts form an alkali perchlorate, and [[boron trioxide]] as a solid residue, and gas containing [[dichlorine heptoxide]], [[chlorine dioxide]], [[chlorine]], and oxygen.

:2&amp;nbsp;M[B(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] → 2&amp;nbsp;MClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + (3&amp;nbsp;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or 6&amp;nbsp;ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|4|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 6&amp;nbsp;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|10|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name="Babaeva1974"/&gt;

When the alkali perchloratoborates first start to decompose at the lower temperatures, the reaction is endothermic, and dichlorine heptoxide is formed. However, if caesium perchloratoborate is heated the decomposition becomes exothermic above 90&amp;nbsp;°C, and at 100&amp;nbsp;°C it explodes exothermically forming chlorine and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1974"/&gt;

==Reactions==
When rubidium perchloratoborate is reacted with extra [[perchloric acid]], it forms RbBO(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;

In water, alkali perchloratoborates decompose exothermically to form [[boric acid]], perchloric acid, and the perchlorate.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;

==Formation==
Nitronium perchloratoborate (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)can be formed by reacting [[nitronium perchlorate]] with [[boron trichloride]] in solution.  Similarly [[ammonium perchlorate]] reacts with BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forming ammonium perchloratoborate.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babaeva|first=V. P.|author2=V. Ya. Rosolovskii|year=1973|title=Alkali metal perchloratoborates|journal=Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Division of Chemical Science|volume=22|issue=3|pages=476–479|issn=0568-5230|doi=10.1007/BF00854006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metal perchloratoborates can also be formed from the metal perchlorate dissolved in anhydrous [[perchloric acid]] reacting with boron trichloride.  Another way is to react a metal [[chloridoborate]] (MBCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with perchloric acid. Chloridoborates can be made from the metal chloride and boron trichloride dissolved in [[nitrosyl chloride]].&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;
Extra Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; drives the reaction forward.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;

:BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → B(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Also formed is BCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and BCl(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] above −78&amp;nbsp;°C to the boron perchlorate and dichloroboron perchlorate.&lt;ref name="Pascal1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pascal|first=Jean-Louis|author2=Frédéric Favier|year=1998|title=Inorganic perchlorato complexes|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews|volume=178-180|pages=865–902|issn=0010-8545|doi=10.1016/S0010-8545(98)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:B(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{chem|ClO|4|−}} → {{chem|B(ClO|4|)|4|−}}

==Properties==
Caesium perchloratoborate is hydroscopic.&lt;ref name="Rosolovskii1971"/&gt;  It has a density of 2.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rosolovskii1971"/&gt;  It has no colour.&lt;ref name="Rosolovskii1971"/&gt;

Infrared absorption bands are observed in caesium perchloratoborate at 640 and 1,087&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rosolovskii1971"/&gt;

Potassium perchloratoborate has density 2.18&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and rubidium perchloratoborate has density 2.32&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;

The three alkali perchloratoborates fume in moist air, are all crystalline and colourless.&lt;ref name="Babaeva1973"/&gt;

'''Pneumobilia''' is the presence of gas in the [[biliary system]]. It is typically detected on a [[Radiography|radiographic imaging]] exam, such as [[ultrasound]], [[Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis|CT]], or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. It is a common finding in patients that have recently undergone biliary surgery or endoscopic biliary procedure.  While the presence of air within biliary system is not harmful, this finding may alternatively suggest a pathological process, such as a [[biliary-enteric anastomosis]], an [[Ascending cholangitis|infection of the biliary system]], an incompetent [[sphincter of Oddi]], or spontaneous biliary-enteric fistula.

==Causes==
In a healthy individual with normal anatomy, there is no air within the biliary tree. When this finding is present, it may be secondary to:
* Recent surgical or endoscopic biliary procedure (e.g. [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]], biliary enteric anastomosis)
* Incompetent [[sphincter of Oddi]] (e.g. passage of large gallstone, scarring related to chronic pancreatitis)

The '''pour point''' of a [[liquid]] is the [[temperature]] below which the liquid loses its flow characteristics. In [[crude oil]] a high pour point is generally associated with a high [[Kerosene|paraffin]] content, typically found in crude deriving from a larger proportion of plant material. That type of crude oil is mainly derived from a [[kerogen]] Type III.

==Measuring the pour point of petroleum products==

=== Manual method ===
ASTM D97, Standard Test Method for Pour Point of Crude Oils. The specimen is cooled inside a cooling bath to allow the formation of [[paraffin wax]] crystals. At about 9&amp;nbsp;°C above the expected pour point, and for every subsequent 3&amp;nbsp;°C, the test jar is removed and tilted to check for surface movement. When the specimen does not flow when tilted, the jar is held horizontally for 5 sec. If it does not flow, 3&amp;nbsp;°C is added to the corresponding temperature and the result is the pour point temperature.

It is also useful to note that failure to flow at the pour point may also be due to the effect of viscosity or the previous thermal history of the specimen. Therefore, the pour point may give a misleading view of the handling properties of the oil. Additional [[viscosity|fluidity]] tests may also be undertaken. An approximate range of pour point can be observed from the specimen's upper and lower pour point.

=== Automatic method ===
ASTM D5949, Standard Test Method for Pour Point of Petroleum Products (Automatic Pressure Pulsing Method) is an alternative to the manual test procedure. It uses automatic apparatus and yields pour point results in a format similar to the manual method (ASTM D97) when reporting at a 3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astm.org/Standards/D5949.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The D5949 test method determines the pour point in a shorter period of time than manual method D97. Less operator time is required to run the test using this automatic method. Additionally, no external chiller bath or refrigeration unit is needed. D5949 is capable of determining pour point within a temperature range of −57&amp;nbsp;°C to +51&amp;nbsp;°C. Results can be reported at 1&amp;nbsp;°C or 3&amp;nbsp;°C testing intervals. This test method has better repeatability and reproducibility than manual method D97.

Under ASTM D5949, the test sample is heated and then cooled by a Peltier device at a rate of 1.5±0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/min. At either 1&amp;nbsp;°C or 3&amp;nbsp;°C intervals, a pressurized pulse of compressed gas is imparted onto the surface of the sample. Multiple optical detectors continuously monitor the sample for movement. The lowest temperature at which movement is detected on the sample surface is determined to be the pour point.

==Measuring the pour point of crude oils==
Two pour points can be derived which can give an approximate temperature window depending on its thermal history. Within this temperature range, the sample may appear liquid or solid. This peculiarity happens because wax crystals form less readily when it has been heated within the past 24 hrs and contributes to the lower pour point.

The upper pour point is measured by pouring the test sample directly into a test jar. The sample is then cooled and inspected for pour point as per the usual pour point method. The method usually gives higher pour point because the thermal history has not been cancelled by a prolonged thermal treatment.

The lower pour point is measured by first pouring the sample into a stainless steel [[pressure vessel]]. The vessel is then screwed tight and heated to above 102&amp;nbsp;°C in an oil bath. After a specified time, the vessel is removed and cooled for a short while. The sample is then poured into a test jar and immediately closed with a cork carrying the [[thermometer]]. The sample is then cooled and then inspected for pour point as per the usual pour point method.

'''Q-pits''' are kiln sites which were dug for the production of [[white coal]] prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]] when white coal was largely superseded by the use of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]].

==Purpose==
The white coal produced in Q-pits was largely used in the smelting of [[lead]] from about 1550 to 1750, when a process was discovered that used coal. The large sections of white coal had previously been mixed with charcoal to give the right temperature, as charcoal alone was too hot and would have [[Volatilisation|volatilised]] the lead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Rackham, Oliver]] (2007). ''The New Naturalist Series. Woodlands''. London : Collins. {{ISBN|978-0-00-720244-7}}.  p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence exists to suggest that some had a secondary use in the charking of coal into coke.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"to chark" is defined as: to reduce by strong heat, as to produce charcoal or coke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Many Q-pits were located in [[deciduous]] woodlands and as such they are an important landscape feature indicating both previous industrial activity and the presence of a [[woodland]] at the site or nearby.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;Muir, Richard (2008). ''Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes.'' Pub. Tempus, Stroud. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4615-8}}. pp. 91 - 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The pits are often found in association with [[saw pit]]s.

==Construction==
The pits were created by removing soil to create a depression about 12-13 feet (4m) in diameter, breached by a 'spout' and thus forming a 'Q' shape. The pits were dug from the end of the [[Middle Ages]] up to around 1760, the start of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Muir1"&gt;Muir, Richard (2008). ''Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes.'' Pub. Tempus, Stroud. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4615-8}}. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potash pit]]s were of a similar shape and size, however they were used to make [[potash]] for use in coursing or degreasing wool and were once found in sheep rearing areas.

==Geographical location==
The pits are a common feature in lead mining districts such as the [[Leadhills]] in Scotland and East Derbyshire.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Due to their small size, they are not likely to be confused with quarries, although bomb craters from [[World War II]] can occasionally lead the landscape historian astray.

In 2007 an isolated example was identified and excavated in [[Westbury-sub-Mendip]] near the lead smelting areas on the [[Mendip Hills]] in Somerset.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Lane, Barry (2008). "A Q-pit on Lodge Hill, Westbury-sub-Mendip, Somerset". [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cbasw/publications/scribd/q-pit.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 200 such pits have been surveyed in [[Ecclesall Woods]], Sheffield.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">A '''quinonoid zwitterion''' is a special type of [[zwitterion]] (or more precisely [[Mesoionic]]) based on [[quinone]] related [[chemical compound]]s. The [[benzene]] derivate 1,3-dihydroxy-4,6-diaminobenzene is easily [[organic oxidation|oxidized]] by air in water or [[methanol]] to the quinonoid. This compound was first prepared in 1883 and the quinonoid structure first proposed in 1956. In 2002 the compound was found to be more stable and to exist as the zwitterion after a [[hydrogen atom|proton]] transfer. Evidence for this structure is based on [[NMR spectroscopy]] and [[x-ray crystallography]]. The positive charge is delocalized between the amino groups over 4 bonds involving 6 [[pi electron]]s. The negative charge is spread likewise between the oxygen atoms.

The '''Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project''' (official name: '''Pearson College - EnCana - Clean Current Tidal Power Demonstration Project at Race Rocks''') was a joint project of the [[Lester B. Pearson College]], [[EnCana Corporation]] and Clean Current Power Systems Incorporated to use [[tidal power]] at [[Race Rocks]] near [[Victoria, British Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. The Race Rocks Tidal Current Generator was installed from July to September 2006 and it was planned to replace two diesel generators at Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. It was the first in-stream tidal current generator in North America.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The water lubricated bearing system did not perform as expected, and the prototype was decommissioned in May 2007, so that the bearing system could be redesigned.&lt;ref name=cleancurrent&gt;

There is a '''renewable energy debate''' about the constraints and opportunities associated with the use of [[renewable energy]].

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as [[wind power]] and [[solar power]], is sometimes criticized for being variable or [[Intermittent power source|intermittent]]. However, the [[International Energy Agency]] has stated that its significance depends on a range of factors, such as the penetration of the renewables concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security] IEA Information Paper, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been "[[not in my back yard]]" (NIMBY) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some [[wind farm]]s, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction.&lt;ref name="Whatever Happened to Wind Energy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080114-wind-energy.html |title=Whatever Happened to Wind Energy? |publisher=LiveScience |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, the Massachusetts [[Cape Wind]] project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive and there are many examples of community wind farm developments. According to a town councillor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the [[Ardrossan Wind Farm]] in Scotland has enhanced the area.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Gourlay |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/windpower.alternativeenergy |title=Wind farms are not only beautiful, they're absolutely necessary |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 January 2012 |date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. [[Climate change]] concerns, coupled with [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]], and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization]].&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme [http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/SEFI_Investment_Report_2007.pdf ''Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325060117/http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/SEFI_Investment_Report_2007.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }} (PDF), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.&lt;ref name=obama&gt;[[Clean Edge]] (2009).

==Definition of renewable energy==
Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[tide]]s, [[Biomass|plant growth]], and [[Geothermal heating|geothermal heat]], as the [[International Energy Agency]] explains:&lt;ref name=iea111&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.}}

Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.&lt;ref name=iea111/&gt;

== Variable renewable energy ==

Variability inherently affects [[solar energy]], as the production of electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of light energy in a given location.  Solar output varies throughout the day, the seasons, with cloud cover and by latitude on the globe. Windblown sand erodes glass in dry climates, protective layers add expenses. These factors are fairly predictable, and some [[solar thermal]] systems make use of molten salt heat storage to produce power when the sun is not shining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-use-solar-energy-at-night/|title=How to Use Solar Energy at Night|first=David|last=Biello|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the [[Intermittent energy source|amount of electricity]] produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics (among other factors). If wind speed is too low (less than about 2.5&amp;nbsp;m/s) then the [[wind turbine]]s will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high (more than about 25&amp;nbsp;m/s) the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage.  While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable.&lt;ref name='IEA2005WindVar'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/Papers/2005/variability.pdf |title=Variability of Wind Power and other Renewables: Management Options and Strategies |accessdate=2008-10-15 |website=IEA |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capacity factor]]s for PV solar are rather poor varying between 10-20% of the rated [[nameplate capacity]]. Onshore wind is better at 20-35% and offshore wind is best at 45%. This means that more total capacity needs to be installed in order to achieve an average output for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energynumbers.info/capacity-factors-at-danish-offshore-wind-farms|title=Capacity factors at Danish offshore wind farms|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity factor relates to statements about capacity increases, generation may have increased by a much smaller figure.

The [[International Energy Agency]] says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt; This issue only applies to certain renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and to a lesser extent [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]]. The significance of this "predictable variability&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/variability-versus-predictability-of-wind-power-production.html&lt;/ref&gt; depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the nature of the energy sources used to balance the intermittentcy, as well as demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable back-up]] or [[Electric power transmission|system modification]].&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt;

In 2011, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the world's leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations, said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |website=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |website=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] says that there is no shortage of renewable energy and a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources can be used to reliably meet electricity demand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | authorlink = Mark Z. Jacobson | last2 = Delucchi | first2 = M.A. | title = A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific American |date=November 2009 | volume = 301 | issue = 5| pages = 58–65 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1109-58 | pmid=19873905| bibcode = 2009SciAm.301e..58J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As physicist [[Amory Lovins]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The variability of sun, wind and so on, turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things. One is to diversify your renewables by technology, so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another. Second, you diversify by site so they're not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they're in the same place. Third, you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind, sun and rain, and of course hydro operators do this right now. Fourth, you integrate all your resources&amp;nbsp;— supply side and demand side..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/570.html |title=Amory Lovins/Rocky Mountain Institute warm to PHEVs |publisher=Calcars.org |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with despatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and [[demand response]] can create a power system that has the potential to meet our needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world:&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids". In Fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the [[International Energy Agency]], has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more.&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name="Lovins11" /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2010, four German states, totalling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43–52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005–2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integration of renewable energy has caused some grid stability problems in Germany. Voltage fluctuations have caused problems with sensitive equipment. In one case, Hydro Aluminium plant in Hamburg was forced to shut down when the rolling mill's highly sensitive monitor stopped production so abruptly that the aluminum belts snagged. They hit the machines and destroyed a piece of the mill. The malfunction was caused when voltage off the electricity grid weakened for a millisecond. A survey of members of the Association of German Industrial Energy Companies (VIK) revealed that the number of short interruptions to the German electricity grid has grown by 29 percent in the years 2009–2012. Over the same time period, the number of service failures has grown 31 percent, and almost half of those failures have led to production stoppages. Damages have ranged between €10,000 and hundreds of thousands of euros, according to company information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/instability-in-power-grid-comes-at-high-cost-for-german-industry-a-850419.html|title=Energy Revolution Hiccups: Grid Instability Has Industry Scrambling for Solutions|journal=Spiegel Online|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minnkota Power Cooperative, the leading U.S. wind utility in 2009, supplied 38% of its retail sales from the wind.&lt;ref name="Lovins11"/&gt;

Mark A. Delucchi and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] report that there are at least seven ways to design and operate variable renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand:&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtII.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System and Transmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]]  |year=2010 |website=Energy policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*(A) interconnect geographically dispersed, naturally variable energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, wave, tidal), which smoothes out electricity supply (and demand) significantly.
*(B) use complementary and non-variable energy sources (such as hydroelectric power) to fill temporary gaps between demand and wind or solar generation.
*(C) use "smart" demand-response management to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available.
*(D) store electric power, at the site of generation, (in batteries, hydrogen gas, molten salts, compressed air, pumped hydroelectric power, and flywheels), for later use.
*(E) over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses.
*(F) store electric power in electric-vehicle batteries, known as "vehicle to grid" or [[V2G]].
*(G) forecast the weather (winds, sunlight, waves, tides and precipitation) to better plan for energy supply needs.&lt;ref name=jacob2010/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jacobson and Delucchi argue that wind, water and solar power can be scaled up in cost-effective ways to meet our energy demands, freeing us from dependence on both fossil fuels and nuclear power.  In 2009 they published "A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet With Renewables" in ''Scientific American''. The article addressed a number of issues, such as the worldwide spatial footprint of wind turbines, the availability of scarce materials needed for manufacture of new systems, the ability to produce reliable energy on demand and the average cost per kilowatt hour. A more detailed and updated technical analysis has been published as a two-part article in the journal ''Energy Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/renewing-support-for-renewables/ |title=Renewing Support for Renewables |author=Nancy Folbre |date=28 March 2011  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy is naturally replenished and renewable power technologies increase energy security for the energy poor locales because they reduce dependence on foreign sources of fuel. Unlike power stations relying on uranium and recycled plutonium for fuel, they are not subject to the volatility of global fuel markets.&lt;ref name=bks/&gt; Renewable power decentralises electricity supply and so minimises the need to produce, transport and store hazardous fuels; reliability of power generation is improved by producing power close to the energy consumer. An accidental or intentional outage affects a smaller amount of capacity than an outage at a larger power station.&lt;ref name=bks&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] in Japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, with climate change is already bringing more weather and climate extremes. These threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy. Shifting to renewable energy "can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts, and ensuring reliable, timely, and cost-efficient delivery of energy". Investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for our energy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/04/yet-another-reason-to-choose-renewable-energy |title=Climate Risk: Yet Another Reason to Choose Renewable Energy |author=Amanda Staudt |date=20 April 2011  |website=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics and viability ==
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|The worldwide growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=Nov 23, 2011  |journal=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen - by 18 percent per MW in the last two years - reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.&lt;ref name=invest2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/renewables-investment-breaks-records |title=Renewables Investment Breaks Records |author= |date=29 August 2011 |website=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the [[Cost of electricity by source|levelised cost of electricity (LCOE)]] is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind and Solar are able to produce electricity for 20-40% of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm] Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2014. Released April, 2014. Report of the [[US Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE).&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas without cheap fossil fuels. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where “oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today”.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; Indicative, levelised, economic costs for renewable power (exclusive of subsidies or policy incentives) are shown in the Table below.

As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; [[Hydroelectricity|Hydropower]] provides 16.3% of the world's electricity. When combined with the other renewables wind, geothermal, solar, biomass and waste: together they make up 21.7% of electricity generation worldwide in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx Historical Data Workbook (2013 calendar year)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseload Electricity===
The "base load" is the minimum level of demand on an electrical grid over a span of time, some variation in demand may be compensated by varying production or electricity trading. The criteria for baseload power generation are low price, availability and reliability. Over the years as technology and available resources evolved, a variety of power sources have been used. Hydroelectricity was the first method and this is still the case in a few wet climates like Brazil, Canada, Norway and Iceland. Coal became the most popular baseload supply with the development of the steam turbine and bulk transport, and this is standard in much of the world. Nuclear power is also used and is in competition with coal, France is predominantly nuclear and uses less than 10% fossil fuel. In the US, the increasing popularity of natural gas is likely to replace coal as the base. There are no [[Electricity generation#List of countries with source of electricity 2008|countries where the majority]] of baseload power is supplied by wind, solar, biofuels or geothermal, as each of these sources fails one or more of the criteria of low price, availability and reliability.

== Environmental, social and legal considerations ==
Renewable power technologies can have significant environmental benefits. Unlike [[coal]] and [[natural gas]], they can generate electricity and fuels without releasing significant quantities of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, however the greenhouse gas savings from a number of [[biofuel]]s have been found to be much less than originally anticipated, as discussed in the article [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels]].

Both solar and wind have been criticized from an aesthetic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, methods and opportunities exist to deploy these renewable technologies efficiently and unobtrusively: fixed solar collectors can double as [[noise barrier]]s along highways, and extensive roadway, parking lot, and roof-top area is currently available; [[photovoltaic cell|amorphous photovoltaic cells]] can also be used to tint windows and produce energy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
{{Main|Hydroelectricity#Advantages_and_disadvantages}}
In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric systems with reservoirs is their ability to store potential power for later [[dispatchable generation|production on demand]]. When used in conjunction with intermittent sources like wind and solar, a constant supply of electricity is achieved. Other advantages include longer life than fuel-fired generation, low operating costs, and other uses of the [[reservoir]].  In areas without natural water flow, [[pumped-storage]] plants provide a constant supply of electricity.  Overall, hydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear energy, and areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry. In Canada it's estimated there are 160,000 megawatts of undeveloped hydro potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerforthefuture.ca/electricity-411/electricity-fuel-source-technical-papers/hydro/|title=Hydro - Power for the Future|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are several disadvantages associated with conventional dam and reservoir [[hydroelectricity]].  These include: dislocation if there are people living where the reservoirs are planned, release of significant [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|amounts of carbon dioxide]] at construction and flooding of the reservoir, disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife, adverse impacts on the river environment, potential risks of sabotage and terrorism, and in rare cases catastrophic failure of the dam wall.

====Advantages====
[[Image:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

*'''Economic gains'''
Hydro is a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing electrical demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of operating a hydroelectric plant is nearly immune to changes in the cost or availability of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or [[coal]], and no imports are needed. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydroelectric plants have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

*'''Industrial use
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand|New Zealand's]] [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

*'''Low impact on climate change'''
Since hydroelectric dams do not burn fossil fuels, they do not directly produce [[carbon dioxide]] or pollutants.  While some carbon dioxide is produced during cement manufacture and construction of the project, this is a tiny fraction of the operating emissions of equivalent fossil-fuel electricity generation. One measurement of greenhouse gas and other external comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institut]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf|title=Final Technical Report, Version 2|author=Rabl A. et. al.|date=August 2005|website=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications|publisher=European Commission|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|website=ExternE-Pol|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emissions of [[methane]] are found in the tropical regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226|bibcode=2011NatGe...4..585W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Other reservoir uses'''
The cost of large dams and reservoirs is justified by some of the added benefits. Reservoirs often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large reservoirs can control flooding and alleviate droughts, which would otherwise harm  people living downstream.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbia River Treaty]] between The US and Canada required that in the 1960s and 1970s, very large reservoirs were constructed for flood control. In order to offset the cost of dam construction some locations included large hydroelectric plants.

*'''Reservoir land requirements'''
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s would submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]].]]
Large reservoirs required for the operation of conventional hydroelectric dams result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, changing biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands into artificial lakes. Ideally a reservoir would be large enough to average the annual flow of water or in its smallest form provide sufficient water for irrigation. The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and North America environmental concerns around land flooded by large reservoirs ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s, since then only [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run of the river]] projects have been approved. Large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like China, Brazil and India.

*'''Reservoirs displace communities'''
A consequence is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the contentious [[Three Gorges Dam]] which displaced 1.24 million residents. [[1954 Yangtze River Floods|In 1954 the river flooded]] {{convert|193000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, killing 33,000&amp;nbsp;people and forcing 18 million people to move to higher ground. The dam now provides a flood storage capacity for 22 cubic kilometres of water.

*'''Reservoir siltation'''
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This may negatively affect the reservoir capacity and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=978-0-918334-80-0|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

*'''Reservoirs methane generation'''
Some reservoirs in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivernet.org/general/wcd/welcome.htm#download|title=Download the official WCD Report|publisher=RiverNet.org|date=2000-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com|date=2005-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of knowledge in the scientific community regarding reservoir GHG emissions, producing many diverging  positions. To resolve this situation, the International Energy Agency is coordinating an analysis of actual emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieahydro.org/media/992f6848/GHG_Guidelines_22October2012_Final.pdf|title=Hydropower and the Environment: Managing the Carbon Balance in Freshwater Reservoirs|publisher=International Energy Agency|date=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, greenhouse gas emissions are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat.com|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Reservoir safety'''
Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure. During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless. Also, the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2000 people died.&lt;ref&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small 1939 [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1967, causing 39 deaths with the Toccoa Flood, ten years after its power plant was decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Downstream aquatic ecosystem
Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s downstream of the plant site. Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Water exiting a reservoir usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For fish migration a [[fish ladder]] may be required. For fish going through a high [[head]] turbine is usually fatal. Reservoir water passing through a [[turbine]] alters the downstream river environment. Downstream changes to the water temperature and dissolved gases have adverse effects on some species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/bonneville_dam_fish_ladders.html|title=The Columbia River - Bonneville Dam Fish Ladders|first=Lyn Topinka,|last=2005|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, alteration to the amount of water let through the dam can also change the composition of gasses in the water downstream. Changes in the amount of discharged water also have the ability to interrupt mating season for various species of fish by dewatering their spawning grounds and forcing them to retreat. Even if mating season has passed, any newly hatched fry can be killed off by low water levels in their spawning areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=CP71169069010001451&amp;context=L&amp;vid=UW&amp;search_scope=all&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=CP71169069010001451&amp;context=L&amp;vid=UW&amp;search_scope=all&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|website=alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power ===
{{See also|Solar_power#Environmental_impacts{{!}}Environmental impact of solar power|Space-based solar power}}
[[File:Blick vom aussichtsturm hörlitz4.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Senftenberg Solarpark]], a solar [[photovoltaic]] power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of [[Senftenberg]], in Eastern Germany. The 78 MW Phase 1 of the plant was completed within three months.]]

Unlike [[fossil fuel]] based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.

The [[energy payback time]] of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as was consumed during production of the system. In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blakers and Klaus Weber, [http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm "The Energy Intensity of Photovoltaic Systems"], Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Australian National University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon PV systems&lt;ref name="ECN2006"&gt;

Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the [[EROEI|energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) or [[EROEI|energy return on investment]] (EROI),&lt;ref&gt;C. Reich-Weiser, D. Dornfeld, and S. Horne. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6bt786nf Environmental assessment and metrics for solar: Case study of solfocus solar concentrator systems]. UC Berkeley: Laboratory for Manufacturing and Sustainability, 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build ''and maintain'' the equipment. (This is not the same as the [[return on investment|economic return on investment]] (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With lifetimes of at least 30 years{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, [[balance of system]] (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Pearce and Andrew Lau, [http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch471/evans%20files/Net_Energy%20solar%20cells.pdf "Net Energy Analysis For Sustainable Energy Production From Silicon Based Solar Cells"], Proceedings of American Society of Mechanical Engineers Solar 2002: Sunrise on the Reliable Energy Economy, editor [[Rebecca Campbell-Howe|R. Campbell-Howe]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of [[cadmium]] in [[cadmium telluride solar cell]]s (CdTe is only used in a few types of PV panels). Cadmium in its metallic form is a toxic substance that has the tendency to [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in ecological [[food chain]]s. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5-10 g/m²) and with proper emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3-0.9 [[microgram]]/kWh over the whole life-cycle.&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; Most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and [[lignite]] combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and [[natural gas]] 0.2 microgram/kWh. Note that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf CdTe PV: Real and Perceived EHS Risks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar power plants require large amounts of land. According to the Bureau of Land Management, there are twenty proposals to use in total about 180 square miles of public land in California. If all twenty proposed projects were built, they would total 7,387 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Land Management, Solar Projects site|title=Solar Applications and Authorizations PDF|url=http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/prog/energy/solar.html|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for so much land has spurred efforts to encourage solar facilities to be built on already-disturbed lands, and the Department of Interior identified Solar Energy Zones that it judges to contain lower value habitat where solar development would have less of an impact on ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seltenrich|first=Nate|title=A Matter of Survival|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201111/solar.aspx|publisher=Sierra Magazine|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensitive wildlife impacted by large solar facility plans include the [[desert tortoise]], [[Mohave Ground Squirrel]], [[Mojave fringe-toed lizard]], and [[desert bighorn sheep]].

In the United States, some of the land in the eastern portion of the Mojave Desert is to be preserved, but the solar industry has mainly expressed interest in areas of the western desert, "where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines", said Kenn J. Arnecke of ''FPL Energy'', a sentiment shared by many executives in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-desert26-2009dec26,0,3513775.story A Mojave power failure A shortfall in Mojave protection bill], ''Los Angeles Times'', editorial, December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biofuels production ===
[[Image:Ethanol butler co iowa.jpg|thumb|An ethanol fuel plant under construction, [[Butler County, Iowa]]]]
{{main|Food vs fuel}}
{{See also|Ethanol fuel energy balance|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization}}
Biofuel production has increased in recent years. Some commodities like [[maize]] (corn), [[sugar cane]] or [[vegetable oil]] can be used either as food, feed, or to make biofuels. The [[Food vs. fuel]] debate is the dilemma regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for [[biofuel]]s production to the detriment of the [[food supply]]. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7026105.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Will biofuel leave the poor hungry?|author=Maggie Ayre |date=2007-10-03|language=|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mydebatetopic.com/debate-topics-for-kids/|title=The Biofuel Smear Campaign|publisher=Farm Futures|author=Mike Wilson|date=2008-02-08|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=}}{{date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1725975,00.html|title=The Clean Energy Scam|publisher=Time Magazine|author=Michael Grundwald|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="babcock"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf The Impact of US Biofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility], By Bruce A. Babcock, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, for [[ICTSD]], Issue Paper No. 35. June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |date=June 2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Energy Agency]], new biofuels technologies being developed today, notably cellulosic ethanol, could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} (PDF), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw),
wood waste, and [[municipal solid waste]] are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated [[energy crop]]s, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be [[sustainability|sustainably produced]] in many
regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.org/ind/biofuel/CellulosicEthanolIssueBrief.pdf Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212025744/http://www.bio.org/ind/biofuel/CellulosicEthanolIssueBrief.pdf |date=12 February 2006 }} (PDF), pages 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethanol and biodiesel production industries also create jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels.&lt;ref name="Worldwatch"/&gt;

Biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to carbon emissions being short term, but are similar to fossil fuels in that [[Biofuel#Air pollution|biofuels contribute]] to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Diesendorf]], formerly Professor of Environmental Science at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and a principal research scientist with [[CSIRO]] has summarised some of the benefits of onshore wind farms as follows.&lt;ref name="Diesendorf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf|title=Why Australia needs wind power|last=Diesendorf|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Diesendorf|website=Dissent|year=2003|accessdate=29 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101080556/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf|archivedate=1 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|A wind farm, when installed on agricultural land, has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all energy sources:
* It occupies less land area per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated than any other energy conversion system, apart from rooftop solar energy, and is compatible with grazing and crops.
* It generates the energy used in its construction in just 3 months of operation, yet its operational lifetime is 20–25 years.
* Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by its construction are very tiny and declining. There are no emissions or pollution produced by its operation.
* In substituting for load following natural gas plants [...] wind power produces a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and a net increase in biodiversity.
* Large wind turbines are almost silent and rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per minute) that they are rarely a bird strike hazard. |[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]], no. 13, Summer 2003/04, pp.43–48&lt;ref name="Diesendorf"/&gt;}}

Improvements in wind turbine design, including a much slower rate of rotation of the blades and a smooth tower base instead of perchable lattice towers, have helped reduce bird mortality at wind farms around the world.  However older smaller wind turbines may be hazardous to flying birds.&lt;ref&gt;

However, residents in other areas have been more positive and there are many examples of community wind farm developments. According to a town councillor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the [[Ardrossan Wind Farm]] in Scotland has enhanced the area.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

A starting point for better understanding community concerns about wind farms is often through public outreach initiatives (e.g., surveys, town hall meetings) to clarify the nature of concerns. Community concerns regarding wind power projects have been shown to be based more on people’s perception rather than actual fact.&lt;ref name=SVV2011/&gt; In tourist areas, for example, there is a misperception that the siting of wind farms will adversely affect tourism. Yet surveys conducted in tourist areas in Germany, Belgium, and Scotland show that this is simply not the case. Similarly, according to Valentine, concerns over wind turbine noise, shadow flicker, and bird life threats are not supported by actual data. The difficulty is that the general public often does not have ready access to information necessary to assess the pros and cons of wind power developments.&lt;ref name=SVV2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottvalentine.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/valentine_sheltering_WP_projects_from_community_concerns.142173359.pdf |title=Sheltering wind power projects from tempestuous community concerns
|author=Scott Victor Valentine |date=2011 |volume=15 |website=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even where a general public supports wind power in principle and is well informed, there are often important 'qualifications' around the delivery of infrastructure (i.e. providing mitigation of development impacts on local ecology and assets).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Navigating the participatory processes of renewable energy infrastructure regulation: A 'local participant perspective' on the NSIPs regime in England and Wales|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517308212|journal=Energy Policy|volume=114|pages=201–210|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.006|issn=0301-4215|last1=Natarajan|first1=L|last2=Rydin|first2=Y|last3=Lock|first3=S.J|last4=Lee|first4=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports tend to emphasize storylines that have popular appeal (i.e. famous figures who are opposed to a particular development). Consequently, media coverage often fails to provide the full project information that the public needs to effectively evaluate the merits of a wind project. Moreover, misinformation about wind power may be propagated by fossil fuel and nuclear power special interest groups.&lt;ref name=SVV2011/&gt; Often there is an ideological right wing interest which tends to dominate, supporting anti-green and [[climate change denial|anti-climate-science]] positions. The Australian anti-wind site ''Stop These Things''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthesethings.com/|title=STOP THESE THINGS|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; best illustrates this approach, describing environmentalists as ‘Greentards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/sites/default/files/Chain%20Reaction%20%23119%20Nov%202013%204MB.pdf |title=Election aftermath: Full speed in reverse |author=Cam Walker |date=November 2013 |website=Chain Reaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lesson for planners and policymakers is that some forms of public opposition can be mitigated by providing community members with comprehensive information on a given project. In fact, not only will a more proactive media strategy help reduce opposition but it may also actually lead to enhanced support.&lt;ref name=SVV2011/&gt;

Public perceptions generally improve after wind projects become operational. Surveys conducted with communities that host wind energy developments in the United Kingdom, Scotland, France, the United States, and Finland have demonstrated that wind farms which are properly planned and sited can engender project support. Wind energy projects, which have been well-planned to reduce social and environmental problems, have been shown to positively influence wind power perceptions once completed. Support is enhanced when community members are offered investment opportunities and involvement in the wind power development.&lt;ref name=SVV2011/&gt; Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=48671 |title=Group Dedicates Opening of 200 MW Big Horn Wind Farm: Farm incorporates conservation efforts that protect wildlife habitat |publisher=Renewableenergyaccess.com |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012192322/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=48671 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeanette Fisher |url=http://environmentpsychology.com/wind_power_midamerican's_intrepid_wind_farm1.htm |title=Wind Power: MidAmerican's Intrepid Wind Farm |publisher=Environmentpsychology.com |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agl.com.au/environment/sustainability/Pages/StakeholderEngagement.aspx |title=Stakeholder Engagement |publisher=Agl.com.au |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases there is [[Community wind energy|direct community ownership of wind farm projects]]. In Germany, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of Germany's electricity.&lt;ref name=emp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/technology/my-take/community-wind-farm.html |title=Community Power Empowers |publisher=Dsc.discovery.com |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Germany.&lt;ref name=soc&gt;[http://nccnsw.org.au/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2148 Community Wind Farms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720132956/http://nccnsw.org.au/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2148 |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power.&lt;ref name=com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WD/WD22vi_public.pdf |title=A Summary of Opinion Surveys on Wind Power |format=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/publicattitudes.aspx |title=Public attitudes to wind farms |publisher=Eon-uk.com |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314142558/http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/publicattitudes.aspx |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, wind projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads and hospitals. Wind projects also revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners.&lt;ref name=nine/&gt;

The [[Intrepid Wind Farm]], in Iowa, is an example of one wind farm where the environmental impact of the project has been minimized through consultation and co-operation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Making sure the wind farm made as gentle an environmental impact as possible was an important consideration. Therefore, when MidAmerican first began planning the Intrepid site, they worked closely with a number of state and national environmental groups. Using input from such diverse groups as the [[Iowa Department of Natural Resources]], the [[Nature Conservancy]], [[Iowa State University]], the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, and the Iowa Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], MidAmerican created a statewide map of areas in the proposed region that contained specific bird populations or habitats. Those areas were then avoided as site planning got underway in earnest. In order to minimize the wind farm's environmental impact even further, MidAmerican also worked in conjunction with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corp of Engineers]], to secure all necessary permits related to any potential risk to wetlands in the area. Regular inspections are also conducted to make certain that the wind farm is causing no adverse environmental impact to the region."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://environmentpsychology.com/wind_power_midamerican's_intrepid_wind_farm1.htm Wind Power: MidAmerican's Intrepid Wind Farm]."

== Longevity issues ==
Even though a source of renewable energy may last for billions of years, renewable energy infrastructure, like hydroelectric dams, will not last forever, and must be removed and replaced at some point. Events like the shifting of riverbeds, or changing weather patterns could potentially alter or even halt the function of hydroelectric dams, lowering the amount of time they are available to generate electricity. A reservoirs capacity may also be affected by [[silting]] which may not be cost-effective to remove.

Wind turbines suffer from wear and fatigue and are scheduled to last 25 years before being replaced, often by much taller units.

Some have claimed that geothermal being a renewable energy source depends on the rate of extraction being slow enough such that depletion does not occur.  If depletion does occur, the temperature can regenerate if given a long period of non-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcmiras.net/jcm/item/95/ |title=Geothermal Energy: Renewable or Not? &amp;#124; Jcmiras.Net_01 |publisher=Jcmiras.net |date=12 January 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Company.

== Diversification ==
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2010}}
The U.S. electric power industry now relies on large, central power stations, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower plants that together generate more than 95% of the nation’s electricity. Over the next few decades uses of renewable energy could help to diversify the nation’s bulk power supply.  In 2016 renewable hydro, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass produced 39% of California’s electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/almanac/electricity_data/total_system_power.html | title=Total System Electric Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of today’s electricity comes from large, central-station power plants, new technologies offer a range of options for generating electricity nearer to where it is needed, saving on the cost of transmitting and distributing power and improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.&lt;ref name="Worldwatch"&gt;{{cite web | title = American Energy: The Renewable Path to Energy Security  | publisher = Worldwatch Institute |date=September 2006 | url = http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] represents the most immediate and often the most cost-effective way to reduce oil dependence, improve energy security, and reduce the health and environmental impact of the energy system. By reducing the total energy requirements of the economy, improved energy efficiency could make increased reliance on renewable energy sources more practical and affordable.&lt;ref name="Worldwatch"/&gt;

== Institutionalized barriers and choice awareness theory ==
Existing organizations and conservative political groups are disposed to keep renewable energy proposals out of the agenda at many levels.&lt;ref name=Elsevier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=Henrik|title=The implementation of renewable energy systems.

According to an article by Henrik Lund, the theory of Choice Awareness seeks to understand and explain why the descriptions of the best alternatives do not develop independently and what can be done about it.&lt;ref name=Elsevier /&gt; The theory argues that public participation, and hence the awareness of choices, has been an important factor in successful decision-making processes&lt;ref name=Elsevier /&gt; Choice Awareness theory emphasizes the fact that different organizations see things differently and that current organizational interests hinder passing renewable energy policies. Given these conditions leaves the public with a situation of no choice.&lt;ref name=Elsevier /&gt; Consequently, this leaves the general public in a state to abide by conventional energy sources such as coal and oil.

In a broad sense most individuals, especially those that do not engage in public discourse of current economic policies, have little to no awareness of renewable energy. Enlightening communities on the socioeconomic implications of fossil fuel use is a potent mode of rhetoric that can promote the implementation of renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=Barry &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=John|title=Cool Rationalities and Hot Air: A Rhetorical Approach to Understanding Debates on Renewable Energy|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=67–98|doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.2.67|year=2008|citeseerx=10.1.1.564.968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparent local planning also proves useful in public discourse when used to determine the location of wind farms in communities supporting renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvaney|first=Kate|title=Different Shades of Green: A Case Study of Support for Wind Farms in the Rural Midwest|journal=Environmental Management|volume=51|issue=5|pages=1012–1024|doi=10.1007/s00267-013-0026-8|pmid=23519901|bibcode=2013EnMan..51.1012M|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article by John Barry et al., a crucial factor communities need to engage discourse on is the principle of "assumption of and imperative towards consensus."&lt;ref name=Barry /&gt; This principle claims that a community cannot neglect its energy or climate change responsibilities, and that it must do its part in helping to decrease carbon emissions through renewable energy reformation.&lt;ref name=Barry /&gt; Hence, communities that continually engage in mutual learning and discourse by conflict resolution will help progress renewable energy.&lt;ref name=Barry /&gt;

== Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy ==
{{Main|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy}}

Legislative definitions of renewable energy, used when determining energy projects eligible for subsidies or tax breaks, usually exclude conventional nuclear reactor designs. Physicist [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] elucidated in 1983 that uranium dissolved in [[seawater]], when used in [[Breeder reactor]]s (which are reactors that "[[breed]]" more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume from base [[fertile material]]) is effectively inexhaustible, with the seawater bearing uranium constantly replenished by river erosion carrying more uranium into the sea, and could therefore be considered a renewable source of energy.&lt;ref name="cohen83"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]](WCED), an organization independent from, but created by, the [[United Nation]]s, published [[Our Common Future]], in which [[breeder reactor]]s, and, when it is developed, [[fusion power]] are both classified within the same category as conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|website=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power.

The '''Harari–Shupe preon model''' (also known as '''rishon model''', RM) is the earliest effort to develop a [[preon]] model to explain the phenomena appearing in the [[Standard Model]] (SM) of [[particle physics]].&lt;ref name=Harari1979&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harari |first=H. |year=1979 |title=A schematic model of quarks and leptons |url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-2310.pdf |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=83&amp;ndash;86 |doi=10.1016/0370-2693(79)90626-9 |bibcode=1979PhLB...86...83H }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first developed independently by [[Haim Harari]] and by [[Michael A. Shupe]]&lt;ref name=Shupe1979&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shupe |first=M. A. |year=1979 |title=A composite model of leptons and quarks |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=87&amp;ndash;92 |doi=10.1016/0370-2693(79)90627-0 |bibcode=1979PhLB...86...87S }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and later expanded by Harari and his then-student [[Nathan Seiberg]].&lt;ref name=HarariSeiberg1984/&gt;

==The model==
The model has two kinds of fundamental particles called '''rishons''' (which means "primary" in [[Hebrew]]). They are '''T''' ("Third" since it has an electric charge of +⅓&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']], or [[Tohu Rishon|Tohu]] which means [[Tohu va bohu|"unformed"]] in [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Genesis]]) and '''V''' ("Vanishes", since it is electrically neutral, or [[Vohu Rishon|Vohu]] which means "void" in Hebrew Genesis). All [[lepton]]s and all [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of [[quark]]s are three-rishon ordered triplets. These groups of three rishons have [[spin-½]]. They are as follows:
* TTT = [[positron]] (anti-electron);
* VVV = [[electron neutrino]];
* TTV, TVT and VTT = three [[color charge|colour]]s of [[up quark]]s;
* TVV, VTV and VVT = three colours of [[down quark|down antiquarks]].

Each rishon has a corresponding antiparticle. Hence:
* {{overline|TTT}} = [[electron]];
* {{overline|VVV}} = [[electron antineutrino]];
* {{overline|TTV}}, {{overline|TVT}}, {{overline|VTT}} = three colours of [[up quark|up antiquarks]];
* {{overline|TVV}}, {{overline|VTV}}, {{overline|VVT}} = three colours of [[down quark]]s.

The [[W and Z bosons|W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; boson]] = TTTVVV;
The [[W and Z bosons|W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; boson]] = {{overline|TTTVVV}}.

[[Baryon number]] (''B'') and [[lepton number]] (''L'') are not conserved, but the quantity [[B−L|''B''−''L'']] is conserved. A baryon number violating process (such as [[proton decay]]) in the model would be &lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|u&amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; &amp;nbsp;{{overline|d}}&amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;
/|\ &amp;nbsp; /|\ &amp;nbsp; /|\ &amp;nbsp; /|\&lt;br&gt;
{{nowrap|TTV + TTV &amp;rarr; TVV + TTT}}&lt;/tt&gt;

*[[Matter]] and [[antimatter]] are equally abundant in nature in the RM.
*[[Generation (particle physics)|Higher generation]] leptons and quarks are presumed to be excited states of first generation leptons and quarks.
*[[Mass]] is not explained.

In the expanded Harari–Seiberg version the rishons possess color and hypercolor, explaining why the only composites are the observed quarks and leptons.&lt;ref name=HarariSeiberg1984&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harari |first1=Haim |last2=Seiberg |first2=Nathan |url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/harari/files/Nuclear_PhysicsB_Vol204.pdf |year=1982 |title=The Rishon Model |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=204 |pages=141–167 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing |access-date=2018-06-02 |dead-url=no|bibcode=1982NuPhB.204..141H |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90426-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain assumptions, it is possible to show that the model allows exactly for three generations of quarks and leptons.

==Evidence==
Currently, there is no [[scientific evidence]] for the existence of substructure within quarks and leptons, but there is no profound reason why such a substructure may not be revealed at shorter distances. In 2008, [[Piotr Zenczykowski]] has derived the RM by starting from a non-relativistic [[O(6)]] [[phase space]].&lt;ref name=Zenczykowski2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zenczykowski, P. |year=2008 |title=The Harari–Shupe preon model and nonrelativistic quantum phase space |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=660 |issue=5 |pages=567–572 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.01.045 |bibcode=2008PhLB..660..567Z |arxiv=0803.0223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such model is based on fundamental principles and the structure of [[Clifford algebras]], and fully recovers the RM by naturally explaining several obscure and otherwise artificial features of the original model.

==In popular culture==
* Science fiction author [[Vonda McIntyre]], in her novelizations of the scripts of the movies ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' and ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' suggested that the [[Project Genesis (Star Trek)|Genesis effect]] was a result of a newly discovered rishon-like substructure to matter.
* Science fiction author [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] in his novel ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'' explicitly postulated a rishon-like model in the development of antimatter weapons and energy sources.

The '''slash rating''', under the United States [[National Electrical Code]], is given to circuit interrupt hardware and specifies a maximum line-to-ground voltage rating in combination with a maximum line-to-line voltage rating.  One common application would be for a [[three-phase]] [[electrical load]]s.  For example a 120/240 V rating can disqualify a circuit breaker for use with a delta system load that would otherwise work with a wye system load.

A '''solar mirror''' contains a [[Coating|substrate]] with a reflective layer for reflecting the [[solar energy]], and in most cases an interference layer.  This may be a [[Plane mirror|planar mirror]] or [[Parabola|parabolic]] arrays of solar mirrors used to achieve a substantially concentrated reflection factor for solar energy systems.

See article "[[Heliostat]]" for more information on solar mirrors used for terrestrial energy.

== Components ==

=== Glass or metal substrate ===

The substrate is the mechanical layer which holds the mirror in shape.

Glass may also be used as a protective layer to protect the other layers from abrasion and corrosion.  Although glass is brittle, it is a good material for this purpose, because it is highly transparent (low optical losses), resistant to [[ultraviolet light]] (UV), fairly hard (abrasion resistant), chemically inert, and fairly easy to clean.  It is composed of a [[float glass]] with high optical transmission characteristics in the visible and [[infrared]] ranges, and is configured to transmit visible light and infrared radiation.  The top surface, known as the "first surface", will reflect some of the incident solar energy, due to the [[reflection coefficient]] caused by its [[index of refraction]] being higher than air.  Most of the solar energy is transmitted through the glass substrate to the lower layers of the mirror, possibly with some [[refraction]], depending on the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] as light enters the mirror.

Metal substrates ("Metal Mirror Reflectors") may also be used in solar reflectors.  [[NASA Glenn Research Center]], for example, used a mirror comprising a reflective  aluminum surface on a metallic honeycomb&lt;ref&gt;NASA Glenn Research Center, 1987 Phase II Small Business Research Program, "Improved Mirror Facet," Solar Kinetics, Dallas, TX [http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/successes/ss/026text.html archived summary]&lt;/ref&gt; as a prototype reflector unit for a proposed power system for the [[International Space Station]].  One technology uses aluminum composite reflector panels, achieving over 93% reflectivity and coated with a speciality coating for surface protection.  Metal reflectors offer some advantages over glass reflectors, as they are lightweight and stronger than glass and relatively inexpensive. The ability to retain parabolic shape in reflectors is another advantage, and normally the subframe requirements are reduced by more than 300%&lt;!--A reduction of more than 100%?--&gt;. The top surface reflection coating allows for better efficiency.

=== Reflective layer ===
The reflective layer is designed to reflect the maximum amount of solar energy incident upon it, back through the glass substrate.  The layer comprises a highly reflective thin metal film, usually either [[silver]] or [[aluminum]], but occasionally other metals.  Because of sensitivity to abrasion and corrosion, the metal layer is usually protected by the (glass) substrate on top, and the bottom may be covered with a protective coating, such as a [[copper]] layer and [[varnish]].

Despite the use of aluminum in generic mirrors, aluminum is not always used as the reflective layer for a solar mirror.  The use of silver as the reflective layer is claimed to lead to higher efficiency levels, because it is the most reflective metal.  This is because of aluminum's reflection factor in the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] region of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Locating the aluminum layer on the first surface exposes it to weathering, which reduces the mirror's resistance to corrosion and makes it more susceptible to abrasion.  Adding a protective layer to the aluminum would reduce its reflectivity.

=== Interference layer ===
An interference layer may be located on the first surface of the glass substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Solar mirror, process for its manufacture and its use
  | date =December 12, 1993
  | url =http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5253105.html
  | accessdate =2007-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be used to tailor the reflectance.  It may also be designed for diffuse reflectance of near-ultraviolet radiation, in order to prevent it from passing through the glass substrate. This substantially enhances the overall reflection of near-ultraviolet radiation from the mirror. The interference layer may be made of several materials, depending on the desired refractive index, such as  [[titanium dioxide]].

== Solar thermal applications ==
The intensity of [[solar thermal energy]] from [[solar radiation]] at the surface of the [[earth]] is about {{convert|1|kW/m2|kW/sqft}}, of area [[Perpendicular|normal]] to the direction of the [[sun]], under clear-sky conditions.  When solar energy is unconcentrated, the maximum collector temperature is about {{cvt|80|-|100|C|F}}.  This is useful for space heating and heating water.  For higher temperature applications, such as [[cooking]], or supplying a [[heat engine]] or [[turbine]]-[[electrical generator]], this energy must be concentrated.

=== Terrestrial applications ===
[[Solar thermal]] systems have been constructed to produce [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP), for generating electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/overview.htm#tower Sandia Labs - CSP Technologies Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/PDFs/solar_tower.pdf PowerTower The large design developed by Sandia National Labs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117095406/http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/PDFs/solar_tower.pdf |date=2004-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large Sandia Lab [[solar power tower]] uses a [[Stirling engine]] heated by a solar mirror [[concentrator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/PDFs/solar_dish.pdf Sandia Lab - Solar Dish Engine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117095302/http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/PDFs/solar_dish.pdf |date=2004-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another configuration is the trough system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/Snapshot/TROUGHS.HTM Sandia Lab - Trough System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028084733/http://www.energylan.sandia.gov/sunlab/Snapshot/TROUGHS.HTM |date=2004-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space power application ===

"Solar dynamic" energy systems have been proposed for various [[spacecraft]] applications, including [[solar power satellite]]s, where a reflector focuses sunlight on to a [[heat engine]] such as the [[Brayton cycle]] type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photovoltaic augmentation ==

[[Photovoltaic cells]] (PV) which can convert solar radiation directly into [[electricity]] are quite expensive per unit area.  Some types of PV cell, e.g. [[gallium arsenide]], if cooled, are capable of converting efficiently up to 1,000 times as much radiation as is normally provided by simple exposure to direct sunlight.

In tests done by Sewang Yoon and Vahan Garboushian, for Amonix Corp.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; silicon solar cell conversion efficiency is shown to increase at higher levels of concentration, proportional to the logarithm of the concentration, provided external cooling is available  to the photocells.  Similarly, higher efficiency multijunction cells also improve in performance with high concentration.&lt;ref&gt;G. Landis, D. Belgiovani, and D. Scheiman, “Temperature Coefficient of Multijunction Space Solar Cells as a Function of Concentration,” ''37th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference'', Seattle WA, June 19–24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial application===

To date no large scale testing has been performed on this concept.  Presumably this is because the increased cost of the reflectors and cooling generally is not economically justified.

===Solar power satellite application===

Theoretically, for space-based [[solar power satellite]] designs, solar mirrors could reduce PV cell costs and launch costs since they are expected to be both lighter and cheaper than equivalent large areas of PV cells.  Several options were studied by [[Boeing]] corporation.&lt;ref&gt;

==Space reflectors for night illumination==

Another advanced space concept proposal is the notion of Space Reflectors which reflect sunlight on to small spots on the night side of the Earth to provide night time illumination.  An early proponent of this concept was Dr. [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]], who wrote about systems called "Lunetta", "Soletta", "Biosoletta" and "Powersoletta".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

{{short description|a self-reinforcing solitary wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity}}
[[File:Soliton hydro.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Solitary wave (water waves)|Solitary wave]] in a laboratory [[wave channel]]]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], a '''soliton''' is a self-reinforcing solitary [[wave packet]] that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity. Solitons are caused by a cancellation of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] and [[dispersion relation|dispersive effects]] in the medium. (The term "dispersive effects" refers to a property of certain systems where the speed of the waves varies according to frequency.) Solitons are the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear dispersive [[partial differential equation]]s describing physical systems.

The soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by [[John Russell (engineer)|John Scott Russell]] (1808–1882) who observed a solitary wave in the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] in Scotland. He reproduced the phenomenon in a [[wave tank]] and named it the "[[John Russell (engineer)#The wave of translation|Wave of Translation]]".

==Definition==
A single, consensus definition of a soliton is difficult to find. {{harvtxt|Drazin|Johnson|1989|p=15}} ascribe three properties to solitons:
# They are of permanent form;
# They are localized within a region;
# They can interact with other solitons, and emerge from the collision unchanged, except for a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]].

More formal definitions exist, but they require substantial mathematics. Moreover, some scientists use the term ''soliton'' for phenomena that do not quite have these three properties (for instance, the '[[light bullet]]s' of [[nonlinear optics]] are often called solitons despite losing energy during interaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Light bullets|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~renns/lbullets.html#bullets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[File:Sech soliton.svg|thumb|300px|right|A [[hyperbolic secant]] (sech) envelope soliton for water waves: The blue line is the [[carrier signal]], while the red line is the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] soliton.]]
[[Dispersion relation|Dispersion]] and [[nonlinearity]] can interact to produce permanent and localized [[wave]] forms.  Consider a pulse of light traveling in glass. This pulse can be thought of as consisting of light of several different frequencies.  Since glass shows dispersion, these different frequencies travel at different speeds and the shape of the pulse therefore changes over time. However, also the nonlinear [[Kerr effect]] occurs; the [[refractive index]] of a material at a given frequency depends on the light's amplitude or strength. If the pulse has just the right shape, the Kerr effect exactly cancels the dispersion effect, and the pulse's shape does not change over time, thus is a soliton. See [[soliton (optics)]] for a more detailed description.

Many [[exactly solvable model]]s have soliton solutions, including the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]], the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]], the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and the [[sine-Gordon equation]]. The soliton solutions are typically obtained by means of the [[inverse scattering transform]], and owe their stability to the [[integrable system|integrability]] of the field equations. The mathematical theory of these equations is a broad and very active field of mathematical research.

Some types of [[tidal bore]], a wave phenomenon of a few rivers including the [[River Severn]], are 'undular': a wavefront followed by a train of solitons. Other solitons occur as the undersea [[internal wave]]s, initiated by [[seabed topography]], that propagate on the oceanic [[pycnocline]]. Atmospheric solitons also exist, such as the [[morning glory cloud]] of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], where pressure solitons traveling in a [[temperature inversion]] layer produce vast linear [[roll cloud]]s. The recent and not widely accepted [[soliton model]] in [[neuroscience]] proposes to explain the signal conduction within [[neuron]]s as pressure solitons.

A [[topological soliton]], also called a topological defect, is any solution of a set of [[partial differential equation]]s that is stable against decay to the "trivial solution". Soliton stability is due to topological constraints, rather than integrability of the field equations. The constraints arise almost always because the differential equations must obey a set of [[boundary conditions]], and the boundary has a nontrivial [[homotopy group]], preserved by the differential equations. Thus, the differential equation solutions can be classified into [[homotopy class]]es.

No continuous transformation maps a solution in one homotopy class to another. The solutions are truly distinct, and maintain their integrity, even in the face of extremely powerful forces. Examples of topological solitons include the [[screw dislocation]] in a [[crystalline lattice]], the [[Dirac string]] and the [[magnetic monopole]] in [[electromagnetism]], the [[Skyrmion]] and the [[Wess–Zumino–Witten model]] in [[quantum field theory]], the [[magnetic skyrmion]] in condensed matter physics, and [[cosmic string]]s and [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].

==History==
In 1834, [[John Scott Russell]] describes his ''[[wave of translation]]''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Translation" here means that there is real mass transport, although it is not the same water which is transported from one end of the canal to the other end by this "Wave of Translation". Rather, a [[fluid parcel]] acquires [[momentum]] during the passage of the solitary wave, and comes to rest again after the passage of the wave. But the fluid parcel has been displaced substantially forward during the process&amp;nbsp;– by [[Stokes drift]] in the wave propagation direction. And a net mass transport is the result. Usually there is little mass transport from one side to another side for ordinary waves.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery is described here in Scott Russell's own words:&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This passage has been repeated in many papers and books on soliton theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped&amp;nbsp;– not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed. I followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rate of some eight or nine miles an hour, preserving its original figure some thirty feet long and a foot to a foot and a half in height. Its height gradually diminished, and after a chase of one or two miles I lost it in the windings of the channel. Such, in the month of August 1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and beautiful phenomenon which I have called the Wave of Translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Scott Russell |authorlink=John Scott Russell |contribution=Report on waves |title=Fourteenth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science |year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves. He built wave tanks at his home and noticed some key properties:
* The waves are stable, and can travel over very large distances (normal waves would tend to either flatten out, or steepen and topple over)
* The speed depends on the size of the wave, and its width on the depth of water.
* Unlike normal waves they will never merge&amp;nbsp;– so a small wave is overtaken by a large one, rather than the two combining.
* If a wave is too big for the depth of water, it splits into two, one big and one small.

Scott Russell's experimental work seemed at odds with [[Isaac Newton]]'s and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s theories of [[hydrodynamics]]. [[George Biddell Airy]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] had difficulty accepting Scott Russell's experimental observations because they could not be explained by the existing water wave theories.  Their contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before [[Joseph Boussinesq]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] published a theoretical treatment and solutions.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;[[Lord Rayleigh]] published a paper in Philosophical Magazine in 1876 to support John Scott Russell's experimental observation with his mathematical theory. In his 1876 paper, Lord Rayleigh mentioned Scott Russell's name and also admitted that the first theoretical treatment was by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1871. [[Joseph Boussinesq]] mentioned Russell's name in his 1871 paper. Thus Scott Russell's observations on solitons were accepted as true by some prominent scientists within his own lifetime of 1808–1882.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[Diederik Korteweg]] and [[Gustav de Vries]] provided what is now known as the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]], including solitary wave and periodic [[cnoidal wave]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korteweg  | first1 = D.

The paper by Korteweg and de Vries in 1895 was not the first theoretical treatment of this subject but it was a very important milestone in the history of the development of soliton theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 [[Norman Zabusky]] of [[Bell Labs]] and [[Martin Kruskal]] of [[Princeton University]] first demonstrated soliton behavior in media subject to the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] (KdV equation) in a computational investigation using a [[finite difference]] approach.  They also showed how this behavior explained the puzzling earlier work of [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and Tsingou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Zabusky|Kruskal|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Gardner, Greene, Kruskal and Miura discovered an [[inverse scattering transform]] enabling [[analytic function|analytical]] solution of the KdV equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Peter Lax]] on [[Lax pair]]s and the Lax equation has since extended this to solution of many related soliton-generating systems.

Note that solitons are, by definition, unaltered in shape and speed by a collision with other solitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Springer | isbn = 9783540659198 | last = Remoissenet | first = M. | title = Waves called solitons: Concepts and experiments | year = 1999 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So solitary waves on a water surface are ''near''-solitons, but not exactly – after the interaction of two (colliding or overtaking) solitary waves, they have changed a bit in [[amplitude]] and an oscillatory residual is left behind.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: &lt;br&gt;• {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0022112076003194 | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–186 | last = Maxworthy | first = T. | title = Experiments on collisions between solitary waves | journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics | year = 1976 |bibcode = 1976JFM....76..177M }}&lt;br&gt;• {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0022112082001141 | volume = 118 | pages = 411–443 | last1 = Fenton | first1 = J.D. | first2 = M.M. | last2 = Rienecker | title = A Fourier method for solving nonlinear water-wave problems: application to solitary-wave interactions | journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics | year = 1982 |bibcode = 1982JFM...118..411F }}&lt;br&gt;• {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2205916 | volume = 18 | issue = 057106 | pages = 25&amp;nbsp;pp. | nopp = yes | last1 = Craig | first1 = W. | first2 = P. | last2 = Guyenne |first3 = J. | last3 = Hammack | first4= D. | last4 = Henderson |first5 = C. | last5 = Sulem | title = Solitary water wave interactions | journal = Physics of Fluids | year = 2006 |bibcode = 2006PhFl...18e7106C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitons are also studied in quantum mechanics, thanks to the fact that they could provide a new foundation of it through de Broglie's unfinished program, known as "Double solution theory" or "Nonlinear wave mechanics". This theory, developed by de Broglie in 1927 and revived in the 1950s, is the natural continuation of his ideas developed between 1923 and 1926, which extended the wave-particle duality introduced by Einstein for the light quanta, to all the particles of matter.

==Solitons in fiber optics==
{{See also|Soliton (optics)}}
Much experimentation has been done using solitons in fiber optics applications.  Solitons in a fiber optic system are described by the [[Manakov equations]].
Solitons' inherent stability make long-distance transmission possible without the use of [[repeater]]s, and could potentially double transmission capacity as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172302644 |title=Photons advance on two fronts |publisher=EETimes.com |date=October 24, 2005| accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

| Thierry Georges and his team at [[France Telecom]] R&amp;D Center, combining optical solitons of different [[wavelength]]s ([[wavelength-division multiplexing]]), demonstrated a ''composite'' data transmission of 1 [[Binary prefix|terabit]] per second (1,000,000,000,000 units of information per second), not to be confused with Terabit-Ethernet.

The above impressive experiments have not translated to actual commercial soliton system deployments however, in either terrestrial or submarine systems, chiefly due to the [[James P. Gordon#Solitons and optical communications|Gordon–Haus (GH) jitter]]. The GH jitter requires sophisticated, expensive compensatory solutions that ultimately makes [[Wavelength-division multiplexing#Dense WDM|dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM)]] soliton transmission in the field unattractive, compared to the conventional non-return-to-zero/return-to-zero paradigm. Further, the likely future adoption of the more spectrally efficient phase-shift-keyed/QAM formats makes soliton transmission even less viable, due to the Gordon–Mollenauer effect. Consequently, the long-haul fiberoptic transmission soliton has remained a laboratory curiosity.

==Solitons in magnets==
In magnets, there also exist different types of solitons and other nonlinear waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1134/1.558674 | title=Magnetic soliton motion in a nonuniform magnetic field | year=1998 | last1=Kosevich | first1=A.

==Bions==

The bound state of two solitons is known as a ''bion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belova|first=T.I.|last2=Kudryavtsev|first2=A.E.|year=1997|title=Solitons and their interactions in classical field theory|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1070/PU1997v040n04ABEH000227|journal=Physics-Uspekhi|volume=40|issue=4|pages=359–386|doi=10.1070/pu1997v040n04abeh000227|via=|bibcode=1997PhyU...40..359B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gani|first=V.A.|last2=Kudryavtsev|first2=A.E.|last3=Lizunova|first3=M.A.|date=|year=2014|title=Kink interactions in the (1+1)-dimensional φ^6 model|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.125009|journal=Physical Review D|volume=89|issue=|pages=125009|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.89.125009|via=|arxiv=1402.5903|bibcode=2014PhRvD..89l5009G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gani|first=V.A.|last2=Lensky|first2=V.|last3=Lizunova|first3=M.A.|date=|year=2015|title=Kink excitation spectra in the (1+1)-dimensional φ^8 model|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP08(2015)147|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|language=en|volume=2015|issue=08|pages=147|arxiv=1506.02313|doi=10.1007/JHEP08(2015)147|issn=1029-8479|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in systems where the bound state periodically oscillates, a ''[[breather]]''.

In field theory ''bion'' usually refers to the solution of the [[Born–Infeld model]]. The name appears to have been coined by G. W. Gibbons in order to distinguish this solution from the conventional soliton, understood as a ''regular'', finite-energy (and usually stable) solution of a differential equation describing some physical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Born–Infeld particles and Dirichlet ''p''-branes | first=G. W. | last=Gibbons | volume=514 | issue=3 | year=1998 | pages=603–639 | doi=10.1016/S0550-3213(97)00795-5 | journal=Nuclear Physics B |arxiv = hep-th/9709027 |bibcode = 1998NuPhB.514..603G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''regular'' means a smooth solution carrying no sources at all. However, the solution of the Born–Infeld model still carries a source in the form of a Dirac-delta function at the origin. As a consequence it displays a singularity in this point (although the electric field is everywhere regular). In some physical contexts (for instance string theory) this feature can be important, which motivated the introduction of a special name for this class of solitons.

On the other hand, when gravity is added (i.e. when considering the coupling of the Born–Infeld model to general relativity) the corresponding solution is called ''EBIon'', where "E" stands for Einstein.

'''Sulfur dioxide''' (also '''sulphur dioxide''' in [[British English]]) is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula {{chem|[[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O]]|2}}. It is a toxic [[gas]] with a burnt match smell. It is released naturally by [[volcanic activity]] and is produced as a by-product of the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s contaminated with sulfur compounds and copper extraction.

== Structure and bonding ==

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a bent molecule with ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[Point groups in three dimensions|symmetry point group]].
A [[valence bond theory]] approach considering just ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals would describe the bonding in terms of [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] between two resonance structures.
[[File:Sulfur-dioxide-resonance-2D.svg|center|upright=1.6|thumb|Two resonance structures of sulfur dioxide]]
The sulfur–oxygen bond has a [[bond order]] of 1.5. There is support for this simple approach that does not invoke ''d'' orbital participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Production==
Sulfur dioxide is primarily produced for sulfuric acid manufacture (see [[contact process]]). In the United States in 1979, 23.6 million tonnes (26,014,547 US short tons) of sulfur dioxide were used in this way, compared with 150 thousand tonnes (165,347 US short tons) used for other purposes. Most sulfur dioxide is produced by the combustion of elemental sulfur. Some sulfur dioxide is also produced by roasting [[pyrite]] and other sulfide ores in air.&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann| author = Müller, Hermann | title = Sulfur Dioxide | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a25_569}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:03. Горење на сулфур во атмосфера од кислород.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.25|An experiment showing burning of sulfur in oxygen. A flow-chamber joined to a gas washing bottle (filled with a solution of [[methyl orange]]) is being used. The product is sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with some traces of [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The "smoke" that exits the gas washing bottle is, in fact, a sulfuric acid fog generated in a reaction.]]

===Combustion routes===
Sulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of [[sulfur]] or of burning materials that contain sulfur:
:S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ΔH = −297 kJ/mol

To aid combustion, liquefied sulfur (140–150&amp;nbsp;°C, 284-302&amp;nbsp;°F) is sprayed through an atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur with a large surface area. The reaction is [[exothermic]], and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000–1600&amp;nbsp;°C, 1832-2912&amp;nbsp;°F). The significant amount of heat produced is recovered by steam generation that can subsequently be converted to electricity.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

The combustion of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and organosulfur compounds proceeds similarly. For example:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] of sulfide ores such as [[pyrite]], [[sphalerite]], and [[cinnabar]] (mercury sulfide) also releases SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company; New York, 2010; p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;
:4 FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 ZnS  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →   2 ZnO  +  2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:HgS  + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   Hg  +  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:4 FeS + 7O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A combination of these reactions is responsible for the largest source of sulfur dioxide, volcanic eruptions.  These events can release millions of tonnes of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Reduction of higher oxides===
Sulfur dioxide can also be a byproduct in the manufacture of [[calcium silicate]] [[cement]]; [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is heated with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and sand in this process:
:2 CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → 2 CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Until the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid and cement were produced by this process in [[Whitehaven]], England. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberated sulfur dioxide gas, used in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produced calcium silicate, a precursor in cement production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html WHITEHAVEN COAST ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY]. lakestay.co.uk (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

On a laboratory scale, the action of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on copper [[swarf|turnings]] produces sulfur dioxide.
:Cu  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===From sulfite===
Sulfite results from the reaction of aqueous base and sulfur dioxide.  The reverse reaction involves acidification of [[sodium metabisulfite]]:
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Reactions==

===Industrial reactions===
Treatment of basic solutions with sulfur dioxide affords sulfite salts (e.g. [[sodium sulfite]]):
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Featuring sulfur in the +4 oxidation state, sulfur dioxide is a [[reducing agent]].  It is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as [[sulfuryl chloride]]:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Sulfur dioxide is the [[oxidising agent]] in the [[Claus process]], which is conducted on a large scale in [[oil refineries]].  Here, sulfur dioxide is reduced by hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 3 S + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The sequential oxidation of sulfur dioxide followed by its hydration is used in the production of sulfuric acid.
: 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===Laboratory reactions===
Sulfur dioxide is one of the few common acidic yet reducing gases. It turns moist litmus pink (being acidic), then white (due to its bleaching effect). It may be identified by bubbling it through a [[dichromate]] solution, turning the solution from orange to green (Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)). It can also reduce ferric ions to ferrous. {{Citation needed|Formula looks wrong. Seems like that would go directly to sulfuric acid: SO2(2-) + 4H(+) =&gt; H2SO4 + 2H(+)|date=March 2014}}

Sulfur dioxide can react with certain 1,3-[[diene]]s in a [[cheletropic reaction]] to form cyclic [[sulfone]]s. This reaction is exploited on an industrial scale for the synthesis of [[sulfolane]], which is an important solvent in the petrochemical industry.

:[[File:Cheletropic reaction of butadiene with SO2.svg|frameless|upright=0.7]]

Sulfur dioxide can bind to metal ions as a [[ligand]] to form [[metal sulfur dioxide complex]]es, typically where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1.  Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is monodentate, attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal [[hapticity|η]]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Precursor to sulfuric acid===
Sulfur dioxide is an intermediate in the production of sulfuric acid, being converted to [[sulfur trioxide]], and then to [[oleum]], which is made into sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.

===As a preservative===
Sulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.&lt;/ref&gt; when used in this way in Europe.  As a preservative, it maintains the colorful appearance of the fruit and prevents [[Decomposition|rotting]]. It is also added to sulfured [[molasses]].

===In winemaking===
Sulfur dioxide was first used in [[winemaking]] by the Romans, when they discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels keeps them fresh and free from vinegar smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|publisher=www.practicalwinery.com|date=1 Feb 2009|title=Practical Winery &amp; vineyard Journal Jan/Feb 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928111625/http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still an important compound in winemaking, and is measured in [[parts per million]] (''ppm'') in wine. It is present even in so-called unsulfurated wine at concentrations of up to 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morethanorganic.com/sulphur-in-the-bottle Sulphites in wine], MoreThanOrganic.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as an [[antibiotic]] and [[antioxidant]], protecting wine from spoilage by bacteria and oxidation - a phenomenon that leads to the browning of the wine and a loss of cultivar specific flavors.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, R.S. (2008) Wine science: principles and applications, Amsterdam; Boston: Elsevier/Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tifs.2014.11.004| title = Demonstrating the efficiency of sulphur dioxide replacements in wine: A parameter review| journal = Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology| volume = 42| pages = 27| year = 2015| last1 = Guerrero| first1 = Raúl F| last2 = Cantos-Villar| first2 = Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its antimicrobial action also helps minimize volatile acidity. Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with "containing [[sulfite]]s".

Sulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations below 10 ppm do not require "contains sulfites" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and rosé wines. In low concentrations, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations over 50 ppm, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt; a mixture of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery &amp; Vineyard Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a reducing agent===
Sulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is not present to any extent.  However, such solutions do show spectra of the hydrogen sulfite ion, HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, by reaction with water, and it is in fact the actual reducing agent present:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

===Biochemical and biomedical roles===
Sulfur dioxide is toxic in large amounts.  It or its conjugate base bisulfite is produced biologically as an intermediate in both sulfate-reducing organisms and in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as well. The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=D. |url=http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |title=Sulfur dioxide: a novel gaseous signal in the regulation of cardiovascular functions |journal=Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1039–1045 |pmid=20540708 |last2=Jin |first2=H |last3=Tang |first3=C |last4=Du |first4=J |doi=10.2174/1389557511009011039 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426082343/http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the [[pulmonary stretch receptors]] and abolishes the [[Hering–Breuer reflex|Hering–Breuer inflation reflex]].

It was shown that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a role in diminishing an experimental [[lung]] damage caused by [[oleic acid]]. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an [[enzyme]] that produces endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding [[acetylcysteine]] or [[glutathione]] to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen S, Zheng S, Liu Z, Tang C, Zhao B, Du J, Jin H |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in association with inhibition of oxidative stress in rats.|journal=Lab. Invest.|date=Feb 2015|volume=95|issue=2|pages=142–156|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2014.147|pmid=25581610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating [[cardiac]] and [[blood vessel]] function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as [[arterial hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], [[stenocardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian H.|title=Advances in the study on endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Chin Med J|date=Nov 2014|volume=127|issue=21|pages=3803–3807|pmid=25382339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of [[homocysteine]] is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yang R, Yang Y, Dong X, Wu X, Wei Y |title=Correlation between endogenous sulfur dioxide and homocysteine in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease|language=chinese|journal=Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi|date=Aug 2014|volume=52|issue=8|pages=625–629|pmid=25224243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] rate of endothelial [[smooth muscle]] cells in blood vessels, via lowering the [[MAPK]] activity and activating [[adenylyl cyclase]] and [[protein kinase A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu D, Huang Y, Bu D, Liu AD, Holmberg L, Jia Y, Tang C, Du J, Jin H |title=Sulfur dioxide inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via suppressing the Erk/MAP kinase pathway mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling|journal=Cell Death Dis.|date=May 2014|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e1251|doi=10.1038/cddis.2014.229|pmid=24853429|pmc=4047873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their [[stenosis]], so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent [[vasodilation]]. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating and bronchodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent [[calcium channel]]s and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang XB, Jin HF, Tang CS, Du JB |title=The biological effect of endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|date=16 Nov 2011|volume=670|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.031|pmid=21925165|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by [[isoproterenol]] [[adrenergic]] hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liang Y, Liu D, Ochs T, Tang C, Chen S, Zhang S, Geng B, Jin H, Du J |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and increases myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats.|journal=Lab.

===As a refrigerant===
Being easily condensed and possessing a high [[heat of evaporation]], sulfur dioxide is a candidate material for refrigerants.  Prior to the development of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, sulfur dioxide was used as a [[refrigerant]] in [[refrigeration#Home and consumer use|home refrigerators]].

===As a reagent and solvent in the laboratory===
Sulfur dioxide is a versatile inert solvent widely used for dissolving highly oxidizing salts.  It is also used occasionally as a source of the sulfonyl group in [[organic synthesis]].  Treatment of aryl [[diazonium salt]]s with sulfur dioxide and cuprous chloride yields the corresponding aryl sulfonyl chloride, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Hoffman, R. V. | title = m-Trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl Chloride | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 508 | year = 1990| prep = CV7P0508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Preparation of m-trifluoromethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.svg|frameless|upright=2.25]]

=== Proposed use in climate engineering ===
[[Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|Injections of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere]] has been proposed in [[climate engineering]]. The cooling effect would be similar to what has been observed after the large explosive volcano eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo#Global environmental effects|Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991. However this form of geoengineering would have uncertain regional consequences on rainfall patterns, for example in [[monsoon]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke L., K. Jiang, K. Akimoto, M. Babiker, G.

Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/ Sulfur Dioxide]. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat suitability for plant communities, as well as animal life.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (2010). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 "Abiotic factor"] in ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland (eds.). National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to [[acid rain]] and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the [[United States|US]] EPA’s [[Acid Rain Program]], the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002.  This improvement resulted in part from [[flue-gas desulfurization]], a technology that enables SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be chemically bound in [[power plant]]s burning sulfur-containing [[coal]] or [[Petroleum|oil]]. In particular, [[calcium oxide|calcium oxide (lime)]] reacts with sulfur dioxide to form [[calcium sulfite]]:
:CaO + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →  CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Aerobic oxidation of the CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [[anhydrite]].  Most gypsum sold in Europe comes from flue-gas desulfurization.

Sulfur can be removed from coal during burning by using limestone as a bed material in [[fluidized bed combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindeburg |first=Michael R. |title=Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam |location=Belmont, C.A. |publisher=Professional Publications, Inc |year=2006 |pages=27–3 |isbn=978-1-59126-049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur can also be removed from fuels before burning, preventing formation of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the fuel is burnt. The [[Claus process]] is used in refineries to produce sulfur as a byproduct.  The [[Stretford process]] has also been used to remove sulfur from fuel. [[Redox]] processes using iron oxides can also be used, for example, Lo-Cat&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100304170107/http://www.gtp-merichem.com/support/index.php FAQ’s About Sulfur Removal and Recovery using the LO-CAT® Hydrogen Sulfide Removal System]. gtp-merichem.com&lt;/ref&gt; or Sulferox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/gasification/pubs/pdf/SFA%20Pacific_Process%20Screening%20Analysis_Dec%202002.pdf Process screening analysis of alternative gas treating and sulfur removal for gasification].

[[File:SulufrDioxide2017.png|thumb|Sulfur dioxide in the world on April 15th, 2017. Note that sulfur dioxide moves through the atmosphere with prevailing winds and thus local sulfur dioxide distributions vary day to day with weather patterns and seasonality.]]
Fuel additives such as [[calcium]] additives and magnesium carboxylate may be used in marine engines to lower the emission of sulfur dioxide gases into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;May, Walter R.  [http://www.fuelspec.com/library/Marine%20Emissions%20Abatement.pdf Marine Emissions Abatement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130001/http://www.fuelspec.com/library/Marine%20Emissions%20Abatement.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}. SFA International, Inc., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, [[China]] was the world's largest sulfur dioxide polluter, with 2005 emissions estimated to be {{convert|25,490,000|ST|Mt|sigfig=3}}. This amount represents a 27% increase since 2000, and is roughly comparable with U.S. emissions in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news78159898.html China has its worst spell of acid rain], [[United Press International]] (2006-09-22).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inhalation===
Inhaling sulfur dioxide is associated with increased respiratory symptoms and disease, difficulty in breathing, and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/sulfurdioxide/ Sulfur Dioxide][broken link] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] reduced the [[short-term exposure limit]] to 0.25 [[parts per million]] (ppm). The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] [[Permissible exposure limit|PEL]] is currently set at 5 ppm (13 &amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) time-weighted average. [[NIOSH]] has set the [[IDLH]] at 100 ppm.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0575.html |title=NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the [[EPA]] "revised the primary SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[NAAQS]] by establishing a new one-hour standard at a level of 75 [[parts per billion|parts per billion (ppb)]]. EPA revoked the two existing primary standards because they would not provide additional public health protection given a one-hour standard at 75 ppb."&lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;

A 2011 [[systematic review]] concluded that exposure to sulfur dioxide is associated with [[preterm birth]].&lt;ref name="Shah-2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Air pollution and birth outcomes: a systematic review | journal = Environ Int | volume = 37 | pages = 498–516 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.009 | pmid = 21112090 | author = Shah PS, Balkhair T, Knowledge Synthesis Group on Determinants of Preterm/LBW Births | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TeslaPowerwall2-2.jpg|thumb|Tesla Powerwall 2]]
The '''Powerwall''' and '''Powerpack''' are [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[lithium-ion battery]] stationary [[energy storage]] products manufactured by [[Tesla, Inc.]] The Powerwall is intended to be used for [[home energy storage]] and stores electricity for solar [[Domestic energy consumption|self-consumption]], [[load management|time of use load shifting]], [[Emergency power system|backup power]], and [[off-the-grid]] use.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Debord |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/here-comes-teslas-missing-piece-battery-announcement-2015-4 |title=Elon Musk's big announcement: it's called 'Tesla Energy' |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=May 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Powerpack is intended for commercial or [[electric utility]] [[electrical grid|grid]] use and can be used for peak shaving, load shifting, backup power, demand response, microgrids, renewable power integration, frequency regulation, and voltage control.

Announced in 2015, with a pilot demonstration of 500 units built and installed during 2015, production of the product was initially at the Tesla Fremont factory before being moved to the under-construction [[Gigafactory 1]] in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=teslaGigafactory20160605&gt;

=== Example of Powerpack installation ===
Tesla installed a [[Battery storage power station|grid storage facility]] for [[Southern California Edison]] with a capacity of 80 MWh at a power of 20 MW between September 2016 and December 2016. {{asof|2017|01}} the storage unit was one of the largest accumulator batteries on the market. Tesla installed 400 Powerpack-2 modules at the Mira Loma transformer station in California. The battery storage serves to store energy at a low network load and then to feed this energy back into the grid at peak load. The principal way of adding peak generation capacity prior to this was the use of [[Peaking power plant|
gas-fired power stations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/news/powerpack-tesla-nimmt-netzspeicher-in-kalifornien-in-betrieb-1701-125793.html ''Tesla nimmt Netzspeicher in Kalifornien in Betrieb''] In: golem.de. 25 January 2017, retrieved, 27 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://electrek.co/2017/01/23/tesla-mira-loma-powerpack-station-southern-california-edison/ ''Tesla quietly brings online its massive – biggest in the world – 80 MWh Powerpack station with Southern California Edison''] In: electrek.co. 23 January 2017, retrieved, 27 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==
The first generation Powerwall has a 6.4&amp;nbsp;kWh capacity for daily cycle applications. Users with larger energy needs can connect multiple Powerwalls to expand the capacity even higher.&lt;ref name="tpw" /&gt; In March 2016 Tesla quietly discontinued a previously announced 10&amp;nbsp;kWh capacity model designed to produce backup power &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Tesla-Discontinues-10kWh-Powerwall-Home-Battery |title=Tesla Discontinues 10-Kilowatt-Hour Powerwall Home Battery |first=Julia |last=Pyper |work=Greentech Media |location=US |date=March 18, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the 6.4 kWh version can also be configured to act as backup power.

The Powerpack is a bigger unit with 100&amp;nbsp;kWh (first generation) and 210 kWh (2nd generation) of storage for commercial and utility grid use. To meet the variety of energy needs in industry, "Powerpack is infinitely scalable", said Elon Musk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Elon Musk's Grand Plan to Power the World With Batteries |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/tesla-batteries/ |website=WIRED |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's objective is to "fundamentally change the way the world uses energy"&lt;ref name="BloombergDream" /&gt; by "fostering a clean energy ecosystem and helping wean the world off fossil fuels"&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt; using backup energy storage for renewable energy. The Powerpack 2 has 200&amp;nbsp;kWh of storage, probably using the [[List of battery sizes#Cylindrical lithium-ion rechargeable battery|2170 cell]] by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/10/07/tesla-powerpack-2-0-doubling-energy-capacity-new-battery-cell-2170-gigafactory/ |title=Tesla is doubling the energy capacity of the Powerpack with new battery cells from the Gigafactory |first=Fred |last=Lambert |work=Electrek |location=US |accessdate=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The Powerwall is optimized for daily cycling, such as for load shifting. Tesla uses proprietary technology for packaging and cooling the cells in packs with liquid coolant.&lt;ref name=2015ecP6&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13142191/6/tesla-motors-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2015-conference-call-transcript.html |title=Tesla Motors (TSLA) Earnings Report: Q1 2015 Conference Call Transcript |work=TheStreet |page=6 |date=May 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511010017/http://www.thestreet.com/story/13142191/6/tesla-motors-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2015-conference-call-transcript.html |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elon Musk]], the chairman, CEO and product architect of the Tesla company, promised not to start patent infringement lawsuits against anyone who, in [[good faith]], used Tesla's technology for Powerwalls as he had promised with Tesla cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/tesla-s-powerwall-event-the-11-most-important-facts |title=Fight Is Promised Over G.M.

== Return on investment calculations ==
A May 2015 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine calculated that using a Tesla Powerwall 1 model combined with solar panels in a home would cost 30 cents/kWh for electricity if a home remains connected to the grid (the article acknowledges that the Tesla battery could make economic sense in applications that are entirely off-grid). US consumers got electricity from the power grid for 12.5 cents/kWh on average. The article concluded the "...Tesla's Powerwall Is Just Another Toy For Rich Green People."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Helman |first=Christopher |date=May 1, 2015 |title=Why Tesla's Powerwall Is Just Another Toy For Rich Green People |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/05/01/why-teslas-powerwall-is-just-another-toy-for-rich-green-people/ |newspaper=Forbes |location= |accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]&lt;ref name = BloombergDream&gt;{{cite news |last=Randall |first=Tom |date=May 21, 2015 |title=Your Home Doesn't Matter for Tesla's Dream of a Battery-Powered Planet |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-21/your-home-doesn-t-matter-for-tesla-s-dream-of-a-battery-powered-planet |newspaper=Bloomberg Business |location=|access-date= June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catalytic Engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bruce |first1=Lin |last2=Klippenstein |first2=Matthew |date=May 8, 2015 |title=Top Ten Facts about Tesla's $350/kWh (DC) PowerWall battery |url=http://www.catalyticengineering.com/top-ten-facts-about-teslas-350kwh-powerwall-battery/ |newspaper=Catalytic Engineering |location=|access-date= June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also agreed that the Tesla system was most useful in places where electricity prices are high.

There are however a number of such locations, including Hawaii and other remote islands that generate electricity with shipped-in or flown-in fuels. Residential California PG&amp;E customers pay as much as 40 cents/kWh if they reach Tier 3 in electrical usage.
Arctic and sub-Arctic locations with high energy prices cannot generate sufficient solar energy in the winter due to little or no sunlight.

The Swiss bank [[UBS]] said that the Powerwall makes sense in Australia and Germany where electricity is very costly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/ubs-tesla-powerwall-can-deliver-6-year-payback-in-australia-63386 |title=UBS: Tesla Powerwall can deliver 6-year payback in Australia |first=Giles |last=Parkinson |work=Renew Economy |date=May 19, 2015 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but solar panels are well distributed.

As of November 2016, the cost to install one Powerwall 2 starts at AU$8,750 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/powerwall?redirect=no&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia or US$1,600 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tesla.com/powerwall&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, the cost to install one Powerwall 1 is US$3,000 (sized for residential use), while the cost to install one Powerwall 2 jumped to US$5,500 (larger capacity but still residential-size, will run many homes for 2 or 3 days without outside power if fully charged).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Trimdon Grange Wind Farm''' is an [[Wind farm#Onshore|onshore wind farm]] near [[Trimdon Grange]], [[County Durham]], [[England]]. Commissioned in October 2008 it consists of four 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[Nordex]] N60 [[Wind turbine|turbines]] giving a total capacity of 5.2&amp;nbsp;MW. It was developed by [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and is operated by [[Cumbria Wind Farms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102132011/http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewindpower.net/wind-farm-1531-trimdon-grange-nordex-n60-1300.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed location of the wind farm caused controversy in 2004 when an agent of [[Tony Blair]], then [[Prime Minister]], wrote to a local action group, Trimdon Area Group Against Wind Farms, claiming that the site was unsuitable. The location is about one mile from Tony Blair's old constituency house.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/wind-farms-not-on-the-prime-ministers-doorstep-thanks-689504.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">The '''tubular pinch effect''' is a phenomenon in [[fluid mechanics]], which has importance in [[membrane technology]].

Mark C. Porter first suspected that the pinch effect was responsible for the return of separated particles into the core flow by the membrane. This effect was first demonstrated in 1956 by G. Sergé and A. Silberberg. They had been working with dilute suspensions of spherical particles in pipelines. While the particle was flowing through the pipeline, it appeared to migrate away from the pipe axis and pipe wall and reach equilibrium in a radial eccentric position. 
[[File:Pinch-Effekt (Rohr) DE.svg | thumb|Radial distribution of the particle concentration c in a tube during the flow-through]]

If:
{|Class="wikitable"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; ||radial velocity component of a particle
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d_T&lt;/math&gt; ||tube diameter
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; ||particle diameter
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; ||equilibrium radius
|-
|&lt;math&gt;w^*&lt;/math&gt; ||mean flow velocity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt; ||[[Reynolds number]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; ||radius
|}

then the pinch effect follows the relation:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{p}=0{,}17 \cdot w^* \cdot Re \cdot {\left( \frac{d_\text{p}}{d_\text{T}} \right)} ^{2{,}84} \cdot \frac{2r}{d_\text{T}}\cdot \left(1 - \frac{r}{r^*}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This effect is of importance in [[cross-flow filtration]] and especially in [[dialysis]]. It is significant especially for particles with a diameter of 5&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] and for particles which follow [[laminar flow]] conditions and slows down the process of [[filter cake]] formation, which prolongs the service life and the filtering stays permanently high.

[[File:Thames barges today - geograph.org.uk - 419034.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Walbrook Wharf and Cannon Street station]]
'''Walbrook Wharf''' is an operating freight wharf in the [[Port of London]] located in the [[City of London]] adjacent to [[Cannon Street station]]. It has [[safeguarded wharf]] status by the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[Port of London Authority]] (PLA).

It is used as a waste transfer station owned by the [[City of London Corporation]] and operated by [[Cory Environmental]]. Refuse from central London is transferred onto barges for transport to the [[Belvedere Incinerator]] in the [[London Borough of Bexley]].

Walbrook Wharf was formerly arranged as a dock, but modern containerised loading has resulted in the infilling of the dock. The wharf is the point where the ancient stream, the [[Walbrook]] fed into the Thames, a location also known as [[Dowgate]].

The riverside walk runs along Walbrook Wharf and is only closed to pedestrians at this point when waste is being transferred onto barges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20080">[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of the [[chemical equation]] of the [[electrolysis of water]], a form of water splitting.]]

'''Water splitting''' is the [[chemical reaction]] in which [[water]] is broken down into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]]:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Efficient and economical photochemical water splitting would be a technological breakthrough that could underpin a [[hydrogen economy]].  A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but hydrogen is not produced. No practical version of water splitting has been demonstrated, but the two component reactions (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production) are well known.  The reverse of water splitting is the basis of the [[hydrogen fuel cell]].

== Electrolysis ==
{{Main article|Electrolysis of water}}
[[File:Electrolyser, front, B.jpg|thumb|Electrolyser front with electrical panel in foreground]]
[[Electrolysis of water]] is the decomposition of [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to an [[electricity|electric current]] being passed through the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauch, A.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Mogensen, M.|title=Highly Efficient high temperature electrolysis|journal=J. Mater. Chem.|year=2008|volume=18|pages=2331–2340|doi=10.1039/b718822f}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[File:Vion radiant energy US Patent 28793.png|thumb|upright|[[Atmospheric electricity]] utilization for the chemical reaction in which water is separated into oxygen and hydrogen. (Image via: Vion, US patent 28793. June 1860.)]]
* Vion, {{US patent|28793}}, "Improved method of using atmospheric electricity", June 1860.

In [[power to gas]] production schemes, the excess power or off peak power created by wind generators or solar arrays is used for load balancing of the energy grid by storing and later injecting the hydrogen into the natural gas grid.

[[File:Hydrogen-challenger hg.jpg|thumb|''|Electrolysis of water ship [[Hydrogen Challenger]]'']]
Production of hydrogen from water is energy intensive. Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. In contrast with low-temperature electrolysis, [[high-temperature electrolysis]] (HTE) of water converts more of the initial [[heat]] energy into chemical energy (hydrogen), potentially doubling [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]] to about 50%. Because some of the energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so the process is more efficient.

==Water splitting in photosynthesis ==
A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but the electrons are shunted, not to protons, but to the electron transport chain in [[photosystem II]].  The electrons are used to convert carbon dioxide into sugars.

When photosystem I gets photo-excited, electron transfer reactions gets initiated, which results in reduction of a series of electron acceptors, eventually reducing NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH and PS I is oxidized. The oxidized photosystem I captures electrons from photosystem II through a series of steps involving agents like plastoquinone, cytochromes and plastocyanine. The photosystem II then brings about water oxidation resulting in evolution of oxygen, the reaction being catalyzed by CaMn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; clusters embedded in complex protein environment; the complex is known as oxygen evolving complex (OEC).&lt;ref&gt;Yano, J.; Kern, J.; Sauer, K.; Latimer, M. J.; Pushkar, Y.; Biesiadka, J.; Loll, B.; Saenger, W.; Messinger, J.; Zouni, A.; Yachandra, V. K., Where Water Is Oxidized to Dioxygen: Structure of the Photosynthetic Mn(4)Ca Cluster.

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|frame|An [[algae bioreactor]] for hydrogen production.]]
In [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|biological hydrogen production]], the electrons produced by the photosystem are shunted not to a chemical synthesis apparatus but to [[hydrogenase]]s, resulting in formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This biohydrogen is produced in an [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress08/ii_f_2_melis.pdf DOE 2008 Report 25 %]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoelectrochemical water splitting==
{{Main article|photoelectrochemical cell|artificial photosynthesis}}
Using electricity produced by [[photovoltaic]] systems potentially offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen, other than nuclear, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric.  Again, water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis, but the electrical energy is obtained by a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] (PEC) process.  The system is also named [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14441-electrode-lights-the-way-to-artificial-photosynthesis.html Electrode lights the way to artificial photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21155/?a=f Solar-Power Breakthrough: Researchers have found a cheap and easy way to store the energy made by solar power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swegene.com/pechouse-a-proposed-cell-solar-hydrogen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |last2= Ishikawa |first2= A. |last3= Domen |first3= K. |date=May 2009|last4= Villoria De La Mano |first4= J.A.|last5= Sánchez-Sánchez|first5= M.C.|last6= González|first6= I.D.|last7= Herreras|first7= S.|last8= Mota|first8= N.|last9= Rivas|first9= M.E. |title= Influence of Zn concentration in the activity of Cd1-xZnxS solid solutions for water splitting under visible light |journal= Catalysis Today |volume= 143 |issue= 1–2 |pages= 51–59 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.024 |bibcode= |ref=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photocatalytic water splitting==
{{Main article|Photocatalytic water splitting}}
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of water splitting process is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water rather than a photovoltaic or an electrolytic system, the reaction takes place in one step, it therefore can be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |date=Jun 2009|last2= Álvarez Galván |first2= M.

==Thermal decomposition of water==
{{Main article|Thermochemical cycle}}
In [[thermolysis]], water molecules split into their atomic components [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. For example, at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C about three percent of all H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are dissociated into various combinations of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, mostly H, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and OH. Other reaction products like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remain minor. At the very high temperature of 3000&amp;nbsp;°C more than half of the water molecules are decomposed, but at ambient temperatures only one molecule in 100 trillion dissociates by the effect of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Hydrogen Energy |volume=26 |year=2001 |pages=185pp |title=Thermochemical hydrogen production: past and present |doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(00)00062-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperatures and material constraints have limited the applications of this approach.

===Nuclear-thermal===
{{see also|NGNP}}
Some prototype [[Generation IV reactor]]s, such as the [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], operate at 850 to 1000 [[degrees Celsius]], considerably hotter than existing commercial [[nuclear power]] plants. [[General Atomics]] predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor ([[HTGR]]) would cost $1.53/[[kilogram|kg]]. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. At {{As of|2005|alt=2005}} gas prices, hydrogen cost $2.70/kg.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Hence, just within the United States, a savings of tens of billions of dollars per year is possible with a nuclear-powered supply. Much of this savings would translate into reduced oil and natural gas imports.

One side benefit of a nuclear reactor that produces both [[electricity]] and hydrogen is that it can shift production between the two. For instance, the plant might produce electricity during the day and hydrogen at night, matching its electrical generation profile to the daily variation in demand. If the hydrogen can be produced economically, this scheme would compete favorably with existing [[grid energy storage]] schemes. What is more, there is sufficient hydrogen demand in the [[United States]] that all daily peak generation could be handled by such plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075457/http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid thermoelectric [[Copper-chlorine cycle]] is a [[cogeneration]] system using the [[waste heat]] from nuclear reactors, specifically the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[supercritical water reactor]].&lt;ref name=Naterer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naterer |first=G. F. |title=Recent Canadian Advances in Nuclear-Based Hydrogen Production and the Thermochemical Cu-Cl Cycle |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=2901–2917 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.090 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar-thermal===

The high temperatures necessary to split water can be achieved through the use of [[concentrating solar power]].  [[Hydrosol-2]] is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°C to split water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to [[heliostat]] fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/&lt;/ref&gt;

Material constraints due to the required high temperatures are reduced by the design of a membrane reactor with simultaneous extraction of hydrogen and oxygen that exploits a defined thermal gradient and the fast diffusion of hydrogen. With concentrated sunlight as heat source and only water in the reaction chamber, the produced gases are very clean with the only possible contaminant being water. A "Solar Water Cracker" with a concentrator of about 100 m² can produce almost one kilogram of hydrogen per sunshine hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2powersystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its comprehension has been made possible ever since the discovery of water electrolysis by means of the titanium dioxide. [[Artificial photosynthesis]] is a research field that attempts to replicate the natural process of photosynthesis, converting sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. Recently, this has been successful in splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an artificial compound called [[Nafion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/mu-mtl081408.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-temperature electrolysis]] (also HTE or [[steam electrolysis]]) is a method currently being investigated for the production of hydrogen from water with oxygen as a by-product. Other research includes [[thermolysis]] on defective [[carbon]] substrates, thus making hydrogen production possible at temperatures just under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[iron oxide cycle]] is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The iron oxide cycle consists of two [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is [[water]] and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The iron oxide process requires an efficient source of heat.

The [[sulfur-iodine cycle]] (S-I cycle) is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The S-I cycle consists of three [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is water and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The S-I process requires an efficient source of heat.

More than 352 [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] cycles have been described for water splitting or [[thermolysis]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf 353 Thermochemical cycles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shgr.unlv.edu/stchNew/source/login.asp UNLV Thermochemical cycle automated scoring database (public)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles promise to produce hydrogen  oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.&lt;ref name="Developmentof"&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water]&lt;/ref&gt; Since all the input energy for such processes is heat, they can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis. This is because the efficiency of electricity production is inherently limited. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.

For all the thermochemical processes, the summary reaction is that of the decomposition of water:
:&lt;chem&gt; 2H2O &lt;=&gt;[\stackrel{}\ce{Heat}] {2H2} + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
All other reagents are recycled. None of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels, although several have been demonstrated in laboratories.

There is also research into the viability of nanoparticles and catalysts to lower the temperature at which water splits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoptek.com/ Naoptek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/hydrogen-production-breakthrough-from-mit-a-giant-leap.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Windscale fire''' of 10 October 1957 was the worst nuclear accident in Great Britain's history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref name="Richard Black"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12789749 |title=Fukushima - disaster or distraction? |author=Richard Black |date=18 March 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire took place in Unit 1 of the two-pile Windscale facility on the northwest coast of England in [[Cumberland]] (now [[Sellafield]], [[Cumbria]]). The two [[graphite-moderated reactor]]s, referred to at the time as "piles", had been built as part of the British post-war [[High Explosive Research|atomic bomb project]]. Windscale Pile No. 1 was operational in October 1950 followed by Pile No. 2 in June 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = Editorial | url = | journal = J. Radiol.

The fire burned for three days and there was a release of [[radioactive contamination]] that spread across the UK and Europe.&lt;ref name="bbc-7030536"/&gt; Of particular concern at the time was the radioactive isotope [[iodine-131]], which may lead to [[Thyroid cancer|cancer of the thyroid]], and it has been estimated that the incident caused 240 additional cancer cases.&lt;ref name="bbc-7030536" /&gt; No one was evacuated from the surrounding area, but there was a worry that milk might be dangerously contaminated.

==Background==
The December 1938 discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]]—and its explanation and naming by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]]—raised the possibility that an extremely powerful [[atomic bomb]] could be created.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=23–29}} During the [[Second World War]], Frisch and [[Rudolf Peierls]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] calculated the [[critical mass]] of a metallic sphere of pure [[uranium-235]], and found that as little as {{convert|1|to|10|kg}} might explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39–41}} In response, the British government initiated an atomic bomb project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108–111}} The August 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] merged Tube Alloys with the American [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=173–177}} As overall head of the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project]], [[James Chadwick]] forged a close and successful partnership with the Americans,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=236–239}} and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=242}}

After the war ended the [[Special Relationship]] between Britain and the United States "became very much less special".{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=93}} The British government had trusted that America would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery,{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} but little information was exchanged immediately after the war,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=111}} and the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) officially ended technical cooperation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106–108}} The British government saw this as a resurgence of [[United States isolationism]] akin to that which had occurred after the [[First World War]]. This raised the possibility that Britain might have to fight an aggressor alone.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=94–95}} It also feared that Britain might lose its [[great power]] status, and therefore its influence in world affairs,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181–184}} The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Clement Attlee]], set up a [[United Kingdom cabinet committee|cabinet sub-committee]], the [[Gen 75 Committee]] (known informally as the "Atomic Bomb Committee"),{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=21}} on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a renewed nuclear weapons programme.{{sfn|Baylis|Stoddart|2015|p=32}}

The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] to the Ministry of Supply on 1 November 1945,{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=417}} and [[Lord Portal]] was appointed Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE), with direct access to the Prime Minister. An [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (AERE) was established at [[RAF Harwell]], south of [[Oxford]], under the directorship of [[John Cockcroft]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=40–43}} [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]] agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new nuclear weapons facilities,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=41}} which included a uranium metal plant at [[Springfields]] in [[Lancashire]],{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=370–371}} and [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[plutonium]] processing facilities at [[Windscale]] in [[Cumbria]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=400–407}} He established his headquarters in a former [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] at [[ROF Risley|Risley]] in Lancashire on 4 February 1946.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=41}}

In July 1946, the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] recommended that Britain acquire nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|pp=16–18}} They estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=216}} The 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, a subcommittee of the Gen 75 Committee, agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs, and endorsed Portal's proposal to place Penney, now the Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR) at [[Fort Halstead]] in Kent, in charge of the development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181–184}} which was codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=24, 48, 57}} Penney contended that "the discriminative test for a first-class power is whether it has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to pass the test or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally."{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|p=500}}

==Windscale Piles==
{{main|Windscale Piles}}
[[File:Windscale-reactor.svg|thumb|right|The design of Windscale Pile No. 1, with one of the many fuel channels illustrated]]
[[File:EN-302px-Reaktor Windscale-schemat.png|thumb|right|Cutaway diagram of Windscale reactor]]
Through their participation in the wartime Tube Alloys and Manhattan Project, British scientists had considerable knowledge of the production of [[fissile]] materials. The Americans had created two kinds: [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]], and had pursued three different methods of [[uranium enrichment]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=10-12}} An early decision had to be made as to whether High Explosive Research should concentrate on uranium-235 or plutonium. While everyone would have liked to pursue every avenue, like the Americans had, it was doubtful whether the cash-strapped post-war British economy could afford the money or the skilled manpower that this would require. The scientists who had remained in Britain favoured uranium-235, but those who had been working in America were strongly in favour of plutonium. They estimated that a uranium-235 bomb would require ten times the fissile material as one using plutonium to produce half the [[TNT equivalent]]. Estimates of the cost of nuclear reactors varied, but it was reckoned that a uranium enrichment plant would cost ten times as much to produce the same number of atomic bombs as a reactor. The decision was therefore taken in favour of plutonium.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=165-167}}

The reactors were built in a short time near the village of [[Seascale]], [[Cumberland]]. They were known as Windscale Pile 1 and Pile 2, housed in large concrete buildings a few hundred feet apart. The core of the reactors consisted of a large block of [[graphite]] with horizontal channels drilled through it for the fuel cartridges. Each cartridge consisted of a uranium rod about {{convert|30|cm}} long encased in an aluminium canister to protect it from the air, as uranium becomes highly reactive when hot and can catch fire. The cartridge was finned, allowing heat exchange with the environment to cool the fuel rods while they were in the reactor. Rods were pushed in the front of the core, the "charge face", with new rods being added at a calculated rate. This pushed the other cartridges in the channel towards the rear of the reactor, eventually causing them to fall out the back, the "discharge face", into a water filled channel where they cooled and could be collected.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=19:15}} The chain reaction in the core converted the uranium into a variety of isotopes, including some plutonium, which was separated from the other materials using chemical processing. As this plutonium was intended for [[Isotopes of plutonium#Pu-240 as obstacle to nuclear weapons|weapons purposes]], the [[burnup]] of the fuel would have been kept low to reduce production of the heavier plutonium isotopes like [[plutonium-240]] and [[plutonium-241]].

The design initially called for the core to be cooled like the [[B Reactor]], which used a constant supply of water that poured through the channels in the graphite. There was considerable concern that such a system was subject to catastrophic failure in the event of a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. This would cause the reactor to run out of control in seconds, potentially exploding. At [[Hanford Site|Hanford]], this possibility was dealt with by constructing a 30-mile (48-km) escape road to evacuate the staff were this to occur, abandoning the site.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=19:50}} Lacking any location where a 30-mile area could be abandoned if a similar event were to occur in the UK, the designers desired a passively safe cooling system. In place of water, they used air cooling driven by convection through a 400-foot (120-m) tall chimney, which could create enough airflow to cool the reactor under normal operating conditions. The chimney was arranged so it pulled air through the channels in the core, cooling the fuel via fins on the cartridges. For additional cooling, huge fans were positioned in front of the core, which could greatly increase the airflow rate.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=20:40}}

During construction, Terence Price, one of the many physicists working on the project, began to consider what would happen if one of the fuel cartridges being pushed out the back of the core were to break open. This could happen, for example, if a new cartridge being inserted was pushed too hard, causing the one at the back of the channel to fall past the relatively narrow water channel and strike the floor behind it. In that event, the hot uranium could catch fire, with the fine uranium oxide dust being blown up the chimney to escape.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=22:15}} When he raised the issue at a meeting and suggested that filters be added to the chimneys, the concern was dismissed as being too difficult to deal with and was not even recorded in the minutes. Sir [[John Cockcroft]], leading the project team, was alarmed enough to order that filters be installed, which required them to be constructed on the ground while the chimneys were still being built, and then winched into position at the top once the chimney's concrete had set.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=22:30}} These became known as "[[Cockcroft's Folly]]" by workers and engineers.

In the end, Price's concerns came to pass. So many cartridges missed the water channel that it became routine for staff to walk through the chimney ductwork with shovels and scoop the cartridges back into the water.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=42.35}} On other occasions, fuel cartridges became stuck in the channels and burst open while still in the core.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=41.10}} In spite of these precautions and the stack filters, scientist Frank Leslie discovered radioactivity around the site and the village, but this information was kept secret, even from the staff at the station.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=41.45}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/04/nucl-a29.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wigner energy==
{{main|Wigner effect}}
Once commissioned and settled into operations, Pile 2 experienced a mysterious rise in core temperature. Unlike the Americans and the Soviets, the British had little experience with the behaviour of graphite when exposed to neutrons. Hungarian-American physicist [[Eugene Wigner]] had discovered that graphite, when bombarded by neutrons, suffers dislocations in its crystalline structure, causing a build-up of potential energy. This energy, if allowed to accumulate, could escape spontaneously in a powerful rush of heat.

The sudden bursts of energy worried the operators, who turned to the only viable solution, heating the reactor core in a process known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. When graphite is heated beyond 250&amp;nbsp;°C it becomes plastic, and the Wigner dislocations can relax into their natural state. This process was gradual and caused a uniform release which spread throughout the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/htgr/fulltext/manchester_07.pdf|title=INERT ANNEALING OF IRRADIATED GRAPHITE BY INDUCTIVE HEATING|author=W. BOTZEM, J. WÖRNER (NUKEM Nuklear GmbH, Alzenau, Germany)|date=2001-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tritium production==
[[Winston Churchill]] publicly committed the UK to building a [[hydrogen bomb]], and gave the scientists a tight schedule in which to do so. This was then hastened after the US and USSR began working on a test ban and possible disarmament agreements which would begin to take effect in 1958. To meet this deadline there was no chance of building a new reactor to produce the required [[tritium]], so the Windscale Pile 1 fuel loads were modified by adding [[enriched uranium]] and [[lithium]]-[[magnesium]], the latter of which would produce tritium during neutron bombardment.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=46.20}} All of these materials were highly flammable, and a number of the Windscale staff raised the issue of the inherent dangers of the new fuel loads. These concerns were brushed aside.

When their [[Operation Grapple#Individual explosions|first H-bomb test]] failed, the decision was made to build a large fusion-boosted-fission weapon instead. This required huge quantities of tritium, five times as much, and it had to be produced as rapidly as possible as the test deadlines approached. To boost the production rates, they used a trick that had been successful in increasing plutonium production in the past; by reducing the size of the cooling fins on the fuel cartridges, the temperature of the fuel loads increased, which caused a small but useful increase in neutron enrichment rates. This time they also took advantage of the smaller fins by building larger interiors in the cartridges, allowing more fuel in each one. These changes triggered further warnings from the technical staff, which were again brushed aside. [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]], Windscale's director, left in frustration.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=49:45}}

After a first successful production run of tritium in Pile 1, the heat problem was presumed to be negligible and full-scale production began. But by raising the temperature of the reactor beyond the design specifications, the scientists had altered the normal distribution of heat in the core, causing hot spots to develop in Pile 1. These were not detected because the [[thermocouples]] used to measure the core temperatures were positioned based on the original heat distribution design, and were not measuring the parts of the reactor which became hottest.

==Accident==
===Ignition===
On 7 October 1957 operators of Pile 1 noticed that the reactor was heating up more than normal, and a Wigner release was ordered.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=57:20}} This had been carried out eight times in the past, and it was known that the cycle would cause the entire reactor core to heat up evenly. During this attempt the temperatures anomalously began falling across the reactor core, except in channel 2053, whose temperature was rising.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=58:20}} Concluding that 2053 was releasing energy but none of the others were, on the morning of 8 October the decision was made to try a second Wigner release. This attempt caused the temperature of the entire reactor to rise, indicating a successful release.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=59:00}}

Early in the morning of 10 October it was suspected that something unusual was going on. The temperature in the core was supposed to gradually fall as [[Wigner energy]] release ended, but the monitoring equipment showed something more ambiguous, and one thermocouple indicated that core temperature was instead rising. As this process continued, the temperature continued to rise and eventually reached 400&amp;nbsp;°C. In an effort to cool the pile, the cooling fans were sped up and airflow was increased. Radiation detectors in the chimney then indicated a release, and it was assumed that a cartridge had burst. This was not a fatal problem, and had happened in the past. Unknown to the operators, the cartridge had not just burst, but caught fire, and this was the source of the anomalous heating in channel 2053, not a Wigner release.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=1:00:30}}

===Fire===
Speeding up the fans increased the airflow in the channel, fanning the flames. The fire spread to surrounding fuel channels, and soon the radioactivity in the chimney was rapidly increasing.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=1:02:00}} A foreman, arriving for work, noticed smoke coming out of the chimney. The core temperature continued to rise, and the operators began to suspect the core was on fire.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=1:03:00}}

Operators tried to examine the pile with a remote scanner but it had jammed. Tom Hughes, second in command to the Reactor Manager, suggested examining the reactor personally and so he and another operator went to the charge face of the reactor, clad in protective gear. A fuel channel inspection plug was taken out close to a thermocouple registering high temperatures and it was then that the operators saw that the fuel was red hot.

"An inspection plug was taken out," said Tom Hughes in a later interview, "and we saw, to our complete horror, four channels of fuel glowing bright cherry red."

There was now no doubt that the reactor was on fire, and had been for almost 48 hours. Reactor Manager [[Tom Tuohy]]&lt;ref name="Tom Tuohy"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Windscale Manager who doused the flames of 1957 fire - Obituary in The Independent 2008-03-26 |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/thomas-tuohy-windscale-manager-who-doused-the-flames-of-the-1957-fire-800546.html |accessdate = 2008-03-27 | location=London | date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; donned full protective equipment and breathing apparatus and scaled the 80-foot (24-m) ladder to the top of the reactor building, where he stood atop the reactor lid to examine the rear of the reactor, the discharge face.  Here he reported a dull red luminescence visible, lighting up the void between the back of the reactor and the rear containment. Red hot fuel cartridges were glowing in the fuel channels on the discharge face. He returned to the reactor upper containment several times throughout the incident, at the height of which a fierce conflagration was raging from the discharge face and playing on the back of the reinforced concrete containment — concrete whose specifications required that it be kept below a certain temperature to prevent its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Arnold | first = L. | title = Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-0-333-65036-3 | page = 235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial fire fighting attempts===
Operators were unsure what to do about the fire. First they tried to blow the flames out by running the fans at maximum speed, but this fed the flames. Tom Hughes and his colleague had already created a [[fire break]] by ejecting some undamaged fuel cartridges from around the blaze, and Tom Tuohy suggested trying to eject some from the heart of the fire by bludgeoning the melted cartridges through the reactor and into the cooling pond behind it with scaffolding poles. This proved impossible and the fuel rods refused to budge, no matter how much force was applied.  The poles were withdrawn with their ends red hot; one returned dripping molten metal.  Hughes knew this had to be molten irradiated uranium, causing serious radiation problems on the charge hoist itself.

"It [the exposed fuel channel] was white hot," said Hughes' colleague on the charge hoist with him, "it was just white hot.  Nobody, I mean, nobody, can believe how hot it could possibly be."

===Carbon dioxide===
Next, the operators tried to extinguish the fire using [[carbon dioxide]]. The new gas-cooled [[Sellafield#Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] reactors on the site had just received a delivery of 25 tonnes of liquid carbon dioxide and this was rigged up to the charge face of Windscale Pile 1, but there were problems getting it to the fire in useful quantities.

"So we got this rigged up," Hughes recounted, "and we had this poor little tube of carbon dioxide and I had absolutely no hope it was going to work."

===Use of water===
On the morning of Friday 11 October, when the fire was at its worst, eleven tons of uranium were ablaze.  Temperatures were becoming extreme (one [[thermocouple]] registered 1,300&amp;nbsp;°C) and the biological shield around the stricken reactor was now in severe danger of collapse.  Faced with this crisis, Tuohy suggested using water.  This was risky, as molten metal oxidises in contact with water, stripping oxygen from the water molecules and leaving free hydrogen, which could mix with incoming air and explode, tearing open the weakened containment.  Faced with a lack of other options, the operators decided to go ahead with the plan.{{sfn|Windscale|loc=1:10:30}}

About a dozen fire hoses were hauled to the charge face of the reactor; their nozzles were cut off and the lines themselves connected to scaffolding poles and fed into fuel channels about a metre (roughly 3 feet) above the heart of the fire. Tuohy once again hauled himself onto the reactor shielding and ordered the water to be turned on, listening carefully at the inspection holes for any sign of a hydrogen reaction as the pressure was increased. The water was unsuccessful in extinguishing the fire, requiring further measures to be taken.

===Shutting off air===
Tuohy then ordered everyone out of the reactor building except himself and the Fire Chief in order to shut off all cooling and ventilating air entering the reactor. Tuohy then climbed up several times and reported watching the flames leaping from the discharge face slowly dying away.  During one of the inspections, he found that the inspection plates—which were removed with a metal hook to facilitate viewing of the discharge face of the core—were stuck fast.  This, he reported, was due to the fire trying to suck air in from wherever it could.

"I have no doubt it was even sucking air in through the chimney at this point to try and maintain itself," he remarked in an interview.

Finally he managed to pull the inspection plate away and was greeted with the sight of the fire dying away.

"First the flames went, then the flames reduced and the glow began to die down," he described, "I went up to check several times until I was satisfied that the fire was out.  I did stand to one side, sort of hopefully," he went on to say, "but if you're staring straight at the core of a shut down reactor you're going to get quite a bit of radiation." (Tuohy lived to the age of 90, despite his exposure.)

Water was kept flowing through the pile for a further 24 hours until it was completely cold.

The reactor tank itself has remained sealed since the accident and still contains about 15 tons of uranium fuel. It was thought that the remaining fuel could still reignite if disturbed, due to the presence of [[pyrophoric]] [[uranium hydride]] formed in the original water dousing.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/getting-to-the-core-issue/267995.article Getting to the core issue]", ''The Engineer'', 14 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, conducted as part of the decommissioning process, has ruled out this possibility.&lt;ref name=NuSAC-p18&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/iacs/nusac/131005/p18.pdf |format=PDF |title=Meeting of RG2 with Windscale Pile 1 Decommissioning Project Team |date=2005-09-29 |publisher=Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee |id=NuSAC(2005)P 18 |accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pile is not scheduled for final decommissioning until 2037.

==Aftermath==
===Radioactive release===
There was a release to atmosphere of radioactive material that spread across the UK and Europe.&lt;ref name="bbc-7030536"/&gt; The fire released an estimated 740 [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] (20,000 [[curie]]s) of [[iodine-131]], as well as 22 [[terabecquerel|TBq]] (594 curies) of [[caesium-137]] and 12,000 TBq (324,000 curies) of [[xenon-133]], among other radionuclides.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book |title=Radioactive releases in the environment: impact and assessment |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhB_jaj-uAgC&amp;pg=PA150 |author1=John R.

The presence of the chimney [[scrubber]]s at Windscale was credited with maintaining partial containment and thus minimizing the radioactive content of the smoke that poured from the chimney during the fire. These scrubbers were installed at great expense on the insistence of [[John Cockcroft]] and were known as [[Cockcroft's Folly]] until the 1957 fire.

===Health effects===
Of particular concern at the time was the radioactive isotope [[iodine-131]], which has a [[half-life]] of only 8 days but is taken up by the human body and stored in the [[thyroid]]. As a result, consumption of iodine-131 often leads to [[Thyroid cancer|cancer of the thyroid]]. Estimates of additional cancer cases and mortality resulting from the radiological release have varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2007/10/02/windscale_outside_feature.shtml |title=The view from outside Windscale in 1957 |date=2 October 2007 |website=[[BBC]] |accessdate=17 September 2013}} ''"No-one died in the fire but despite what the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|AEA]] said in 1957 about there being no risk to human health, it's now widely accepted that some deaths in the UK, and elsewhere in Europe, could have been caused by the release of the radioactivity. But the figures vary depending on which study you look at. Some have suggested 30, others around 100 and some well over that. Brian Wynne, professor of science studies at Lancaster University says the deaths are what are known as statistical deaths i.e. not actual named people and it will be always difficult to prove whether any one person died as a direct result of an incident like the fire."''&lt;/ref&gt;

No one was evacuated from the surrounding area, but there was concern that [[milk]] might be dangerously contaminated.  Milk from about 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of nearby countryside was destroyed (diluted a thousandfold and dumped in the Irish Sea) for about a month.  A 2010 study of workers directly involved in the cleanup—and thus expected to have seen the highest exposure rates—found no significant long term health effects from their involvement.&lt;ref name="iopscience-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience-2000"/&gt;

===Salvage operations===
The reactor was unsalvageable; where possible, the fuel rods were removed, and the reactor bioshield was sealed and left intact.  Approximately 6,700 fire-damaged fuel elements and 1,700 fire-damaged isotope cartridges remain in the pile.  The damaged reactor core was still slightly warm as a result of continuing nuclear reactions. In 2000 it was estimated that the core still contained
* 1470 [[terabecquerel|TBq]] (4.1 [[gram|g]]) of [[tritium]] (half-life 12 years),
* 213 TBq (69 g) of [[caesium-137]] (half-life 30 years),
* 189 TBq (37 g) each of [[strontium-90]] (half-life 29 years) and its daughter [[yttrium-90]],
* 9.12 TBq (4.0 kg) of [[plutonium-239]] (half-life 24,100 years),
* 1.14 TBq (0.29 g) of [[plutonium-241]] (half-life 14 years)
as well as smaller activities of other [[radionuclide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the levels and nature of the radioactivity remaining in the core can be seen at {{cite journal|last1=D.G. Pomfret|title=Safety and Dose Management During Decommissioning of a Fire Damaged Nuclear Reactor|journal=IRPA-10 Proceedings of the 10th International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association on Harmonization of Radiation, Human Life and the Ecosystem|date=2000|url=http://www.irpa.net/irpa10/cdrom/00322.pdf}} Table 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Windscale Pile 2, though undamaged by the fire, was considered too unsafe for continued use.  It was shut down shortly afterwards.  No air-cooled reactors have been built since.  The final removal of fuel from the damaged reactor was scheduled to begin in 2008 and to continue for a further four years.&lt;ref name=NuSAC-p18 /&gt;

Inspections showed that there had not been a graphite fire, and the damage to the graphite was localised, caused by severely overheated uranium fuel assemblies nearby.&lt;ref name=NuSAC-p18/&gt;

===Board of inquiry===
A [[Public inquiry|board of inquiry]] met under the chairmanship of [[William Penney, Baron Penney|Sir William Penney]] from 17 to 25 October 1957. Its report (the "Penney Report") was submitted to the Chairman of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] and formed the basis of the [[White paper#Government papers|Government White Paper]] submitted to Parliament in November 1957. The report itself was released at the [[Public Record Office]] in January 1988. In 1989 a revised transcript was released, following work to improve the transcription of the original recordings.&lt;ref name="bbc-7030281"&gt;{{Cite news

Penney reported on 26 October 1957, 16 days after the fire was extinguished&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2047059 When Windscale burned]&lt;/ref&gt; and reached four conclusions:

* The primary cause of the accident had been the second nuclear heating on 8 October, applied too soon and too rapidly.
* Steps taken to deal with the accident, once discovered, were "prompt and efficient and displayed considerable devotion to duty on the part of all concerned".
* Measures taken to deal with the consequences of the accident were adequate and there had been "no immediate damage to health of any of the public or of the workers at Windscale". It was most unlikely that any harmful effects would develop. But the report was very critical of technical and organisational deficiencies.
* A more detailed technical assessment was needed, leading to organisational changes, clearer responsibilities for health and safety, and better definition of radiation dose limits.

Those who had been directly involved in the events were heartened by Penney's conclusion that the steps taken had been "prompt and efficient" and had "displayed considerable devotion to duty". Some considered that the determination and courage shown by Thomas Tuohy, and the critical role he played in the aversion of complete disaster, had not been properly recognised. Tuohy died on 12 March 2008; he had never received any kind of public recognition for his decisive actions.&lt;ref name="Tom Tuohy" /&gt; The Board of Inquiry's report concluded officially that the fire had been caused by "an error of judgment" by the same people who then risked their lives to contain the blaze. It was later suggested by the grandson of [[Harold Macmillan]], Prime Minister at the time of the fire, that the US Congress might have vetoed plans of Macmillan and US president [[Dwight Eisenhower]] for joint nuclear weapons development if they had known that it was due to reckless decisions by the UK government, and that Macmillan had covered up what really happened.  Tuohy said of the officials who told the US that his staff had caused the fire that "they were a shower of bastards".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1582801/Tom-Tuohy.html The Telegraph: Tom Tuohy, obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windscale site was [[decontamination|decontaminated]] and is still in use. Part of the site was later renamed [[Sellafield]] after being transferred to [[BNFL]]; the whole site is now owned by the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]].

==Comparison with other accidents==
The release of radiation by the Windscale fire was greatly exceeded by the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, but the fire has been described as the worst reactor accident until [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] in 1979. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] estimates put the number of additional cancers caused by the Three Mile Island accident at not more than one; only Chernobyl produced immediate casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/the-windscale-disaster|title=The Windscale Disaster|date=2007-05-07|author=Gerry Matlack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Mile Island was a civilian reactor, and Chernobyl primarily so, both being used for electrical power production. In contrast Windscale was for purely military purposes.

The reactors at Three Mile Island, unlike those at Windscale and Chernobyl, were in buildings designed to contain radioactive materials released by a reactor accident.

Other military reactors have produced immediate, known casualties such as the 1961 incident at the [[SL-1]] plant in [[Idaho]] which killed three operators.

The accident at Windscale was also contemporary to the [[Kyshtym disaster]], a far more serious accident which happened on 29 September 1957 at the [[Mayak]] plant in the [[Soviet Union]], when the failure of the cooling system for a tank storing tens of thousands of tons of dissolved nuclear waste resulted in a non-nuclear explosion.

The Windscale fire was retrospectively graded as level 5, an accident with wider consequences, on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref name="Richard Black"/&gt;

==Irish sea contamination==
In 1968 a paper was submitted to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', on a study of radioisotopes found in [[oyster]]s from the Irish Sea, using [[gamma spectroscopy]]. The oysters were found to contain &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;[[isotopes of cerium|Ce]], &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;[[isotopes of ruthenium|Ru]], &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru, [[Caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]], &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;[[isotopes of zirconium|Zr]] and &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;[[isotopes of niobium|Nb]]. In addition a zinc [[neutron activation|activation product]] (&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;[[isotopes of zinc|Zn]]) was found; this is thought to be due to the corrosion of magnox fuel cladding in [[spent fuel pool|cooling ponds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v218/n5142/pdf/218689a0.pdf |title= Detection, Estimation and Radiological Significance of Silver-110m in Oysters in the Irish Sea and the Blackwater Estuary|author=A.

==Television documentaries==
In 1999, the [[BBC]] produced an educational [[documentary film]] about the fire as a 30-minute episode of "Disaster" (Series 3) entitled ''The Windscale Fire''. It subsequently was released on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcactivevideoforlearning.com/1/SeriesDetails.aspx?SeriesID=818|title=Disaster - Series 3|year=1999|publisher=bbcactivevideoforlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the BBC produced another documentary about the accident entitled "Windscale: Britain’s Biggest Nuclear Disaster",&lt;ref name="bbc-7030281"/&gt; which investigates the history of the first British nuclear facility and its role in the development of [[nuclear weapons]]. The documentary features interviews with key scientists and plant operators, such as [[Tom Tuohy]], who was the deputy general manager of [[Windscale]]. The documentary suggests that the fire — the first fire in any nuclear facility — was caused by the relaxation of safety measures, as a result of pressure from the British government to quickly produce [[fissile material]]s for nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=reckless&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/apr2008/nucl-a29.shtml|title=BBC documentary reveals government reckless in drive for the production of nuclear weapons|publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site|WSWS]]|date=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotope cartridges==
The following substances were placed inside metal cartridges and subjected to neutron irradiation to create radioisotopes. Both the target material and some of the product isotopes are listed below.

[[File:Young Woman in a Black and Green Bonnet, Looking Down.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Young Woman in a Black and Green Bonnet'', 1890, [[pastel]] on tan wove paper, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

'''Wove paper''' is a [[writing paper]] with a uniform [[surface finishing|surface]], not ribbed or [[watermarked]]. 
The papermaking mould's wires run parallel to each other to produce laid paper, but they are woven together into a fine wire mesh for wove paper. The originator of this new papermaking technique was James Whatman (1702–59) from Kent, England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726180544/http://www.princetonaudubon.com/about_the_watermark.htm (Some historical background)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 500 years European paper makers could only produce what came to be called [[laid paper]]. In 1757 John Baskerville printed his famous edition of [[Virgil]] on a new kind of paper, called Wove (known in Europe as Vélin). This paper is now known to have been made by the elder [[James Whatman (papermaker)|James Whatman]]. Twenty-five years later (1780s) the manufacture of wove paper spread quickly to other paper mills in England, and was also being developed in France and America. All this took place over a decade before a machine to replace making paper by hand was conceived. With the establishment of the paper machine (1807), the manufacture of paper on a wove wire base would become the predominant standard in the world, with laid paper being relegated to certain specialist uses, such as being used as a support for charcoal drawings. Today more than 99% of the world's paper is made in this way.

==Whatman paper==

Whatman paper is a type of wove paper named after James Whatman. It is notable for its exceptional quality.
Whatman paper is grained, strong and rigid, without laid lines. It is used in publishing, filtering, and chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatman.com/TestamentToQuality.aspx Whatman, the current trademark owners]&lt;/ref&gt;
