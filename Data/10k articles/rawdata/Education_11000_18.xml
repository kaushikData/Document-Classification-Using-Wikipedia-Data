In 1985, former Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] introduced the '''8-4-4 System''' [[educational program]], which adopted eight years of primary education, four years of secondary education and four years of university education &lt;ref name="chalkboardkenya"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kenyan Education System|url=http://chalkboardkenya.org/chalkboard-kenya-programme/the-kenyan-programme/|website=chalkboardkenya|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With the introduction of the 8-4-4 system CPE became KCPE ([[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]]) while KCE became the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] (KCSE).

The '''achievement gap in the United States''' is the observed, persistent disparity in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES), [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]. The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including [[standardized test]] scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy &amp; Rothstein, [http://www.epi.org/blog/international-tests-achievement-gaps-gains-american-students/ "International Tests Show Achievement Gaps in All Countries"], Economic Policy Institute, January 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rowntree Bawlls vs Lunch [http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty "Education and Poverty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140816/http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty |date=March 24, 2013 }}, "How Does Poverty Affect Children's Education?"&lt;/ref&gt; Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.

Research into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled "Equality of Educational Opportunity"), commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist [[David Berliner]], home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-Berliner-NON-SCHOOL.pdf "Poverty and Potential: Out-of-School Factors and School Success"], Education Public Interest Center, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=12106 "Our Impoverished View of Educational Reform"], Teachers College Record, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP), has become a focal point of [[education reform]] efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented, such as [[affirmative action]], [[multicultural education]], finance equalization,{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.

==Racial achievement gap==
{{main|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}{{see also|National Assessment of Educational Progress|Race and intelligence}}
The [[education of African Americans]] and some other minorities lags behind those of other [[United States|U.S.]] ethnic groups, such as [[White people|Whites]] and [[Asian Americans]], as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of [[Africans in the United States|African immigrant]] population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asian Americans|East Asian Americans]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent score the highest in all scholastic standardized tests such as the [[SAT]], [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]], [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] exams and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]] followed by [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[White people]] who score in the intermediate range followed by [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] students who tend to score in the lower ranges. U.S. students as whole have in general attained average scores on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|International PISA test]] while other wealthy [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed]] [[East Asian]] countries, such as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] have the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students will be required to pass [[high school graduation examination|standards-based assessments]] which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled tradepersons or unskilled laborers.

Nowadays, there's a gaining population of students who use online education, and the number of institutions which offering fully online degrees is also increasing. According to several studies, online education probably could create an environment where there is less cultural division and negative stereotypes of African Americans, thus protecting those students who have had bad experiences. In addition, the influence technology and user skills and so as economics and academic influences are tightly bonded, that may have positively contributed to African American online learners experience. However, it appears African American male students are less likely to enroll in online classes.

===Evidence of the racial achievement gap: National Assessment of Educational Progress (United States)===
&lt;!-- sort, annotate me --&gt;
{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}
[[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Evidence of the racial achievement gaps|Evidence of the achievement gap]] can be found using various measures, but one assessment used nationwide is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The graphs below show the achievement gap on this assessment between black and white students and between Hispanic and white students in the U.S. over time. Although the gaps have generally narrowed in recent years according to this particular measure, there are clearly still large disparities between groups.

===Debate on the origins of the racial achievement gap===
Researchers have not reached consensus about the [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap|causes of the academic achievement gap]]; instead, there exists a wide range of studies that cite an array of factors, both cultural and structural, that influence student performance in school. Annette Lareau suggested that students who lack middle-class [[cultural capital]] and have limited parental involvement are likely to have lower academic achievement than their better resourced peers.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class Differences in Family-School Relationships: The Impact of Cultural Capital'' Annette Lareau, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers suggest that academic achievement is more closely tied to race and [[socioeconomic status]] and have tried to pinpoint why.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Tracking: From Theory to Practice'' Maureen Hallinan 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic factors were identified as lack of online course access (McCoy, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, K. L. (2012). A study of African American males and their response to online learning (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3546682) &lt;/ref&gt; and online course attrition which indicated before (Liu et al., 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Liu, S., Gomez, J., Khan, B., &amp; Yen, C.J. (2007). Toward a learneroriented community college online course dropout framework. International Journal on ELearning, 6(4), 519–542. &lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the National Center for Educational Statistic (2015)&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2011). The condition of education, 2011. (NCES 2011033), Indicator 43. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011033&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, about half of African American male students grew up in single-parent households. They are associated with higher incidences of poverty, which leads to poorer educational outcomes (Child Trends Databank, 2015). Low-income households tend to have fewer home computers and less access to the Internet (Zickuhr &amp; Smith, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Zickuhr, K., &amp; Smith, A. (2012). Digital differences. Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp; American Life Project, Washington, D.C., 1–41. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Digital&lt;/nowiki&gt; differences.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, being raised in a low-income family often means having fewer educational resources in addition to poor nutrition and limited access to health care, all of which could contribute to lower academic performance. Researchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanlon|first=Harriet|author2=Robert Thatcher |author3=Marvin Cline|title=Gender Differences in the Development of EEG Coherence in Normal Children|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=479–506|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn1603_27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sax|first=Leonard|title=Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know about the Emerging Science of Sex Differences|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|location=Portland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Hernstein and Murray claimed in the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'',&lt;ref name="X"&gt;Hernstein, R. J., and C. Murray, ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life'' (The Free Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; creating much controversy, that [[Race and intelligence|genetic variation in average levels of intelligence]] (IQ) may explain some portion of the racial disparities in achievement. Other researchers have argued that there is no significant difference in inherent cognitive ability between different races that could help to explain the achievement gap, and that environment is at the root of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic Differences and School Readiness" William T. Dickens, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Race, IQ, and Jensen" James R. Flynn (London: Routledge, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbett, Richard. “Race, Genetics, and IQ,” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips (Brookings, 1998), pp. 86–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The racial achievement gap in early childhood====
Research shows that the achievement gap, which often is first measured (by standardized tests) in elementary school, actually begins well before students reach kindergarten as a “school readiness” gap.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness: Closing Racial and Ethnic Gaps" Cecilia Rouse, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Sara McLanahan, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One study claims that about half the test score gap between black and white high school students is already evident when children start school.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Phillips, James Crouse, and John Ralph, “Does the Black-White Test Score Gap Widen after Children Enter School?” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Jencks and Phillips (Brookings, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of different tests at kindergarten entry have provided evidence of such a gap, including the U.S. Department of Education's Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey of Kindergarten children (ECLS-K). While results differ depending on the instrument, estimates of the black-white gap range from slightly less than half a standard deviation to slightly more than 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;"Assessment Issues in the Testing of Children at School Entry" Donald A. Rock and A. Jackson Stenner, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This early disparity in performance is critical, as research shows that once students are behind, they do not catch up. Children who score poorly on tests of cognitive skills before starting kindergarten are highly likely to be low performers throughout their school careers.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness and Later Achievement" G. J. Duncan et al, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of the early appearance of the gap has led to efforts focused on early childhood interventions (see “Narrowing the achievement gap” below).

====African American culture and family structure====
{{Further|African American culture|African-American family structure}}

Achievement gaps between African American students and White students in online classes tend to be greater than regular class. Expanding from 14% in 1995 to 22% in 2015 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2016). Educational attainment of young adults, 2016. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;. Possible cause might be the differences in socio-economic status (Palmer et al., 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G. A., Bowman, L., &amp; Harroff, P. (2013). Literature review: Barriers to participation in the online learning environment: The role of race and gender. Adult Education Research Conference. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&amp;context=aerc&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, academic performance differences (Osborne, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, J. (2001). Testing stereotype threat: Does anxiety explain race and sex differences in achievement? Contemporary Educational Psychology, 26(3), 291–310. doi:10.1006/ceps.2000.1052 &lt;/ref&gt;, unable to access technology (Fairlie, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;Fairlie, R. W. (2012a). Academic achievement, technology and race: Experimental evidence. Economics of Education Review, 31(5), 663–679. doi:10.1016/j.econedurev.2012.04.003 &lt;/ref&gt;, no online technical support (Rovai &amp; Gallien, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Rovai, A. P., &amp; Gallien, L. B. (2005). Learning and sense of community: A comparative analysis of African American and Caucasian online graduate students.

Testing stereotype threat: Does anxiety explain race and sex differences in achievement? Contemporary Educational Psychology, 26(3), 291–310. doi:10.1006/ceps.2000.1052 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The culture and environment in which children are raised may play a role in the achievement gap. Jencks and Phillips argue that African American parents may not encourage early education in toddlers because they do not see the personal benefits of having exceptional academic skills. As a result of cultural differences, African American students tend to begin school with smaller vocabularies than their white classmates.&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"&gt;''America's Next Achievement Test: Closing the Black-White Test Score Gap'' Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley calculated a "[[30 million word gap]]" between children of high school dropouts and those of professionals who are college educated. The differences are qualitative as well as quantitative, with differences in "unique" words, complexity, and "conversational turns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Sarah D.|title=Research on Quality of Conversation Holds Deeper Clues Into Word Gap|work=Education Week|publisher=Educational Projects in Education, Inc.|date=April 22, 2015|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, poverty often acts as a confounding factor and differences that are assumed to arise from racial/cultural factors may be socioeconomically driven. Many children who are poor, regardless of race, come from homes that lack stability, continuity of care, adequate nutrition, and medical care creating a level of environmental stress that can affect the young child's development. As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Hart and Risley (1995). Meaningful differences in the every day experiences of young children. Baltimore, MD: Paul H Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that when students have parental assistance with homework, they perform better in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Immigration, Family Life, and Achievement Motivation Among Latino Adolescents'' Carola Suarez-Orozco and Marcelo Suarez-Orozco 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This is a problem for many minority students due to the large number of single-parent households ([[African-American family structure|67% of African-American children are in a single-parent household]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=107|title=Children in single-parent families by race|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increase in non-English speaking parents. Students from single-parent homes often find it difficult to find time to receive help from their parent. Similarly, some Hispanic students have difficulty getting help with their homework because there is not an English speaker at home to offer assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Hispanic views toward education ====
Disadvantages in a child's early life can cultivate into achievement gaps in their education. Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digest of Education Statistics|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.51-5366|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=51|issue=10|pages=51–5366–51-5366|doi=10.5860/choice.51-5366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the [[Poverty in the United States|economic poverty level]], compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; there are still issues that must be addressed.

There is a common misconception that Hispanic parents are not involved in their child's education and fail to transmit strong educational values to their children. However, there is evidence that Hispanic parents actually hold their children's education in high value. The majority of Hispanic children are affected by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. It affects recent immigrants as well as the children of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Richard R.|date=2002-04-01|title="Mexican Americans Don't Value Education!"

Hispanic students showed lower academic achievement, more absences, and more life stressors than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Sita G.|last2=Barrera|first2=Alinne Z.|last3=Strambler|first3=Michael J.|last4=Muñoz|first4=Ricardo F.|last5=Macciomei|first5=Erynn|date=2016-04-02|title=The Achievement Gap Among Newcomer Immigrant Adolescents: Life Stressors Hinder Latina/o Academic Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=15|issue=2|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|issn=1534-8431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014-2015, 77.8% of Hispanic children were [[English-language learner|English Language learners]]. This can be problematic because children may not have parents who speak English at home to help with language acquisition. Immigration struggles can be used as a motivator for students. Immigrant parents appeal to their children and hold high expectations because of the “gift” they are bestowing on them. They immigrated and sacrificed their lives so their children can succeed, and this framework is salient in encouraging children to pursue their education. Parents use their struggles and occupation to encourage a better life.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceballo|first=Rosario|last2=Maurizi|first2=Laura K.|last3=Suarez|first3=Gloria A.|last4=Aretakis|first4=Maria T.|title=Gift and sacrifice: Parental involvement in Latino adolescents’ education.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033472|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=116–127|doi=10.1037/a0033472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parent Involvement|Parental involvement]] has been shown to increase educational success and attainment for students. For example, parental involvement in elementary school has been shown to lower high school dropout rates and improved on time completion of high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Wendy Miedel|title=Parent involvement in elementary school and educational attainment|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190740903001178|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=39–62|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2003.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception is that Latino parents don’t hold their children's education in high regards (Valencia, 2002), but this has been debunked. Parents show their values in education by holding high academic expectations and giving “consejos” or advice. In 2012, 97% of families reported teaching their children letters, words or numbers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A study reported that parent involvement during adolescence continues to be as influential as in early childhood.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

====Motivation gap====
Another explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that some minority children may not be motivated to do their best on these assessments. Many argue that standardized IQ tests and other testing procedures are culturally biased toward the knowledge and experiences of the European-American middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronnie-reese/test-bias-minorities_b_2734149.html |title=Minority Testing Bias Persists |last=Reese |first=Ronnie |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/11/why-its-time-to-get-rid-of-standardized-tests/ |title=Why It's Time to Get Rid of Standardized Tests |last=Rooks |first=Noliwe M. |publisher=''TIME'' |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude M. Steele suggested that minority children and adolescents may also experience [[stereotype threat]]—the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group. According to this theory, this produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities.

===="Acting white"====
{{Main|Acting white}}

Some researchers&lt;ref name="researchers"&gt;Steele, C., and J. Aronson, “Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans” (pp. 401–430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of “[[acting white]]” by their peers,&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' [[Signithia Fordham]] and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; or that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true or deserved benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the [[achievement ideology]] &amp;ndash; that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.

====Structural and institutional factors====
Different schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;''Education and the Inequalities of Place'' Vincent J.Roscigno, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and Martha Crowley 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.&lt;ref name="teachers"&gt;Gordon, Kane &amp; Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools also tend to place students in [[tracking (education)|tracking]] groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Why Do Some Schools Group By Ability?'' Peter G. VanderHart 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers’ and administrators’ expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of [[institutional racism]]. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of [[racial segregation]] within the schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Detracking: The Social Construction of Ability, Cultural Politics, and Resistance to Reform'' Jeannie Oakes, Amy Stuart Wells, Makeba Jones, and Amanda Datnow 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Teachers' Beliefs on Teaching, Learning, and Students: A Pilot Study in the United States of America'' Kim Hyunsook Song 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class in Public Schools'' Jennifer L. Hochschild 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.&lt;ref&gt;''Is Ability Grouping Equitable?'' Adam Gamoran 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of awarding low grades and test scores to children who struggle causes low-performing children to experience anxiety, demoralization, and a loss of control.&lt;ref name="Crooks, Terence J. 1988"&gt;Crooks, Terence J. (1988). The Impact of Classroom Evaluation Practices on Students.

(2017). ''Solving the achievement gap: Overcoming the structure of school inequality.'' New York: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect may explain why the achievement gap has resisted solution.&lt;ref name="Yeh, Stuart S. 2017"/&gt;

====Preschool education====
Additionally, poor and minority students have disproportionately less access to high-quality early childhood education, which has been shown to have a strong impact on early learning and development. One study found that although black children are more likely to attend preschool than white children, they may experience lower-quality care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Early Childhood Care and Education: Effects on Ethnic and Racial Gaps in School Readiness |first=Katherine A. |last=Magnuson |first2=Jane |last2=Waldfogel |year=2005 |journal=The Future of Children |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=169–196 |jstor=1602667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also found that Hispanic children in the U.S. are much less likely to attend preschool than white children. Another study conducted in Illinois in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fuller, 2010 (referenced in: {{cite web |url=http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/pdf/press%20release%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045158/http://mccormickfoundation.org/PDF/PRESS%20RELEASE%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that only one in three Latino parents could find a preschool slot for his or her child, compared to almost two thirds of other families.

Finally, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), families with modest incomes (less than $60,000) have the least access to preschool education.&lt;ref&gt;"Who Goes to Preschool and Why Does it Matter?" W. Steven Barnett &amp; Donald J. Yarosz, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that dramatic increases in both enrollment and quality of prekindergarten programs would help to alleviate the school readiness gap and ensure that low-income and minority children begin school on even footing with their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Economic implications of the racial achievement gap===
In addition to the moral and social justice arguments for closing the achievement gap, there are [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Economic outcomes|strong economic arguments for doing so]]. A 2009 report by the management consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] asserts that the persistence of the achievement gap in the U.S. has the economic effect of a “permanent national recession."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America's Schools |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |year=2009 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424192005/http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report claims that if the achievement gap between black and Latino performance and white student performance had been narrowed, GDP in 2008 would have been $310 billion to $525 billion higher (2–4 percent).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

If the gap between low-income students and their peers had been narrowed, GDP in the same year would have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher (3–5 percent). In addition to the potential increase in GDP, the report projects that closing the achievement gap would lead to cost savings in areas outside of education, such as incarceration and healthcare. The link between low school performance and crime, low earnings and poor health has been echoed in academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence From Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-reports |first=L. |last=Lochner |first2=E. |last2=Moretti |year=2004 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=155–189 |doi=10.1257/000282804322970751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |first2=Diane M. |last2=Whitmore |chapter=Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap? |title=Bridging the Achievement Gap |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technical difficulties and technology support ===
Students who have problems with technology interfered are more likely to withdraw from their online courses (Bambara et al., 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bambara, C. S., Harbour, C. P., Davies, T. G., &amp; Athey, S. (2009). Delicate engagement: The lived experience of community college students enrolled in highrisk online courses. Community College Review, 36(3), 219–238. doi:10.1177/0091552108327187 &lt;/ref&gt;. Also, there's no sufficient technology support which will also leads students to drop the class since their problems could not be solved quickly (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010). Students’ perceptions of the value of the elements of an online learning environment: Looking back in moving forward. Interactive Learning Environments, 18(2), 135–151. doi:10.1080/09539960802364592

Presented at Association for Educational Communications and Technology Annual Meeting 2005. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.learntechlib.org/p/76937/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technology experience, skills, and self-efficacy ===
Students who were more focused and engaged themselves to the class will tend to receive higher grade, their self-confidence can be gained through daily life use of Internet (Sahin &amp; Shelley, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Sahin, I., &amp; Shelley, M. (2008). Considering students’ perceptions: The distance education student’s satisfaction model. Journal of Educational Technology and Society, 11(3), 216–223. &lt;/ref&gt;. Male online learners had higher Internet self-efficacy than female, while they participated less in discussions (Chang et al., 2014; Ong &amp; Lai, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.S., Liu, E. Z.F., Sung, H.Y., Lin, C. H., Chen, N.S., &amp; Cheng, S.S. (2014). Effects of online college student’s Internet selfefficacy on learning motivation and performance.

=== Factors contributing to onsite academic success for African American males ===
As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723)&lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.

=== African American male online learners as college students ===
Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014). Spaces for success in higher education: Males of color at an online predominantly white community college (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3621155) &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Attempts at narrowing the racial achievement gap ===
Explanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.  These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to "close the gap" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables-- all of which can have an effect on one another-- ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215170642/http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-15|title=NEA - The Crisis in the Education of Latino Students|date=2010-02-15|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following attempts have all been made in order to counteract the effects of the achievement gap at schools. They range from nationwide, government-led initiatives to smaller school-based initiatives.

====Standards-based reform and No Child Left Behind====
The federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002 (NCLB) focuses on standardized test scores and school accountability to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. As written, the legislation incentivizes that schools show continual improvement toward this goal (otherwise known as "Adequate Yearly Progress," or AYP) otherwise schools face punishments, such as sanctions. This system has been criticized by some for being unfair toward schools that have the highest population of minority and poor students, as it is harder for these schools to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act, due to insufficient funding from either local, district, or state actors. This in turn leads to a cycle of underperformance and sanctions within these areas which furthers the problems that the Act meant to fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Obama Administration]] instituted the [[Race to the Top]] (RTTT) program which provides financial incentives to states to produce measurable student gains. RTTT's primary goals are to improve student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve high school graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact Sheet: The Race to the Top". The White House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2011. Retrieved April 9,2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of both programs has been to close the achievement gap, but the RTTT has been more focused on closing the gap between higher and lower performing schools rather than focusing on a national approach.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm|title=COMPARING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP|last=Director|first=Judith Lohman, Assistant|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between the two educational reform programs is that RTTT is a competitive grant program that provides incentives for schools to change, while the NCLB Act mandated various changes in state and local education systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The RTTT's approach is more adaptable and focused as it allows for individual actions between schools, and is meant to encourage reform within schools without resorting to punishments, whereas the No Child Left Behind Act relies on punishments as its main form of promoting reform in schools.

Another attempt to standardize the education of students is the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], also known as Common Core. The Common Core, created in 2009 and 2010, sets benchmarks for the skills that students should have by certain grade levels in subjects such as Math and Language Arts and the system itself is to meant to be a national baseline for how students are achieving. This baseline is meant to help establish what students need in order to achieve in higher education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/3-what-problems-is-the-common-core-trying-to-solve|title=What problems is the Common Core trying to solve?|date=2014-03-26|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the standards are meant to be nationwide, they have only been adopted by 35 states as it is not mandatory for states to subscribe to the Common Core unless they desire federal grants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-states-academic-standards-common-core-or.html|title=Map: Tracking the Common Core State Standards|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core Initiative has been criticized as it has not yielded any noticeable improvement in what has almost 10 years since it has been implemented, due to a multiple reasons, from incorrect implementation to content as the idea of a centralized system for education has been criticized for not taking the dynamic differences in learning-style into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nealmccluskey/2018/10/18/common-core-doesnt-seem-to-be-working-that-may-be-just-fine/#1b9d5bbb6993|title=Common Core Doesn't Seem To Be Working; That May Be Just Fine|last=McCluskey|first=Neal|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest addition to the growing list of government-led initiatives has been the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], or ESSA. The ESSA, enacted in December 2015, is Congress's replacement for the NCLB. The ESSA takes notes from both the RTTT and the NCLB, by keeping the standardized testing of the NCLB while allowing for the flexibility of the RTTT. The ESSA gives states more say in how schools are held accountable, and how states can act to fix issues at their schools, and as such, states can set long-term goals instead of having to worry about year-to-year performance issues as with the NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/every-student-succeeds-act/index.html|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: An ESSA Overview|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must still identify low performing schools and provide additional support, but now states can focus on long-term solutions. The new bill also focuses more on academic growth, which is subjective and does not always line up with a student's grade level, whereas the NCLB only cared whether students were performing to grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationpost.org/the-abcs-of-esea-essa-and-no-child-left-behind/|title=The ABC’s of ESEA, ESSA and No Child Left Behind - Education Post|work=Education Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining the standardized test requirements of the NCLB while allowing for more state control like in the RTTT, the ESSA hopes to achieve long-lasting success and reform.

====School-based reform====
Initiatives to close the achievement gap have been implemented at the school, district and state level in order to better address the issue. These include investments in pre-kindergarten programs, class size reduction, small schools, curricular reform, alignment of pre-kindergarten through college standards and expectations, and improved teacher education programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Bridging the Achievement Gap" John E. Chubb &amp; Tom Loveless, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools have started implementing [[After-school activity|after-school activities]] such as tutoring sessions, remedial programs, and rapid assessment programs. These programs are meant to help minority students learn at a more accelerated rate in order to help them catch up to their peers. Other schools have started de-tracking their students in order to provide the same quality education for all students, regardless of race. De-tracking not only allows for all students to be taught in the same way, but it also opens up new opportunities for students who would be put on a certain career path by their education.

====Teacher-focused reform====
Another focus of reform directed toward the achievement gap has been on teacher development, as research shows that since teachers are responsible for almost every aspect of a child's education within the bounds of a classroom. Therefore, in order to best address the achievement gap, reform efforts based on improved teaching are one of the main strategies used to address the gap. This reform effort has been both top-down, in the form of higher state standards for teacher education and preparation,&lt;ref&gt;"Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching" Linda Darling-Hammond(prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as bottom-up, through programs like Teach for America and AmeriCorps that aim to address educational inequity by recruiting and training teachers specifically to work in high-needs schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for America: Our Approach|url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/our-approach/|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Way Public Schools AmeriCorps team|url=http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419162328/http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investment in early childhood====
One strategy being used to address the achievement gap has been focusing on early childhood development. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.&lt;ref&gt;"Investments in Early Childhood as a Means for Deficit Reduction" James Heckman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By helping develop critical skills early on, these programs cut out the need for such intervention later on. Head Start and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to level the playing field for these children before school begins. In addition to increased access, there has also an increased national focus on raising quality standards for Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs, and in improving training and professional development for early care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Pre-K: Examining the changes and impacts of quality standards in prekindergarten at the national, state, district and program levels|url=http://www.nieer.org|accessdate=April 13, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417172816/http://nieer.org/| archivedate=April 17, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial evidence pointing to early childhood development playing a huge role in closing the achievement gap: various studies, including the Carolina Abecedarian study, Child-Parent Center study, and HighScope Perry Preschool study, have shown that pre-K programs can have a positive and long-lasting impact on academic achievement of low-income and minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=F.

Pre-K programs help students develop social, emotional, and critical thinking skills at a young age, and while none of this prevents the effects of poverty, it does help in dampening the effects while also better preparing student for their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/03/524907739/pre-k-decades-worth-of-studies-one-strong-message|title=Pre-K: Decades Worth Of Studies, One Strong Message|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of narrowing the racial achievement gap====
Sociologists [[Christopher Jencks]] and Meredith Phillips have argued that narrowing the black-white test score gap "would do more to move [the United States] toward racial equality than any politically plausible alternative".&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt; As already discussed, there is also strong evidence that narrowing the gap would have a significant positive economic and social impact.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, Stuart S. (2009). Shifting the Bell Curve: The Benefits and Costs of Raising Student Achievement. Evaluation and Program Planning, 32(1), 74-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narrowing the achievement gap through technology====

Computer and technology use have been linked to increased student achievement. “When teachers and administrators make a sustained commitment to the use of [[computers in the classroom]], student achievement increases (Mann &amp; Shafer, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=D. |last2=Shafer |first2=E. |year=1997 |title=Technology and Achievement |journal=The American School Board Journal |url=http://www.asbj.com/achievement/cilcilo.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomized experiments demonstrate that the performance of low-achieving students can be improved by using technology that adjusts the level of difficulty of the books and math problems that are presented to each student, raises the probability that each student will achieve high scores on end-of-book reading comprehension quizzes and high accuracy scores on daily math assignments, raises the probability that each student can earn high letter grades, and creates a structured environment where each student is likely to receive regular, objective, positive feedback signaling that he or she is advancing on a daily basis, promoting high self-efficacy and a strong sense of control over academic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ysseldyke |first=Jim |last2=Bolt |first2=Daniel M. |year=2007 |title=Effect of Technology-Enhanced Continuous Progress Monitoring on Math Achievement |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=453–467 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven M., Nunnery, John, &amp; Goldfeder, Elizabeth (2004).

New York, NY: Picador. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the world is flat, online education has made the education becomes more accessible for a wider range of students. But there's also some counter points of online education for example: lack of technical support (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010).

Using technology as a tool for narrowing the achievement gap begins with a purpose, communication, listening, and collaboration. These skills can be achieved through the use of weblogs, social networking sites, feeds, and myriad other multimedia. In classrooms, students can communicate internally, or they can work side by side with others who are located thousands of miles away. Through the use of technology, presentations can be archived so that the material can be reviewed at any time. “All teachers could record important parts of what they do in the classroom that can then be archived to the class Weblog and used by students who may have missed the class or just want a refresher on what happened.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;117)&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"&gt;Richardson, W. (2010), Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms&lt;/ref&gt;

Having access to information on the web gives students an advantage to learning. “Students at all levels show more interest in their work and their ability to locate and reflect upon their work is greatly enhanced as are the opportunities for collaborative learning” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt; Weblogs are different from posts or comments; they require students to analyze and synthesize the content and communicate their understanding with the audience responses in mind. 
 
Technology has been incorporated into the Standards. Even though the NCLB Act holds school districts accountable for student achievement, there are still many students who do not have the resources at home to fully take part in these excellent educational tools. Some teachers feel that technology is not the solution and see it as a risk. Therefore, technology is not always being used to its fullest potential by teachers and students do not gain the advantages technology offers. “Given the fact that the amount of information going online shows no sign of slowing, if they are unable to consistently collect potentially relevant information for their lives and careers and quickly discern what of that information is most useful, they will be at a disadvantage.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt;

According to the U.S. Census, by 2012, it is estimated that 70% of homes will have broadband access. While this is a large percentage, it still leaves 30% of households without internet access. The government has lent its hand in closing the Global Achievement Gap by granting funding for low-income school districts for programs such as one-on-one computing, however, the fact that many of these students do not have online capability at home is still a main issue. This [[digital divide]] may cause the achievement gap to increase as technology continues to become heavily integrated in the daily coursework for school children. Students need to have Internet access outside of school on a regular basis to successfully complete challenging courswork.

According to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group. Reading gaps between African Americans and Whites have increased from 1992 to present (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2016). Educational attainment of young adults, 2016. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Tonsing-Meyer (2013)&lt;ref&gt;TonsingMeyer, J. (2013). An examination of online instructional practices based on the learning styles of graduate education students. The Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 14(3), 141–149. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the reading and writing practice was specified and emphasized in 85% of online course assignment, with activities attached, which might improve this situation.

===High-performing high-poverty and high-minority schools===
Exceptions to the achievement gap exist. Schools that are majority black, even poor, can perform well above national norms, with [[John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School|Davidson Magnet School]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} in [[Augusta, Georgia]] being a prominent example. Another school with remarkable gains for students of color is Amistad Academy in New Haven, Connecticut.Additionally North Star Academy has been awarded the National Blue Ribbon School for two years in a row. These schools offer more rigorous, traditional modes of instruction, including [[Direct Instruction]]. In one study, Direct Instruction was found to be the single most effective pedagogical method for raising the skill levels of inner-city students (Project Follow Through).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/hu091597.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

High performing Black schools are not unique to the twentieth century. In Washington, DC in the late 19th century, a predominantly low income Black school performed higher than three White schools in yearly testing. This trend continued until the mid 20th century, and during that time the M Street School exceeded national norms on standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html|title=Thomas Sowell - "The Education of Minority Children"|first=Na|last=Liu|website=www.tsowell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans lagged behind whites in 2000 by nearly a factor of two. However, it is less frequently observed{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that whites lag behind Asians by nearly as large a ratio. The group with the least education is not the African Americans, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] or other groups who have quite a different legacy of discrimination.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The African-American community is behind the curve in education but statistics show 9 out of 10 young black adults ages 25 to 29 have completed high school or its equivalent.

In 2008, over three million degrees were awarded throughout the United States. Half of all degrees earned were [[bachelor's degrees]]. The bachelor's degree is one of the most awarded degrees for all ethnicities and races. Asians obtained bachelor's degrees more than any other race, followed by Whites. Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barriers to Educational Opportunities for Hispanics in the United States|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|date = 2006-01-01|first = Barbara|last = Schhneider|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Martinez|first3 = Ann|last3 = Ownes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asians obtain more [[first professional degree]]s than any other race. A high percentage{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} of Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives own an [[associate's degree]] compared with other races. About 1–2% [[doctorate degree]]s are awarded to all races. The table below shows the number of degrees awarded for each group.

=== College and university enrollment ===

Between 1978 and 2008, college enrollment rates increased for all races. The college enrollment rate is determined by the percentage of high school students who enroll in two-year or four-year college and universities immediately after high school. In 2008, the college enrollment rate for all races was 69%. Although the college rate increased for each racial and ethnic group between 1980 and 2007, the enrollment rates for [[Black people|Blacks]] and [[Hispanics]] did not increase, and the college enrollment rate for Blacks increased from 44% to 56%.{{clarification needed|date=June 2018|It did increase, but it didn't, but it did?}} Between 1980 and 2007, the college enrollment rates for Hispanics have increased from 50% to 62%. In comparison, the same rate increased from 49.8% to 77.7% for Whites. There are no data for Asians or American Indians/Alaska Natives regarding enrollment rates from the 1980s to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the enrollment rate of high school graduates reached a historical high of 70.1% (see above for statistics on the racial gap in graduation rates). Asian Americans have the highest enrollment rate (92.2%), followed by Whites (69.2%), Blacks (68.7%), and Hispanics (59.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/college-enrollment-rate-at-record-high/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=College Enrollment Rate at Record High | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenting influence ===

Parenting methods are different across cultures, thus can have dramatic influence on educational outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} For instance, Asian parents often apply strict rules and parental authoritarianism to their children while many white American parents deem creativity and self-sufficiency to be more valuable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''[[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]'' by Yale Professor Amy Chua highlights some of the very important aspects in Asian parenting method in comparison to the “American way”. Chua's book has generated interests and controversies in the “Tiger Mom” parenting method and its role in determining children's education outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Moms: Is Tough Parenting Really the Answer?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043477,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine | date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hispanic parents and their children believe that a college degree is necessary for obtaining stable and meaningful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED430176|publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 0-300-07982-6|first = Barbara|last = Schneider|first2 = David|last2 = Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is reflected in the educational expectations parents hold for their children and in the expectations that young people have for themselves (U.S. Department of Education, 1995b, p.&amp;nbsp;88).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"/&gt; High educational expectations can be found among all racial and ethnic groups regardless of their economic and social resources (p.&amp;nbsp;73). Although parents and children share high educational aims, their aspirations do not necessarily translate into postsecondary matriculation. This is especially the case for Hispanic high school students, particularly those whose parents have not attended college.&lt;ref&gt;Nuñez, Cuccaro-Alamin, and Carroll, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/98082.pdf |title = National Center for Education Statistics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental involvement in children's education is influential to children's success at school.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=J. L. |last2=Coates |first2=L. |last3=Salinas |first3=K. C. |last4=Sanders |first4=M. G. |last5=Simon |first5=B.

Collaboration between teachers and parents is necessary when working to help a child; parents have the necessary knowledge of what is best for their child's situation.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=LaRocque |first=M. |last2=Kleiman |first2=I. |last3=Darling |first3=S. M. |year=2011 |title=Parental involvement: the missing link in school achievement |journal=Preventing School Failure |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=115–122 |doi=10.1080/10459880903472876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the student body in schools is diverse, and although teachers make an effort to try and understand each child's unique cultural beliefs, it is important that they are meeting with parents to get a clear understanding of what needs should be met in order for the student to succeed. School administrators must accommodate and account for family differences and also be supportive by promoting ways families can get involved. For example, schools can provide support by accommodating the needs of the family who have do not have transportation, schools may do so by providing external resources that may benefit the family.&lt;ref&gt;Flakes, B. M. (2007). Teacher and parent perceptions of parental involvement at W. S. Hornsby Elementary School. (Doctoral dissertation). (Order No. 3278095). Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/304722541&lt;/ref&gt; As referenced by Feliciano et al. (2016), educators can also account for culture by providing education about the diversity at the school. This can be achieved by creating an environment where both teachers and students learn about cultures represented among the student population.

Larocquem et al. (2011) stated that family involvement may include visiting their children's class, being involved with a parent teacher organization, attending school activities, speaking to the child's class, and volunteering at school events. It is also important for families to be involved with the child's school assignments, especially by holding them accountable for completion and discussion of the work assigned.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"/&gt; Also, educators may want to consider how parental language barriers and educational experiences affect families and the influence of contributing to their child's education.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"/&gt; In addition, even when families want to get involved, they may not know how to collaborate with school personnel, especially for families who are Hispanic, African American, and or of low economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=A.

=== Illiteracy ===

African Americans were once denied educations. Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans—the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy.&lt;!-- see table below --&gt; Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and [[Latin America]].

=== Immigrants ===
Educational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S report having higher levels of education than any other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |title=U.S. Population: Ethnicity, Race, Gender, Income |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214090723/http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2018}} Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays{{when|date=April 2018}} have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/a/DoesAffirmativeActionAddressIntraRacialDivides.htm|title=Ethnicities Eligible for College Affirmative Action|author=Nadra Kareem Nittle|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aracorporation.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=African-Born U.S. Residents are the Most Highly Educated Group in American Society |journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |volume=13 |year=1996 |pages=33–34 |doi=10.2307/2963153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English.

According to data from the [[2000 United States Census]], "43.8 percent of African immigrants had achieved a college degree, compared with 42.5 of Asian Americans, 28.9 percent of immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=235:african-immigrants-are-the-most-educated&amp;catid=135:immigration&amp;Itemid=348|title=African Immigrants are the Most Educated|author=Africa|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational attainment amount varies by group.

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.

Source: 1995 College Board SAT Profiles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurhu.com/index/test.htm#satincome] Hu's Index of Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative African American scholars such as [[Thomas Sowell]] observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30–40,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as [[Prince George County]], are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.

=== State standards ===

Most state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the ''[[Education gap]]'' between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as [[No Child Left Behind]] truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Murray |title=Acid Tests |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 25, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115379210632316123 }} He claims NCLB punishes minority students and does not close basic skill differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

The amount of education completed varies greatly between members of religions in the United States. Hindus and Jews, for example, are more likely than general population to have completed a college education, whereas members of Evangelical churches, historically Black Protestant churches and Jehovah's Witness are less likely (21%, 15% and 12% respectively).&lt;ref name="pew2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pew Research Center |date=12 May 2015 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=The Pew Forum |accessdate=20 May 2015 |page=56 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082110/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International comparisons ===

{{TIMSSMathScores2007}}

As a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS international math and science test]]. However, broken down by race, US Asians scored comparably to Asian nations, white Americans scored comparably to the best European nations. Although some racial generally score lower than whites in the US, they scored as well as whites in other European nations. Hispanic Americans averaged 505, comparable to students Austria and Sweden, while African Americans at 482 were comparable to Norway and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|title=Odds and Ends|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404215401/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|archive-date=April 4, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special programs ===

Achievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of [[special education]] and [[gifted education]] programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, R.

==Gender achievement gap in the United States==
{{see also|Sex and intelligence}}
For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.&lt;ref name="Kafer"/&gt;

Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious [[STEM fields]] (science, technology, engineering, and math).&lt;ref name="Kafer"&gt;Kafir, Krista (April 2007). "Taking the Boy Crisis in Education Seriously: How School Choice can Boost Achievement Among Boys and Girls." Independent Women's Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Voyer |first2=Susan D. |last2=Voyer |title=Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2014 |volume=140 |issue=4 |page=1194 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-a0036620.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723) &lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014).

===Gender gap in literacy===

[[File:Differences in Average Scale Scores for Girls and Boys.jpg|thumb|450px|Achievement gaps between boys and girls in the United States are more pronounced in reading and writing than in math and science.]]

Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the [[US Department of Education]], the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year.&lt;ref name="Perie"&gt;Perie, M. (2005). NAEP 2004 Trends in Academic Progress. Washington, DC: US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;

On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.&lt;ref name="Persky"&gt;Persky, H. (2003). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2002. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.&lt;ref name="Salahu"&gt;Salahu-Din, Debra (2008). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2007. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salahu"/&gt;

===Gender gap in math and science===

Which gender is disadvantaged by the gap in math and science achievement largely depends on how academic achievement is being measured. Female students generally have better grades in their math classes, and this gap starts off very minimal but increases with age.&lt;ref name="Dee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dee |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Teachers and the gender gaps in student achievement |journal=Journal of Human Resources |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.3368/jhr.XLII.3.528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adeleke |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Gender disparity in mathematical performance revisited: can training in problem solving bring difference between boys and girls? |work=Essays in Education |volume=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, males score higher on standardized math tests, and these score gaps also increase with age. Male students also score higher on measures of college readiness, such as the AP Calculus exams and the math section of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;Amelink, C. (2009). Information sheet: gender differences in math performance . Assessing Women in Engineering, 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Dee2007" /&gt; This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a student's completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Lubienski, S. T., McGraw, R., &amp; [[Marilyn Strutchens|Strutchens, M.]] (2004). NAEP findings regarding gender: Mathematics achievement, student affect, and learning practices. In P. Kloosterman, &amp; F. K. Lester Jr. (Eds.), Results and interpretations of the 1990 through 2000 mathematics assessments of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (pp. 305–336). Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=CollegeBoard.com |year=2010 |title=SAT Percentile Rank or Males, Females, and Total Group, 2007 College-Bound Seniors—Mathematics |others=A table |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SAT_percentile_ranks_males_females_total_group_mathematics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study has challenged the existence of the gender gap in mathematics. In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on [[No Child Left Behind]] standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items. This raised questions about whether there is still a gender gap in math achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyde |first=J. S. |last2=Lindberg |first2=S. M. |last3=Linn |first3=M. C. |last4=Ellis |first4=A. B. |last5=Williams |first5=C.

There is also a large discrepancy between the number of men and women working in STEM fields. Women have been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields. This underrepresentation is evident in the distribution of college majors among men and women; from 1997 to 2007, women earned only 18% of engineering bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dey |first=J. G. |last2=Hill |first2=C. |year=2007 |title=Beyond the Pay Gap |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender gap in graduation rates===

According to recent data, 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Digest of Education Statistics 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Sara. (2006). The Evidence Suggests Otherwise: The Truth About Boys and Girls. Washington: Education Sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the percentage of women with bachelor's degrees was higher than the percentage of men with bachelor's degrees for the first time in America. &lt;ref&gt; "Women Now at the Head of the Class, Lead Men in College Attainment" Wed Oct 07 2015.

===Gender gap in lifetime earnings===
{{see also|Gender pay gap}}
Although more women are graduating with undergraduate degrees, men are still earning disproportionately more in their lifetimes. This could be due to many factors, including different types of jobs for males and females. Females are greatly underrepresented in science and engineering fields, which are typically correlated with high lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedard |first=Kelly |first2=Insook |last2=Cho |year=2010 |title=Early gender test score gaps across OECD countries |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=348–363 |doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2009.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females also have vastly different labor market histories based on type of job and time spent in each job.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Possible causes of the gender achievement gap in the United States==

===Teacher interactions===

How a student interacts with and is evaluated by his or her teachers is closely correlated with that student's future academic achievement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} According to researcher Thomas Good, there are two competing views of how teachers can indirectly impact the achievement of their students. The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Good |first=T. L. |year=1987 |title=Two decades of research on teacher expectations: Findings and future directions |journal=Journal of Teacher Education |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=32–47 |doi=10.1177/002248718703800406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher evaluations===

How teachers perceive students’ knowledge and abilities varies by gender and influences classroom processes and student achievement in both reading and math. Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt; A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.&lt;ref name="Tach"/&gt;

Teachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males’ reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Tach"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tach |first=L. M. |last2=Farkas |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=Learning-related behaviors, cognitive skills, and ability grouping when schooling begins |journal=Social Science Research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1048–1079 |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigro, G., M. Tappan, and S. Desrochers. (2008). The gender divide in academic engagement: Perspectives from Maine boys and young men. Report presented at the annual meeting of the Maine Boys Network conference, Bates College, Lewiston, ME.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite trend has been found in math classes. Teachers still tend to view math as a “masculine” subject and tend to have higher expectations for and better attitude towards their male students in these classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Q. |year=1999 |title=Teachers’ beliefs and gender differences in mathematics: A review |journal=Educational Research |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=63–76 |doi=10.1080/0013188990410106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Fennema et al. has also shown that teachers tend to name males when asked to list their “best math students.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fennema |first=E. |last2=Peterson |first2=P. L. |last3=Carpenter |first3=T. P. |last4=Lubinski |first4=C. |year=1990 |title=Teachers’ attributions and beliefs about girls, boys, and mathematics |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=55–69 |doi=10.1007/BF00311015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are more likely than males to be negatively impacted than male students by this underestimation of their math abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKown |first=C. |last2=Weinstein |first2=R. S. |year=2002 |title=Modeling the role of child ethnicity and gender in children’s differential response to teacher expectations |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=159–184 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb01425.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These gender-specific evaluations from teachers are implicit; usually the teachers have no idea that they are favoring one gender over the other until they are shown concrete evidence, such as a video recording of their classroom. However, even though the discrimination is implicit, it still has negative effects on both male and female students.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt;

There is conflicting evidence about whether teacher assessments of student performance and ability are consistent with cognitive assessments like standardized tests. Teacher assessment evidence comes from a relatively small number of classrooms when compared to standardized tests, which are administered in every public school in all fifty states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Joseph Paul |first2=Sarah Theule |last2=Lubienski |year=2010 |title=The Development of Gender Achievement Gaps in Mathematics and Reading During Elementary and Middle School: Examining Direct Cognitive Assessments and Teacher Ratings |journal=American Education Research Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=268–302 |doi=10.3102/0002831210372249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
{{see also|Stereotype threat}}
There is speculation that gender stereotyping within classrooms can also lead to differences in academic achievement and representation for female and male students. Math and science are often perceived as “masculine” subjects because they lead to success in “masculine” fields, such as medicine and engineering. English and history, on the other hand, are often perceived as “feminine” subjects because they are more closely aligned with “feminine” jobs, such as teaching or care work. These stereotypes can influence student achievement in these areas.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Research on [[stereotype threat]] has shown that gender stereotypes decrease the mathematical self-esteem of many female students, and that this lack of academic confidence leads to anxiety and poorer performance on math exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amelink |first=C. |year=2009 |title=Information sheet: gender differences in math performance |work=Assessing Women in Engineering |volume=1–4 |url=https://www.engr.psu.edu/AWE/misc/ARPs/ARP_InfoSheet_Math.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parent socialization===

How a child's parents view his or her skills can also contribute to the gender achievement gap in education. A study by Jacobs and Eccles has shown that adults rate female children as having better social skills than male children, and that girls are more likely to be seen as "good children" than boys.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt; These gender-based stereotypes can perpetuate the gender achievement gap in education by influencing parents' perceptions of their children's skills, and these perceptions can influence the types of activities and subjects parents steer their children toward.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Janis E. |first2=Jacquelynne S. |last2=Eccles |year=1992 |title=The Impact of Mothers' Gender-Role Stereotypic Beliefs on Mothers' and Children's Ability Perceptions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=932–944 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-economic factors === 
The gender achievement gap, measured by standardized test scores, suspensions, and absences, in favor of female students, is larger at worse schools and among lower-income households. So poverty and school quality are partially responsible for the gap. &lt;ref&gt;Guo, Jeff. "The serious reason boys do worse than girls." The Washington Post. January 28, 2016. https://archive.today/20180722233207/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/28/the-serious-reason-boys-do-worse-than-girls/?utm_term=.4f067a226d42&amp;noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

=== self-regulation and conscientiousness. === 
Girls tend to have better self-regulation skills than boys. Self-regulation skills correlate with time spent on homework and time spent taking notes in class. This contributes to girls getting better grades than boys in all subject. &lt;ref&gt;GNAULATI, ENRICO. "Why Girls Tend to Get Better Grades Than Boys Do." The Atlantic. SEP 18, 2014. https://archive.today/20170328190455/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/#selection-1251.0-1251.12.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Sex differences in psychology]]

==Implications of the gender gap==

It is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Glenn |first2=Ashley |last2=Swanson |year=2010 |title=The Gender Gap in Secondary School Mathematics at High Achievement Levels: Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all “masculine” fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as “nerdy” or “geeky,” and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

The careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a [[Gender pay gap|gender wage gap]]. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Attempts to reduce the gender gap==

There have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name="Miyake"/&gt;

Values affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women's achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Akira |last=Miyake |first2=Lauren E. |last2=Kost-Smith |first3=Noah D. |last3=Finkelstein |first4=Steven J. |last4=Pollock |first5=Geoffrey L. |last5=Cohen |first6=Tiffany A. |last6=Ito |displayauthors=1 |year=2010 |title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=330 |issue=6008 |pages=1234–1237 |doi=10.1126/science.1195996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers for disadvantaged students and efforts to close the gap    ==
Another explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion .&lt;ref&gt;Eichelberger, Brenda, Mattioli, Heather, &amp; Foxhoven, Rachel. (2017). Uncovering Barriers to Financial Capability: Underrepresented Students' Access to Financial Resources. ''Journal of Student Financial Aid,'' ''47''(3), Journal of Student Financial Aid, 2017, Vol.47(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services. 

On the high school level, a report finds that the greater the amount of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zelinski, N. (2015, May). "Path not found": Report says low-income students lack computer access. ''Oakland Post'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.csun.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.csun.edu/docview/1686085124?accountid=7285&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide economics indicate 1.3 million new jobs in the tech industry by 2022. Meanwhile, African Americans and Latinos only make up about 5 percent of the technical work force. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Supplemental funding for targeted disadvantaged school districts in Ohio showed a reduction in performance gaps between disadvantaged districts and other districts. Supplementing state funds for the districts with higher amount of disadvantaged students produced benefits in the form of student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Gary T., Fortner, C. Kevin, &amp; Thompson, Charles L. (2010). Targeted Funding for Educationally Disadvantaged Students: A Regression Discontinuity Estimate of the Impact on High School Student Achievement. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis,'' ''32''(2), 183-204.&lt;/ref&gt; IDA's or individual development account initiatives introduced in the 1990s to address poverty was found on the belief that poor family's should have access to asset development in order to break the cycle of poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kezar, A., Lester, J., &amp; Yang, H. (2010). Nonprofits Partnering With Postsecondary Institutions to Increase Low-Income Student Access. Educational Policy, 24(3), 500-533.&lt;/ref&gt; As of now most IDA's main focus is on home ownership or starting small businesses. There has been a push for partnerships between community agencies and higher education institutions that would offer IDA's to encourage lower income individuals to turn towards higher education. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Anna J. Hamilton''' (April 20, 1860 - ) was an American educator, journalist, writer, and editor from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. She was one of the editors for Kentucky on "A Woman of the Century", and was engaged in editorial work on the "National encyclopedia of America". Hamilton served as principal of Semple Collegiate School in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]],{{sfn|National Educational Association|1907|p=65}} after taking over its management in 1900, along with [[Anne Carroll Moore|Annie Moore]].{{sfn|Kleber|2001|p=801}}

==Early years and education==
Anna J. Hamilton was born in Louisville on April 20, 1860. She was descended on the maternal side from the old Kentucky family of Caldwells, and on the paternal side from the Hamiltons, of [[Pennsylvania]]. She was educated in the public schools of Louisville and was graduated from the girls' high school.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=353}}

==Career==
Hamilton served as chair in the Normal School, being known as an enthusiastic educator. She was a writer of both prose and poetry. Her poems were published in the local journals and in various periodicals. Much of her time was on editorial work. For a year, she edited the children's column in a prominent educational journal. She was one of the editors for Kentucky on "A Woman of the Century", and was engaged in editorial work on the "National encyclopedia of America". She was a member of the library committee from Kentucky for the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair]].

An '''architect''' is a person who plans, designs, and reviews the [[construction]] of [[buildings]].  To ''practice architecture'' means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.&lt;!--Removed bit about 'human use' as obvious in most architectural work, except for animal shelters, zoos, etc.--&gt;&lt;ref name=ns.ca&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm The Nova Scotia Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000000/http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically, ''architect'' derives from the Latin ''architectus'', which derives from the Greek (''arkhi-'', chief + ''tekton'', builder), i.e., '''chief builder'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a ''practicum'' (or ''internship'') for practical experience to earn a [[Profession|license]] to practice [[architecture]]. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction.

==Origins==
{{Main article|History of Architecture}}
Throughout ancient and medieval history, most of the architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s—such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of master builder. Until modern times, there was no clear distinction between architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles ''architect'' and ''engineer'' were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&amp;q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt {{ISBN|0-8052-1082-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined|title=Civil Engineering Defined - Civil Engineering Definitions and History - smweng.com|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.smweng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Masaccio, cappella brancacci, san pietro in cattedra. ritratto di filippo brunelleschi.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi]] is revered as one of the most inventive and gifted architects in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://totallyhistory.com/filippo-brunelleschi Filippo Brunelleschi], Totally History&lt;/ref&gt;]]It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional 'gentleman' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600. The availability of both allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals.&lt;ref name="MAD 225"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacey|first=Arnold|title=Medieval Architectural Drawing|year=2007|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4404-8|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas.&lt;ref name="MAD 225" /&gt; However, the development was gradual. Until the 18th-century, buildings continued to be designed and set out by craftsmen with the exception of high-status projects.&lt;ref name="MAD 225" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ab project"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vardhan|first1=Harsh|title=Different types of work by architects|url=http://archibuddy.com/app/user/storyboard/5a919eafec9a1606f9f16f07|website=Archibuddy|publisher=www.archibuddy.com|accessdate=17 March 2018|ref=archibuddy project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
In most developed countries, only qualified people with an appropriate license, certification, or registration with a relevant body, often governmental, may legally practice architecture. Such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as ''[[architectural designer]]'' are often not legally protected.

To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term ''[[building design]] professional'' (or ''Design professional)'', by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as [[engineering]] professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as ''[[architectural technologist]]s'' and ''[[intern architect]]s''. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.

==Practice==
In the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design and construction management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. However, the design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. Often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning, entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief. The program or brief is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner — it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

It is generally expected that the design proposal(s)is both imaginative as well as pragmatic, but the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary, depending on the place, time, finance, culture, and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place.

Designing buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking, no matter what the scale of the project might be. A strong degree of foresight is a prerequisite. Any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables which include qualities of space(s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture|title=Space: The undefinable space of architecture|first=Erdem|last=Üngür|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations, and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of [[mathematics and architecture]], new or current [[architectural theory]], or references to [[architectural history]].

A key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM (Building Information Management), CAD, and cloud-based technologies.

At all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.

====Means of design====

Previously, architects employed drawings&lt;ref name="MAD 225"/&gt; to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects|title=17 Napkin Sketches by Famous Architects|date=5 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer technology has now become the industry standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html|title=Think Before You Build|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski|date=30 March 2011|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, and other media in design production. 
Increasingly, computer software such as [[BIM]] is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building's design, construction and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States |publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental role===
As current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house|title=What is a Passive House? [  ]|website=passipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future.

===Construction role===
As the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions).

Architects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.

In most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.

The architect will typically review contractor [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in the design and to manage construction.

In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.

===Alternate practice and specializations===
Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as building code, [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.

Many architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], construction management, [[interior design]], city planning, or other related fields.

==Professional requirements==
{{Main article|Professional requirements for architects}}
{{See also|Architectural engineering#Architect}}

Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Educational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]] or [[wikt:surveyor|surveyor]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

==Fees==
Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.

Overall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner, or shareholder, etc.), and the size and location of the firm.

==Professional organizations==
{{main article|List of professional architecture organizations}}
A number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.

The American Institute of Architects (AIA) USA

Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) UK

Architects Registration Board (ARB) UK

The Australian Institute of Architects (AIA)   Australia

Association of Licensed Architects 
(ALA)    USA

==Prizes, awards, and titles==
{{main article|List of architecture prizes}}
[[File:Zaha Hadid in Heydar Aliyev Cultural center in Baku nov 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Zaha Hadid]], winner of the 2004 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].]]
A wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures, and professional careers.

The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the "[[Nobel Prize]] for architecture." Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Royal Gold Medal]], the [[AIA Gold Medal]] (USA), AIA Gold Medal (Australia), and the [[Praemium Imperiale]].

Architects in the UK, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA.  Architects in the US, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects and can write [[FAIA]] after their name. Architects in Canada, who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service, or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), may be elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.

Architects in the [[Philippines]] and [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipino communities overseas]] (whether they are Filipinos or not), especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as ''Architect'', rather than ''Sir/Madam'' in speech or ''Mr./Mrs./Ms.'' (''G./Gng./Bb.'' in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.

'''Artspeak''' is a computer language conceived by [[Jacob T. Schwartz]] at [[New York University]]'s [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]].  Until 2011, the only known compiler/interpreter was written for the [[CDC 6600]], a mainframe computer.  In order to program in Artspeak on the CDC 6600, one had to use punch cards and utilize [[batch processing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc3/showpage.php?page=63 ARTSPEAK -- A Computer Language For Young At Heart And The Art Lover (The ARTSPEAK graphics programming language; history, reaction, examples)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artspeak was a specialized language that worked with a single-color graphical [[plotter]] to produce graphical output on a 10-inch by 10-inch sheet of paper.  It used simple, English language-based statements to draw elemental shapes, including [[circle]]s, [[point (geometry)|point]]s, [[Plain text|text]], and many types of [[curve]]s (including [[line (geometry)|lines]]).

In 2011, Ron Schnell (author of [[Dunnet (game)|Dunnet]]) found an old draft manual for the language, and after discovering that the language ceased to exist, wrote it from scratch in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artspeak.quogic.com/artspeak.pdf New Artspeak Reference Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new version of Artspeak outputs to a [[computer monitor]], as opposed to a plotter, and allows local and server storage of Artspeak programs.  There are other differences from the original Artspeak, all of which are detailed in the reference guide.

'''Baby Einstein''' is a line of [[multimedia]] products, including [[direct-to-video]] programs, [[CD]]s, [[book]]s, [[flashcard]]s, [[toy]]s, and baby gear that specialize in interactive activities for [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s, created by Julie Aigner-Clark. 
The videos are known for showing babies and toddlers under four years simple patterns, puppet shows, and familiar objects, such as everyday items, animals, and toys that are often accompanied by reorchestrated classical music written by composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig Van Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and many others constructed for an easy, relaxing way meant for a baby's ear.

Baby Einstein was introduced to the public in 1996 and remained a small company until Clark sold to Disney. Between November 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/07/business/fi-1070|title=Disney Buys Toy Maker, Publisher Baby Einstein|last=VERRIER|first=RICHARD|date=2001-11-07|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and September 2013, [[Disney]] owned and operated the Baby Einstein brand. Starting in October 2013, [[Kids 2, Inc.]] owns and operates the Baby Einstein brand.

==History==
The '''Baby Einstein Company''' was founded in 1996 by former teacher and stay-at-home mom Julie Aigner-Clark at her home in suburban [[Alpharetta, Georgia|Alpharetta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as '''I Think I Can Productions'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO0eqXc1ous|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aigner-Clark and her husband invested $18,000 of their savings to produce the initial product, a VHS they named ''Baby Einstein'' and later sold as ''Language Nursery''.

The original video shows a variety of toys and visuals interspersed with music, stories, numbers, and words of many languages. Eventually, the video was marketed across the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Other videos followed, some featuring the Clarks' two daughters, Aspen and Sierra, as well as other children.

It quickly became a multimillion-dollar [[Media franchise|franchise]]; its revenue grew from $1 million in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work =Denver Post| title=Baby videos spell big money Mom turns 'Einstein' into million-dollar enterprise| author=Eric Hubler| date=March 12, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to $25 million in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nurturing a 'Baby' boom Littleton woman's line of videos, CDs a hit with children| work=Denver Post| date=May 30, 2001 |author=Daisy Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1998, Julie Aigner-Clark renamed the company the Baby Einstein Company, and in February 2000 gave distribution rights of the company's home videos to [[Artisan Entertainment]] and [[Family Home Entertainment]], both now acquired by and folded into [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]. In November 2001, Julie Aigner-Clark sold Baby Einstein to [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Artisan Entertainment Acquires Rights to Distribute Branded Developmental Series From The Baby Einstein Company| date=February 10, 2000 | work =Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept and popularity of Baby Einstein expanded as a Disney property. Educational toys and additional videos were developed. Baby Einstein was also the source of inspiration for a Preschool-aimed television series called ''[[Little Einsteins]]'', created jointly by [[Disney]] and [[Curious Pictures]]. The series aired episodes on [[Playhouse Disney]] from 2005-2009 and has since been airing reruns on [[Disney Junior]] the channel.

The success of Baby Einstein was estimated to be nearly $400 million based on revenues. Julie was named "Entrepreneur of the Year" and won various awards, and one in three U.S. households with babies were found to own at least one Baby Einstein product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It received positive media and Aigner-Clark appeared on the ''[[Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The Today Show]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]'', among others. President [[George W. Bush]] mentioned the Baby Einstein Company in his 2007 [[State of the Union]] address, which Aigner-Clark was invited to attend.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2008, Clark, along with actress [[Jennifer Garner]], hosted a tenth anniversary party for ''Baby Einstein''. Clark had also announced plans to launch a toddler brand called ''Einstein Pals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080820005257/en/Baby-Einstein-TM-Founder-Julie-Clark-Jennifer|title=Baby Einstein(TM) Founder Julie Clark and Jennifer Garner Host 10th Anniversary Celebration - Business Wire|author=|date=|work=businesswire.com|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including videos, but it has since been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/einstein-pals-77294482.html|title=Apply for a Trademark. Search a Trademark|author=|date=|work=trademarkia.com|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Baby Einstein being named for [[Albert Einstein]], [[royalties]] had to be paid to [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]] which compensates the Einstein [[Estate (law)|estate]]. This made Einstein one of the top five earning dead celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/cobain-is-the-new-elvis/2006/10/25/1161699375968.html |title= Cobain is the new Elvis (Most earning dead celebrities)| work =Sydney Morning Herald|date=2006-10-25|accessdate=2008-08-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905014203/http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/cobain-is-the-new-elvis/2006/10/25/1161699375968.html| archivedate= 5 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===FTC complaint===
In May 2006, the [[Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood]] (CCFC) filed a complaint with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) against the Baby Einstein Company and similar companies for [[false advertising]].&lt;ref name=FTCcomplaint&gt;[http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/ftccomplaint.htm "Baby Einstein &amp; Brainy Baby FTC Complaint"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719054418/http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/ftccomplaint.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood website, retrieved Dec. 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The CCFC alleged false advertising based on an [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommendation that children under two should be discouraged from watching television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;107/2/423 |author=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]], Committee on Public Education |title=Children, Adolescents, and Television (policy statement) |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=107 |date=February 2001 |pages=423–426 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.423 |pmid=11158483 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706012200/http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3B107/2/423 |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cited studies showing that only 6% of parents were aware of that recommendation, whereas 49% thought educational videos were very important in children's intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mothering.com/guest_editors/kids_commercialism/kids_commercialism.html |title=Putting the Book Back in Book Fair |work=[[Mothering (magazine)|Mothering]] |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-13 |author=Josh Golin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812174744/http://www.mothering.com/guest_editors/kids_commercialism/kids_commercialism.html |archivedate=2007-08-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/entmedia121405pkg.cfm |title=New Report on Educational Media for Babies, Toddlers, and Preschoolers|author1=Michelle M.

In December 2007, the FTC closed the complaint, noting that some of the CCFC's claims did not raise issues under the FTC's substantiation rules.&lt;ref name=FTCClosingLetter&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/closings/staff/071205einst.pdf "Federal Trade Commission Closing Letter"] to counsel for the Baby Einstein Company, December 5, 2007, retrieved July 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC also considered the redesign of the Baby Einstein website, which removed certain product testimonials and product descriptions, as well as the company's promise to make sure that advertising claims about products' educational and developmental value would be properly substantiated.&lt;ref name=FTCClosingLetter/&gt; However, the websites of Baby Einstein in languages other than English are not all modified in the same way.

A 2010 study published in ''[[Psychological Science]]'' demonstrated that children who viewed the videos regularly for one month, with or without their parents, "showed no greater understanding of words from the program than kids who never saw it".&lt;ref name=bower&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bruce Bower|title=DVDs don’t turn toddlers into vocabulary Einsteins| url= https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dvds-don%E2%80%99t-turn-toddlers-vocabulary-einsteins| work= ScienceNews |date = September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, children who were taught by their parents improved the most; researchers speculated that this was probably because children learn best "through meaningful gestures and interactive communication with parents".&lt;ref name=maia&gt;{{cite news|author1=Maia Szalavitz |title=‘Like Crack for Babies': Kids Love Baby Einstein, But They Don’t Learn From It|url=http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/07/like-crack-for-babies-baby-einstein-fails-again-in-new-study |work =Time|date=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these new findings, Disney offered refunds to parents whose children did not see improvement,&lt;ref&gt;Tamar Lewin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/education/24baby.html "No Einstein in Your Crib?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1047">Historically, '''bannimus''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "we banish") was the form of [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] of any individual from the [[University of Oxford]], by putting the proctorial edict up in some public place, as a denunciation or promulgation of it. It also served to prevent the individual from claiming the cause of expulsion was unknown.

Individuals can still be expelled today, as well as ''rusticated'', that is, when a student is sent down or banished from the University for a period of time before being allowed to return and further their education.

The term ''bannimus'' is related to ''bannition'', which is the general expulsion of an individual from a university.

'''Bertha Harmer''' (2 March 1885 – 14 December 1934) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] nurse, writer and educator, known for writing the textbook ''Textbook of the Principles and Practice of Nursing''.{{r|hnn}}

Harmer was born in [[Port Hope, Ontario]], the daughter of a railway carpenter. After finishing high school and working for several years,{{r|aahn}}
she earned a nursing degree from the Toronto General Hospital in 1913,{{r|hnn}}
and a bachelor's degree in administration and teaching from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] in 1915.{{r|aahn}}

In 1922, as a nursing teacher at St. Luke's Hospital Training School for Nurses in New York, Harmer published the first edition of her textbook.
She joined the faculty of the [[Yale School of Nursing]] in 1923, and remained there until 1927;{{r|aahn}} at Yale, she was also First Assistant Superintendent of Nurses at the New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.{{r|hnn|aahn}} During this time she also published a second book, ''Methods and Principles of Teaching the Practice of Nursing''.{{r|aahn}}

She left her position at Yale in 1927 for health reasons, but returned to Teachers College where she earned a master's degree.{{r|aahn}}
In 1928 she moved to [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], where she became director of McGill's nursing school.{{r|hnn|mcgill}}
At McGill, in the height of the [[Great Depression]], she had to work hard to prevent the school from closing.{{r|aahn|kerr}}
By 1934 her health had again become a problem for her; she resigned from McGill, and died that year.{{r|hnn|aahn}}

She revised her book twice, publishing a second edition in 1928 and a third edition in 1934.{{r|hnn}}
Its publisher, Macmillan, published fourth and fifth editions in 1939 and 1955, adding Virginia Henderson as a second author but keeping Harmer's name because of the popularity of the book.{{r|hnn}}

== History ==
[[Image:Red wolf pups - captive breeding.jpg|thumb|[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]] staff with two [[red wolf]] pups bred in captivity]]
[[File:Arabian oryx (oryx leucoryx).jpg|thumb|The Arabian Oryx is one of the first animals reintroduced via a captive breeding program.]]
Captive breeding techniques began with the first human domestication of animals such as goats, and plants like wheat, at least 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/domestication/|title=domestication|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were then expanded with the rise of the first [[zoo]]s, which started as royal menageries in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/leopards-hippos-cats-oh-worlds-first-zoo/|title=The World's First Zoo {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=2015-11-12|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity, which led to the increase in zoos worldwide. The first actual captive breeding programs were only started in the 1960s. These programs, such as the [[Arabian oryx|Arabian Oryx]] breeding program from The Phoenix Zoo in 1962, were aimed at the reintroduction of these species into the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/the-loneliest-animals/captive-breeding-success-stories/4920/|title=The Loneliest Animals {{!}} Captive Breeding Success Stories {{!}} Nature {{!}} PBS|date=2009-04-01|work=Nature|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs expanded under The [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]], which focused on protecting endangered species and their habitats to preserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/articles/dduszoos.htm|title=Detailed Discussion of the Laws Affecting Zoos {{!}} Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research and conservation centers have been housed in zoos, such as the Institute for Conservation Research at the San Diego Zoo founded in 1975 and expanded in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-06-28|title=BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF SAN DIEGO|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=3|issue=1|pages=126–127|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1962.tb03439.x|issn=0074-9664}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have contributed to the successful conservation efforts of species such as the [[Hawaiian crow|Hawaiian Crow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://institute.sandiegozoo.org/species/alala|title='Alala|date=2015-09-18|work=San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordination==
The breeding of species of conservation concern is coordinated by cooperative breeding programs containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective. These studbooks contain information on birth date, gender, location, and lineage (if known), which helps determine survival and reproduction rates, number of founders of the population, and inbreeding coefficients.&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web| title = Captive Breeding Populations| work = [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]]| url = http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/endangeredspecies/capbreedpops/default.cfm| deadurl = yes| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612095538/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm| archive-date = 2010-06-12| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A species coordinator reviews the information in studbooks and determines a breeding strategy that would produce most advantageous offspring.

If two compatible animals are found at different zoos, the animals may be transported for mating, but this is stressful, which could in turn make mating less likely. However, this is still a popular breeding method among European zoological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = European Association of Zoos and Aquaria| title = EEPs and ESBs| date = 2015-02-05| url=http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205074701/http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-date=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artificial fertilization]] (by shipping semen) is another option, but male animals can experience stress during semen collection, and the same goes for females during the artificial insemination procedure. Furthermore, this approach yields lower-quality semen, because shipping requires extending the life of the sperm for the transit time.

There are regional programmes for the conservation of [[endangered species]]:

== Challenges ==

===Genetics===
The objective of many captive populations is to hold similar levels of  genetic diversity to what is found in wild populations. As captive populations are usually small and maintained in artificial environments, genetics factors such as adaptation, inbreeding and loss of diversity can be a major concern.

==== [[Domestication]] (Adaptation) ====
Adaptive differences between plant and animal populations arise due to variations in environmental pressures. In the case of captive breeding prior to reintroduction into the wild, it's possible for species to evolve to adapt to the captive environment, rather than their natural environment.[11] Reintroducing a plant or animal to an environment dissimilar to the one they were originally from can cause fixation of traits that may not be suited for that environment leaving the individual disadvantaged. Selection intensity, initial genetic diversity, and effective population size can impact how much the species adapts to its captive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03399.x |pmid=18173504 |title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=325–33 |year=2008 |last1=Frankham |first1=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling works indicate that the duration of the programs (i.e., time from the foundation of the captive population to the last release event) is an important determinant of reintroduction success.

==== Genetic diversity ====
One consequence of small captive population size is the increased impact of [[genetic drift]], where genes have the potential to fix or disappear completely by chance, thereby reducing genetic diversity. Other factors that can impact genetic diversity in a captive population are bottlenecks and initial population size. [[Population bottleneck|Bottlenecks]], such as rapid decline in the population or a small initial population impacts genetic diversity. Loss can be minimized by establishing a population with a large enough number of founders to genetically represent the wild population, maximize population size, maximize ratio of effective population size to actual population size, and minimize the number of generations in captivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== [[Inbreeding]] ====
Inbreeding is when organisms mate with closely related individuals, lowering [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] in a population. Although inbreeding can be relatively common, when it results in a reduction in fitness it is known as [[inbreeding depression]]. The detrimental effects of inbreeding depression are especially prevalent in smaller populations and can therefore be extensive in captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalinowski|first=Steven T.|date=2018|title=Inbreeding Depression in the Speke's Gazelle Captive Breeding Program|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=14|pages=1375–1384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make these populations the most viable, it is important to monitor and reduce the effects of deleterious allele expression caused by inbreeding depression and to restore genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Comparing inbred populations against non-inbred or less-inbred populations can help determine the extent of detrimental effects if any are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grueber|first=Catherine E.|date=2015|title=Impacts of early viability selection on management if inbreeding and genetic diversity in conservation|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|pages=962–1083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely monitoring the possibility of inbreeding within the captive bred population is also key to the success of reintroduction into the species' native habitat. [[File:Speke's Gazelle.jpg|thumb|The Speke's Gazelle was the focus of a captive breeding program centered on determining the effect of selection on reducing genetic load.]]

===== [[Outbreeding depression|Outbreeding]] =====
Outbreeding is when organisms mate with unrelated individuals, increasing heterozygosity in a population. Although new diversity is often beneficial, if there a large genetic differences between the two individuals it can result in outbreeding depression. This is a reduction in fitness, similar to that of inbreeding depression, but arises from a number of different mechanisms, including taxonomic issues, chromosomal differences, sexual incompatibility, or adaptive differences between the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2011|title=Predicting the Probability of Outbreeding Depression|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=25|pages=465–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common cause is chromosomal ploidy differences and hybridization between individuals leading to sterility. The best example is in the [[orangutan]], which, prior to taxonomic revisions in the 1980s would be commonly mated in captive populations producing [[hybrid orangutan]]s with lower fitness {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. If chromosomal ploidy is ignored during reintroduction, restoration efforts would fail due to sterile hybrids in the wild. If there are large genetic differences between individuals originally from distant populations, those individuals should only be bred in circumstances where no other mates exist.

====Behavior Changes====
Captive breeding can contribute to changes in behavior in animals that have been reintroduced to the wild. Released animals are commonly less capable of hunting or foraging for food, which leads to [[starvation]], possibly because the young animals spent the critical learning period in captivity. Released animals often display more risk-taking behavior and fail to avoid [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhee|first=M. Elsbeth|date=2003|title=Generations in captivity increases behavioral variance: considerations for captive breeding and reintroduction programs|url=https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/mcpheem/private-docs/cv-documents/McPhee%202003%20BC.pdf|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=115|pages=71–77|via=|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(03)00095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golden lion tamarin]] mothers often die in the wild before having [[offspring]] because they cannot climb and forage. This leads to continuing population declines despite [[reintroduction]] as the species are unable to produce [[:wikt:viable|viable]] [[offspring]]. Training can improve anti-predator skills, but its effectiveness varies.&lt;ref name="JJWPT91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CB2000" /&gt;

Salmon bred in captivity have shown similar declines in caution and are killed by predators when young. However, salmon that were reared in an enriched environment with natural prey showed less risk-taking behaviors and were more likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Environmental enrichment reduces maladaptive risk-taking behavior in salmon reared for conservation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711001571|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=144|issue=7|pages=1972–1979|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.017|issn=0006-3207|last1=Roberts|first1=L.J.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Garcia De Leaniz|first3=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[Mouse|mice]] has found that after captive breeding had been in place for multiple generations and these mice were "released" to breed with wild mice, that the captive-born mice bred amongst themselves instead of with the wild mice. This suggests that captive breeding may affect mating preferences, and has implications for the success of a reintroduction program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slade B, Parrott ML, Paproth A, Magrath MJ, Gillespie GR, Jessop TS | title = Assortative mating among animals of captive and wild origin following experimental conservation releases | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 20140656 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25411380 | pmc = 4261860 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black Robin on Rangatira Island.jpg|thumb|Chatham Island Black Robin on Rangatira Island, New Zealand.]]
Human mediated recovery of species can unintentionally promote maladaptive behaviors in wild populations. In 1980 the number of wild Chatham Island Black Robins was reduced to a single mating pair. Intense management of populations helped the population recover and by 1998 there were 200 individuals. During recovery scientists observed "rim laying" an egg laying habit where individuals laid eggs on the rim of the nest instead of the center. Rim laid eggs never hatched. To combat this land managers pushed the egg to the center of the nest, which greatly increased reproduction. However, by allowing this maladaptive trait to persist, over half the population were now rim layers. Genetic studies found that this was an autosomal dominant mendelian trait that was selected for due to human intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massaro|first=Melanie|last2=Sainudiin|first2=Raazesh|last3=Merton|first3=Don|last4=Briskie|first4=James V.|last5=Poole|first5=Anthony M.|last6=Hale|first6=Marie L.|date=2013-12-09|title=Human-Assisted Spread of a Maladaptive Behavior in a Critically Endangered Bird|journal=PLOS One|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e79066|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079066|pmid=24348992|pmc=3857173|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Cheetah at De Wildt Cheetah Farm, Hartbeespoort, North West Province (6253206366).jpg|thumb|A cheetah at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre.]]
The [[De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre]], established in [[South Africa]] in 1971, has a [[cheetah]] captive breeding program. Between 1975 and 2005, 242 litters were born with a total of 785 cubs. The [[survival rate]] of cubs was 71.3% for the first twelve months and 66.2% for older cubs, validating the fact that cheetahs can be bred successfully (and their [[endangerment]] decreased). It also indicated that failure in other breeding habitats may be due to "poor" sperm [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=RDA08/&gt;

Wild [[Tasmanian devil]]s have declined by 90% due to a [[Transmissible cancers|transmissible cancer]] called [[Devil Facial Tumor Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://discovermagazine.com/2014/may/13-the-immortal-devil|title = Fatal Cancer Threatens Tasmanian Devil Populations|last = Rehmeyer|first = Julie|date = March 31, 2014|work = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A captive insurance population program has started, but the captive breeding rates at the moment are lower than they need to be. Keeley, Fanson, Masters, and McGreevy (2012) sought to "increase our understanding of the [[estrous cycle]] of the devil and elucidate potential causes of failed male-female pairings" by examining temporal patterns of fecal [[progestogen]] and [[corticosterone]] [[metabolite]] concentrations. They found that the majority of unsuccessful females were captive-born, suggesting that if the species' survival depended solely on captive breeding, the population would probably disappear.&lt;ref name=keeley2012/&gt;

== Methods Used in Captive Breeding ==
{{See also|Artificial_insemination#In_animals}}
[[File:Californian Condor 50 MC.jpg|thumb|Every known individual of the California condor population has been captured and then bred using research from microsatellite regions in their genome.]]
To found a captive breeding population with adequate [[genetic diversity]], breeders usually select individuals from different source populations—ideally, at least 20-30 individuals. Founding populations for captive breeding programs have often had fewer individuals than ideal because of their threatened state, leaving them more susceptible to challenges such as inbreeding depression.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

To overcome challenges of captive breeding such as adaptive differences, loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and outbreeding depression and get desired results, captive breeding programs use many monitoring methods. [[Artificial insemination]] is used to produce the desired offspring from individuals who don't mate naturally to reduce effects of mating closely related individuals such as inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics . Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition.|last=Frankham|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-87847-0|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods as seen in [[panda pornography]] allow programs to mate chosen individuals by encouraging mating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/22/AR2006112202039.html|title=Pandas Getting New View of Mating Ritual|last=Gray|first=Denis D.|date=2006-11-23|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a concern in captive breeding is to minimize the effects of breeding closely related individuals, [[microsatellite]] regions from an organisms genome can be used to determine amounts of relationship among founders to minimize relatedness and pick the most distant individuals to breed.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This method has successfully been used in the captive breeding of the [[California condor]] and the [[Guam rail]]. The maximum avoidance of inbreeding (MAI) scheme allows control at a group level rather than an individual level by rotating individuals between groups to avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==New technologies==

=== Assisted reproduction technology (ART): Artificial insemination ===

Getting captive wild animals to breed naturally can be a difficult task. Giant panda for example lose interest in [[mating]] once they are captured, and female giant pandas only experience estrus once a year, which only lasts for 48 to 72 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/2015/03/11/giant-panda-undergoes-artificial-insemination-procedure-at-the-san-diego-zoo|title=Giant Panda Undergoes Artificial Insemination Procedure at the Sand Diego Zoo|last=|first=|date=2015-03-11|website=Zoonooz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have turned to artificial insemination in an attempt to increase the populations of endangered animals. It may be used for many reasons, including to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to control the paternity of offspring, and to avoid injury incurred during natural mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/insemination.htm|title=Artificial Insemination of the Mare|last=|first=|date=|website=Equine Artificial Insemination|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates more genetically diverse captive populations, enabling captive facilities to easily share genetic material with each other without the need to move animals. Scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world's first macaw by assisted reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/06/25/finally_a_way_to_collect_semen_from_parrots_106573.html|title=Finally: A Way to Collect Semen from Parrots|last=Pomeroy|first=Ross|date=June 24, 2013|website=Real Clear Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryopreservation ===

Animal species can be preserved in [[Genebank|gene banks]], which consist of [[cryogenic|a cryogenic]] facilities used to store live [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[Ovum|eggs]], or [[embryo]]s in ultracold conditions. The Zoological Society of San Diego has established a "[[frozen zoo]]" to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species samples using [[cryopreservation]] techniques. At present, there has been more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilization, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilization. Cryogenically preserved specimens can potentially be used to revive breeds that are [[Endangered species|endangered]] o r[[Extinction|extinct]], for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation. However, cryo-conservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryo-conservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm|title=Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cryobiology is a field of active research and many studies concerning plants are underway.

An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the [[Hungarian Grey cattle]], or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9 million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of [[World War II]] and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12581284|title=Economic and ecological importance of indigenous livestock and the application of assisted reproduction to their preservation| vauthors = Solti L, Crichton EG, Loskutoff N, Cseh S | date = 2000-02-01|volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the [[Mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.hu/en/hungarian-grey-cattle|title=WWF|website=wwf.hu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/|title=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===

The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ono T, Li C, Mizutani E, Terashita Y, Yamagata K, Wakayama T | title = Inhibition of class IIb histone deacetylase significantly improves cloning efficiency in mice | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 929–37 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20686182 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.110.085282 | url = https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/83/6/929/2530195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloning-endangered-animals/|title=Will Cloning Ever Save Endangered Animals?|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last bucardo ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah. However, cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333206/Clone-farming-introduce-cruelty-massive-scale-say-animal-welfare-groups.html|title=Clone farming would introduce cruelty on a massive scale, say animal welfare groups|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interspecific pregnancy ===

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is [[interspecific pregnancy]], implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Niasari-Naslaji A, Nikjou D, Skidmore JA, Moghiseh A, Mostafaey M, Razavi K, Moosavi-Movahedi AA |date=2009-01-29|title=Interspecies embryo transfer in camelids: the birth of the first Bactrian camel calves (Camelus bactrianus) from dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius)|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/RD08140|journal=Reproduction, Fertility and Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=333–337|doi=10.1071/RD08140|issn=1448-5990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for the Spanish Ibex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02900547 |title=Advances in interspecific pregnancy |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=1772–8 |year=2001 |last1=Wang |first1=Xichao |last2=Dai |first2=Bojie |last3=Duan |first3=Enkui |last4=Chen |first4=Dayuan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Houbara bustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wernery U, Liu C, Baskar V, Guerineche Z, Khazanehdari KA, Saleem S, Kinne J, Wernery R, Griffin DK, Chang IK | title = Primordial germ cell-mediated chimera technology produces viable pure-line Houbara bustard offspring: potential for repopulating an endangered species | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e15824 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21209914 | pmc = 3012116 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0015824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical Considerations ==
With successes such as in 1986 when a population only of 18 black ferrets left in the world was brought back up to 500 in the wild, and when the Arabian oryx was brought back from extinction in 1972 to a population of 1,000 in the deserts of the Middle East, captive breeding programs have proven successful throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://psmag.com/environment/is-breeding-endangered-species-in-captivity-the-right-way-to-go|title=Is Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity the Right Way to Go?|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While captive breeding sounds like an ideal solution for preventing endangered animals from facing serious threats of extinction there are still reasons to believe that these programs can occasionally do more harm than good. Some detrimental effects include delays in understanding optimal conditions required for reproduction, failure to reach self-sustaining levels or provide sufficient stock for release, loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding, and poor success in reintroductions despite available captive-bred young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12449 |title=Ark or park: The need to predict relative effectiveness ofex situandin situconservation before attempting captive breeding |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=841–50 |year=2015 |last1=Dolman |first1=Paul M |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J |last3=Scotland |first3=Keith M |last4=Burnside |first4=Robert. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been proven that captive breeding programs have yielded negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms, there is no direct evidence to show that this negative effect also decreases the overall fitness of their wild-born descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0315 |pmid=19515651 |pmc=2781957 |title=Carry-over effect of captive breeding reduces reproductive fitness of wild-born descendants in the wild |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=621–4 |year=2009 |last1=Araki |first1=H |last2=Cooper |first2=B |last3=Blouin |first3=M. S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is reason to demand for the release of animals from captivity programs for four main reasons: a lack of sufficient space due to overly successful breeding programs, closure of facilities due to financial reasons, pressure from animal rights advocacy groups, and to aid the conservation of endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waples|first=Kelly A.|last2=Stagoll|first2=Clifford S. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1997|title=Ethical Issues in the Release of Animals from Captivity|journal=BioScience|volume=47|issue=2|pages=115–121|doi=10.2307/1313022|jstor=1313022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are many ethical complications to reintroducing animals born in captivity back into the wild. For example, when scientists were reintroducing a rare species of toad back into the Mallorcan wild in 1993, a potentially deadly fungus that could kill frogs and toads was unintentionally introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080922122427.htm|title=Captive Breeding Introduced Infectious Disease To Mallorcan Amphibians|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to maintain the organism’s original habitat, or replicate that specific habitat for species survival.

'''Chris Williams''' (born c. 1968/1969) is a [[Canadian Americans|Canadian American]] [[animator]], [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]. He directed the short film ''[[Glago's Guest]]'' and co-directed ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', which was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2009; ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', which won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Animated Feature in 2015 and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]],'' which was nominated for two Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song in 2016.

==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Missouri]] and spent the first 25 years of his life in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], Canada, where his father was the Director of Counselling Services at the [[University of Waterloo]].&lt;ref name=StarCanadian /&gt; Williams graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Fine Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Waterloo alumnus wins Oscar for Big Hero 6|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/university-waterloo-alumnus-wins-oscar-big-hero-6|website=Waterloo Stories|publisher=University of Waterloo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then enrolled in the animation program at [[Sheridan College]], Oakville, Ontario. Upon graduation from Sheridan, he was recruited by Disney and moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=StarCanadian /&gt;

==Career==
Williams previously worked in the story department for ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000), and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013), in which he also voiced the character Oaken. In February 2007, it was announced he would direct ''American Dog'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/news/toy-story-sequel-set-1117959040/ | title='Toy Story' sequel set | last=Fritz | first=Ben | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was re-titled ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'' (2008), and was later joined by [[Byron Howard]], both of them replaced [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] who was the original director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/bolt-teaser-poster-a-look-back-at-american-dog/ | title=Bolt Teaser Poster; A Look Back at American Dog | last=Sciretta | first=Peter | publisher=''[[/Film]]'' | date=June 20, 2008 | accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, it was reported by various sources that Williams would direct ''King of the Elves'' based on the story by [[Philip K. Dick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King of the Elves being reworked; Disney plans far ahead|url=http://filmonic.com/king-of-the-elves-being-reworked-disney-plans-far-ahead|accessdate=December 24, 2011|newspaper=Filmonic|date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Graser | first=Marc | last2=Sneider | first2=Jeff | url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/disney-revives-king-of-the-elves-toon-1118039315/ | title=Disney revives 'King of the Elves' toon | publisher=''Variety'' | date=June 29, 2011 | accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Disney Sets HORRIBLE BOSSES Scribe to Pen KING OF THE ELVES | last=Chitwood | first=Adam | url=http://collider.com/king-of-the-elves-michael-markowitz-disney/ | work=Collider | date=June 29, 2011 | accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2013, it was revealed that Williams had joined another Walt Disney Animation film, ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', as a co-director inspired by the [[Marvel Comics]] of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|the same name]].&lt;ref name="THRWilliams" /&gt;

'''College application''' is the process by which individuals apply to gain entry into a [[college]] or [[university]]. Although specific details vary by country and institution, applications generally require basic background information of the applicant, such as family background, and academic or qualifying exam details such as [[Grading (education)|grade point average]] in [[secondary school]] and [[standardized test]]ing scores.

==United States==
{{Main|College admissions in the United States}}
{{Further|Transfer admissions in the United States}}

Most colleges and universities in the U.S. have their own set of requirements for the information that is necessary for a college application. A common requirement on a college application is the applicant's standardized test scores, most commonly the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] or [[SAT]], and a high school [[Transcript (education)|transcript]]. Some colleges also require applications to include a [[Recommendation letter|Letter of Recommendation]] and a personal essay. A commonly accepted application used by many universities is the "[[Common Application]]" which is an online application that is used by over 500 colleges and universities. Deadlines for admission applications are established and published by each college or university.  Many college-bound students receive application assistance and advice from their high school guidance counselors.  Students who are transferring from a community college to a four-year college can obtain guidance from their college counselors.

Aided by marketing firms, some colleges send out "fast-track" applications. These applications typically waive the application fee, do not require essays, and assure an admittance decision within a shortened amount of time. Critics warn that these types of applications are misleading, because they give the impression that the student is pre-approved to be admitted and may not explore other colleges because this easy option is provided to them.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jacques. "Colleges Market Easy, No-Fee Sell to Applicants." ''The New York Times.''https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/education/26admit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Universities &amp; Colleges Admissions Service}}
Almost all [[British universities]] are members of UCAS, a [[Wiktionary:clearing house|clearing house]] for [[undergraduate]] admissions.
Applicants submit a single application for up to 5 courses at different universities. There is a maximum limit of 4 choices for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses.

The application also includes current and expected qualifications, employment, criminal history, a personal statement, and a reference (which generally includes predicted grades if the applicant is still in education).

Additional forms are required for application to [[Oxbridge]]. One can only apply to a particular college at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in a single year.
Many Oxbridge applicants are assessed through academic interviews and sometimes further testing.

'''Critical pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] and [[social movement]] that has developed and applied concepts from [[critical theory]] and related traditions to the field of [[education]] and the study of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe|last2=Steinburg|first2=Shirley|year=1997|title=Changing Multiculturalism|publisher=Open University Press|location=[[Bristol, PA]]|page=24|quote="Critical pedagogy is the term used to describe what emerges when critical theory encounters education"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of critical pedagogy view teaching as an inherently [[political]] act, reject the neutrality of knowledge, and insist that issues of [[social justice]] and [[democracy]] itself are not distinct from acts of [[teaching]] and [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H., 2007. Utopian thinking in dangerous times: Critical pedagogy and the project of educated hope. Utopian pedagogy: Radical experiments against neoliberal globalization, pp.25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of critical pedagogy is [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]] through an awakening of the [[critical consciousness]], based on the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term  ''[[conscientização]]''. When achieved, critical consciousness encourages individuals to effect change in their world through [[Social criticism|social critique]] and [[Activism|political action]].

== Background ==
The concept of critical pedagogy can be traced back to [[Paulo Freire]]'s best-known 1968 work, ''[[The Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. Freire, a professor of [[history]] and the [[philosophy of education]] at the [[University of Recife]] in Brazil, sought in this and other works to develop a philosophy of adult education that demonstrated a solidarity with the poor in their common struggle to survive by engaging them in a dialogue of greater awareness and analysis. Although his family had suffered loss and hunger during the [[Great Depression]], the poor viewed him and his formerly middle-class family "as people from another world who happened to fall accidentally into their world".&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8264-1276-8|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intimate discovery of class and their borders "led, invariably, to Freire's radical rejection of a class-based society".&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt;

The influential works of [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] made him arguably the most celebrated critical educator. He seldom used the term "critical pedagogy" himself when describing this philosophy. His initial focus targeted adult [[literacy]] projects in Brazil and later was adapted to deal with a wide range of social and educational issues. Freire's pedagogy revolved around an anti-authoritarian and interactive approach aimed to examine issues of relational power for students and workers.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt; The center of the curriculum used the fundamental goal based on social and political critiques of everyday life. Freire's praxis required implementation of a range of educational practices and processes with the goal of creating not only a better learning environment but also a better world. Freire himself maintained that this was not merely an educational technique but a way of living in our educative practice.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt;

Freire endorses students' ability to think critically about their education situation; this way of thinking is thought by practitioners of critical pedagogy to allow them to "recognize connections between their individual problems and experiences and the social contexts in which they are embedded".&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mingo.info-science.uiowa.edu/~stevens/critped/page1.htm | title = Critical Pedagogy on the Web | archive-url = https://archive.is/20030715084613/http://mingo.info-science.uiowa.edu/~stevens/critped/page1.htm | archive-date = 2003-07-15 | access-date = 2017-04-12 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing one's consciousness ("[[Critical consciousness|conscientization]]", "''conscientização"'') is then a needed first step of "[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]", which is defined as the power and know-how to take action against oppression while stressing the importance of liberating education. "Praxis involves engaging in a cycle of theory, application, evaluation, reflection, and then back to theory. Social transformation is the product of praxis at the collective level."&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt;

Critical pedagogue [[Ira Shor]], who was mentored by and worked closely with Freire from 1980 until Freire's death in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.csi.cuny.edu/ira_shor.html|title=Ira Shor|website=English Department|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical pedagogy as:

{{quote|Habits of thought, reading, writing, and speaking which go beneath surface meaning, first impressions, dominant myths, official'' ''pronouncements, traditional clichés, received wisdom, and mere opinions, to understand the deep meaning, root causes, social'' ''context, ideology, and personal consequences of any action, event, object, process, organization, experience, text, subject'' ''matter, policy, mass media, or discourse. (''Empowering Education'', 129)}}

Critical pedagogy explores the dialogic relationships between teaching and learning. Its proponents claim that it is a continuous process of what they call "unlearning", "learning", and "relearning", "reflection", "evaluation", and the effect that these actions have on the students, in particular students whom they believe have been historically and continue to be disenfranchised by what they call "traditional schooling". {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The educational philosophy has since been developed by [[Henry Giroux]] and others since the 1980s as a [[praxis (process)|praxis]]-oriented "educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop [[critical consciousness|a consciousness]] of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action".&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (October 27, 2010) "Lessons From Paulo Freire", ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]].'' Retrieved 10/20/10.&lt;/ref&gt; Freire wrote the introduction to his 1988 work, ''Teachers as Intellectuals: Toward a Critical Pedagogy of Learning.'' Another leading critical pedagogy theorist who Freire called his "intellectual cousin",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philcsc.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/foreword-to-peter-mclarens-pedagogy-of-insurrection/|title=Foreword to Peter McLaren's Pedagogy of Insurrection|last=philcsc|date=2016-01-09|website=philcsc.wordpress.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter McLaren]], wrote the foreword. McLaren and Giroux co-edited one book on critical pedagogy and co-authored another in the 1990s. Among its other leading figures in no particular order are [[bell hooks]] (Gloria Jean Watkins), [[Joe L. Kincheloe]], Patti Lather, [[Antonia Darder]], [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]], [[Peter McLaren]], [[Joe L. Kincheloe]], [[Khen Lampert]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Donaldo Macedo]], Sandy Grande, [[Michael Apple]], and Stephanie Ledesma. Educationalists including [[Jonathan Kozol]] and [[Parker Palmer]] are sometimes included in this category. Other critical pedagogues known more for their [[Anti-schooling activism|Anti-schooling,]] [[unschooling]], or [[deschooling]] perspectives include [[Ivan Illich]], [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Ira Shor]], [[John Taylor Gatto]], and [[Matt Hern]].

Critical pedagogy has several other strands and foundations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kincheloe, Joe (2008) Critical Pedagogy Primer. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern]], [[anti-racist]], [[feminist]], [[postcolonial]], and [[queer]] theories all play a role in further expanding and enriching Freire's original ideas about a critical pedagogy, shifting its main focus on social class to include issues pertaining to [[religion]], [[military rank|military identification]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], and age. Much of the work also draws on [[anarchism]], [[György Lukács]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[postcolonialism]], and the discourse theories of [[Edward Said]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] ([[rhizomatic learning]]) and [[Michel Foucault]]. ''[[Radical Teacher]]'' is a magazine dedicated to critical pedagogy and issues of interest to critical educators. Many contemporary critical pedagogues have embraced [[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodern]], [[non-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] perspectives of the individual, of language, and of power, "while at the same time retaining the [[Paulo Freire|Freirean]] emphasis on critique, disrupting oppressive regimes of power/knowledge, and social change".&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt;

==Developments==
Like [[critical theory]] itself, the field of critical pedagogy continues to evolve.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Contemporary critical educators, such as [[bell hooks]] and [[Peter McLaren]], discuss in their criticisms the influence of many varied concerns, institutions, and social structures, "including globalization, the mass media, and race/spiritual relations", while citing reasons for resisting the possibilities to change.&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt; McLaren has developed a social movement based version of critical pedagogy that he calls revolutionary critical pedagogy, emphasizing critical pedagogy as a social movement for the creation of a democratic socialist alternative to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/mclaren/ | title=Peter McLaren, PhD &amp;#124; Professor, Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies; Co-Director, the Paulo Freire Democratic Project and International Ambassador for Global Ethics and Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/peter-mclaren-interview.html#.WDTetvkrLD4|title=Revolutionary Critical Pedagogy and the Struggle against Capital Today: An Interview with Peter McLaren I The Hampton Institute|website=www.hamptoninstitution.org|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and Shirley R. Steinberg have created the Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy at [[McGill University|McGill]] University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freireproject.org/|title=Freire Project - Critical Cultural, Community, and Media Activism|author=|date=|website=www.freireproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Kincheloe and Steinberg's contributions to critical pedagogy, the project attempts to move the field to the next phase of its evolution. In this second phase, critical pedagogy seeks to become a worldwide, decolonizing movement dedicated to listening to and learning from diverse [[discourse]]s of people from around the planet. Kincheloe and Steinberg also embrace Indigenous knowledges in education as a way to expand critical pedagogy and to question educational hegemony. Joe L. Kincheloe, in expanding on the Freire's notion that a pursuit of social change alone could promote anti-intellectualism, promotes a more balanced approach to education than postmodernists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Quote|text=We cannot simply attempt to cultivate the intellect without changing the unjust social context in which such minds operate. Critical educators cannot just work to change the social order without helping to educate a knowledgeable and skillful group of students. Creating a just, progressive, creative, and democratic society demands both dimensions of this pedagogical progress.|sign=|source=}}

One of the major texts taking up the intersection between critical pedagogy and Indigenous knowledge(s) is Sandy Grande's, ''Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2004). In agreement with this perspective, Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, challenges the anthropocentrism of critical pedagogy and writes that to achieve its transformative goals there are other differences between Western and Indigenous worldview that must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe, J. &amp; Steinberg, S. (2008) Indigenous Knowledges in Education: Complexities, Dangers, and Profound Benefits in Ed Denzin, N. Handbook of Critical and Indigenous Methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Four Arrows (2011) Differing Worldviews: Two Scholars Argue Cooperatively about Justice Education (Sense)&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching the intersection of Indigenous perspectives and pedagogy from another perspective, [[critical pedagogy of place]] examines the impacts of place.

=== In the classroom ===
[[Ira Shor]], a professor at the [[City University of New York]], provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods in the context of the everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.

Of course, achieving such a goal is not automatic nor easy, as he suggests that the role of the teacher is critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group and the role of the teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging. This encourages the growth of each student's intellectual character rather than a mere "mimicry of the professorial style."&lt;ref&gt;Shor, I. (1980). Critical Teaching and Everyday Life. Boston, Massachusetts: South End Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers, however, do not simply abdicate their authority in a [[Student-centred learning|student-centred]] classroom. In the later years of his life, Freire grew increasingly concerned with what he felt was a major misinterpretation of his work and insisted that teachers cannot deny their position of authority.

{{Quote|text=Critical teachers, therefore, must admit that they are in a position of authority and then demonstrate that authority in their actions in supports of students... [A]s teachers relinquish the authority of truth providers, they assume the mature authority of facilitators of student inquiry and problem-solving. In relation to such teacher authority, students gain their freedom--they gain the ability to become self-directed human beings capable of producing their own knowledge.|sign=[[Joe L. Kincheloe]]|source=[[Critical Pedagogy Primer]] p. 17}}

And due to the student-centeredness that critical pedagogy insists upon, there are inherent conflicts associated with the "large collections of top-down content standards in their disciplines".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critical pedagogy advocates insist that teachers themselves are vital to the discussion about [[Standards-based education reform in the United States]] because a pedagogy that requires a student to learn or a teacher to teach externally imposed information exemplifies the [[banking model of education]] outlined by Freire where the structures of knowledge are left unexamined. To the critical pedagogue, the teaching act must incorporate social critique alongside the cultivation of intellect.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] argues that this is in direct opposition to the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] concept of [[positivism]], where "social actions should proceed with law-like predictability".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this philosophy, a teacher and their students would be served by [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|Standards-based education]] where there is "only be one correct way to teach" as "[e]veryone is assumed to be the same regardless of race, class, or gender".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Donald Schön]]'s concept of "indeterminate zones of practice" illustrates how any practice, especially ones with human subjects at their center, are infinitely complex and highly contested, which amplify the critical pedagogue's unwillingness to apply universal practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schon|first=Donald, A.|year=1995|title=The new scholarship requires a new epistemology|url=|journal=Change|volume=27|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]], who is greatly influenced by Freire, points out the importance of engaged pedagogy and the responsibility that teachers, as well as students, must have in the classroom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/hooks.htm|title=bell hooks on education|author=|date=28 January 2013|website=infed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Teachers must be aware of themselves as practitioners and as human beings if they wish to teach students in a non-threatening, anti-discriminatory way. Self-actualisation should be the goal of the teacher as well as the students.}}

== Resistance from students ==
Students sometimes resist critical pedagogy. Student resistance to critical pedagogy can be attributed to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seas|first=Kristen|year=2006|title=Enthymematic Rhetoric and Student Resistance to Critical Pedagogies|jstor=20176747|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=(25) 4|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or [[Ideology|ideologies]], introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resistance is often, at the least, understandably protective: As anyone who can remember her or his own first uneasy encounters with particularly challenging new theories or theorists can attest, resistance serves to shield us from uncomfortable shifts or all-out upheavals in perception and understanding-shifts in perception which, if honored, force us to inhabit the world in fundamentally new and different ways.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopelson|first=Karen|year=2003|title=Rhetoric on the edge of cunning: Or, the performance of neutrality (re) considered as a composition pedagogy for student resistance|jstor=3594203|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=|pages=119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kristen Seas further explains: "Students [often] reject the teacher's message because they see it as coercive, they do not agree with it, or they feel excluded by it."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Karen Kopelson concludes "that many if not most students come to the university in order to gain access to and eventual enfranchisement in 'the establishment,' not to critique and reject its privileges."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  To overcome student resistance to critical pedagogy, teachers must enact strategic measures to help their students negotiate controversial topics.

== Critical pedagogy of teaching ==
The rapidly changing demographics of the classroom in the [[United States]] has resulted in an unprecedented amount of [[linguistic]] and [[cultural]] diversity. In order to respond to these changes, advocates of critical pedagogy call into question the focus on practical skills of teacher credential programs. "[T]his practical focus far too often occurs without examining teachers' own assumptions, values, and beliefs and how this ideological posture informs, often unconsciously, their perceptions and actions when working with linguistic-minority and other politically, socially, and economically subordinated students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartolomé|first=Lilia|year=2004|title=Critical Pedagogy and Teacher Education: Radicalizing Prospective Teachers|url=http://www.teqjournal.org/backvols/2004/31_1/bartoleme.pmd.pdf|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|volume=Winter|pages=97–122|via=teqjournal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As teaching is considered an inherently political act to the critical pedagogue, a more critical element of teacher education becomes addressing implicit biases (also known as [[implicit cognition]] or implicit stereotypes) that can subconsciously affect a teacher's perception of a student's ability to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/|title=Understanding Implicit Bias|website=kirwaninstitute.osu.edu|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of critical pedagogy insist that teachers, then, must become learners alongside their students, as well as students ''of'' their students. They must become experts beyond their field of [[knowledge]], and immerse themselves in the [[culture]], customs, and lived experiences of the students they aim to teach.

== History ==
During South African [[apartheid]], legal [[racialization]] implemented by the regime drove members of the radical [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] Teachers' League of South Africa to employ critical pedagogy with a focus on nonracialism in Cape Town schools and prisons. Teachers collaborated loosely to subvert the racist curriculum and encourage critical examination of religious, military, political, and social circumstances in terms of spirit-friendly, humanist, and democratic ideologies. The efforts of such teachers are credited with having bolstered student resistance and activism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Criticism ==
Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterizes the goal of Giroux's form of critical pedagogy "to create political radicals", thus highlighting the antagonistic moral and political grounds of the ideals of citizenship and "public wisdom."&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. (1990) ''The Storm Over the University'', ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; These varying moral perspectives of what is "right" are to be found in what [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1938). Experience and Education.&lt;/ref&gt; has referred to as the tensions between traditional and [[progressive education]]. Searle argues that critical pedagogy's objections to the [[Western canon]] are misplaced and/or disingenuous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude, the "canon" served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maxine Hairston takes a hard line against critical pedagogy in the first year college composition classroom and argues, "everywhere I turn I find composition faculty, both leaders in the profession and new voices, asserting that they have not only the right, but the duty, to put ideology and radical politics at the center of their teaching."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, ideology, and teaching writing.|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43 |issue=2|pages=179–193|doi=10.2307/357563|jstor=357563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston further confers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When classes focus on complex issues such as racial discrimination, economic injustices, and inequities of class and gender, they should be taught by qualified faculty who have the depth of information and historical competence that such critical social issues warrant. Our society's deep and tangled cultural conflicts can neither be explained nor resolved by simplistic ideological formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sharon O'Dair (2003) says that today compositionists "focus [...] almost exclusively on ideological matters",&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Dair|first=Sharon|year=2003|title=Class work: Site of egalitarian activism or site of embourgeoisement?|url=|journal=College English|volume=|pages=593–606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further argues that this focus is at the expense of proficiency of student writing skills in the composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; To this end, O'Dair explains that "recently advocated working-class pedagogies privilege activism over" language instruction."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Jeff Smith argues that students want to gain, rather than to critique, positions of privilege, as encouraged by critical pedagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Smith|year=1997|title=Students' Goals, Gatekeeping, and Some Questions of Ethics|url=|journal=College English|volume=59|pages=299–320|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a wide variety of views in opposition to critical pedagogy in the first year composition classroom, these are but a few.

== Classification ==
Developmental coordination disorder is classified in the fifth revision of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-5]]) as a [[motor disorder]], in the category of [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM315.4&gt;{{Cite book | author= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=74–7 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris SR, Mickelson EC, Zwicker JG | title = Diagnosis and management of developmental coordination disorder | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 187 | issue = 9 | pages = 659–65 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26009588 | pmc = 4467929 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.140994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Various areas of development can be affected by developmental coordination disorder and these will persist into adulthood,&lt;ref name="Kirby 2010" /&gt; as DCD has no cure. Often various coping strategies are developed, and these can be enhanced through occupational therapy, psychomotor therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, or psychological training.

In addition to the physical impairments, developmental coordination disorder is associated with problems with memory, especially [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Alloway Rajendran 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alloway TP, Rajendran G, Archibald LM | title = Working memory in children with developmental disorders | journal = Journal of Learning Disabilities | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–82 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19380495 | doi = 10.1177/0022219409335214 | hdl = 1893/863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically results in difficulty remembering instructions, difficulty organizing one's time and remembering deadlines, increased propensity to lose things or problems carrying out tasks which require remembering several steps in sequence (such as cooking). Whilst most of the general population experience these problems to some extent, they have a much more significant impact on the lives of dyspraxic people.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Biggs | first1 = Victoria | name-list-format = vanc | title = Caged in chaos : a dyspraxic guide to breaking free | chapter = 3 A Survival Guide to School | publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers | year = 2005 | location = London ; Philadelphia  |oclc=57316751  | isbn = 978-1-84310-347-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many dyspraxics have excellent [[Long-term memory|long-term memories]], despite poor [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)" /&gt; Many dyspraxics benefit from working in a structured environment, as repeating the same routine minimises difficulty with time-management and allows them to commit procedures to long-term memory.

People with developmental coordination disorder sometimes have difficulty moderating the amount of sensory information that their body is constantly sending them, so as a result dyspraxics are prone to [[sensory overload]] and [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (3)" /&gt;

Moderate to extreme difficulty doing physical tasks is experienced by some dyspraxics, and fatigue is common because so much energy is expended trying to execute physical movements correctly. Some dyspraxics suffer from [[hypotonia]], low muscle tone, which like DCD can detrimentally affect balance.&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt;

=== Gross motor control ===
Whole body movement and [[motor coordination]] issues mean that major developmental targets including walking, running, climbing and jumping can be affected. The difficulties vary from person to person and can include the following:
* Poor timing&lt;ref name="Missiuna 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missiuna C, Gaines R, Soucie H, McLean J | title = Parental questions about developmental coordination disorder: A synopsis of current evidence | journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 507–12 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 19030319 | pmc = 2528644 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poor balance&lt;ref name="Missiuna 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geuze 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geuze RH | title = Postural control in children with developmental coordination disorder | journal = Neural Plasticity | volume = 12 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 183–96; discussion 263–72 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16097486 | pmc = 2565450 | doi = 10.1155/NP.2005.183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes even falling over in mid-step).  Tripping over one's own feet is also common.
* Difficulty combining movements into a controlled sequence.
* Difficulty remembering the next movement in a sequence.
* Problems with spatial awareness,&lt;ref name="Geuze 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson PH, McKenzie BE | title = Information processing deficits associated with developmental coordination disorder: a meta-analysis of research findings | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–40 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9758192 | doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[proprioception]].
* Trouble picking up and holding onto simple objects such as pencils, owing to poor muscle tone or proprioception.
* Clumsiness to the point of knocking things over, causing minor injuries to oneself and bumping into people accidentally.
* Difficulty in [[Relative direction#Left-right confusion|determining left from right]].
* Cross-laterality, [[ambidexterity]], and a shift in the preferred hand are also common in people with developmental coordination disorder.
* Problems with chewing foods.

=== Fine motor control ===
Fine-motor problems can cause difficulty with a wide variety of other tasks such as using a knife and fork, fastening buttons and shoelaces, cooking, brushing teeth,  styling hair,  shaving,&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polatajko 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polatajko HJ, Cantin N | title = Developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia): an overview of the state of the art | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Neurology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16780296 | doi = 10.1016/j.spen.2005.12.007 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071909105000859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applying cosmetics, opening jars and packets, locking and unlocking doors, and doing housework.

Difficulties with fine motor co-ordination lead to problems with handwriting,&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt; which may be due to either ideational or ideo-motor difficulties.&lt;ref name="Missiuna 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenblum 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenblum S | title = Handwriting measures as reflectors of executive functions among adults with Developmental Coordination Disorders (DCD) | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 357 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23805113 | pmc = 3693067 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline |date=October 2016}}
Problems associated with this area may include:
* Learning basic movement patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacquaniti F | title = Central representations of human limb movement as revealed by studies of drawing and handwriting | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 287–91 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2475946 | doi = 10.1016/0166-2236(89)90008-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developing a desired writing speed.&lt;ref name="Polatajko 2005" /&gt;
* Establishing the correct pencil grip.&lt;ref name="Polatajko 2005" /&gt;
* The acquisition of [[grapheme]]s – e.g. the letters of the [[Latin alphabet]], as well as numbers.&lt;!-- this paragraph may not reliable as the reference is not a published journal , it is a blog and maybe the primary research --&gt;

=== Developmental verbal dyspraxia ===
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)]] is a type of ideational dyspraxia, causing [[speech and language impairment]]s. This is the favoured term in the UK; however, it is also sometimes referred to as articulatory dyspraxia, and in the United States the usual term is childhood apraxia of speech (CAS).&lt;ref name="Vargha-Khadem 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargha-Khadem F, Gadian DG, Copp A, Mishkin M | title = FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language | journal = Nature Reviews.

Key problems include:
* Difficulties controlling the [[speech organ]]s.
* Difficulties making speech sounds.
* Difficulty sequencing sounds
** Within a word, and 
** Forming words into sentences.
* Difficulty controlling breathing, suppressing salivation and [[phonation]] when talking or singing with lyrics.
* Slow [[language development]].&lt;!-- this paragraph may not reliable as the reference is not a published journal , it is a blog and maybe the primary research --&gt;

== Associated disorders and secondary consequences ==
People who have developmental coordination disorder may also have one or more of these co-morbid conditions:

However, they are unlikely to have all of these conditions. The pattern of difficulty varies widely from person to person; an area of major weakness for one dyspraxic can be an area of strength or gift for another. For example, while some dyspraxics have difficulty with reading and spelling due to dyslexia, or with numeracy due to dyscalculia, others may have brilliant reading and spelling or mathematical abilities. Some estimates show that up to 50% of dyspraxics have ADHD.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Barkley | first = Russell A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a handbook for diagnosis and treatment |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-89862-443-4 |oclc=21335369  |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- v --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cravedi E, Deniau E, Giannitelli M, Xavier J, Hartmann A, Cohen D | title = Tourette syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders: a comprehensive review | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health | volume = 11 | pages = 59 | date = 2017-12-04 | pmid = 29225671 | pmc = 5715991 | doi = 10.1186/s13034-017-0196-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory processing disorder ===
{{Main|Sensory processing disorder}}
'''Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)''' concerns having oversensitivity or undersensitivity to physical stimuli, such as touch, light, sound, and smell.&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller LJ, Anzalone ME, Lane SJ, Cermak SA, Osten ET | title = Concept evolution in sensory integration: a proposed nosology for diagnosis | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–40 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17436834 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.61.2.135 | url = http://www.spdfoundation.net/pdf/Miller_Anzalone.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024223226/http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Miller_Anzalone.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may manifest itself as an inability to tolerate certain textures such as [[sandpaper]] or certain fabrics such as wool, oral intolerance of excessively textured food (commonly known as picky eating), being touched by another individual (in the case of touch oversensitivity) or it may require the consistent use of sunglasses outdoors since sunlight may be intense enough to cause discomfort to a dyspraxic (in the case of light oversensitivity). An aversion to loud music and naturally loud environments (such as clubs and bars) is typical behavior of a dyspraxic individual who suffers from [[Hyperacusis|auditory oversensitivity]], while only being comfortable in unusually warm or cold environments is typical of a dyspraxic with temperature oversensitivity. Undersensitivity to stimuli may also cause problems. Dyspraxics who are undersensitive to pain may injure themselves without realising it.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (2)" /&gt; Some dyspraxics may be oversensitive to some stimuli and undersensitive to others.&lt;ref name="Biggs 2005 (2)" /&gt;

=== Specific language impairment ===
{{Main|Specific language impairment}}
'''Specific Language Impairment (SLI)''' research has found that students with developmental coordination disorder and normal language skills still experience learning difficulties despite relative strengths in language. This means that for students with developmental coordination disorder their working memory abilities determine their learning difficulties. Any strength in language that they have is not able to sufficiently support their learning.&lt;ref name="Alloway 2008" /&gt;

Students with developmental coordination disorder struggle most in visual-spatial memory. When compared to their peers who don’t have motor difficulties, students with developmental coordination disorder are seven times more likely than typically developing students to achieve very poor scores in visual-spatial memory.&lt;ref name="Alloway 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alloway TP | title = Working memory, reading, and mathematical skills in children with developmental coordination disorder | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–36 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17010988 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2006.07.002 | hdl = 1893/800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this working memory impairment, students with developmental coordination disorder have learning deficits as well.&lt;ref name="Alloway Temple 2007"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors  = Alloway TP, Temple K | title=A Comparison of Working Memory Profiles and Learning in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder and Moderate Learning Difficulties|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=21| issue=4| pages=473–487| year=2007 |doi=10.1002/acp.1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and social consequences ===
'''Psychological domain:''' Children with DCD struggle with lower self-efficacy and lower self-perceived competence in peer and social relations. They demonstrate greater aggressiveness and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name="Zwicker 562–580"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zwicker JG, Harris SR, Klassen AF | title = Quality of life domains affected in children with developmental coordination disorder: a systematic review | journal = Child | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–80 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 22515477 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2012.01379.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social domain:'''  Children are more vulnerable to social rejection and bullying, along with higher levels of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Zwicker 562–580" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Assessments for developmental coordination disorder typically require a developmental history,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; detailing ages at which significant [[developmental milestones]], such as [[crawling (human)|crawling]] and [[walking]],&lt;ref name="Zwicker 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby 2007" /&gt; occurred. Motor skills screening includes activities designed to indicate developmental coordination disorder, including balancing, physical sequencing, touch sensitivity, and variations on walking activities.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has four primary inclusive diagnostic criteria{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirby A, Sugden DA | title = Children with developmental coordination disorders | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 182–6 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17404341 | pmc = 1847727 | doi = 10.1177/014107680710011414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for determining if a [[child]] has developmental coordination disorder.

The criteria are as follows:
# Motor Coordination will be greatly reduced, although the intelligence of the child is normal for the age.
# The difficulties the child experiences with motor coordination or planning interfere with the child's daily life.
# The difficulties with coordination are not due to any other medical condition
# If the child does also experience comorbidities such as mental retardation; motor coordination is still disproportionally affected.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007"/&gt;

Currently there is no single gold standard assessment test.&lt;ref name="Cools-2009" /&gt;

A baseline motor assessment establishes the starting point for developmental intervention programs. Comparing children to normal rates of development may help to establish areas of significant difficulty.

However, research in the ''[[British Journal of Special Education]]'' has shown that knowledge is severely limited in many who should be trained to recognise and respond to various difficulties, including developmental coordination disorder, [[dyslexia]] and [[Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception|deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP)]].&lt;ref name="Kirby 2007" /&gt; The earlier that difficulties are noted and timely assessments occur, the quicker intervention can begin.  A teacher or [[General practitioner|GP]] could miss a diagnosis if they are only applying a cursory knowledge.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Teachers will not be able to recognise or accommodate the child with learning difficulties in class if their knowledge is limited. Similarly GPs will find it difficult to detect and appropriately refer children with learning difficulties."&lt;ref name="Kirby Davies 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirby| first1=Amanda|last2=Davies|first2=Rhys|last3=Bryant| first3=Amy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Do teachers know more about specific learning difficulties than general practitioners?|journal=British Journal of Special Education| volume=32|issue=3| year=2005|pages=122–126|issn=0952-3383|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2005.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline |date=October 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Management==
There is no cure for the condition. Instead, it is managed through therapy. [[Occupational therapy]] or [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] can help those living with the condition.

Some people with the condition find it helpful to find alternative ways of carrying out tasks or organizing themselves, such as typing on a laptop instead of writing by hand, or using diaries and calendars to keep organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia-in-adults/#treatment-for-dyspraxia | title=Dyspraxia (developmental co-ordination disorder) in adults| date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Developmental coordination disorder is a lifelong [[neurological]] condition that is more common in [[males]] than in [[females]], with a ratio of approximately four males to every female. The exact proportion of people with the disorder is unknown since the disorder can be difficult to detect due to a lack of specific laboratory tests, thus making diagnosis of the condition one of elimination of all other possible causes/diseases. Approximately 5–6% of [[children]] are affected by this condition.&lt;ref name="Barnhart 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blank 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwicker 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaines R, Missiuna C, Egan M, McLean J | title = Educational outreach and collaborative care enhances physician's perceived knowledge about Developmental Coordination Disorder | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | pages = 21 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18218082 | pmc = 2254381 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-21 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/8/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline |date=October 2016}}&lt;!---What about adults??? Amanda Kirby and others clearly stated in the references adults are affected too.---&gt;

== History ==
Collier first described developmental coordination disorder as 'congenital maladroitness'. [[Anna Jean Ayres|A. Jean Ayres]] referred to developmental coordination disorder as a disorder of sensory integration in 1972,&lt;ref name="Ayres 1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayres AJ | title = Types of sensory integrative dysfunction among disabled learners | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–8 | year = 1972 | pmid = 5008164 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willoughby 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willoughby C, Polatajko HJ | title = Motor problems in children with developmental coordination disorder: review of the literature | journal = The American Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 787–94 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8526224 | doi = 10.5014/ajot.49.8.787 | url = http://ajot.aotapress.net/content/49/8/787.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1975 Sasson Gubbay, MD, called it the 'clumsy child syndrome'.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gubbay 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gubbay SS | title = The management of developmental apraxia | journal = Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–6 | date = October 1978 | pmid = 729912 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1978.tb15283.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental coordination disorder has also been called minimal brain dysfunction although the two latter names are no longer in use.

Other names include: Developmental Apraxia,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; [[Deficits in attention, motor control and perception|Disorder of Attention and Motor Perception (DAMP)]]&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt; Dyspraxia,&lt;ref name="Henderson 2003" /&gt;  Developmental Dyspraxia,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt; Motor Learning Difficulties,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt; Perceptuo-motor dysfunction,&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willoughby 1995" /&gt; Sensorimotor dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Gibbs 2007" /&gt;

On the biggest ever global school rankings, conducted by the OECD's economic think tank and compiled from an amalgamation of international assessments, including the OECD's Pisa tests, the TIMSS tests run by US-based academics and TERCE tests in Latin America, Lebanon ranked 58th globally in maths and sciences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32608772?ocid=socialflow_facebook|title=Asia tops biggest global school rankings|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/global-school-rankings-interactive-map-shows-standards-of-education-across-the-world-10247405.html|title=Global school rankings: Interactive map shows standards of education across the world|author=Nicole Chang|date=13 May 2015|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the international student achievement tests in math and sciences (TIMSS) in 2007 and 2011 for grade 8, Lebanese students scored well below the international average of 500. In math, Lebanon scored 449 in both 2007 and 2011.&lt;ref name="globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com"/&gt;

Lebanon's adult literacy rate is 93.9% in 2014(http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LBN), according to the UN Human Development Index, ranking it 65th globally.

The percentage of the population as a whole with at least some secondary education (aged 25 and above) is 54.2%. For the percentage of the female population with at least some secondary education, the figure drops to 38.8%.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LBN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education system==
Education in Lebanon is divided into 5 cycles split in 3 phases: Pre-school education, basic education, and secondary education, the latter ending on a [[Baccalaureat]] or a "professional certificate", which both give access to tertiary education.&lt;ref name="unevoc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=LBN#par0_2 | title=Vocational Education in Lebanon | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is compulsory age 6 to age 14, being the basic education cycle.&lt;ref name="IBE2"/&gt; Pre-school education (cycle 1) starts at age 3 or 4. Basic education is then composed of two levels: elementary level and intermediate level. Elementary level is grade 1 to 3 (cycle 2) and grades 4 to 6 (cycle 3). Intermediate level is grades 7 to 9 (cycle 4). Secondary Education is grades 10 to 12 (cycle 5). Secondary Education is usually completed at age 18.&lt;ref name="unevoc"/&gt;

It is worth noting that an estimated two-thirds of Lebanese students attend private schools. In April 2015, the Minister of Education, Elias Bou Saab, acknowledged the myriad challenges and gaps that exist in the Lebanese school system, in particular in the public schools. While Lebanese law stipulates that the national curriculum should be updated every four years, it has not been updated since 2000. In addition, because of national disagreement over Lebanon's modern history, the history textbooks in particular only cover history until 1943. The national exams (Grade 9 Brevet and Grade 12 Baccalaureate) were not marked in 2014.

===Pre-school education===
According to the [[World Bank]] database, gross enrollment rate of pre-school education is 62.5 percent for male, 68.3 percent for female, and 64.4 percent for total in 2006.&lt;ref name="TheWorld"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://go.worldbank.org/ITABCOGIV1
|title= The World Bank Edstats database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-school education aims to initiate children into the school environment. The goal of pre-school education is 1) to create a favorable climate for the children to communicate with others, 2) to develop their physical capacities, limb control and coordination of their movements, and 3) to educate their senses. Pre-school education also takes into account physiological moral and intellectual development of children.&lt;ref name="Institutefor"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uis.unesco.org
|title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics database}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the World Bank database, private enrollment share for pre-school education is 80.3 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="TheWorld" /&gt;

===Basic education===
'''Elementary Level'''

According to the Worlds database, gross enrollment rate of elementary level of basic education is for 96.8 percent for male, 93.9 percent for female, and 95.4 percent for total in 2007. Private enrollment share in elementary level is 67.6 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name="TheWorld" /&gt;

'''Intermediate level'''

Primary completion rate of Lebanon (US$6,000 GNI per capita in 2007) is lower than that of Tunisia, Jordan, Iran, Algeria, West Bank and Egypt (all of which have lower GNI per capita). Primary completion rates have not improved during the period 1995/96 to 2003/04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/11/000003596_20080716124845/Rendered/PDF/Lebanon0ESPISP0II0PID.pdf
|title=The World Bank (2008) Project Information Document, Concept Stage, Lebanon Second Emergency Social Protection Implementation Support Project, Washington D.C.: The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Primary completion rate is 79.8 percent for male, 83.3 percent for female, and 81.5 percent for total.&lt;ref name="TheWorld" /&gt; According to UIS database, technical and vocational enrollment as percent of total enrollment in intermediate level is 5.1 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="Institutefor" /&gt; Private enrollment share of general education in intermediate level is 60.2 percent and that of technical and vocational education is 56.8 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="Institutefor" /&gt;

===Secondary education===

Secondary education is three years education,  the first year is common for all students, and the second year is either scientific or literature whereas the third year composes of ([[humanities]], [[economics]], [[life sciences]], [[general sciences]]) and [[technical education]] (about 55 different fields of study). Most schools, however have deviated from this system. They usually do not offer Humanities education, citing socio-economics as a better and more efficient alternative [[School principal]]s decide students’ path based on students’ aptitude as shown by the first secondary and second secondary years. When students complete three years education, they take official Lebanese Baccalaureate exams in their respective tracks (four in all). Students who finish examinations successfully obtain the Lebanese Baccalaureate Certificate of Secondary Education (Shahaadat Al-Bakaalouriya al Lubnaaniya l’il-ta ‘liim al-Thaanawi) or the Technical Baccalaureate (Al-Bakaalouriya al-Finniya)&lt;ref name="InternationalAssociation"&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/index.html
|title=International Association of University, World Higher Education Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Minister of Education passed all students who took the exam, regardless of their score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/21064|title=Lebanon: Education minister passes all students in bid to undermine the UCC|work=Al Akhbar English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations Human Development Index, the gross enrollment rate for secondary school is 74%.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"/&gt;

[[Palestinian refugees]] in Lebanon have limited access to public secondary education. Most of them are not able to afford the high cost of private secondary education.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[UNRWA]] operates three secondary schools in Beirut, Saida and Tyre. School operated by UNRWA partially offset the absence of available educational opportunities at the secondary school level. (UNRWA website)
According to the World Bank database, gross enrollment rate of secondary education is 69.8 percent for male, 80.2 percent for female, and 74.9 percent for total.&lt;ref name="TheWorld" /&gt; According to UIS database, technical and vocational enrollment as percent of total enrollment in secondary level is 27.8 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="Institutefor" /&gt; Private enrollment share of general education in intermediate level is 49.8 percent and that of technical and vocational education is 56.9 percent in 2008.&lt;ref name="Institutefor" /&gt;

Lebanon participated in [[TIMSS]] in 2003 and 2007. Score of mathematics at 8th grade is 433 in 2003 and 449 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://timss.bc.edu/TIMSS2007/PDF/TIMSS2007_InternationalMathematicsReport.pdf

At the end of middle school, each student has to enter the official exams.

==Tertiary education==
Tertiary education in Lebanon is composed of [[Institute of technology|Technical]] and Vocational Institutes, [[University college]]s, [[University Institute]]s and [[Universities]]. The [[Lebanese University]] is the only public institution. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education administrates the private and public sectors and Technical and Vocational Institutes are under the Directorate General of Technical and Vocational Education Directorate General of Higher Education has responsibility for University Colleges, University Institutes and Universities).&lt;ref name="InternationalAssociation" /&gt;

According to the World Bank database, gross enrollment rate of tertiary education (the percentage of students who go on to tertiary education within five years of completing secondary education) was 48% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR|title=Gross enrolment ratio, tertiary, both sexes (%)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With university graduates making up 30% of people seeking a job,&lt;ref&gt;Youth Economic Forum, Youth Employment: Towards an Improved Regulation of the Labor Market, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that the Higher Education system needs to play a key role in resolving the problem of youth unemployment in Lebanon. The key issue related to this sector is the mismatch between the highly skilled graduates that universities supply and the skills and professionals the labor market demands; these supply-demand failings in the labor market are increasingly preventing   young people from finding a job in their country that fits their qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Di Bartolomeo, Anna, Tamirace Fakhoury, and Delphine Perrin. CARIM – Migration Profile. European University Institute – Robert Schuman Centre For Advanced Studies, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to address these issues, universities can implement policies to:
1.	Reform the curricula to better prepare graduates for their professional life
2.	Improve career guidance structures and activities
3.	Invest in relevant research, statistics and data gathering.

Lebanon has 41 nationally accredited universities, several of which are internationally recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

At the English universities, students who have graduated from an American-style high school program enter at the freshman level to earn their baccalaureate equivalence from the Lebanese Ministry of Higher Education. This qualifies them to continue studying at the higher levels. Such students are required to have already taken the SAT I and the SAT II (Subjects Test) upon applying to college, in lieu of the official exams. On the other hand, students who have graduated from a school that follows the Lebanese educational system are directly admitted to the sophomore year. These students are still required to take the SAT I, but not the SAT II.

The highest-ranked universities in Lebanon include the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB), the [[Lebanese American University]] (LAU), the [[Université Saint-Joseph]] (USJ), the [[Lebanese University]] (LU), the [[University of Balamand]] (UOB), the [[Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik]] (USEK), [[Beirut Arab University]] (BAU), [[Haigazian University]] (HU), and the [[Notre Dame University - Louaize]] (NDU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Asia/Lebanon%20|title=Lebanon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="topuniversities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/arab-region-university-rankings/2015#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|title=QS University Rankings: Arab Region 2015|work=Top Universities}}&lt;/ref&gt; QS Top Universities ranks AUB second in the Arab region (the only Lebanese university to rank among the region's top 10), and 268 globally.&lt;ref name="topuniversities.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2015#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=america|title=QS World University Rankings® 2015/16|work=Top Universities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The THE (Times Higher Education) World University Rankings 2015-2016 place the American University of Beirut between 501 and 600 in its rankings, while the Center for World University Rankings places AUB at 682 in its global rankings; AUB is the only Lebanese university to make either of these lists.

Not all private higher educational institutions in Lebanon consider SAT I or SAT II for undergraduate admissions. The majority require a local entrance test prepared by these individual higher educational institutions. In most times, the entrance test is a placement test.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The main requirement for undergraduate admissions for Lebanese students is the secondary-school leaving certificate called the Baccalaureate II or more recently the International Baccalaureate. However, students with a foreign nationality are admitted to private higher education institutions that pattern after the American system of higher education as Freshman students in case they do not have an equivalence to the Baccalaureate II.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In case they obtain an equivalence from the Ministry of Education and higher Education, they are admitted as sophomore students. As for the Lebanese University, which is the only public higher educational institution in Lebanon, students are admitted to undergraduate programs based on their Baccalaureate II. A number of Faculties at the Lebanese University, such as the Faculty of Sciences require further testing for selectivity based on entrance tests (concurs) prepared and administered by this faculty.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Education management==
Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) regulates all education institutes in the public sector through a regional education system. The education system in Lebanon is centralized, and this regulation is not direct. The education system is managed through regional education bureaus. [[Public school (government funded)|Public schools]] are monitored by the regional education bureaus in the governorates. The regional education bureau serves as liaisons between the public school and the directorates of education at the ministry's headquarters. [[Private schools]] have their own organization, but private schools are still subject to the authority of the MOEHE.&lt;ref name="SkafAntoine"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://timss.bc.edu/TIMSS2007/PDF/T07_Enc_V1.pdf
|title= Skaf, Antoine and Zeina Habib (2008) "Lebanon" In Ina V.S. Mullis, Michael O. Martin, Joh F. Olson, Dbra R. Berger, Dana Milne, and Gabrielle M. Stanco ed., TIMSS 2007 Encyclopedia: A Guide to Mathematics and Science Education Around the World, Volume 2, Boston: TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD) is an autonomous staff organization under the trusteeship of the MOEHE. CERD's tasks are 1) to draft curricula of academic and vocational education for the pre-university education stage, 2) to revise and modify the curricula according to the necessity, 3) to prepare all means and ways for applying these curricula, 4) to do  educational research, 5) to secure training for pre-university teachers, 6) to prepare the curricula in all subject areas, 7) to provide teacher training, 8) to write textbooks, and 9) to conduct evaluations, etc.&lt;ref name="SkafAntoine" /&gt;

==Education finance==
According to the United Nations Human Development Index 2014, public education expenditure as percentage of [[GDP]] is 1.65 in 2014.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"/&gt; Public schools are financed by the Ministry of Education and private schools are financed by students' fees. The processes involved curricula draft and modification, and teacher training are mainly financed by nongovernment funds such as private companies or international bodies which include the World Bank and the [[UNDP]].&lt;ref name="SkafAntoine" /&gt;

==Curriculum==
The Lebanese curriculum is used at all public and private schools in Lebanon. Schools have to apply both the Lebanese and foreign schemes at the same time when they will implement a foreign curriculum (French, English, or international) in a school.&lt;ref name="SkafAntoine" /&gt;

==Syrian Refugees in Lebanese Schools==
The Syrian crisis has placed a large burden on Lebanese public schools. There are nearly 400,000 school-aged refugee children in Lebanon, which is roughly 25% more than the number of Lebanese students in Lebanese public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bold-mag.com/site/article.php?issueId=117&amp;catId=42&amp;articleId=725#.VioK2_mqqko|title=Educating Syrian Refugee Children in Lebanon: the challenge &amp; the opportunity - BOLD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only an estimated 30% of the Syrian refugee school-aged children are receiving an education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/lebanon-education-crisis-syria-refugees-children-schools.html#|title=Lebanon schools struggle to integrate Syrian children - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to barriers to access and other challenges, a significant barrier to integration is language: Syrian schools are taught in Arabic, while Lebanese public schools incorporate both French and English.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Luc/Downloads/6-EducationUNHCRMonthlyUpdate-December2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 104,000 Syrian refugee students were taught in Lebanese schools. In 2015, the Ministry of Education aimed to double the number of Syrian children in  public schools to 200,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Jul-30/308913-lebanon-hopes-to-enroll-more-syrian-students-in-public-schools.ashx|title=Lebanon hopes to enroll more Syrian students in public schools|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emerson College''' is a private college in [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Founded in 1880 by [[Charles Wesley Emerson]] as a "school of oratory," the college offers more than three dozen degree programs in the area of Arts and Communication and is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]]. Located in Boston's [[Washington Street Theatre District]] on the edge of the [[Boston Common]], the school also maintains buildings in [[Los Angeles]] and the town of [[Well, Netherlands|Well]], The Netherlands.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Charles Wesley Emerson]] founded the '''Boston Conservatory of Elocution, Oratory, and Dramatic Art''' in 1880, a year after [[Boston University]] closed its [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri| School of Oratory]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Classes were held at [[Pemberton Square]] in [[Boston]]. Ten students enrolled in the conservatory's first class. The following year, the conservatory changed its name to the '''Monroe Conservatory of Oratory''', in honor of [[Charles Wesley Emerson|Charles Emerson]]'s teacher at [[Boston University]]'s School of Oratory, Professor Lewis B. Monroe. In 1890, the name changed again to '''Emerson College of Oratory'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emerson College of Oratory |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n41/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later shortened to '''Emerson College''' in 1939.

[[File:Emerson College, Boston MA.jpg|thumb|right|244px|&lt;center&gt;Emerson College&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Early expansion and growth===
The college expanded and rented space at [[Wesleyan Building, Boston (Bromfield Street)|36 Bromfield Street]], and moved to [[Odd Fellows Hall, Boston|Odd Fellows Hall]] on Berkeley and Tremont Streets in the [[South End, Boston|South End]] of [[Boston]]. With the new location, the college's first library was established in 1892. [[Henry Lawrence Southwick]], a faculty member and graduate, became a financial partner for the college with Emerson. This financial partnership led to the purchase of the Boston School of Oratory from Moses T. Brown in 1894.

At the turn of the century, faculty members Henry and [[Jessie Eldridge Southwick]] and William H. Kenney purchased the college from Dr. Emerson. Soon after, the college rented a new location in [[Chickering Hall, Boston (1901)|Chickering Hall]].

Dr. Emerson retired in 1903 and William J. Rolfe, a [[Shakespearean]] [[scholar]] and actor, was named the second President of Emerson College of Oratory. His service as president lasted until his retirement in 1908.

As the Student Government Association of the college held its first meeting in 1908, the third president of the college, Henry Lawrence Southwick, was inaugurated. He introduced the study of [[acting]] and [[stagecraft]] into the college curriculum.

During his tenure, the college rented a new building at 30 Huntington Avenue. The college was also granted the right to award Bachelor of Literary Interpretation (B.L.I.) degrees. In addition, Emerson became the first school with a collegiate-level program in [[children's theater]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/EmersonCollege.aspx |title=Emerson College |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offered its first course in [[Journalism]] in 1924.

The college purchased its first piece of real estate with a new women's dormitory building at 373 Commonwealth Ave. and started [[intramural sports]] in 1931 with the organization of [[volleyball]] games.

===Administrative restructuring===
In 1930, full charge and control of the college was transferred to the Board of Trustees by William H. Kenney, Henry Lawrence Southwick, and Jessie Eldridge Southwick.

When Harry Seymour Ross was appointed the fourth president of Emerson College in 1931, the first course in [[radio broadcasting]] was taught by the [[program director]] of [[WEZE|WEEI]], a [[Boston]] AM radio station.

The purchase of buildings at 130 Beacon Street and 128 Beacon Street a year later began the presence of Emerson College in [[Boston]]'s [[Back Bay (Boston)|Back Bay]]. Emerson kept ownership of these buildings until summer 2003.

In the following years, a professional training program in [[Speech and Language Pathology|Speech Pathology]] (1935) and the first undergraduate program in broadcasting and [[broadcast journalism]] (1937) were offered for the first time in the United States.  Also, construction of a theater behind 128–130 Beacon began, and the institution was granted the right to award [[Master of Arts]] degrees.

===Post-war era===
In the post-war era, the [[G.I. Bill of Rights]] and the Broadcasting curriculum contributed to the rebalancing of the student body from a primarily-female population to an equally-balanced population of men and women. Boylston Green, the first president to have no prior association with the college, used his background as a dean of students to enhance extracurricular activities, including the establishment of a student activities fee. These efforts led to the first publication of Emerson's student newspaper, ''[[The Berkeley Beacon]]'', in 1947. It is still in production today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/ |title=The Berkeley Beacon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson also saw major development in its broadcasting program. A one-year Certificate of Broadcasting was offered via evening classes. The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] awarded the college a 10-watt license in 1949, and [[WERS]], the first educational [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio station]] in [[New England]], was born. The station's power was increased to 300 watts three years later, and 18,000 watts by 1953.

At the start of the decade, In 1950&lt;ref name="roster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ |title=Roster of Institutions &amp;#124; Colleges &amp; Universities (CIHE) / Commission on Institutions of Higher Education |publisher=Cihe.neasc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828132004/http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson College became a member of the [[New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]], an accreditation association for schools and colleges in New England.

President Green left the college in 1949 after being selected as president of the [[University of the South]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green to Leave Emerson for Post in South|newspaper=Daily Boston Globe|date=6 May 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Godfrey Dewey served as Acting President until 1951. At that time, Jonathon French was appointed as Acting President, and he became President in December of that year, despite never being formally [[Inauguration|inaugurated]].

===Financial crisis of 1952 and recovery===
The college suffered from a severe financial crisis in 1952, and sought $50,000 in emergency funding. At the time, the Chairman of the Corporation stated that without these funds, the college had three alternatives: go broke, sell out, or join up with another institution. Led by the National Alumni Council, a [[grassroots]] campaign was launched to improve the financial situation of the college. The efforts led to the resignation of the Council of Trustees, which was then replaced mostly by alumni. The new board elected a former Emerson history professor, S. Justus McKinley, as the fifth President of Emerson College.

Pulling out of its financial crisis, the college started to develop its programs with new facilities. In 1953, Emerson opened the Robbins Speech and Hearing Clinic at 145 Beacon Street, furthering the Communication Sciences and Disorders Program. A television studio was dedicated at 130 Beacon in 1954, with its first closed-circuit TV program the following year as WERS-TV. The first annual spring musical, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' by [[Moss Hart]], was presented.{{when|date=April 2012}}

The school was authorized&lt;ref name="roster" /&gt;  to grant Bachelors and Masters of Science in Speech, honorary degrees, and [[Bachelor of Music]] in conjunction with the [[Longy School of Music]].

===Back Bay as Emerson's campus===
As the 1960s started, the building at 373 Commonwealth Avenue was sold to purchase a dormitory at 100 Beacon Street to accommodate an enrollment of 609 undergraduate and 29 graduate students. A year later, a building at 150 Beacon Street was obtained for dorms, dining hall, and administrative offices. With major gifts from Elisabeth Abbot Smith and J.F. Buzzard, the college library moved from the fourth floor of 130 Beacon Street into its own building at 303 Berkeley Street. In 1964, two buildings were purchased: 96 Beacon Street, which became the student union building, and 132–134 Beacon Street, which became a dormitory. The campus remained primarily in Back Bay until the late 1990s.

In 1967, Richard Chapin, former Dean of the [[Harvard Business School]] was inaugurated as the seventh president of Emerson College.

Shortly afterward, an academic planning committee approved a new course of study for general education requirements.  The first level of this program replaced the college-wide requirements with a two-year interdisciplinary course of study and electives.{{elucidate|date=April 2012}} In order to accommodate this new program, the building at 67–69 Brimmer Street was purchased.  The Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies was born. A year later (1972), the college gained authorization{{by whom|date=April 2012}} to grant [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]], and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degrees.

===Attempted relocation===
Though Emerson College has moved to various locations within the city of Boston, the appointment of Allen E. Koenig (the ninth President of Emerson College) almost took the college completely outside of Boston.  As soon as he was inaugurated in 1979, Koenig initiated talks with [[Pine Manor College]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]] to relocate Emerson and merge the two schools. However, an agreement was never reached and the plan was dropped entirely.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic-services/library/archives/emerson-history |title=A Short History of Emerson College &amp;#124; Emerson College |publisher=Emerson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025043338/http://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic-services/library/archives/emerson-history |archivedate=2013-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emerson.edu/about-emerson/administration/president/past-presidents |title=Past Presidents of Emerson College &amp;#124; Emerson College |publisher=Emerson.edu |date=1992-02-20 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 1980s, Koenig made a proposal to the Board of Trustees for a major renovation of the college's facilities. The plan allowed for new performance spaces, classrooms, and faculty offices at Brimmer Street; remodeling the Library and Learning Resources Center at 150 Beacon; remodeling the 303 Berkeley building for the Humanities and Social Sciences Division; a new radio/audio complex at 126 Beacon; and construction of two new television studios behind 130 Beacon.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1984, 335 Commonwealth Avenue was purchased for Administration and the Communication Studies department. The college also received the authorization to grant [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degrees in Creative Writing.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Despite the newly purchased Commonwealth Avenue buildings, [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], was soon being discussed as a new location for Emerson College, about {{convert|44.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Boston]]. The mayor of Lawrence announced that the necessary land would be taken by [[eminent domain]] and sold to Emerson for a token payment of $100.  However, the five affected private landowners disagreed with this arrangement and fought the city in court. Three years later in 1988, Judge John Forte ruled in favor of the City of Lawrence. The river-front site in Lawrence was proposed as the new campus for the College. However, as real estate values in Boston dropped and the costs of constructing a new campus increased, the plans were put on hold and eventually abandoned when Koenig resigned as president in 1989.  In 1988, the college bought a building at Zero Marlborough Street (also known as 6 Arlington Street) for dormitories and a dining hall.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In an unrelated move, [[Kasteel Well]] in the Netherlands was purchased and became the home of Emerson's overseas program (now called External Programs).

===Rebirth in the Theater District===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
[[File:Emerson Colonial Theater Boston MA.jpg|thumb|Emerson College's Colonial Theater]]
John Zacharis became the tenth President of Emerson College and faced a college fractured by the failed move to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Over the course of two years, he moved to restore unity to the campus by purchasing a building at 180 Tremont Street, now called the Ansin Building. This purchase started a transition from [[Back Bay (Boston)|Back Bay]] to the [[Boston Theater District]]. Zacharis went on medical leave in 1992 and died of [[leukemia]] shortly after.

During Zacharis's leave, [[Jacqueline Liebergott|Jacqueline Weis Liebergott]] was appointed as Acting President and, a year later, inaugurated to become the first female president of the college. Shortly after, she submitted a 10-year master plan to the [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]] which involved moving the college to the [[Washington Street Theatre District]] (also known at that time as the [[Combat Zone, Boston|Combat Zone]]).

In the mid-1990s, a planning document of the college's future plans was drafted and public hearings were held. The college also extended [[Health insurance|health care benefit]]s to [[domestic partner]]s of gay and lesbian faculty, administration and staff. Under the plan, dental coverage and tuition waivers were also available.

1994 was also the year the college started to go online with a $100,000 gift from Mrs. Mary E. Tufte. Financed by the contribution, '''The Tufte Lab''' was placed on the fourth floor of the Ansin Building and dedicated in Mrs. Tufte's honor. The lab was the catalyst for a telecommunications / [[fiber optic]] network installation, which was completed in October 1995.

In addition, the college announced the purchase and restoration of The Little Building (Boston) (1994) across the street from the Ansin Building and next to Emerson's [[Cutler Majestic Theatre|Majestic Theatre]]. Restoration was completed on the façades of the college's buildings at 126, 128, 130, 132–134, 168 Beacon Street, and 21 Commonwealth Avenue.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1998, Emerson purchased the Walker Building (Boston) at 120 Boylston.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The building currently hosts the school's Department of Television, Radio, Film Production, the Institutional Advancement (Alumni and Development) department, and the Government and Community Relations department. It also contains the school's Library and many of its classrooms.

===21st century===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
In 2003, the Tufte Performance Production Center (PPC) at 10 Boylston Place opened.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The 11-story steel-and-glass building houses the Department of Performing Arts and includes two theaters (The Semel Theatre and The Greene Theatre), two television studios, makeup and costume labs, faculty offices, and an exhibition area. Also that year, the [[Cutler Majestic Theatre]] finished renovations and re-opened as one of the main stages of Emerson Stage productions.

In 2004, it was announced that the buildings at 96, 100, and 132 Beacon had been sold and would be vacated by the Fall 2006 semester.

Construction of a new 14-story residence hall at 150 Boylston Street began in March 2004, and was completed in September 2006 in time for the new school year. It is the first entirely-new residence hall in Emerson's history. The facility includes residential suites, athletic facilities, offices and meeting rooms for student organizations, informal gathering places for off-campus students, spaces for small-group rehearsals and performances, and dining facilities.
[[File:Paramount Theatre, Boston MA.jpg|thumb|Paramount Theatre, Boston MA]]
In 2005 the school purchased the historic [[Paramount Theatre (Boston)]] on Washington Street, with plans to build a new complex at the site including a 565-seat main stage theater inside the existing Paramount Theater and a 125-seat black box theater in an adjacent new building. Plans also included a 200-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from {{convert|700|to|1900|sqft|m2}}, six smaller rehearsal spaces, a sound stage for film students, a new [[scene shop]], and a dormitory for 260 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emerson.edu/emersontoday/index.cfm?action=3&amp;articleID=3596&amp;editionID=338]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2006, a {{convert|3|shtn|adj=on}} scaffolding platform on the east side of the 150 Boylston construction project fell to the street below, killing two construction workers and one passing motorist. The scaffolding had been attached to the east side of the building and was in the process of being removed. Investigators found that the construction workers did not properly secure the scaffolding to a crane while dismantling the apparatus, causing the platform to be unstable and resulting in the collapse. Construction was stopped for over a week to allow investigators to determine the cause of the accident, but was resumed in time to meet the project's August 2006 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/scaffolding_collapse/ |work=The Boston Globe | title=Boston scaffolding accident | date=June 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the Campus Center in the Piano Row building was named the [[Max Mutchnick]] Campus Center after a major gift from the 1987 graduate and co-creator of the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. In the same year, the school exercised its purchase option on the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston, Massachusetts)|Colonial Theatre]], adjacent to the Little Building, and then converted the upper floors of the building to a 372-bed dormitory.  With the addition of dorm space here and at the Paramount Theatre, the school hoped to accommodate up to 75% of its students in on-campus housing by the year 2010.

In September 2006 a long-running labor dispute between the administrators and faculty union was resolved. The administration limited the union's role in promotion and tenure, and brought department chairs into administrative roles, where they were not covered by the union. In response, the college agreed not to dismantle the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wasley |first=Paula |url=http://www.chroniclecareers.com/article/Labor-Battle-Ends-at-Emerson/8546/ |title=Labor Battle Ends at Emerson College – Faculty – The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chroniclecareers.com |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314065516/http://www.chroniclecareers.com/article/Labor-Battle-Ends-at-Emerson/8546/ |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, students in Emerson Alliance for Gays, Lesbians, and Everyone (E.A.G.L.E.) as well as the Student Government Association (S.G.A.) received the gender neutral bathrooms they had pitched to the administration in the spring. In September 2016, every bathroom on Emerson's campus was converted into a gender inclusive restroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=-Emily A.

On December 2, 2009, President Liebergott announced she would step down in June 2011. On September 8, 2010, the college announced she would be succeeded by [[M. Lee Pelton]] of [[Willamette University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–M.

On March 18, 2010, the newly renovated [[Paramount Center]] officially opened, with Boston Mayor [[Thomas M. Menino]] illuminating the Paramount's original [[art deco]] [[marquee (sign)|marquee]], which Emerson had restored. In addition to the 590-seat Paramount Theatre, the Paramount Center also houses an experimental [[black box theater]], the Bright Family Screening Room (for films), a [[sound stage]], a [[scene shop|scene/prop production shop]], nine rehearsal studios, six practice rooms, four classrooms, 20 faculty offices, and a student gathering area. A commercial restaurant will be located on the street level.

{{as of|2014}}, two students are suing the college for mishandling their rape cases and failing to provide their Title IX rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/emerson-college-lawsuit-rape_n_5671580.html |title=Emerson College Slammed in Lawsuit Over Handling of Rape Case |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Emerson College completed its move{{when|date=April 2012}} from Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhood to the historic [[Washington Street Theatre District]], abutting the southeast corner of [[Boston Common]].  The main campus is served by [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]] station on the [[MBTA]] [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and [[Chinatown (MBTA station)|Chinatown]] station on the MBTA [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]].

The College also owns a fourteenth-century castle in The Netherlands (the base for its European programs), and {{asof|2013|lc=y}} constructed a major academic center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to house its long-standing Los Angeles programs.

===Academic and theater buildings===

====Ansin Building (180 Tremont Street)====
Once owned by the [[Boston Edison Company]], the Ansin Building was purchased by Emerson in 1992. The building stands 14 stories high and contains all Visual &amp; Media Arts (VMA) labs and facilities, offices for all VMA and Writing, Literature &amp; Publishing (WLP) departments, and is the home of [[WERS]], WECB, and ETIN (Emerson's Talk and Information Network, an online radio service). It also contains the registrar's office, Tufte and 3D computer labs, Digital Production labs, and the Media Services center.

====216 Tremont Street====
The former Union Bank building at 216 Tremont Street houses the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and its speech and hearing clinic The Robbins Center. Also located here are the offices of Student Financial Services, Health Services, Career Services, the Counseling Center and the International Student Center. The Bill Bordy Theater and Auditorium on the ground floor is used for lectures, performances, performance classes and special events.

Computer Labs: Communication Sciences and Disorders Lab (CSD)

====Walker Building (120 Boylston Street)====

====Paramount Center (555 Washington Street)====
Opening in 1932 as a movie theatre, seating 1,700 movie-goers, the Paramount Theatre was one of the first movie houses in Boston to play talking motion pictures.  In 2005, Emerson College announced plans to renovate the Paramount Theatre, building an entire performing arts facility in and around the theatre. Construction was completed in January 2010.

The project included not only renovating the Paramount Theatre into a 550-seat theater, but building both a new Performance Development Center and a new residence hall for the school in the upper floors of the building. The complex features the 120-seat [[black box theater|Liebergott Black Box Theatre]], the 174-seat Bright Family Screening Room, nine rehearsal studios ranging from {{convert|700|to|1900|sqft|m2}}, five practice rooms for individuals and small groups, a [[sound stage]] for film production classes, a [[scene shop]], several classrooms; a restaurant, and Emerson faculty and staff offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emerson.edu/about-emerson/offices-departments/office-arts/venues |title=Office of the Arts: Venues |publisher=Emerson College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovated Paramount Center was designed by [[Elkus Manfredi Architects]] of Boston and built by Bond Brothers. Construction began in the spring of 2007 and was completed in December 2009.

===ELA—Hollywood Center (Los Angeles)===

The 10-story building was opened for the college's winter semester in 2014. The new facility accommodates 217 students, approximately twice the number of students that were supported by Emerson's older facility in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Vincent, [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-emerson-20120302,0,2085438.story "Emerson College is building a new West Coast campus in Hollywood.

===Kasteel Well (Netherlands)===
Emerson College owns and operates [[Kasteel Well]] in the province of Limburg, the Netherlands, a national historical monument that provides living accommodations, classrooms, a resource center, and related facilities. Located near the German border, Kasteel Well is approximately two hours from Düsseldorf, Amsterdam, and Brussels, and five hours from Paris, Milan, and Madrid. Approximately 85 matriculated Emerson students attend  the "Castle" Program each semester, and are chosen through a lottery style system. Most course offerings are Sophomore level, but the program is open to Sophomores and above. Students are encouraged to travel throughout the duration of the program, with the campus partially closing each weekend (with no weekend dining services) and no Thursday evening or Friday classes to allow for weekend trips. Many students travel most or every weekend of the semester. 

Classes are taught by Dutch teachers, with several Belgian and other teachers on staff. 

Student housing is in the two separate buildings of the castle - the "Main Castle" and the "Vorbercht" with a variety of doubles, triples, and singles. Most rooms are triples with loft beds. 

The village of Well is a small town of about 2,500 residents. It is located in the southernmost province of the Netherlands and has its own distinctive character. The area is very rural, and filled with numerous walking and cycling paths. There are pastures with horses and sheep and beautiful landscapes. There is an “old” section and a “new” section of Well, with the castle in the middle.

===Main campus residence halls===
An unusual feature of Emerson College residence halls is their close proximity to many of the major theaters and performance spaces in the heart of the [[Washington Street Theatre District]] of Boston. Some of the student rooms are literally on top of a major Boston theater owned by Emerson, and all of them are in close walking distance to the major performance venues of the District. Also nearby are major shopping centers and restaurants of the [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], [[Downtown Crossing|Downtown]], and [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhoods of Boston.

====Piano Row &amp; Max Mutchnick Campus Center (150 Boylston Street)====
The newly constructed building opened in September 2006, replacing residence hall and student union buildings on Beacon and Arlington streets with most offices relocating to the new building. Sited on Boylston St. in the historic [[Piano Row District]], the building is often referred to as "Piano Row".

The residence floors consist of seven suites per floor. Each suite consists of three two-person bedrooms and one shared bathroom and living room for the unit. In addition, each floor has at least one residence assistant's room with either a common room or an additional residence assistant's room every other floor.

Piano Row is also home to the [[Max Mutchnick]] Campus Center, sometimes called "The Max", and the [[Bobbi Brown]] and Steven Plofker Gymnasium. The former features several conference, meeting, and rehearsal spaces open to all students, offices for Student Life and the Student Government Association, and storage for any student organization that requires it. The Brown Gymnasium has an [[NCAA]] regulation-sized basketball court, with several sets of bleachers and a sky box equipped for events, as well as a workout and fitness center for athletes. Also housing new offices for the Athletics Department, it is Emerson College's first-ever indoor athletic facility. The construction of the gym was controversial at the time of its announcement, considering lack of performing space on campus and the lack of enthusiasm around athletics at Emerson. Since then, with growing appreciation for athletics among the student body, and the development of significant new performance and rehearsal space in the Paramount Center (see below), the Brown Gym has become an important campus feature.

The building also features a cafe, which offers several made-to-order food items as well as convenience items, with indoor seating overlooking the Boston Common.

====Little Building (80 Boylston Street)====
In addition to housing a number of administrative offices on the ground floor, the Little Building was once an office and residential space before Emerson College purchased the building in 1994 and opened it for use in September 1995.  The Little Building contains the college's only [[cafeteria]], a {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} fitness center in its basement and "The Cabaret", a space in the basement used for performances with a maximum capacity of 150 people.

The residence hall houses over 750 students in the upper 10 floors of the 12-story building. The housing section of the building comprises singles, doubles, triples, two quads, and suites of between 4 and 6 people made up of various configurations of singles and doubles.

The Little Building was originally built to hold 600 offices, 15 stores, 22 shops, and a Post Office. Built in 1917, it was named after its financier, John Mason Little and was designed by famed architect Clarence Blackall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&amp;d=p626 |title=The Council of Independent Colleges: Historic Campus Architecture Project |publisher=Puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807213803/http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&amp;d=p626 |archivedate=2012-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's name is often confused as being a descriptive [[adjective]], which leads to surprise upon discovery that it is one of the larger buildings on campus. In 1998 the building was changed from its original red color.{{elucidate|date=December 2013}}

As of the 2017-2018 school year, the Little Building was closed for much-needed renovation and will reopen in the fall of 2019.

====Colonial Building (100 Boylston Street)====
Newly renovated in 2009, the upper floors of this 10-story building house 372 students in single and double rooms in three-, four-, five-, or six-person suite-like environments that include a shared bathroom. Residents share common lounges with kitchenettes and a centralized laundry facility.  This was formerly the headquarters of music publishing company, McLaughlin &amp; Reilly Co.

====Paramount Center (555 Washington Street)====
Opened in 2010, The Paramount Center is located in the heart of the Boston Theatre district, adjacent to the [[Boston Opera House (1980)|Boston Opera House]] and on top of the newly renovated Paramount Theatre, classroom space, a film soundstage, 200 seat screening room, and a black box theatre.  The Residence hall has four floors, on the 6th through 9th floors.  Each floor has a common room, and a mix of doubles and four or six person suites.  All rooms or suites have their own full bathroom, and all floors are coed.

====2 Boylston Place (2 Boylston Place)====
Opened in 2017, 2 Boylston Place is an 18-story residence hall that houses approximately 375 students. The new building has created a much-needed student social space and contributes to making the Boylston Place corridor a striking, signature entrance to our urban campus.Three hundred and seventy-five students call 2 Boylston Place home in single, double, and triple rooms within six- or eight-person suite-like environments that include a shared bathroom. There are also off-hallway triple rooms that include a private bathroom. Residents share three common lounges, one with a kitchen, and two centralized laundry facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emerson.edu/housing-dining/residence-halls/2-boylston-place&lt;/ref&gt;

The company holds bi-annual showcases at the end of every semester highlighting student dancers and choreographers, all of whom have auditioned at the start of every semester and applied to choreograph through a selection process run by the company's executive board.

Emerson Dance Company (commonly referred to as EDC) also offers master classes, workshops, and events which are open to the entire Emerson community. In addition to participating in internal college activities, the group also engages in community service around the Boston area.&lt;ref name="About Emerson Dance Company"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerson Dance Company|url=Emerson Dance Company also offers master classes, workshops, and events which are open to the Emerson community.

{{Classicism}}
The '''great books''' are [[book]]s that constitute an essential foundation in the [[literature]] of [[Western culture]]. Specified sets of great books typically range from 100 to 150, though they differ according to purpose and context. For instance, some lists are built to be read by undergraduates in a college semester system (130 books, Torrey Honors Institute),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/academics/reading/ |title=The Reading List &amp;#124; Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University}}&lt;/ref&gt; some are compiled to be sold as a single set of volumes ([[Great Books of the Western World|500 books]], [[Mortimer Adler]]), while some lists aim at a thorough literary criticism (2,400 books, [[Harold Bloom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teeter|first=Robert|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html |title=Bloom. Western Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The great books are those that tradition, and various institutions and authorities, have regarded as constituting or best expressing the foundations of [[Western culture]] (the [[Western canon]] is a similar but broader designation); derivatively the term also refers to a curriculum or method of education based around a list of such books. [[Mortimer Adler]] lists three criteria for including a book on the list:
* the book has contemporary significance; that is, it has relevance to the problems and issues of our times;
* the book is inexhaustible; it can be read again and again with benefit; "This is an exacting criterion, an ideal that is fully attained by only a small number of the 511 works that we selected. It is approximated in varying degrees by the rest."&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberspacei.com/greatbooks/h2/criteria.htm |title=Selecting Works for the 1990 Edition of the Great Books of the Western World|author=Adler, Mortimer J. |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the book is relevant to a large number of the great ideas and great issues that have occupied the minds of thinking individuals for the last 25 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, "Second Look", p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-uebersax.com/plato/reading2.htm |title=Thomas Jefferson's Reading Lists |publisher=John-uebersax.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known for his interest in higher education, frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents, for example, for Peter Carr in 1785&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr  (An honest heart, a knowing head; Paris, August 19, 1785). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 814–818)&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (The homage to Reason; Paris, August 10, 1787).

In 1909, Harvard University published a 51-volume great books series, titled the [[Harvard Classics]].  These volumes are now in the public domain.

The [[Great Books of the Western World]] came about as the result of a discussion among American academics and educators, starting in the 1920s and 1930s and begun by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054422/http://radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about how to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

They were at odds both with much of the existing educational establishment and with contemporary educational theory. Educational theorists like [[Sidney Hook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hook|first=Sidney|title=Education for Modern Man|year=1946|publisher=The Dial Press|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.ditext.com/hook/hook.html|authorlink=Sidney Hook|chapter=A Critical Appraisal of the St. John's College Curriculum|quote=Reprinted with some minor changes from ''[[The New Leader]]'', May 26 and June 4, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Dewey]] (''see [[pragmatism]]'') disagreed with the premise that there was [[educational crossover|crossover]] in education.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Program==
The Great Books Program is a curriculum that makes use of this list of texts. As much as possible, students rely on primary sources. The emphasis is on open discussion with limited guidance by a professor, facilitator, or tutor. Students are also expected to write papers.

In 1920, Professor Erskine taught the first course based on the "great books" program, titled "General Honors", at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |date= |publisher=Columbia College |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped mold its core curriculum. It initially failed, however, shortly after its introduction due to fallings-out between the senior faculty over the best ways to conduct classes and due to concerns about the rigor of the courses. Thus junior faculty including [[Mark Van Doren]]  and [[Mortimer Adler]] after 1923, taught a part of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. Adler left for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the University president, [[Robert M. Hutchins]], held an annual seminar of great books. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at [[St. John's College, Annapolis]], besides University of Chicago. This course later became Humanities A for freshmen, and subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities.&lt;ref name=col/&gt;  Survivors, however, include [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia's Core Curriculum]], the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at [[Boston University]], each heavily focused on the "great books" of the Western canon.

A university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s. The aim of such programs is a return to the Western [[Liberal Arts]] tradition in education, as a corrective to the extreme disciplinary specialisation common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

There are only a few true "Great Books Programs" still in operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These schools focus almost exclusively on the Great Books Curriculum throughout enrollment and do not offer classes analogous to those commonly offered at other colleges. The first and best known of these schools is [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#Great Books program|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe (program established in 1937);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John’s College &amp;#124; Academic Program &amp;#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was followed by [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, the Integral Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/the-integral-program|title=The Integral Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Saint Mary's College of California (1955), [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), [[Northeast Catholic College]] in Warner, New Hampshire,  and [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Santa Paula, California. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), [[Gutenberg College]] in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), [[Harrison Middleton University]] in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005), and [[Imago Dei College]] in Oak Glen, California (est. 2010). Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. The [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, is a highly regarded Great Books Program that operates as a separate institution within the College of Liberal Arts. [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics.&lt;ref name="drbu.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Realm Buddhist University Accepting Applications for Undergraduate Program|url=http://www.drbu.org/news/dharma-realm-buddhist-university-accepting-applications-undergraduate-program|website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Study of the Great Ideas advances the Great Conversation found in the great books by providing Adler's guidance, and resource materials through both live and on-line seminars, educational and philosophical consultation, international presence on the Internet, access to the Center's library collection of books, essays, articles, journals and audio/video programs. Center programs are unique in that they do not replicate other existing programs either started or developed by Adler.

=== Universities ===
Over 100 institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada, and Europe maintain some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are:

==Controversy==
In contemporary scholarship, the great books curriculum was drawn into the popular debate about [[multiculturalism]], traditional education, the "culture war," and the role of the intellectual in American life. Much of this debate centered on reactions to the publication of ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' in 1987 by [[Allan Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html John Searle, "The Storm Over the University," ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
{{main article|Great Books of the Western World}}

The ''Great Books of the Western World'' is a hardcover 60-volume collection (originally 54 volumes) of the books on the great books list (about 517 individual works). Many of the books in the collection were translated into English for the first time.{{fact|date=February 2017}} A prominent feature of the collection is a two-volume [[Syntopicon]] that includes essays written by Mortimer Adler on 102 "great ideas." Following each essay is an extensive outline of the idea with page references to relevant passages throughout the collection. Familiar to many Americans, the collection is available from [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], which owns the copyright.

Shortly after Adler retired from the [[Great Books Foundation]] in 1989, a second edition (1990) of the ''Great Books of the Western World'' was published; it included more Hispanic and female authors and, for the first time, works by black authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104001606/http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-04 |author=Sabrina Walters |title=Great Books won Adler fame, scorn |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president of the Foundation, Adler had resisted such additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |author=Peter Temes |title=Death of a Great Reader and Philosopher |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-03 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012348/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |archivedate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We did not base our selections on an author's nationality, religion, politics, or field of study; nor on an author's race or gender. Great books were not chosen to make up quotas of any kind; there was no "affirmative action" in the process&amp;nbsp;... we chose the great books on the basis of their relevance to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas. Many of the great books are relevant to a much larger number of the 102 great ideas, as many as 75 or more great ideas, a few to all 102 great ideas. In sharp contrast are the good books that are relevant to less than 10 or even as few as 4 or 5 great ideas. We placed such books in the lists of Recommended Readings to be found in the last section in each of the 102 chapters of the "Syntopicon". Here readers will find many twentieth-century female authors, black authors, and Latin American authors whose works we recommended but did not include in the second edition of the great books.&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"/&gt;}}

{{Main article| The Learning Channel's Great Books}}
In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco, comprising 52 half-hour programs, entitled ''The Great Ideas''. These programs were produced by the Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the [[American Broadcasting Company]], presented by National Educational Television (NET), the precursor to what is now PBS. Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatideas.org/mortimer_adler_videos/index.html|title=Mortimer Adler Videos on The Great Ideas|website=www.thegreatideas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 and 1994, The [[Learning Channel]] created a series of one-hour programs discussing many of the great books of history and their impact on the world. It was narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], amongst others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">'''Henry Kronenberg''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 2000s) is an American physician and academic. {{As of|2006}} he is the immediate past Division Head of Endocrinology at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]], MA and a Professor of Medicine at the [[Harvard Medical School]]. He is noted for his work on parathyroid hormone and the use of genetic mouse models to understand the role of [[parathyroid hormone]] and [[parathyroid hormone-related protein]] in the regulation of [[bone]] formation and remodeling.  He graduated from [[Harvard College]] and [[Columbia Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/doctor.aspx?id=16502#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Dr. Kronenberg has made a series of fundamental observations of importance to the understanding of how several peptides regulate the formation and remodeling of bone. These include the cloning of a [[cDNA]] for [[parathyroid hormone]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloning and nucleotide sequence of DNA coding for bovine preproparathyroid hormone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47232">[[Harvard College]], around which [[Harvard University]] eventually grew, was founded in 1636 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.

For centuries, its graduates dominated Massachusetts' clerical and civil ranks and beginning in the 19th century its stature became national, then international, as a dozen graduate and professional schools were formed alongside the nucleus undergraduate College. Historically influential in national roles are the schools of [[Harvard Medical School|medicine]] (1782), [[Harvard Law School|law]] (1817) and [[Harvard Business School|business]] (1908) as well as the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1890).

Since the late 19th century Harvard has been one of the most prestigious schools in the world, its library system and financial endowment larger than those of any other.

|{{sic|hide=y|After God had carried us safe to New-England, and wee had builded our houses, provided necessaries for our livelihood, rear’d convenient places for Gods worship, and setled the Civill Government: One of the next things we longed for, and looked after was to advance Learning and perpetuate it to Posterity; dreading to leave an illiterate {{sic|hide=y|Mini|stery}} to the Churches, when our present Ministers shall lie in the Dust. And as we were thinking and consulting how to effect this great work, it pleased God to stir up the heart of one Mr. Harvard (a godly gentleman and a lover of learning; then living amongst us) to give one-half of his estate (it being in all about &amp;pound;1,700) towards the erecting of a Colledge, and all his library. After him, another gave &amp;pound;300; others after them cast in more; and the public hand of the State added the rest. The Colledge was by common consent appointed to be at Cambridge (a place very pleasant and accommodate), and is called (according to the name of the first founder) Harvard Colledge.

[[File:HarvardCollegeCharter.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Harvard Corporation]] charter (1650)]]
With some 17,000 [[Puritans]] migrating to New England by 1636, Harvard was founded in anticipation of the need for training clergy for the new commonwealth, a "church in the wilderness". Harvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

In 1639, the college was renamed Harvard College after clergyman [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], a [[University of Cambridge]] alumnus who had willed the new school [[Pound sign|£]]779 [[pounds sterling]] and his library of some 400 books.&lt;ref name="JH facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Harvard Facts, Information.|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/John_Harvard.aspx|publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate=2009-07-17|quote=He bequeathed £780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new established college at Cambridge, Mass., which was named in his honor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony charter creating the [[Harvard Corporation]] was granted in 1650 at the beginning of the [[English Interregnum]]. When the college's first president [[Henry Dunster]] abandoned Puritanism in favor of the English [[Baptist]] faith in 1654, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. The colony's Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology, but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism.

Dunster's conflict with the colony's magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing as an adherent of the [[Believers baptism]] of English Baptists and/or [[Anabaptists]] that only adults should be baptized. Efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed and his apostasy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him in his job as Harvard's president to uphold the colony's religious mission, thus he represented a threat to the stability of society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654 and moved to nearby [[Plymouth Colony]], where he died in 1658.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy L. Wood, "'I Spake the Truth in the Feare of God': the Puritan Management of Dissent During the Henry Dunster Controversy," ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 2005 33(1): 1-19,&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it had been illegal for the colony to establish a college, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] rescinded the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter in 1684 by writ of [[scire facias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Baker, J.

In 1692, the leading Puritan divine [[Increase Mather]] became president of Harvard. One of his acts was replacing pagan classics with books by Christian authors in ethics classes and maintaining a high standard of discipline. The Harvard "Lawes" of 1642 and the "Harvard College Laws of 1700" testify to its original high level of discipline.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.peacebyjesus.com/HARVARD_LAWES.HTML Laws and Statutes for Students of Harvard College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190843/http://www.peacebyjesus.com/HARVARD_LAWES.HTML |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were required to observe rules of pious decorum inconceivable in the 19th century and ultimately to prove their fitness for the bachelor's degree by showing that they could "read the original of the Old and New Testament into the Latin tongue, and resolve them logically".&lt;ref&gt;Barrett Wendell, ''Cotton Mather, the Puritan priest'' (1897) p 35&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's leadership and alumni (including Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather) played a central role in the [[Salem Witch Trials]] 1692{{ndash}}1693.

During Harvard's early years, the town of Cambridge maintained order on campus and provided economic support, as the local [[Puritan]] minister had direct oversight of Harvard and ensured the orthodoxy of its leadership. By 1700, Harvard was strong enough to regulate and discipline its own people and to a large extent the direction in which support and assistance flowed was reversed, Harvard now providing financial support for local economic expansion, improvements to public health and construction of local roads, [[Colonial meeting house|meetinghouses]] and schools.&lt;ref&gt;John Daniel Burton, ''Puritan Town and Gown: Harvard College and Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1636–1800.'' PhD dissertation, College of William and Mary, 1996. 314 pp. DAI 1997 58(2): 560-A. DA9720973&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18th century ==
The early motto of Harvard was ''Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae'', meaning "Truth for Christ and the Church". In the early classes, half the graduates became ministers (though by the 1760s the proportion was down to 15%) and ten of Harvard's first twelve presidents were ministers. Systematic theological instruction was inaugurated in 1721 and by 1827 Harvard became a nucleus of theological teaching in New England.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Eliot Morison, ''The Founding of Harvard College'' (1935) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of Mather's presidency in 1701 marked the start of a long struggle between orthodoxy and liberalism. Harvard's first secular president was John Leverett, who began his term in 1708. Leverett left the curriculum largely intact and sought to keep the College independent of the overwhelming influence of any single sect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.harvard.edu/history/07_leverett.php John Leverett - History - Office of the President] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612033858/http://www.president.harvard.edu/history/07_leverett.php |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Revolution, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] alumni were outnumbered seven to one by Patriots—seven alumni died in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Jack P. Greene, "Harvard Men in a Changing World," ''Massachusetts Historical Review'' 2007 9: 166-176,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unitarians ===
Throughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.&lt;ref name=Dorrien&gt;Gary J. Dorrien.

[[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected to the chair in 1805 and the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).&lt;ref name=Dorrien/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref&gt;Peter S.

=== Science ===
In 1846, the natural history lectures of [[Louis Agassiz]] were acclaimed both in New York and on his campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that one can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norris and in a Romantic vein [[Samuel Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Nartonis, "Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795–1846,"  ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 2005 66(3): 437-449, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3654189 in JSTOR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031010118/http://www.jstor.org/stable/3654189 |date=October 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elitism ===
Between 1830 and 1870, Harvard became "privatized".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Story ''The Forging of an Aristocracy: Harvard and the Boston Upper Class, 1800–1870'', (1980),&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] controlled state government, Harvard had prospered and the 1824 defeat of the Federalist Party in Massachusetts allowed the renascent [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] to block state funding of private universities. By 1870, the politicians and ministers that heretofore had made up the university's board of overseers had been replaced by Harvard alumni drawn from Boston's upper-class business and professional community and funded by private endowment.

During this period, Harvard experienced unparalleled growth that securely placed it financially in a league of its own among American colleges. Ronald Story notes that in 1850, Harvard's total assets were "five times that of Amherst and Williams combined, and three times that of Yale".&lt;ref&gt;Story, R. (1980). ''The Forging of an Aristocracy: Harvard and the Boston Upper Class, 1800–1870''. Wesleyan University Press, {{ISBN|0-8195-5044-2}} (p. 50: Harvard's explosive growth from 1800 to 1850 separate it from other colleges)&lt;/ref&gt; Story also notes that "all the evidence… points to the four decades from 1815 to 1855 as the era when parents, in Henry Adams's words, began 'sending their children to Harvard College for the sake of its social advantages'".&lt;ref&gt;Story, R. (1980). op. cit. p. 97, (1815–1855 as the era when Harvard began to be perceived as socially advantageous)&lt;/ref&gt; Under President Eliot's tenure, Harvard earned a reputation for being more liberal and democratic than either [[Princeton University|Princeton]] or [[Yale]] in regard to bigotry against Jews and other ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. (2001). ''The Ethnic Myth''. Beacon Press, {{ISBN|0-8070-4153-X}}. (Harvard most democratic of the Big Three under Eliot, p. 234)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, one year into Eliot's term, [[Richard Theodore Greener]] became the first African-American to graduate from Harvard College. Seven years later, [[Louis Brandeis]], the first Jewish justice on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], graduated from Harvard Law School. Nevertheless, Harvard became the bastion of a distinctly Protestant élite – the so-called [[Boston Brahmin]] class – and continued to be so well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Philosophy 4 |first = Owen | last = Wister | year = 1914 | publisher = The Macmillan Company}}, p. 23: "had colonial names;" p. 36, "Bertie's and Billy's parents owned town and country houses in New York.

=== Eliot ===
[[Charles W. Eliot]], president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth and the indwelling God in each person.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Shoemaker, "The Theological Roots of Charles W. Eliot's Educational Reforms," ''Journal of Unitarian Universalist History'' 2006–2007 31: 30-45,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
Football, originally organized by students as an extracurricular activity, was banned twice by the university for being a brutal and dangerous sport. However, by the 1880s football became a dominant force at the college as the alumni became more involved in the sport. In 1882, the faculty formed a three-member athletic committee to oversee all intercollegiate athletics, but due to increasing student and alumni pressure the committee was expanded in 1885 to include three student and three alumni members. The alumni's role in the rise and commercialization of football, the leading moneymaker for athletics by the 1880s, was evident in the fundraising for the first steel-reinforced concrete stadium. The class of 1879 donated $100,000 – nearly one-third of the cost – to the construction of the 35,000-seat stadium, which was completed in 1903, with the remainder to be collected from future ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Smith, "Commercialized Intercollegiate Athletics and the 1903 Harvard Stadium," ''New England Quarterly'', Vol. 78, No. 1 (Mar., 2005), pp. 26-48 [https://web.archive.org/web/20160113030613/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1559707 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Graduate schools ==
=== Medical School ===
{{main|Harvard Medical School}}
The school, the third-oldest medical school in the United States, was founded in 1782 as Massachusetts Medical College by [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]], [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] and [[Aaron Dexter]]. It relocated from Cambridge across the river to Boston in 1810. The medical school was tied to the rest of the University "only by the tenuous thread of degrees", but its strong faculty gave it a national reputation by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Eliot Morison|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636–1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C&amp;pg=PA224|year=1936|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical school moved to its current location on Longwood Avenue in 1906, where the "Great White Quadrangle" or HMS Quad with its five white marble buildings was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hms.harvard.edu/public/history/history.html|title=Harvard Medical School&amp;nbsp;— History|accessdate=February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countway.harvard.edu/archives/historyNotes.shtml

The reputation continued to grow into the 20th century, especially in terms of scientific research and support from regional and national elites. Fifteen scientists won the Nobel Prize for work done at the Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms "The History of HMS"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821205116/http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms |date=August 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

=== Law School ===
{{main|Harvard Law School}} 
The Harvard Law School was established in 1817, making it the oldest continuously operating law school in the nation. It was a small operation and grew slowly. By 1827, it was down to one faculty member. [[Nathan Dane]], a prominent alumnus, endowed the Dane Professorship of Law and insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Story]]. For a while, the school was called Dane Law School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/1/23/law-school-has-fine-portrait-collection/ "Law School Has Fine Portrait Collection"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182518/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/1/23/law-school-has-fine-portrait-collection/ |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''Harvard Crimson'' (1930-01-23).&lt;/ref&gt; Story's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time. Enrollment remained low as academic legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice.

[[Image:Langdell.jpg|thumb|Law Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell]]
Radical reform came in the 1870s, under Dean [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] (1826–1906).&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Chase. "The Birth Of The Modern Law School," ''American Journal of Legal History'' (1979) 23#4 pp 329-348&lt;/ref&gt; Its new curriculum set the national standard and was copied widely in the United States. Langdell developed the [[casebook method|case method]] of teaching law, based on his belief that law could be studied as a "science" gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. The school introduced a first-year curriculum that was widely imitated, based on classes in [[contracts]], [[property]], [[torts]], [[criminal law]] and [[civil procedure]].

Critics bemoaned abandonment of the more traditional lecture method, because of its efficiency and the lower workloads it placed on faculty and students. Advocates of the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. From its founding in 1900, the Association of American Law Schools promoted the case method in law schools that sought accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Kimball, "The Proliferation of Case Method Teaching in American Law Schools: Mr. Langdell's Emblematic 'Abomination,' 1890–1915," ''History of Education Quarterly'' (2006) 46#2 pp 192-240 [https://web.archive.org/web/20160602225646/http://www.jstor.org/stable/20462057 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graduate school ===
{{main|Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences}}
As the College modernized in the late 19th century, the faculty was organized into departments and began to add graduate programs, especially the PhD. [[Charles William Eliot]], president from 1869 to 1909, was a chemist who had spent two years in Germany studying their universities. Thousands of Americans, mostly Harvard and Yale alumni, had attended German universities, especially Berlin and Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Diehl, ''Americans and Germans Scholarship, 1770–1870'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot used the German model to set up graduate programs at Harvard and he formed a graduate department in 1872, which granted its first Ph.D. degrees in 1873 to [[William Elwood Byerly|William Byerly]] in mathematics and Charles Whitney in history. Eliot set up the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with its own dean and budget in 1890, which dealt with graduate students and funded research programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Hawkins, ''Between Harvard and America: The Educational Leadership of Charles W. Eliot'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, there were 3,200 graduate students in 53 separate programs and forty former or current professors had won a Nobel Prize, most of them scientists or economists based in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John T. Bethell|author2=Richard M.

=== Business school ===
{{main|Harvard Business School}}
From its beginning in 1908, the Harvard Business School had a close relationship with the corporate world. Within a few years of its founding many business leaders were its alumni and were hiring other alumni for starting positions in their firms.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Yogev, "Corporate Hand in Academic Glove: The New Management's Struggle for Academic Recognition--The Case of the Harvard Group in the 1920's," ''American Studies International'' (2001) 39#1 online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvin T. Copeland, ''And Mark an Era: The Story of the Harvard Business School'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Smith, ''The American Business System: The Theory and Practice of Social Science, the Case of the Harvard Business School, 1920–1945'' (Garland Publishers, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The School used Rockefeller funding in the 1920s to launch a major research program under [[Elton Mayo]] (1926–1947) for his "Harvard human relations group". Its findings revolutionized human relations in business and raised the reputation of the Business School from its initial "low status as a trainer of money grabbers into a high prestige educator of socially-conscientious administrators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morgen Witzel|author2=Malcolm Warner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Management Theorists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlFoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1935, the school began weekend and short-term leadership training workshops for executives of major corporations that further expanded its national role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Witzel|author2=Warner|title=The Oxford Handbook of Management Theorists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlFoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97||page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1949, almost half of all the holders of the MBA degree in the U.S. were alumni of the Business School and it was "the most influential graduate school of business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Harvey|author2=Geoffrey Jones|title=Organisational Capability and Competitive Advantage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=el7hAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT178|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation for scholarship grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program. It built the largest and finest academic library in the world and built up the labs and clinics needed to establish the reputation of its science departments and the [[Harvard Medical School|Medical School]]. The [[Harvard Law School|Law School]] vied with Yale Law for preeminence, while the [[Harvard Business School|Business School]] combined a large-scale research program with a special appeal to entrepreneurs rather than accountants. The different schools maintain their separate endowments, which are very large in the case of the College/Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the Business, Law and Medical Schools, but quite modest for the Divinity and Education schools.

[[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In the 1920s [[Edward Harkness]] (1874–1940), a Yale man with oil wealth, was ignored by his alma mater and so gave  $12,000,000 to Harvard to establish a house system like that of Oxford University. Yale later took his money and set up a similar system.

In addition to the usual department, specialized research centers proliferated, especially to enable interdisciplinary research projects that could not be handled at the department level. However, the departments kept jealous control of the awarding of tenure; typically tenured professorships went to outsiders, and not as promotions to assistant professors. Older research centers include the East Asian Research Center, the Center for International Affairs, the Center for Eastern Studies, the Russian Research Center, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History and the Joint Center for Urban Studies (with [[MIT]]). The Centers raised their own money, sometimes from endowments, but most often from federal and foundation grants, making them increasingly independent entities.&lt;ref&gt;Morton Keller and Phyllis Keller. ''Making Harvard Modern: The Rise of America's University'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Harvard was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="navalyearbooks-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/yearbooks.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709093742/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/yearbooks.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 9, 2006 |title=Naval Training and Education Yearbooks in the Navy Department Library |publisher=Department of the Navy |last= |first= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual undergraduate tuition was $300 in the 1920s and $400 in the 1930s, doubling to $800 in 1953. It reached $2,600 in 1970 and $22,700 in 2000.&lt;ref name="Oxford UP"/&gt;

=== Meritocracy ===
[[James Bryant Conant]] (president, 1933–1953) pledged to reinvigorate creative scholarship at Harvard and reestablish its preeminence among research institutions. Viewing higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, Conant decided that Harvard's undergraduate curriculum needed to be revised so as to place more emphasis on general education and called on the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Fay Kravitz, "The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography", Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades immediately after 1945, Harvard reformed its admissions policies as it sought students from a more diverse applicant pool. Whereas Harvard undergraduates had almost exclusively been upper-class alumni of select New England "feeder schools" such as [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Exeter]], [[Hotchkiss School|Hotchkiss]], [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] and [[Milton Academy]], increasing numbers of international, minority and working-class students had by the late 1960s altered the ethnic and socio-economic makeup of the college.&lt;ref&gt;Malka A. Older. (1996). [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=217911 Preparatory schools and the admissions process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911160531/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=217911 |date=September 11, 2009 }}. [[The Harvard Crimson]], January 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Not just undergraduates, but the faculty became more diverse, especially in its willingness to hire Jews, Catholics and foreign scholars. The History Department was among the first to hire Jews and how it contributed to the university trend toward professionalism from 1920 to 1950. [[Oscar Handlin]] became one of the most influential professors, training hundreds of graduate schools and later serving as head of the University Library.&lt;ref&gt;William Palmer, " Gentlemen and Scholars: Harvard's History Department and the Path to Professionalism, 1920–1950," ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts,'' Spring 2009, Vol. 37 Issue 1, pp 107-121&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program.

=== Women ===
In 1945, [[Harvard Medical School]] admitted its first class of women after a special committee concluded that male students would benefit from learning to view women as equals, that the lower-paid specialties typically shunned by men would benefit from the talents of women doctors and that the weakest third of each entering class of men could be replaced by a superior group of women.&lt;ref name="First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945"&gt;{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its first fifty years the undergraduate [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as the "Harvard Annex for Women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Schwager |chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe |title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History |editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (ed.) |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2004 |isbn=1-4039-6098-4 |pages=87–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid Harvard faculty to repeat their lectures for a female audience. During World War II, male and female undergraduates attended classes together for the first time, though it was many decades{{clarify|date=April 2014}} before the population of Radcliffe College reached parity with that of Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. (2004). [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/04/01/in_first_harvard_admits_more_women_than_men_as_undergraduates?mode=PF In first, Harvard admits more women than men as undergraduates] {{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. [[The Boston Globe]], April 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, two agreements between Harvard and Radcliffe made Harvard responsible for essentially all undergraduate matters for women – including admissions, advising, instruction, housing, student life and athletics – though women were still formally admitted to and graduated from Radcliffe until a final merger in 1999 made Radcliffe a part of Harvard, at the same time creating the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard |publisher= |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Lawrence Summers]] resigned his presidency after suggesting that women's underrepresentation in top science positions could be due to differences in "intrinsic aptitude".

In 1984, Harvard severed ties with undergraduate "[[final clubs]]" because of their refusal to admit women. As of 2016, Harvard bars members of single-sex organizations (such as final clubs, fraternities and sororities) from campus leadership positions such as team captaincies and from receiving recommendation letters from Harvard requisite for scholarships and fellowships such as the [[Marshall Scholarship]] and [[Rhodes Scholarship]].&lt;ref name=NYT2016&gt;Stephanie Saul.

=== Minorities ===

Though Harvard ended required chapel in the mid-1880s, the school remained culturally Protestant and fears of dilution grew as enrollment of immigrants, Catholics and Jews surged at the turn of the 20th century. By 1908, Catholics made up nine percent of the freshman class and between 1906 and 1922 Jewish enrollment at Harvard increased from six to 25%. President [[A. Lawrence Lowell]] tried to impose a 12% quota on Jews, but the faculty rejected it even though he managed to cut the numbers in half anyway. By the end of World War II, the quotas and most of the latent antisemitism had faded away.&lt;ref&gt;Morton Keller and Phyllis Keller, ''Making Harvard Modern: The Rise of America's University'' (2001) p. 48-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Synnott |first= Marcia G. |year= 2004 |chapter= The Changing 'Harvard Student': Ethnicity, Race, and Gender |chapterurl= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4669676 |editor= Laurel Ulrich |title= Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4662764 |location= New York |publisher= [[Palgrave Macmillan]] |pages= 195–214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies of exclusion were not limited to religious minorities. In 1920, "Harvard University maliciously persecuted and harassed" those it believed to be gay via a "[[Secret Court of 1920 (Harvard)|Secret Court]]" led by President Lowell. Summoned at the behest of a wealthy alumnus, the inquisitions and expulsions carried out by this tribunal, in conjunction with the "vindictive tenacity of the university in ensuring that the stigmatization of the expelled students would persist throughout their productive lives" led to two suicides. Harvard President [[Lawrence Summers]] characterized the 1920 episode as "part of a past that we have rightly left behind" and "abhorrent and an affront to the values of our university".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Wright (author)|Wright, W.]] (2005). ''Harvard's Secret Court: The Savage 1920 Purge of Campus Homosexuals'', St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-32271-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1950s, Wilbur Bender, then the dean of admissions for Harvard College, was seeking better ways to "detect homosexual tendencies and serious psychiatric problems" in prospective students.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gladwell. (2005).

The '''French Institute in Nigeria''' (in French: '''Institut français du Nigéria''') (IFN) is part of the worldwide organisation of [[Institut Français|Instituts français]] ([[French Institutes]]). The [[Abuja]] institute is the only in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifmapp.institutfrancais.com/les-if-dans-le-monde#f1_2305_1-NIGERIA&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educative role == 
The primary goal of the institute is to provide [[French language|French]] lessons, courses and examinations for children, students and professionals alike.&lt;ref&gt;https://hotels.ng/places/abuja/696-institut-fran%C3%83%C2%A7ais-du-nigeria&lt;/ref&gt;

This institute counts over 2000 students every year, from various backgrounds. The IFN is also accredited to deliver international language certifications like: [[DELF]], [[DALF]], [[Test de connaissance du français|TCF]], [[DELF Prim]], [[DELF Junior]] and the [[TCF Québec]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutfrancais-nigeria.com/category/abuja-fr/langue-francaise/?lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural activities == 
The institute’s [[cultural center]] participates actively to the local and national art scene, by organising hundreds of cultural events every year, on a local, regional or national basis. 
It also participates to external events, within the promotion of friendly ties between [[France]] and other [[francophone countries]] and [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutfrancais-nigeria.com/category/abuja-fr/culture/programmes-interculturels/?lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these events, the center offers regular classes in: [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[singing]], [[dance]] and [[theatre]] and [[visual arts]] lessons.

== General information == 
The IFN shelters a [[media hub]] and a [[library]] with over 1000 francophone documents accessible to the wider audience, as well as an online ‘[[culturethèque]]’ (online cultural library) proposing an additional couple of thousands of documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutfrancais-nigeria.com/category/abuja-fr/mediatheque/presentation-fr/?lang=fr&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM)''' is an international scientific conference devoted to all aspects of [[composite materials]]. The list of topics includes manufacturing, mechanics, fracture and damage, fatigue, design of components and structures, impact behavior, experimental methods.

== History ==
The conference was initiated by the Metallurgical Society of [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|AIME]]. The first conference was held in 1975 simultaneously in [[Geneva]] and [[Boston]] and was rather small. The second conference, ICCM-2, held in 1978 in [[Toronto]], Canada, gathered around 300 delegates. Official welcome was given by Frank Thurston, Director of the National Aeronautical Establishment, Ottawa; the key address was given by [[Alan Lovelace]] from [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=L.N.|last2=Warren|first2=R.|title=ICCM 2|journal=Composites|date=October 1978|volume=9|issue=4|pages=224–226|doi=10.1016/0010-4361(78)90169-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISFiT - The International Student Festival in Trondheim, Norway''' is the world's largest student festival with a thematic emphasis.&lt;ref name="Norway.org"&gt;[http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/Education/educationnews/Delta_ISFit09_en/ Norway.org: Sign up for the International Student Festival in Trondheim 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 450 students from all over the world attend the festival.&lt;ref name="What is ISFiT?"&gt;[http://www.isfit.org/about/pages/7 ISFiT homepage: What is ISFiT?]&lt;/ref&gt; The themes change with each festival, but have always been related to social and political topics with international relevance.

The stated purpose of ISFiT is to be ''a meeting place for discussion and debate, an arena where ideas are born, friendships are made and valuable lessons are learned.''&lt;ref name="What is ISFiT?" /&gt; The festival aims at fostering inspiration and being a starting point for international cooperation amongst students. ISFiT is a non-profit festival.&lt;ref name="What is ISFiT?" /&gt;

The ISFiT participants take part in different workshops, which highlight the festival theme in various ways. Several lectures and thematic meetings are arranged, where well-known international speakers share their views with the participants and others.

ISFiT has been arranged in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]] every second year since 1990. More than 450 students work voluntarily in order to organize the festival. The president for the festival in 2019 is Tyler Stewart.

== History ==
The idea of an international student festival in Trondheim came to life in 1988. The thought was to gather students from different parts of the world in a combination of a conference and a festival.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.isfit.org/about/pages/4 ISFiT homepage: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of ISFiT 1990 was "A Changing Europe -- What are the Roles and Responsibilities of the Students and their Universities?," a timely theme, considering that the [[Berlin Wall]] fell shortly before the festival was held. [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] opened the festival. ISFiT arranged for two trains, one from Budapest and one from Paris, to transport 375 students from all over Europe to Trondheim. For many of the participants, this was their first visit outside the Iron Curtain. This train ride has later been called "The ISFiT Rail". 

In 1992, ISFiT had already established its name in the world. More than 4,300 applications were addressed to Trondheim from students all over the world. Norwegian Minister of Education and Research [[Gudmund Hernes]] opened the festival.

In 1994, [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] visited ISFiT after he had received a visit from dedicated ISFiT representatives, who went to India and spent days outside his office until they got a 10-minute meeting with him. He was reported to have replied, "Cancel my other appointments. This is more important." &lt;ref name="Sien Quarterly"&gt;[http://www.sienquarterly.icwip.hu/htmls/download/magazine/sienq_9.pdf Sien Quarterly: How Students from Trondheim Convinced the Dalai Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814223930/http://sienquarterly.icwip.hu/htmls/download/magazine/sienq_9.pdf |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalai Lama"&gt;[http://www.underdusken.no/dusker/html/9702/isfit.html Under Dusken: ISFiT-97 like om hjørnet]&lt;/ref&gt; 1994 was also the year that ISFiT started to offer financial support, so that participants from even more countries could come to the festival. The Dalai Lama visited the Festival for the second time in 2015. &lt;ref name="AlphaGamma"&gt; [http://www.alphagamma.eu/entrepreneurship/3-business-lessons-from-the-dalai-lama/ "3 Business Lessons from the Dalai Lama | AlphaGamma"], February 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dialogue Groups were first introduced in 1997. Since then, the Dialogue Groups have been a seminar where participants from different sides of a conflict get to meet at neutral ground to share their experiences and discuss possible solutions to the conflict.

In 1999 The [[Student Peace Prize]] was awarded for the first time. Since then, the prize has been given every second year on behalf of all Norwegian students. Antero Benedito da Silva from [[East Timor]] was the first laureate. He received the award for his non-violent battle against the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian occupation]].

Many world figures have attended ISFiT, and past speakers include former Director-General of WHO Dr [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] and Nobel Peace Prize Laureates [[José Ramos-Horta]], [[Wangari Maathai]],&lt;ref name="Wangari Maathai"&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2006/10/05/478840.html Dagbladet.no: Studentfestival vil ha Chavez til Trondheim]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref name="Tutu"&gt;[http://fromparriswithlove.com/2010/04/desmond-tutu/ Vision of a Cleric – Desmond Tutu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430004259/http://fromparriswithlove.com/2010/04/desmond-tutu/ |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]]&lt;ref name="Betty Williams"&gt;[http://www.stv.no/content/webitem/640/ STV: ISFiT 2009 - "Everybodys Business"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shirin Ebadi]].&lt;ref name="Ebadi"&gt;[http://www.stv.no/content/webitem/639/ STV: ISFiT 2009 - "Empowering Women"]&lt;/ref&gt; Former US president [[Bill Clinton]] has participated via video conference.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton speaking of the importance of the International Student Festival in Trondheim"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rEWdKCsyjM YouTube: Bill Clinton speaking of the importance of the International Student Festival in Trondheim]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, the festival has had participants from more than a hundred countries.&lt;ref name="Under Dusken"&gt;[http://www.underdusken.no/resources/archive/2003/8-2003.pdf Under Dusken: Asylsøkere misbruker ISFiT]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
ISfIT 2013 was a student festival held from February 7 to February 17, 2013, in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]]. 

On April 6, 2011 a plenary session was held at the [[Student Society in Trondheim]] to elect the President for the upcoming festival in 2013. Several pre-announced candidates ran for president and presented what they believed should be the main of ISFiT 2013; among them were Guro Grytli Seim (Energy), Marianne Ytterbø (Technology) and [[Kaja Juul Skarbø]] (Trade).&lt;ref name="Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem"&gt;[http://www.samfundet.no/upload/documents/styret/Beslutningsprotokoll%202010-2011.pdf#page=61 Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem: Beslutningsprotokoll 2010 - 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Juul Skarbø and Grytli Seim were the remaining candidates after the preliminary rounds, and Juul Skarbø won in the end with 110 votes to 101, making ''Trade'' the main theme for ISFiT 2013.&lt;ref name="Under Dusken1"&gt;[http://www.underdusken.no/nyhet/2011/6/1514044/%E2%80%93+forelsket+i+isfit Under Dusken: – Forelsket i ISFiT]&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate Juul Skarbø emphasized trade as a mean for social and economic development, but also as an obstacle for development. She pointed to power structures, sustainability, ethics and human trafficking as interesting approaches to the theme.&lt;ref name="Adresseavisen1"&gt;[http://www.adressa.no/student/article1616064.ece Adresseavisen: Kaja skal styre Isfit-skuta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for ISFiT 2013, Global [[Trade]], covered many different areas of human activity. Juul Skarbø proposed topics as diverse as finance, economies of war, subsidies, human trafficking and local and global markets, for some of the workshops during the festival.&lt;ref name="ISFiT1"&gt;[http://www.isfit.org/news/articles/150 ISFiT.org: ISFiT-president 2013: Kaja Juul Skarbø]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISFiT 2013 defined trade as legal and illegal exchange of goods, services, labour, capital and financial instruments. By this definition, international trade encompasses issues that are both the reason for, and the consequences of, such exchanges. They discussed solutions to global trade issues in a long-term perspective. ISFiT 2013 also want to create a constructive debate and dialogue across ideological and national boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The theme was discussed in the workshops, at plenary sessions and under the event ISFiT open. They want to put a spotlight on issues like: Do students have the power to change a political regime? Who dominate the global market, and why? Is there a limit for what we can buy or sell? What is the reason for starvation when tons of food are thrown away in the western countries? Can consumption be a way to communicate and express our cultural identity and values? Is mixing business and social development the future?

As president, Juul Skarbø elected the following as members of the board:&lt;ref name="ISFiT2"&gt;[http://www.isfit.org/news/articles/156 ISFiT.org: Styret for ISFiT-2013 er klart!]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Yvonne Fadnes: Head of Administration
* Martin Gulseth: Head of Culture
* Victoria Nash: Head of Economy
* Elise Djupedal: Head of Theme
* Therese Høstad: Head of Student Peace Prize
* Christine Berntzen: Board Member
* Marte Helland: Organization Secretary

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12184">'''Invest in US''' is an [[early childhood education]] initiative and public awareness campaign spearheaded by the [[bi-partisan]], [[non-profit]] First Five Years Fund and funded by foundations, corporations, and individuals. The initiative works to expand high quality early childhood programs and research, as well as to offer resources to community leaders working to increase access to early learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/10/white-house-announces-1-billion-in-early-education-funding|title=Obama Administration To Expand Early Head Start|website=US News &amp; World Report|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== White House summit on early education ==
On December 10, 2014, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] held the White House Summit on Early Education, attended by officials representing school districts and state and local governments, corporate and community leaders, and other advocates for supporting early education in the U.S. 

At the event, the president unveiled the Invest in US initiative, created in partnership with the First Five Years Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last Year Was Big For Early Childhood Education Funding. What Lies Ahead for 2015? - Inside Philanthropy: Fundraising Intelligence - Inside Philanthropy|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2015/1/2/last-year-was-big-for-early-childhood-education-funding-what.html|website = www.insidephilanthropy.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative’s goal is to expand programs, research, and funding for high quality early childhood education. This public-private partnership initially generated $333 million in philanthropic commitments from corporations, foundations, and individuals (total commitments increased to just over $340 million by December 2015). More than $750 million in federal funding for early learning programs through the Preschool Development Grants and Early Head Start-Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnerships were also announced to support early learning for over 63,000 additional children across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Invest in Us,' and Our Parents, Too|url = http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/invest-in-us-and-our-parents-too/?_r=0|website = Motherlode Blog|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the $750 million total, $250 million was awarded in [[United States Department of Education|Education Department]] grants to these 18 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. And $500 million in funding from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Department]] is going to more than 40 states to expand [[Early Head Start Program|Early Head Start]] and [[child care]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obama announces $1 billion investment for early childhood education {{!}} PBS NewsHour|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-announcing-1-billion-investment-early-childhood-education/|website = PBS NewsHour |accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invest in US and federal funding combined targeted more than $1 billion in funding for early childhood education. Though praised by early learning advocates, the funding was noted by several sources to be far short of the $75 billion, 10-year investment in preschool that President Obama had previously proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Advocates Cheer White House Spending on Early-Ed.|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/12/22/advocates-cheer-white-house-spending-on-early-ed.html|website = Education Week|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Obama Announces $1 Billion in Early-Education Funding|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-expected-to-announce-early-education-campaign-1418209202|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0099-9660|first = Caroline Porter And Byron|last = Tau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ROI of expanded early learning opportunities ==
The White House made the case that increasing access to high-quality early learning opportunities would not only benefit those children reached but [[American society]] generally and that early learning programs actually pay for themselves over time. In a conference call with reporters the day before the White House Summit, Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] made the case for investing in early education, citing research from [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[economist]] [[James Heckman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UChicago Economist James Heckman’s Research Helps Shape Early Education Policy {{!}} Division of the Social Sciences|url = https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-economist-james-heckman%E2%80%99s-research-helps-shape-early-education-policy|website = socialsciences.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that showed that every dollar invested in high-quality preschool and other early learning opportunities can generate an $7 [[Return on investment|ROI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = President Obama to announce $1 billion in funding for preschool (+video)|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2014/1210/President-Obama-to-announce-1-billion-in-funding-for-preschool-video|newspaper = Christian Science Monitor|access-date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0882-7729|first = Amanda|last = Paulson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invest in US fact sheet released by the White House on the day of the summit increased that 7-to-1 ROI projection, stating that expanding early learning initiatives should provide benefits to society of around $8.60 for every $1 spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FACT SHEET: Invest in US: The White House Summit on Early Childhood Education|url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/10/fact-sheet-invest-us-white-house-summit-early-childhood-education|website = whitehouse.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Largest corporate and foundation supporters ==
Corporations and foundations pledging $10 million or more to support the Invest in US initiative included [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation, the [[The Kresge Foundation|Kresge Foundation]], the George Kaiser Family Foundation, [[PBS]] and the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the [[Buffett Early Childhood Fund]], the Trust for Learning, [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], the David and Laura Merage Foundation, the Greater Cleveland Community Effort, the [[William Penn Foundation]], the Bainum Family Foundation, and [[ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy|Age of Learning, Inc. / ABCmouse.com]].&lt;ref name=IIUwebsite &gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - Invest In Us|url = https://investinus.org/#investments|website = Invest In Us|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communities and states ==
In addition to the organizations and individuals who pledged financial support for Invest in US, 22 communities and states committed to making early childhood programs a policy priority, and over 40 advocacy organizations announced ongoing support of the initiative. Cities supporting the initiative included Boston, Chicago Cleveland, Denver, New York City, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Tulsa; states included Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.&lt;ref name=IIUwebsite /&gt;

== Key organizations ==

The initiative also identified 10 organizations that would continue to help funders with early learning planning grants, technical assistance, communities, and resources: [[Alliance for Early Success]], BUILD, Early Childhood Funders Collaborative, Early Childhood-LINC, [[National Association of Counties]], [[National Governors Association]], National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), [[National League of Cities]], The Ounce of Prevention Fund, and the [[United States Conference of Mayors|U.S. Conference of Mayors]].&lt;ref name=IIUwebsite /&gt;

== Follow up events and announcements ==
On March 30, 2015, Invest in US partner Houghton Mifflin Harcourt launched a series of quarterly symposia, called Conversations in Early Learning, to promote collaboration within the early education community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Convenes Key Stakeholders to Advance National Dialogue on Early Education; Launches Conversations in Early Learning Symposium Series {{!}} Business Wire|url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150330005875/en/Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Convenes-Key-Stakeholders-Advance|website = www.businesswire.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15–16, the 2015 ECEC Invest in US Forum was held in Washington, D.C., “to amplify the voice of high-quality taxpaying and non-profit community early care and education providers” and to hold “discussions of policy issues impacting the provider community.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ececonsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Invest-In-Us-Forum-Summary.pdf|title = 2015 ECEC Invest In Us Forum|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = December 23, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2015, Invest in US and other partners announced a new $100 million loan fund to pay for early childhood education providers’ classroom renovations and other infrastructure improvements that they project will benefit 36,000 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Construction Loan Fund to Benefit Early-Childhood Classrooms|url = http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/early_years/2015/09/new_construction_loan_fund_to_benefit_early_childhood_classrooms.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|website = Education Week - Early Years|accessdate = 2015-12-24|first = Christina|last = Samuels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2015 event was held in Washington, D.C. to commemorated the first anniversary of the 2014 White House summit on early childhood education and to announce a related program, the Early Childhood Innovation Network. At the event, [[Valerie Jarrett]], President Obama’s senior advisor, spoke about the first year of Invest in US: “Invest in US has continued to press for more children to have this very important access to early education and we’ve been holding webinars and filming PSAs and meeting with stakeholders from all across the country, and we have just done tremendous work, but we want to keep leading and we want to get everyone engaged.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = White House, Georgetown Announce Early Childhood Innovation Network|url = http://gumc.georgetown.edu/news/White-House-Georgetown-Announce-Early-Childhood-Innovation-Network|website = gumc.georgetown.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Senior Administration Officials Commemorates 1-Year Anniversary of White House Summit on Early Childhood Education|url = http://ffyf.org/senior-administration-officials-to-commemorate-1-year-anniversary-of-white-house-summit-on-early-childhood-education/|website = First Five Years Fund|accessdate = 2015-12-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, the [[Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts]] announced it would become the latest partner in the Invest in US campaign, pledging more than $1 million for early childhood education in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts Commits $1 Million to Early Childhood Education, Joining the Invest in US Coalition|url = http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/12/16/796152/10158584/en/Wolf-Trap-Foundation-for-the-Performing-Arts-Commits-1-Million-to-Early-Childhood-Education-Joining-the-Invest-in-US-Coalition.html|website = GlobeNewswire News Room|accessdate = 2015-12-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KXSC''' (1560 AM)  is the student-run [[college radio]] station at the [[University of Southern California]]. Listeners can tune in via the internet at [http://KXSC.org/listen/ KXSC.org/listen], and at 1560 AM in the area immediately surrounding USC's campus. KXSC provides original programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The station also provides students with the opportunity to work at a [[college radio]] station and learn the basics of the music industry.

KXSC—over 200 members—is entirely composed of student volunteers. KXSC is made up of 34 staff members,&lt;ref&gt;http://kxsc.org/contact/&lt;/ref&gt; around 70 DJs, and over 100 interns. A General Manager oversees six main departments: programming, music, concerts, promotions, operations, and sales. In addition to working for one or more of these departments, staff members must work at least two hours per week in the studio during their scheduled office hours.

==History==
KXSC traces its roots to the original KUSC, which was operated by students starting in 1946. Eventually, KUSC transitioned to classical programming and moved off-campus in the mid-1970s.

In 1975, a group of students reacted to renewed demand for student-run radio at USC and founded KSCR, a [[carrier-current]] station broadcasting at 1560AM out of the Hancock Foundation Building. Eventually, due to equipment failures, the University authorized a grant to move KSCR to a new location in Marks Hall and construct new, state-of-the-art studios. In 1984, KSCR transitioned the carrier-current broadcast to its new studios.

The station was incorporated under USC Student Senate in 1988 thanks to an outpouring of student support. New funds enabled new studio upgrades, and a new logo "SC-53" was adopted to signify a new beginning. Then, starting in late 1990, KSCR started broadcasting through downtown's then-dominant cable provider, Continental Cablevision, as the background audio to their programming guide channel 37. A change in station branding to "The Underground" commemorated this change and the station's new focus on [[independent music]]. In 1991, KSCR began broadcasting a low-power FM signal in the downtown Los Angeles and USC campus area at 104.7&amp;nbsp;MHz FM. For a period, this allowed the station to have an unprecedented simulcast of 104.7FM/530AM/Cable Channel 37. Believing that 1980s' style new wave and modern rock music was stale and feeling that the budding [[grunge]] sound of alternative music was already served by many area stations, KSCR's general manager that same year controversially switched the station's daytime programming to the nation's first electronica/techno format, predating the launch of the area's 103.1 MARS-FM, which would be the country's first commercial electronica format. KSCR called its format "The Pulse of the 90's" and it survived even past MARS-FM's demise. KSCR then received significant press attention when it turned over its airwaves to nearly all the former MARS-FM on-air personalities to host a special "MARS Day" to acknowledge that station's major role in creating and defining the Southern California rave culture. The KSCR general manager who created the "Pulse" format went on to launch the dance/techno-formatted RENEGADE RADIO at [[KWIZ]] 96.7FM in 1993, and feeling that format was now being served, KSCR's management switched the student station back to "The Underground" branding and an alternative rock format.

KSCR eventually was forced to cease broadcasting its 104.7FM signal after the commercial station broadcasting at that frequency in an outlying area complained of signal interference. The station began [[webcast]]ing in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-18935129.html|title=Student-run radio station finds web success after FCC shutdown|last=Stello|first=Sharron|date= December 9, 1998 |work=University Wire|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, KSCR broadcast online through a USC [[Server (computing)|server]] using [[RealAudio]]. This made the station's programming available to a worldwide audience. The station's slogan changed to "revolutionary radio" to commemorate the renewed student interest in KSCR thanks to its new online technology.

In 2010, KSCR adopted the call letters KXSC in order to be eligible to obtain a new FM license from the FCC. The station can now be found in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on the USC campus.

==Programming==
One of KXSC's greatest assets is its live programming. KXSC streams 50+ hours of live programming a week with a variety of show types including music, sports, news, and special programming.&lt;ref&gt;http://kxsc.org/schedule/&lt;/ref&gt; KXSC now broadcasts over-the-air in [[downtown Los Angeles]] at 1560&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Amplitude modulation|AM]], and offers two online streams using its own servers. KXSC's live stream can be listened to on the [http://kxsc.org/listen/ KXSC Pop-Up Player].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51036">'''Peacebuilding''' is an intervention technique or method that is designed to prevent the start or resumption of violent conflict by creating a sustainable [[peace]]. Peacebuilding activities address the root causes or potential causes of violence, create a societal expectation for peaceful conflict resolution, and stabilize society politically and socioeconomically.

The activities included in peacebuilding vary depending on the situation and the agent of peacebuilding. Successful peacebuilding activities create an environment supportive of self-sustaining, durable peace; reconcile opponents; prevent conflict from restarting; integrate civil society; create [[rule of law]] mechanisms; and address underlying structural and societal issues. Researchers and practitioners also increasingly find that peacebuilding is most effective and durable when it relies upon local conceptions of peace and the underlying dynamics which foster or enable conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coning | first1 = C | year = 2013 | title = Understanding Peacebuilding as Essentially Local | url = | journal = Stability: International Journal of Security and Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 6 | doi = 10.5334/sta.as }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The exact definition varies depending on the actor, with some definitions specifying what activities fall within the scope of peacebuilding or restricting peacebuilding to post-conflict interventions.

Even if peacebuilding has remained a largely amorphous concept without clear guidelines or goals,&lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = 454654 | first1 = Jennifer M. | year = 2007 | title = Can Peacekeepers Be Peacebuilders? | url = | journal = International Peacekeeping | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 323–338 | doi = 10.1080/13533310701422901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; common to all definitions is the agreement that improving [[human security]] is the central task of peacebuilding.&amp;nbsp;In this sense, peacebuilding includes a wide range of efforts by diverse actors in government and civil society at the community, national, and international levels to address the root causes of violence and ensure civilians have freedom from fear (negative peace), freedom from want (positive peace) and freedom from humiliation before, during, and after violent conflict.  &amp;nbsp;

Although many of peacebuilding's aims overlap with those of peacemaking, peacekeeping and conflict resolution, it is a distinct idea. [[Peacemaking]] involves stopping an ongoing conflict, whereas peacebuilding happens before a conflict starts or once it ends. [[Peacekeeping]] prevents the resumption of fighting following a conflict; it does not address the underlying causes of violence or work to create societal change, as peacebuilding does. Peacekeeping also differs from peacebuilding in that it only occurs after conflict ends, not before it begins. [[Conflict resolution]] does not include some components of peacebuilding, such as state building and socioeconomic development.

In 2007, the [[UN Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General's]] Policy Committee defined peacebuilding as follows: "Peacebuilding involves a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and [[sustainable development]]. Peacebuilding strategies must be coherent and tailored to specific needs of the country concerned, based on national ownership, and should comprise a carefully prioritized, sequenced, and therefore relatively narrow set of activities aimed at achieving the above objectives."&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt;

==Approaches to peacebuilding==

There are two broad approaches to peacebuilding.

First, peacebuilding can refer to ''direct work'' that intentionally focuses on addressing the factors driving or mitigating conflict.  When applying the term "peacebuilding" to this work, there is an explicit attempt by those designing and planning a peacebuilding effort to reduce structural or direct violence.

Second, the term peacebuilding can also refer to efforts to coordinate a multi-level, multisectoral strategy, including ensuring that there is funding and proper communication and coordination mechanisms between humanitarian assistance, development, governance, security, justice and other sectors that may not use the term "peacebuilding" to describe themselves. The concept is not one to impose on specific sectors. Rather some scholars use the term peacebuilding as an overarching concept useful for describing a range of interrelated efforts.

While some use the term to refer to only post-conflict or post-war contexts, most use the term more broadly to refer to any stage of conflict. Before conflict becomes violent, preventive peacebuilding efforts, such as diplomatic, economic development, social, educational, health, legal and security sector reform programs, address potential sources of instability and violence. This is also termed conflict prevention. Peacebuilding efforts aim to manage, mitigate, resolve and transform central aspects of the conflict through official diplomacy; as well as through civil society peace processes and informal dialogue, negotiation, and mediation. Peacebuilding addresses economic, social and political root causes of violence and fosters reconciliation to prevent the return of [[structural violence|structural]] and direct violence. Peacebuilding efforts aim to change beliefs, attitudes and behaviors to transform the short and long term dynamics between individuals and groups toward a more stable, peaceful coexistence.&amp;nbsp;Peacebuilding is an approach to an entire set of interrelated efforts that support peace.

==History==

In the 1970s, Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] first created the term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems that would create sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt; Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist [[John Paul Lederach]] proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Keating XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

Peacebuilding has since expanded to include many different dimensions, such as [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration|disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]] and rebuilding governmental, economic and civil society institutions.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding and the UN" /&gt; The concept was popularized in the international community through UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]]'s 1992 report [[An Agenda for Peace]]. The report defined post-conflict peacebuilding as an “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict"&lt;ref name="Agenda for Peace" /&gt; At the [[2005 World Summit]], the [[United Nations]] began creating a peacebuilding architecture based on [[Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan's]] proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 36&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal called for three organizations: the [[Peacebuilding Commission|UN Peacebuilding Commission]], which was founded in 2005; the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Fund|UN Peacebuilding Fund]], founded in 2006; and the UN Peacebuilding Support Office, which was created in 2005. These three organizations enable the Secretary-General to coordinate the UN's peacebuilding efforts.&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt; National governments' interest in the topic has also increased due to fears that [[failed states]] serve as breeding grounds for conflict and extremism and thus threaten international security. Some states have begun to view peacebuilding as a way to demonstrate their relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, peacebuilding activities continue to account for small percentages of states' budgets.&lt;ref name="Barnett 53"&gt;Barnett 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marshall Plan]] was a long-term postconflict peacebuilding intervention in Europe with which the United States aimed to rebuild the continent following the destruction of World War II. The Plan successfully promoted economic development in the areas it funded.&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 92, 101&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, peacebuilding has been implemented in postconflict situations in countries including [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Cyprus]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of peacebuilding==
The activities included in peacebuilding vary depending on the situation and the agent of peacebuilding. Successful peacebuilding activities create an environment supportive of self-sustaining, durable peace; reconcile opponents; prevent conflict from restarting; integrate civil society; create rule of law mechanisms; and address underlying structural and societal issues. To accomplish these goals, peacebuilding must address functional structures, emotional conditions and social psychology, social stability, rule of law and ethics, and cultural sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding" /&gt;

Preconflict peacebuilding interventions aim to prevent the start of violent conflict.&lt;ref name="Keating XXXVII"&gt;Keating XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies involve a variety of actors and sectors in order to transform the conflict.&lt;ref name="Sandole 13-14"&gt;Sandole 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the definition of peacebuilding includes preconflict interventions, in practice most peacebuilding interventions are postconflict.&lt;ref&gt;Sandole 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, many peacebuilding scholars advocate an increased focus on preconflict peacebuilding in the future.&lt;ref name="Keating XXXVII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandole 13-14"/&gt;

There are many different approaches to categorization of forms of peacebuilding among the peacebuilding field's many scholars.

Barnett ''et al.'' divides postconflict peacebuilding into three dimensions: stabilizing the post-conflict zone, restoring state institutions, and dealing with social and economic issues. Activities within the first dimension reinforce state stability post-conflict and discourage former combatants from returning to war ([[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration|disarmament, demobilization and reintegration]], or DDR). Second dimension activities build state capacity to provide basic public goods and increase state legitimacy. Programs in the third dimension build a post-conflict society's ability to manage conflicts peacefully and promote socioeconomic development.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett et al 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of locally and internationally focused components is key to building a long-term sustainable peace.&lt;ref name="Peacebuilding" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 212&lt;/ref&gt; Mac Ginty says that while different "indigenous" communities utilize different conflict resolution techniques, most of them share the common characteristics described in the table below. Since indigenous peacebuilding practices arise from local communities, they are tailored to local context and culture in a way that generalized international peacebuilding approaches are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mac Ginty | first1 = R | year = 2012 | title = Against Stabilization | url = | journal = Stability: International Journal of Security and Development | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 20–30 | doi = 10.5334/sta.ab }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major organizations==

===Intergovernmental organizations===
The [[United Nations]] participates in many aspects of peacebuilding, both through the peacebuilding architecture established in 2005-6 and through other agencies.
* Peacebuilding architecture
** [[Peacebuilding Commission|UN Peacebuilding Commission]] (PBC): intergovernmental advisory body&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt; that brings together key actors, gathers resources, advises on strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and highlights issues that might undermine peace.&lt;ref name="PBC Mandate" /&gt;
** [[United Nations Peacebuilding Fund|UN Peacebuilding Fund]] (PBF): supports peacebuilding activities that directly promote post-conflict stabilization and strengthen state and institutional capacity. PBF funding is either given for a maximum of two years immediately following conflict to jumpstart peacebuilding and recovery needs or given for up to three years to create a more structured peacebuilding process.&lt;ref name="PBF how we fund" /&gt;
** UN Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO): supports the Peacebuilding Commission with strategic advice and policy guidance, administers the Peacebuilding Fund and helps the Secretary-General coordinate UN agencies' peacebuilding efforts.&lt;ref name="PBSO about" /&gt;
* Other agencies
**[[Peacebuilding Portal]]: provides information and develops communication networks in the peacebuilding community to build local, national, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations' capacity
**[[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|UN Department of Political Affairs]]: postconflict peacebuilding
**[[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]]: conflict prevention, peacebuilding, postconflict recovery&lt;ref name="Barnett et al. 38"&gt;Barnett et al. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] focus on the economic and financial aspects of peacebuilding. The World Bank assists in post-conflict reconstruction and recovery by helping rebuild society's socioeconomic framework. The International Monetary Fund deals with post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding by acting to restore assets and production levels.&lt;ref name="Barnett et al. 38"/&gt;

The [[European Union|EU]]'s [[European Commission]] describes its peacebuilding activities as conflict prevention and management, and rehabilitation and reconstruction. Conflict prevention and management entails stopping the imminent outbreak of violence and encouraging a broad peace process. Rehabilitation and reconstruction deals with rebuilding the local economy and institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett et al. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission Conflict Prevention and Peace building 2001-2010 was subjected to a major external evaluation conducted by Aide a la Decisions Economique (ADE) with the [[European Centre for Development Policy Management]] which was presented in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;ADE, Thematic Evaluation of European Commission Support to Conflict Prevention and Peace-building, Evaluation for the Evaluation Unit of DEVCO, October 2011, http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/evaluation/evaluation_reports/2011/1291_docs_en.htm&lt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European External Action Service]] created in 2010 also has a specific Division of Conflict Prevention, Peacebuilding and Mediation.

==Role of women==
Women have traditionally played a limited role in peacebuilding processes even though they often bear the responsibility for providing for their families' basic needs in the aftermath of violent conflict. They are especially likely to be unrepresented or underrepresented in negotiations, political decision-making, upper-level policymaking and senior judicial positions. Many societies' [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] cultures prevent them from recognizing the role women can play in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, many peacebuilding academics and the United Nations have recognized that women play a vital role in securing the three pillars of sustainable peace: economic recovery and reconciliation, social cohesion and development and political legitimacy, security and governance.&lt;ref name="Policy Issues" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter 184&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's participation in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan covering the seven commitment areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress on the women, peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women.&lt;ref name="UN Women" /&gt; In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future post-disaster and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.&lt;ref name="Policy Issues" /&gt;

Porter discusses the growing role of female leadership in countries prone to war and its impact on peacebuilding. When the book was written, seven countries prone to violent conflict had female heads of state. [[Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] of [[Chile]] were the first female heads of state from their respective countries and President Johnson-Sirleaf was the first female head of state in Africa. Both women utilized their gender to harness "the power of maternal symbolism - the hope that a woman could best close wounds left on their societies by war and dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;Porter 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing efforts==
[[File:UN Peacebuilding Commission and UN Peacebuilding Fund locations.svg|thumb|right|285px|{{legend|#F8A20C|Ongoing UN PBC and PBF projects&lt;ref name="PBC Homepage" /&gt; }} {{legend|#3CE67B|Ongoing UN PBF projects&lt;ref name="PBF Countries" /&gt;}}]]

The UN Peacebuilding Commission works in [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]&lt;ref name="PBC Homepage" /&gt; and the UN Peacebuilding Fund funds projects in Burundi, Central African Republic, [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Guinea, Guinea Bissau, [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Lebanon]], Liberia, [[Nepal]], [[Niger]], Sierra Leone, [[Somalia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="PBF Countries" /&gt; Other UN organizations are working in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]),&lt;ref&gt;Keating 120&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Iraq]].

The World Bank's [[International Development Association]] maintains the Trust Fund for East Timor in Timor-Leste. The TFET has assisted reconstruction, community empowerment and local governance in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Keating XLII-XLIII&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], the United States has invested $104 billion in reconstruction and relief efforts for the two countries. The [[Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund]] alone received $21 billion during FY2003 and FY2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff 14&lt;/ref&gt; The money came from the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] and included funding for security, health, education, social welfare, governance, economic growth and humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnoff 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil society organisations sometimes even are working on Peacebuilding themselves. This for example is the case in Kenya, according to the magazine [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220704/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation]. After the election riots in Kenya in 2008, civil society organisations started programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future, for instance the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) and peace meetings organised by the church and they supported the National Cohesion and Integration Commission.

==Results==
In 2010, the UNPBC conducted a review of its work with the first four countries on its agenda.&lt;ref name="2010 PBC Report" /&gt; An independent review by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting also highlighted some of the PBC's early successes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer Report" /&gt;

One comprehensive study finds that UN peacebuilding missions significantly increase the likelihood of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Too good to be true? United Nations peacebuilding and the democratization of war-torn states|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/32/5/513|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 513–535|volume = 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0738894214559671|language = en|first = Janina Isabel|last = Steinert|first2 = Sonja|last2 = Grimm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Jennifer Hazen &lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"/&gt; contends there are two major debates relating to peacebuilding; the first centres on the role of the liberal democratic model in designing peacebuilding activities and measuring outcomes and the other one questions the role of third-party actors in peacebuliding.

Regarding the debate about the role of the liberal democratic model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.
Another side contends that liberal democracy might be an insufficient or even inappropriate goal for peacebuilding efforts and that the focus must be on a social transformation to develop non-violent mechanisms of conflict resolution regardless of their form.&lt;ref name="Jennifer M. Hazen 2007"/&gt;

With regards to the role of third-party actors, David Chandler &lt;ref&gt;David Chandler, Empire in Denial: The Politics of State-building, London: Pluto Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; contends that external support creates dependency and undermines local and domestic politics, thus undermining autonomy and the capacity for self-governance and leaving governments weak and dependent on foreign assistance once the third-party actors depart. Since the logic of peacebuilding relies on building and strengthening institutions to alter societal beliefs and behaviour, success relies on the populations' endorsement of these institutions. Any third party attempt at institution building without genuine domestic support will result in hollow institutions - this can lead to a situation in which democratic institutions are established before domestic politics have developed in a liberal, democratic fashion, and an unstable polity.

[[Séverine Autesserre]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Severine|title=Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a different approach, which focuses on the role of everyday practices in peacebuilding. She argue that the foreign peace builders' everyday practices, habits, and narratives strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Autesserre stresses that international peacebuilders do not fully understand the conflicts they are trying to resolve because they rarely include local leaders in decision making, do not speak the local languages, and do not stay posted long enough to oversee effective change. This leaves decision makers out of touch with the key players in the peacebuilding process.

Jeremy Weinstein challenges the assumption that weak and failing states cannot rebuild themselves. He contends that through the process of autonomous recovery, international peacekeeping missions can be unnecessary for recovery because they assume that conflicts cannot be resolved by the country internally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/autonomous-recovery-and-international-intervention-comparative-perspective-working-paper|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective - Working Paper 57|last=Weinstein|first=Jeremy|date=|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=2017-05-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes autonomous recovery as a "process through which countries achieve a lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and postwar political and economic development in the absence of international intervention".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through peace and institutions generated by allowing war to run its natural course, autonomous recovery can be viewed as a success. He claims that war leads to peace by allowing the naturally stronger belligerent gain power, rather than a brokered peace deal that leaves two sides still capable of fighting. Secondly he claims that war provides a competition among providers of public goods until one can control a monopoly. He says that war can create an incentive to create institutions at all levels in order to consolidate power and extract resources from the citizens while also giving some power to the citizens depending upon how much the institutions rely on them for tax revenues.

Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, holds that peacekeeping interventions actually do substantively matter following the end of a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/pkISQ%20offprint.PDF|title=Does Peacekeeping Keep Peace? International Intervention and the Duration of Peace After Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|date=|website=International Studies Quarterly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.

===Implementation===
[[Michael N. Barnett|Barnett]] ''et al.'' criticizes peacebuilding organizations for undertaking supply-driven rather than demand-driven peacebuilding; they provide the peacebuilding services in which their organization specializes, not necessarily those that the recipient most needs.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 48&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that many of their actions are based on organizations precedent rather than empirical analysis of which interventions are and are not effective.&lt;ref name="Barnett 53"/&gt; More recently, Ben Hillman has criticized international donor efforts to strengthen local governments in the wake of conflict. He argues that international donors typically do not have the knowledge, skills or resources to bring meaningful change to the way post-conflict societies are governed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawford.anu.edu.au/pdf/staff/ben_hillman/2013/The-Policymaking-Dimension-of-Post-conflict-governance.pdf {{cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Ben |title= The Policymaking Dimension of Post-Conflict Governance: the Experience of Aceh, Indonesia |journal= Conflict Security and Development |volume=11 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=133–153] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawford.anu.edu.au/pdf/staff/ben_hillman/2013/PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION-REFORM-IN-POST-CONFLICT-SOCIETIES.pdf {{cite journal |last=Hillman |first=Ben |title= Public Administration Reform in Post-Conflict Societies: Lessons from Aceh, Indonesia |journal=Public Administration and Development |volume=33 |year=2012 |pages=1–14] |doi= 10.1002/pad.1643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetuation of cultural hegemony===
Many academics argue that peacebuilding is a manifestation of [[liberal internationalism]] and therefore imposes [[Western Culture|Western]] values and practices onto other cultures. Mac Ginty states that although peacebuilding does not project all aspects of Western culture on to the recipient states, it does transmit some of them, including concepts like [[neoliberalism]] that the West requires recipients of aid to follow more closely than most Western countries do.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty 38&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett also comments that the promotion of liberalization and democratization may undermine the peacebuilding process if security and stable institutions are not pursued concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett 51&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond has shown how 'liberal peacebuilding' represents a political encounter that may produce a post-liberal form of peace. Local and international actors, norms, institutions and interests engage with each other in various different contexts, according to their respective power relations and their different conceptions of legitimate authority structures.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver P Richmond, ''A Post-Liberal Peace'', Routledge, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Koper''' (born 1947) is an American journalist, professor, screenwriter, and producer. He numbers among the original [[Dreamlanders]], the group of actors and artists who worked with independent film maker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] on his early films. He has written for the [[Associated Press]], the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', ''[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. He worked as a staff writer and producer for ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', and has written television for the [[Discovery Channel]], the [[TLC (TV network)|Learning Channel]], [[Paramount Television]] and [[Lorimar Television]]. Koper wrote and co-produced the cult movie ''[[Headless Body in Topless Bar]]'', and wrote the screenplay for ''[[Island of the Dead (2000 film)|Island of the Dead]]''. He has taught at the [[University of the District of Columbia]], and [[Hofstra University]]. Currently, Koper is a contributing writer for the website Splice Today.

==Early life and influences==
Koper was born in 1947 in British-occupied [[Quakenbrück]], [[Germany]], to [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] fighter [[Antoni Koper]] and [[Holocaust]] survivor Sophie Koper. In 1952, his family emigrated to the [[United States]], living first in [[Pacific Grove, California]]. In 1958, the family relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father worked for the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref name=Koper&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koper|first1=Sophie|title=Oral History Interview|url=http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn508494|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of sixteen, Koper attended the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], where he heard [[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]] sing, and heard [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] deliver "[[I Have a Dream]]." Fifty years later, Koper recalled how the crowd had fallen silent as King began to speak, and how his words had made it seem like the struggle for [[civil rights]] could be won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Witnesses to History, 50 Years later|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/23/us/march-on-washington-anniversary-memories.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1965, Koper matriculated at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. There, he co-edited ''[[The Johns Hopkins News-Letter|The News-Letter]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Russ|title=Pictures of You (#3)|url=http://www.splicetoday.com/pop-culture/pictures-of-you-3|website=Splicetoday.com|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Richard Ben Cramer]], a freshman when he began at ''The News-Letter'' in 1967, remembered Koper as a role model, one of the "giants" to whom he hoped he would someday "measure up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Michael|title=From the archives: Richard ben Cramer on life in the bubble|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2013/01/08/richard-ben-cramer-what-it-takes#|website=Hub: News from Johns Hopkins|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still a student, Koper also took his first job as a paid reporter, for the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]''. For "the Afro," Koper covered such historic events as the demonstration to release the group of draft protesters known as the [[Catonsville Nine]]. Later that same day, Koper covered a political rally for [[racial segregation|segregationist]] presidential hopeful [[George Wallace]] inside the [[Baltimore Civic Center]], and the subsequent spontaneous demonstration against Wallace outside. In the confusion, he was caught up in a group of a hundred and fifty demonstrators, whom police dispersed with dogs. Koper was arrested by police, in spite of presenting his press credentials, and charged with "failing to obey a reasonable and lawful request of a police officer." A municipal court judge ultimately dismissed the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=Afro Reporter Jailed at Wallace Civic Center Rally; Reporter nabbed when cops corner singing marchers|work=The Baltimore Afro-American|issue=77 /25|date=8 October 1968|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1969 with a B.A. in the humanities.

==Dreamlander years==

While a student at Johns Hopkins University, Koper lived off-campus in the [[Fell's Point, Baltimore|Fell's Point]] neighborhood of Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Robert|title=Low-Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|date=2011|publisher=Full Page Publishing|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he first met filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] at the Hollywood Bakery, a communal studio and living space founded by [[Vincent Peranio]], a [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] graduate who would serve as production designer for many Waters films. Koper recalls how, in 1968, shortly before Waters  made ''[[Mondo Trasho]]'', the group later known as the [[Dreamlanders]] coalesced from three distinct groups: recent Maryland Institute College of Art alumni, many of whom lived at the Hollywood Bakery, the Johns Hopkins University literary set, including Koper himself, and Waters' friends from Baltimore's suburbs by way of Baltimore's gay scene, including [[Divine (performer)|Divine]].  "We weren't hippies by any stretch of the imagination," Koper remembered. "It was much more like...freaks is what we called ourselves, and it was sort of a coming together of all the misfits and malcontents and juvenile delinquents."&lt;ref name=Waters&gt;{{cite AV media|people = Waters, John|title = John Waters DVD Scrapbook|medium =DVD|publisher = New Line Home Entertainment|date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Koper appeared alongside John Waters, [[Edith Massey]] and other Dreamlander's in ''[[Edith's Shopping Bag]]'', a 1973 documentary Koper helped to direct about Massey's Fells Point thrift store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477423/|title=Edith's Shopping Bag|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After what one contemporary called "several frantic years in Fells Point,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Robert|title=Low-Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|date=2011|publisher=Full Page Publishing|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper sought a quieter life, and purchased a twenty-six acre farm twenty-five miles north of Baltimore in [[Hampstead, Maryland]]. As Waters began production on ''[[Desperate Living]]'', he asked Koper if he could build the sets for the Mortville exteriors there. Koper agreed, on the condition that "every trace of Mortville vanish when filming was completed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=John|title=Shock Value: A Tasteful Book about Bad Taste|date=1981|publisher=Dell Publishing Co., Inc.|isbn=0-440-57871-X|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production designer Vince Peranio was soon constructing a plywood castle and a slum of rubbish along Koper's otherwise bucolic farm lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Chloe|title=Edgewise: A Picture of Cookie Mueller|date=2014|publisher=b_books|isbn=3942214202|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Production manager [[Robert Maier]] recalls the challenges of the location, including flooded dirt roads and limited septic facilities, acknowledging Koper's patience throughout the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Robert|title=Low-Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|date=2011|publisher=Full Page Publishing|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0|pages=116–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper also portrayed one of Queen Carlotta's goons in the film.&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;

When Koper married designer Gina Consoli, then working for artist [[Andy Warhol]] at ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'',&lt;ref name=Gail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dana|first1=Gail|title=A Paige in History|url=http://portlandtribune.com/pt/11-features/120011-a-paige-in-history|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=Portland Tribune|publisher=Pamplin Media|date=10 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters served as best man. Years later, Waters and Koper recounted for Warhol how Waters had hired an old school bus for Koper's bachelor's party, a tour of "every low strip joint in Baltimore." In reply, Warhol asked, "Are there any high strip joints?" The couple were married at a pier rented from the city of Baltimore for fifty dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhol|first1=Andy|last2=Hackett|first2=Pat|title=Andy Warhol's Party Book|date=1988|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-517-56698-2|pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the wedding, much of the party adjourned to Koper's farm in Hampstead for their annual summer croquet tournament.&lt;ref name=Smith1/&gt;

In 1981, Peter and Gina Koper relocated to [[New York City|New York]], where they purchased an unfinished industrial loft on Prince Street in [[Lower Manhattan]], north of [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] and east of [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]]. Cultural commentator [[John Strausbaugh]] described the area at that time as "a no-name wasteland of dark streets prowled by [[Bowery]] winos, [[heroin]] addicts and [[American Mafia|Mafia]] block [[Caporegime|capos]]." Gina told Strausbaugh they called it UhOh, "...as in 'Uh oh we're out of bread.' There was no place to buy groceries. You could walk to some artist's place to buy a $200,000 painting, but you couldn't buy a quart of milk that wasn't sour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Strausbaugh|editor1-last=Marshall|editor1-first=Berman|editor2-last=Brian|editor2-first=Berger|title=New York Calling: From Blackout to Bloomberg|date=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-338-8|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia and journalism==
After his graduation from Johns Hopkins University, Koper covered the police beat for the Associated Press.&lt;ref name=Biskind&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biskind|first1=Peter|title=The Editing Room|journal=American Film|date=July–August 1982|page=5|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/154245134/American-Film-Magazine-July-1982|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=American Film Institute|issn=0361-4751}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than twenty-five years later, he explained, "I love low-life."&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowman|first1=David|title='Headless' is a Flick from Tabloid Heaven|work=Long Beach Press-Telegram|agency=New York Times News Service|date=24 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Koper accepted his first academic position at the University of the District of Columbia in 1972, where he served as an assistant professor in the communications department until the fall of 1980. While there he defended the university's liberal open admissions policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinberg|first1=Lawrence|title=D.C. Public Colleges Record Spotty|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=16 October 2015|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he received a Master of Arts from [[American University]].

While teaching, Koper continued his journalism career. His 1978 article about the emerging recreational use of the dissociative drug phencyclidine, also known as PCP, was among the early reporting on the topic, and was later cited by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Philip|title=Synthetic Panics: The Symbolic Politics of Designer Drugs|date=1 July 1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0814742440|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=Angel Death|work=New Times|date=20 March 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, he began writing for the alternative weekly ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]''. The newspaper's co-founder [[Russ Smith (publisher)|Russ Smith]] remembers the day they met. "Peter Koper was one of the first 'name' writers to wander into my office...to pitch a story." His debut story was a parody of the monthly magazine [[Baltimore (magazine)|''Baltimore'']]. Koper gained a reputation as the "staff troublemaker," and Smith recalls several late-night adventures with Koper on the streets of Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Smith1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Russ|title=When Baltimore's Leon Pen Pig Ruled|url=http://www.splicetoday.com/baltimore/when-baltimore-s-leon-s-pig-pen-ruled|website=Splicetoday.com|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1980, Koper worked for two years as a syndicated writer and foreign correspondent for Independent News Alliance/United Features Syndicate. For United Features, Koper traveled to [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]] to shadow [[Aubelin Jolicoeur]] for a day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=Haiti's 'Elsa Maxwell': Stranger than Fiction|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Independent News Alliance|date=23 May 1981|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/05/23/page/49/article/a-man-of-charn-and-mystery|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported on the underground free press from Warsaw during a period of [[martial law in Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=Polish Press Free...Underground|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=The Pittsburgh Press|agency=Independent News Alliance/United Features Syndicate|date=22 August 1988|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19820822&amp;id=JrgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_18EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5591,1767447&amp;hl=en|page=A-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1982, when twenty-eight people killed themselves after they had reportedly watched the Russian roulette scenes in the film ''[[The Deerhunter]]'', Koper asked the question, "Can movies kill?" in an influential article published by the American Film Institute's ''[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gross|editor1-first=Larry|editor2-last=Katz|editor2-first=John Stewart|editor3-last=Ruby|editor3-first=Jay|title=Image Ethics: The Moral Rights of Subjects in Photographs, Film, and Television|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0195067804|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=American Film: Magazine of the Film and Television Arts|date=July 1982|publisher=American Film Institute|issn=0361-4751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1980, Koper assumed an assistant professorship in the communications arts department at Hofstra University. One of his students, television writer and producer Dean Young, called Koper's classes memorable, and credited Koper, together with another Hofstra professor, with having had a "profound" influence on his own decision to become a television writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumni of the Month, December 2011|url=http://www.hofstra.edu/Alumni/AOTM/aotm_dec11_young.html|website=Hofstra.edu|publisher=Hofstra University|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media advocate [[Jaci Clement]] also remembers Koper as one of her favorite professors at Hofstra, and his demanding classes as the "best  training to prepare me for working in a newsroom." Koper's influence didn't end at the classroom door either, according to Clement: "...anywhere near the media center, he would track me down and ask what I had written that day. His rule was you had to write something, anything, every day. If you didn't, he'd follow you around, nipping at your heels like a Jack Russell Terrier until he made you miserable. It was simply easier to do the writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumni of the Month, May 2015|url=http://www.hofstra.edu/alumni/aotm/aotm-may15-clement.html|website=Hofstra.edu|publisher=Hofstra University|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper taught at Hofstra University until 1986. Koper has also served as an assistant adjunct professor in the film division at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University School of the Arts, Divisions of Film, Theatre Arts, Visual Arts, and Writing|url=http://oracle-web.petersons.com/ccc92/display_pdf?p_instance_id=150063.pdf|website=Petersons.com|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Koper became a regular contributor to the website Splice Today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=The Festering Wound of Lynching|url=https://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/the-festering-wound-of-lynching|website=SpliceToday.com|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koper|first1=Peter|title=Amok and Mass Murders|url=https://www.splicetoday.com/writing/amok-and-mass-murders|website=SpliceToday.com|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film, television, and theatre==
In 1981, Koper played an uncredited role in the production of John Waters' film [[Polyester (film)|''Polyester'']], arranging financing from other investors as well as investing his own money, with which he trusted Waters "like an old penny-pinching aunt."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Trish|title=Master of "the Ultimate Nose Thumb"|work=The Globe and Mail|date=9 April 1983|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=E.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped Waters develop the concept of the scratch-and-sniff Odorama cards distributed to the audience.&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;

Koper received co-screenplay credit for his contributions to the [[Kathy Acker]] script on which director Bette Gordon based her 1983 arthouse film ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Totally Awesome 7: Great Films of the 80s|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/films/2013/p62/greatfilmsofthe80s.aspx|website=afi.com|publisher=AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center|accessdate=21 October 2015|date=July 6 – September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 1983, Koper read [[Vincent Musetto|Vincent Musetto's]] now famous headline in the ''[[New York Post]]'': "Headless Body in Topless Bar." The headline inspired Koper to begin writing a screenplay loosely based on the facts of the story, with the headline as its title. Remembering the years that followed, Koper said, "If my life were a newspaper, this would be splashed on page one: 'Screenwriter Haunted by Headless Headline.'"&lt;ref name=Bowman /&gt;

During a four-year stint working full-time as a staff writer and producer for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television's]] ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' in the early 1990s, Koper first worked with director James Bruce, scripting "a dozen offbeat vignettes about murder and mayhem." During that time, Koper never forgot the Musetto headline, shaping the story through retelling, and "turning it into a story of his own."&lt;ref name=Bowman /&gt; Koper wrote the story for the stage before developing the screenplay,&lt;ref name=Kehr&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kehr|first1=Dave|title=No Bra-vos for 'Topless Bar'|work=New York Daily News|date=16 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated again with Bruce to realize it.&lt;ref name=Bowman /&gt; In May 1995, ''[[Headless Body in Topless Bar]]'' appeared at the 48th [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival's]] [[Marché du Film]].&lt;ref name=Stratton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stratton|first1=David|title=Review: 'Headless Body in Topless Bar'|work=Variety|date=19 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Headless Body in Topless Bar'' opened in New York and Los Angeles to mixed reviews. [[Stephen Holden]] of the [[New York Times]] credited the cast's "fine ensemble acting" with "disguising the screenplay's long-windedness."&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=Film Review; A Sadist's Kinky Update of the Old Truth or Dare|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B00EED91239F935A25751C0A960958260|website=The New York Times|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Strauss of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' described the film as [[Paul Verhoeven|Paul Verhoeven's]] "''[[Showgirls]]'' without the budget," criticizing both the screenplay produced by "Koper's tabloid ink-stained hands," and Bruce's "uncertain direction."&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Bob|title=Mindless Head in 'Topless Bar'|work=Daily News of Los Angeles|date=22 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Anderson of the [[Los Angeles Times]] compared the film to ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' and ''[[No Exit]]'', "but without a certain delicacy."&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=John|title=Hostages get Caught in Headline-Inspired 'Bar'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=22 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Stratton]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as "gripping," praised Bruce's "fluid direction" and predicted that "prospects look brighter for video release."&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;

''Headless Body in Topless Bar'' was well received in Germany, where it was remembered as one of two "magnificent film highlights" from the [[Oldenburg International Film Festival]], then in its second year, and Koper was a touted guest of the festival in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oldenburg Film Festival Chronology|url=http://www.filmfest-oldenburg.de/en/festival/rueckblick/|website=filmfest-oldenburg.de|publisher=Oldenburg International Film Festival|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Körper ohne Kopf in Oben-ohne-Bar'', German dramatist Klaus Pohl's [[German language|German]] translation of Koper's original script for the stage, premiered at the [[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] on 11 November 1999.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web|title=Kulturspiegel: Theatres and Premieres|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/kulturspiegel/d-15251591.html|website=Der Spiegel|accessdate=11 September 2015|language=German|date=25 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheatreHeute&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronicle: Hamburg|journal=Theatreheute|date=January 2000|page=52|language=German|issn=0040-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer found the play "reminiscent" of Quentin Tarantino films.&lt;ref name="Felix Bloch Erben"&gt;{{cite web|title=Headless Body in Topless Bar|url=http://www.felix-bloch-erben.de/index.php5/aid/14/cid/1/autor/Peter%2BKoper/Action/showAuthor/fbe/101/|website=Felix Bloch Erben|accessdate=11 September 2015|language=German|date=14 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Koper took up seasonal residence in the [[Long Island]] hamlet of [[Springs, New York]], where he became interested in the story of the four [[Nazi]] saboteurs who disembarked from a [[U-boat]] on the morning of June 13, 1942, to land on [[Amagansett, New York|Amagansett's]] Atlantic Avenue Beach, then boarded the [[Long Island Rail Road]] bound for [[Manhattan]] as part of a [[Operation Pastorius|plan to attack the United States]].&lt;ref name=Drumm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drumm|first1=Russell|title=A Weird Nazi trip, Dramatized|url=http://easthamptonstar.com/Arts/2011608/Weird-Nazi-Trip-Dramatized|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=The East Hampton Star|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guardsman]] foiled the plot; upon encountering the invaders, he ran back to the Amagansett [[Coast Guard Station]] and raised the alarm, "The Nazis have landed!"&lt;ref name=Garrison&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garrison|first1=Virginia|title=Nazi Invaders Land at Mulford|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/General-Interest/385383/Nazi|website=27east.com|publisher=The East Hampton Press|accessdate=21 October 2015|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg]] commissioned Koper to write a screenplay about the Nazi misadventure, entitled ''Code Name: Pastorius''.&lt;ref name=osiris&gt;{{cite web|title=Code Name: Pastorius|url=http://www.osiris-gmbh.com/en/projects/project_2.htm|website=osiris-gmbh.com|publisher=Osiris Media GmbH|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper said he relied on the military trial transcripts housed at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] to fully understand the story, and tried to capture the story's inherent dark humor.&lt;ref name=Drumm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt; In 2011, the East Hampton Historical Society staged a reading of the screenplay at [[Mulford Farmhouse]] to raise funds to restore the Amagansett Coast Guard Station.&lt;ref name=Drumm /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrison /&gt;

A second Long Island landmark captured Koper's interest as well, inspiring another screenplay. By 1998, he was circling [[Hart Island, New York]] in a dinghy, imagining the "modern ghost town" and paupers' graveyard as the backdrop for ''[[Island of the Dead (2000 film)|Island of the Dead]]'', the horror film the island inspired him to write.&lt;ref name=Horwitz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horwitz|first1=Tony|title=Hart Island, Pop.

Koper won the 2001 [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival|Santa Barbara International Film Festival's]] Peter Stark Screenwriting competition for his screenplay ''Joyful Noise''.&lt;ref name=SBIFF /&gt;

In 2004, the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg honored Koper with a second commission, this time to write a dark romantic comedy about capital punishment entitled ''The Executioner in Love.'' &lt;ref name=medienboard2&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding Decisions March/ April/ May 2004|website=medienboard.de|publisher=Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg GmbH|accessdate=27 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903073944/http://www.filmboard.de/zusagen_archiv/030405_2004.htm|archivedate=3 September 2004|page=4|url=http://www.filmboard.de/zusagen_archiv/030405_2004.htm|language=German|format=PDF|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Koper wrote and co-produced the documentary ''Trump Tribe'', filmed at that year's [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and featuring seventeen voters who speak candidly about their zeal for the presidential candidacy of [[Donald J. Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Tribe|url=https://vimeo.com/ondemand/trumptribe|accessdate=25 January 2018|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses the "formal structure of anthropological study to divide Trump supporters into groups such as Myth Keepers, Tribal Women, Tribal Elders, and Tribal Youth."&lt;ref name="Fass"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fass|first1=Tara|title='Trump Tribe' Documentary an Anthropological Study of Trump Cult|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tara-fass/trump-tribe-documentary-an_b_12788634.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=November 4, 1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School''' or '''Phelps A.C.E. High School''' is a public high school in the northeast quadrant of the [[District of Columbia]], United States. 

The school is often considered to be a prime example of the school investment program currently occurring in DC. Having fallen victim to time and neglect the school was rebuilt by an award-winning architect{{who|date=July 2018}} from several smaller buildings into its current form. Along with architecture, construction and engineering, other courses are also taught there, including vehicle maintenance/repair and operation of large vehicles such as cranes and diggers on state-of-the-art simulators. The school also has a small greenhouse where plants can be tended by the students. The buildings are powered by a variety of renewable energy sources (indicated by the color-coded pipes inside, each color denoting a different system). The students, as part of their course work, are trusted to monitor and maintain parts of this system.

'''Play Money''' (PM) is noticeably fake [[banknotes|bills]] or [[coins]] intended to be used use as [[toy]] [[currency]], especially for classroom instruction or as a marker in [[board game]]s such as [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], rather than currency in a legitimate [[exchange market]]. Play money coins and bills are collected widely. They can be found made from metals, cardboard or, more frequently today, plastic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plastic-play-money.org&lt;/ref&gt; For [[card game]]s such as [[poker]], [[casino token]]s are commonly used instead.

Many [[online gambling]] sites offer "play money" games which can be played for freely-obtainable credits. These are usually offered alongside "real money" games. However, some sites also offer software that only offers play money games. Such software is usually downloadable from a parallel [[.net]] web address, which can then be advertised to the general public as a non-gambling website{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

In 1997, the [[Winston Million]] (a cash prize award program on the NASCAR Winston Cup series) was won by Jeff Gordon at the Mountain Dew Southern 500. A [[The Brink's Company|Brinks]] truck led him around the victory lap, spewing [[money bag|bags]] of Winston play money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clothier|first1=Richard|title=Play Money Of American Children|date=1985|publisher=Richard Clothier|location=Becket, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--See [[Winston Million]] for reference--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">{{Nihongo|'''Radio calisthenics'''|ラジオ体操|rajio taisō|extra=literally, "radio exercises"}} are warm-up [[calisthenics]] performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts. They are popular in [[Japan]] and parts of Mainland [[China]] and  [[Taiwan]]. 
[[File:Rajiotaiso2013park.ogv|thumb|(video) Two men do rajio taisō in a park.]]

==Japan==
In Japan, radio calisthenics are broadcast to music on public [[NHK]] [[radio]] early in the [[morning]]. Rajio taisō were introduced to Japan in 1928 as a commemoration of the coronation of Emperor [[Hirohito]].&lt;ref name="Fukue"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090722i1.html| title = Wake up, hike out, tune in, move it | last = Fukue | first = Natsuko | publisher = Japan Times| date = 2009-07-22 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for radio broadcast [[calisthenics]] came from the US, where during the 1920s the [[MetLife|Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.]] sponsored 15-minute radio calisthenics in major cities in the US. Visiting employees of the Japanese postal insurance division brought samples of the exercises from the US back to Japan.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt; The exercises were widely used to improve the health of Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s. The exercises were introduced to several other pacific nations, including Taiwan, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Indonesia]] during Japan's colonization period.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, the broadcasts were banned by the occupying powers as being too militaristic in nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7KkQB10-Kw&amp;t=1071| title = Begin Japanology: Radio Callisthenics | publisher = NHK| date = 2015-06-25 | accessdate = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several rewrites to the exercise routine, it was reintroduced by NHK radio in 1951 with the support of the education ministry, health ministry, the Japan Gymnastic Association and the Japan Recreation Association.&lt;ref name="Fukue"/&gt;

==China==

China also has such calisthenics. They have been mandatory since 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Originally they were introduced by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnakWocA3sc |accessdate = 2013-05-01 | title=Chairman Mao's 4 Minute Workout}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the broadcasts now are run by the General Administration of Sport China.

==Current status==
Radio taisō is still used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during [[Sports day#Japan|sports day]] activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spice.stanford.edu/publications/10064/ | title = Japanese Radio Exercises | origyear = 1977| year = 1996 | accessdate = 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">The cry of '''Rinehart!''' (more fully '''Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e-HART!''') was a [[meme]] of [[Harvard University]] student and alumni culture in the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935760,00.html |title=Education: Oh, Rinehart! |author= |date=September 29, 1952 |work=Time |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cry references an unknown undergraduate's call, from ground to dormitory window, for John Bryce Gordon Rinehart (1875-1954; Harvard class of 1900).&lt;ref name=FoF&gt;{{cite book |last=Hendrickson |first=Robert |title=The Facts on File Dictionary of American Regionalisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXY0yQnvmmUC&amp;pg=PA277 |accessdate=April 5, 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Facts on File |isbn=978-0816041565 |page=277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His cry of "Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e-HART!" drifting across Harvard Yard was inexplicably and spontaneously taken up by hundreds of students in the Yard and at open windows of surrounding dormitories. This phenomenon first occurred on June 11, 1900,&lt;ref name=winter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/AllportRinehart.pdf |title=Gordon Allport and the legend of 'Rinehart' |author=David G. Winter |date=March 1996 |volume=64 |issue=1 |work=Journal of Personality |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the next forty years cries of "Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e-HART!" (described as "Harvard's rebel yell")&lt;ref name=time/&gt; could be heard at random times and around the world, wherever Harvard men traveled or congregated, sometimes signalling the start of merry revelry.&lt;ref name=partridge&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Partridge |editor1-last=Dalzell |editor1-first=Tom |editor2-last=Victor |editor2-first=Terry |title=The new Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |volume=Volume 2 (J-Z) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA1619 |accessdate=April 5, 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, UK; New York, USA |isbn=0-415-25938-X |page=1619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Barrymore]] mentioned the "Rinehart!" cry in the 1939 film ''[[The Great Man Votes]]''.&lt;ref name=LL/&gt; The call was included by journalist [[George Frazier]] in his 1932 song  "Harvard Blues" (music by Tab Smith), recorded in 1941 by [[Count Basie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conti |first=Brooke |title=Ellison's Rinehart and Count Basie's: Invisible Man and ‘Harvard Blues’ |journal=Notes and Queries |volume=54 |issue=2 |date=June 1, 2007 |pages= |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included on the compilation ''The Count Basie Story, Disc 3 - Harvard Blues'' (2001, Proper Records). 
{{cquote|Rinehart, Rinehart / I'm a most indiff'rent guy / Rinehart, Rinehart / I'm a most indiff'rent guy / But I love my [[Vincent Club|Vincent]] Baby / And that's no Harvard lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/i-love-my-vincent-baby-html |title=I Love My Vincent Baby... |author=Primus V |date=September–October 2002 |work=Harvard Magazine |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Pynchon]] describes the cry in ''[[Against the Day]]'':
{{cquote|"Popular fellow, this Rinehart," Kit remarked. "A Harvard pleasantry from a few years back," explained Scarsdale Vibe, "which shows no sign of abating. Uttered in repetition, like this, it's exhausting enough, but chorused by a hundred male voices on a summer's evening, with Harvard Yard for an echo chamber? well . . . on the Tibetan prayer-wheel principle, repeat it enough and at some point something unspecified but miraculous will come to pass. Harvard in a nutshell, if you really want to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pynchon |first=Thomas |title=Against the Day |url= |year= |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0143112563 |page=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various legends grew up around the call; for instance, a Harvard man in Africa who was about to be kidnapped by some Arabs supposedly screamed "Rinehart!" and was rescued because there happened to be another Harvard man nearby in the [[French Foreign Legion]].&lt;ref name=LL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=E. J. |title=Harvard: Through Change and Through Storm |year=1969 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=978-0393085846 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
It is now considered established that the original target of the call was James Bryce Gordon Rinehart (Harvard 1900).&lt;ref name=FoF/&gt; A contemporary piece in the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'' adds details:
{{cquote|Rinehart, who is an earnest student, has been in great demand as a tutor to other men in his courses. As he lives at the top of Grays hall his friends have sought to find out whether he was in or not by directing plaintive cries of "Rinehart, O Rinehart" at his windows. This made the studiously inclined who swell in the neighboring dormitories very tired and they determined to quell Rinehart, so promptly at dark for the past three nights the college yard has resounded with the cries of "Rinehart, O Rinehart." First one end of the yard and then other would send up the plaintive cry, and then all the buildings would swell as if in chorus with the same old plaint. Last night the college police tried to stop the racket, but the boys by a little teamwork kept them running from one dormitory to the other. One man with a megaphone was particularly offensive, but despite the police vigil of three hours the megaphonist was still summoning Rinehart in tearful tones.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard ''Crimson'', Undated (presumably from either June 1899 or 1900), Scrapbook of R. R. Kent, '00, Harvard Archives HUD 900.44 F&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As this origin faded from memory, while the cry itself remained current, various false origin stories were circulated. One had Mr Rinehart hiring other students to call his name, to make him appear more popular.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003880.html |title=Rinehart |author=Mark Liberman |date=December 9, 2006 |work=Language Log |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These origin stories were collected, and a new one suggested, by [[Gordon Allport]] in a prize-winning undergraduate essay.&lt;ref name=winter/&gt;

'''Robert Mason David "Bob"&lt;ref&gt;[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/research/wreru/aboutus/staff/rj/jazz/ Nickname used both in the "jazz world" and among colleagues. See also his WRERU profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson''' (born 11 June 1945) is a British [[teacher|educator]] and [[educational research]]er working in the fields of [[Religious education in primary and secondary education|religious]] and [[Intercultural competence|intercultural education]] in [[United Kingdom|the UK]] and internationally, and in [[Education|educational policy]] at the European level. He has authored several influential books on an inclusive form of religious education in which young people learn together about religious and world view diversity, and has contributed to policy development on the religious dimension of intercultural education for the [[Council of Europe]]. He has written and presented educational broadcasts for [[BBC Schools|BBC Education]], and has edited both professional and academic journals. His work has been influential in a variety of countries beyond Europe. Away from academic work, he is a jazz musician and poet.

==Education and teaching==
He was born in [[Ilkeston]], [[Derbyshire]] in 1945. He attended [[Hallcroft school]], then studied [[Theology]] at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|St David’s College, Lampeter]] (1963–1966), and for a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) at the [[University of Cambridge]] (1966–67), where he was a member of [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]], and a member of the [[Footlights|Footlights Dramatic Club]]. He completed an MA degree in Philosophy in 1975, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Arts Education in 1994 at the University of Warwick.

He taught at [[Nottingham High School]] 1967–1971, and at [[Coventry College of Education]] 1972–78, joining the Department of Arts Education (later Institute of Education, and then the Centre for Education Studies) at the [[University of Warwick]] in April 1978, becoming Professor of Religions and Education in 1995. He held Visiting Fellowships in Religions and Education at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], in Autumn 1974 and Spring 1978, the first leading to the publication of ''Perspectives on World Religions'',&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (Ed.) (1978) ''Perspectives on World Religions''. London : University of London School of Oriental and African Studies. {{ISBN|0728600552}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second to a series of BBC Education broadcasts on [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]] experienced by members of religious communities in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Blaylock, L., Jackson, R. and Marshall-Taylor, G. «Image and Imagination: Religious Education at the BBC». In: ''RE Today'', 19 (3), 28–9. ISSN 0226 7738&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded a [[Doctor of Letters|DLitt degree]] by the University of Wales, Lampeter in 2006 for a selection of his published work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/research/wreru/aboutus/staff/rj/ WRERU on professor Robert Jackson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical research==
Influenced by meeting families of South Asian background in Coventry from 1972, Jackson began ethnographic research on [[Hindu]] families in Britain. He was joined in this work by Eleanor Nesbitt, and a report of their research was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. and Nesbitt, E. (1993) ''Hindu Children in Britain''. Stoke on Trent: Trentham. {{ISBN|0948080736}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the formation of the Institute of Education&lt;ref&gt;[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/ The Institute's website]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Warwick in 1994, Jackson established and became Director of the Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit (WRERU) until his retirement from full-time work in 2012. He remains an active member of WRERU. Jackson led WRERU’s contribution to the REDCo (Religion, Education, Dialogue, Conflict) Project, a European research project on religious education involving researchers, teachers and students from eight countries, funded by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapworkingparty.org.uk/downloads/Redco.pdf About REDCo]&lt;/ref&gt; WRERU has continued with a range of externally funded studies with funding from sources including the UK Research Councils and charitable bodies.

Jackson was invited to become a member of the Steering Committee of ‘Religion and Society’ (2007–2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionandsociety.org.uk/about/programme_management/steering_committee The Steering Committe's website]&lt;/ref&gt; an extensive UK research programme, taking a particular interest in projects concerned with education and youth, leading to the publication of a special issue of ''the Journal of Beliefs and Values'' in 2012, and a book co-edited with Elisabeth Arweck.&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, E. and Jackson, R. (eds.)(2014) ''Religion, Education and Society : Young People, Religious Identity, Socialisation and Diversity.'' London: Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415824729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson’s ideas have been developed in various research contexts by others, including quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as action research studies undertaken by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J., O'GRady, K. and McKenna, U. (eds.) (2013) ''Religion in Education : Innovation i International Research''. New York and London: Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415659499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theewc.org/news/view/publications.in.honour.of.robert.jackson.university.of.warwick.and.european.wergeland.centre/ The Wergeland Centre on publications in honour of Robert Jackson]&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson’s ideas have also been discussed with a view to adapting them to other national contexts, such as the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Grelle, Bruce (2006) «Defining and Promoting the Study of Religion in British and American Schools». In: M. de Souza, K. Engebretson, G. Durka, R. Jackson and A. McGrady (eds.), ''International Handbook of the Religious, Moral and Spiritual Dimensions of Education'', pp 461-474. Dordrecht, the Netherlands: Springer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|9781402048036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education theory and didactics==
[[File:Robert Jackson British educator.jpg|thumb|260px|Jackson receiving his honorary doctorate diploma at NTNU, Trondheim in 2017. Left: NTNU's rector [[Gunnar Bovim]]]]
Jackson has continued to argue that an open and inclusive study of religions and other worldviews in state funded schools is intrinsic to a broadly based liberal education, while also contributing instrumentally to the personal development of students and to social aims, such as fostering appreciation for the human rights principle freedom of religion and belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/37735 Jackson, R. (2015) «Inclusive Study of Religions and Other Worldviews in Publicly-funded Schools in Democratic Societies». in Kristina Stoeckl and Olivier Roy (eds.) ''The Future of Religious Education in Europe'', pp 7–18. San Domenico di Fiesole: European University Institute. (Open access e-book)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on ideas and methods from his ethnographic studies, Jackson developed the interpretive approach to religious education, which examines the dynamic relationship between individuals, the various kinds of groups they relate to, and wider religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (1997) ''Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach''. London: Hodder and Stoughton. {{ISBN|978-0340688700}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by work in recent [[social anthropology]], [[hermeneutics]], [[religious studies]], [[Intercultural relations|intercultural studies]] and [[social psychology]], and deals with issues of representing and interpreting religions fairly and accurately. It also includes a reflexive dimension in which the learner or researcher reflects on the implications of new learning for their own personal development. Professor [[John M. Hull]] described ''Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach'' as «a major contribution to the academic and professional study of religious education.»&lt;ref&gt;«''Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach'', Robert Jackson, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1997, 0–340–68870–X. Reviewed by John M Hull, Professor of Religious Education in the University of Birmingham». In ''British Journal of Religious Education'' (1998) 20 (2), pp 125–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on religious education and plurality,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2004) ''Rethinking Religious Education and Plurality: Issues in Diversity and Pedagogy''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415302722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson argues that the educational potential of the study of religion in state-funded schools has been underestimated; state schools should not be thought of as places of secular education, but as providing a pluralist context for educational development, and an environment encouraging dialogue. In reviewing ''Rethinking Religious Education and Plurality'', John M. Hull wrote: «Jackson’s masterly work not only helps us to rethink religious education; it shows its wider educational significance and points to its exciting future».&lt;ref&gt;Book Review by John Hull, ''British Educational Research Journal'' 32, (1), February 2006, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson’s latest book – ''Religious Education for Plural Societies'' – is a compilation of selected writings from across his career organised into sections on empirical research; the interpretive approach to religious education; religious education and plurality; and human rights and international policy development. A substantial general introduction is provided, plus introductions for each section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Education-Plural-Societies-Educationalis/dp/1138550671/|title=Religious Education for Plural Societies: The Selected Works of Robert Jackson|last=Jackson|first=Robert|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138550674|edition= 1st|location=|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Jackson’s work on families of religious minorities attracted the attention of BBC Education producers Ralph Rolls and Geoffrey Marshall-Taylor, and they invited him to make radio and radiovision programmes for school students of various ages, using actuality material and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall-Taylor, G. (2010) «Strawberry Fields ... For Ever? Personal recollections on the BBC’s support for RE and collective worship». In: ''REsource'', 33:1, pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorships== 
Jackson edited ''Resource'', which became the journal of the National Association for Teachers of Religious Education, from 1978 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Albans, P. (1996) ''Resource'', 19, 1, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he succeeded John Hull as Editor of the ''British Journal of Religious Education'', which he continued to do until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R (2011) «Religion, education, dialogue and conflict: editorial introduction», ''British Journal of Religious Education'', 33: 2, 105-109.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackson extended Hull’s policy of enhancing the academic status of the journal, including increasing its international profile, setting up editorial and international advisory boards, taking the journal to a commercial publisher, and gaining its inclusion in the [[Thomson Reuters Indices|Thomson Reuter citation index]].&lt;ref&gt;«Editorial (2008): The evolution of the British Journal of Religious Education: 30th and 74th birthdays», ''British Journal of Religious Education'', 30, (3), September 2008, pp. 183–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson serves on the editorial boards of a range of European and international journals. He is co-editor of ‘Religious Diversity and Education in Europe’ an extensive book series published in Germany by Waxmann,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waxmann.com/reihe1862-9547 Waxmann on the series]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a contributing editor to the University of Vienna’s book series on Religious Education at Schools in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rel-edu.eu/authors/ University of Vienna on the series]&lt;/ref&gt; and to Springer’s ''International Handbooks on Religion and Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/1-4020-5246-4 Springer on the handbook series]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy development==
Jackson has been involved with the [[Council of Europe]]’s work on policy for religion and education since it first included this topic in 2002. He participated in a project on the Religious dimension of intercultural education which produced publications in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe (2004) ''The Religious Dimension of Intercultural Education''. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keast, J. (ed.) (2007) ''Religious Diversity and Intercultural Education: A Reference Book for Schools''. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; He co-organised the first Council of Europe «Exchange» between leaders of faith communities and humanist associations in Europe in [[Strasbourg]] in April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CM(2008)62&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=9999CC&amp;BackColorIntranet=FFBB55&amp;BackColorLogged=FFAC75 Council of Europe (2008a) ''Report on Council of Europe 2008 Exchange on the Religious Dimension of Intercultural Dialogue'' (Strasbourg, 8 April 2008), 118th Session of the Committee of Ministers, Strasbourg, 7 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the team which drafted the Recommendation by the Committee of Ministers on teaching about religions and non-religious convictions, published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int//ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CM/Rec(2008)12&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&amp;BackColorIntranet=FDC864&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864 Council of Europe (2008b) Recommendation CM/Rec (2008) ''12 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the Dimension of Religions and Nonreligious Convictions within Intercultural Education'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he conducted a study for the Council of Europe exploring the feasibility of a European educational centre, including studies of religious diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2006) ''A ‘Centre of Excellence’ in Education for Democratic Citizenship, Human Rights, Intercultural Education and Education about Religious Diversity: A Feasibility Study, Report for the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers''&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation to initiate an interdisciplinary centre, including intercultural, human rights and citizenship education, with cross-cutting subjects such as religion and history, was taken up by the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian Government]] and the Council of Europe, and the [[European Wergeland Centre]] opened in Oslo in 2009. Jackson held a Visiting Professorship at [[Oslo University College]] (2009–2012) in order to take on the role of Special Adviser on religious diversity and education at the European Wergeland Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theewc.org/Content/Who-we-are/Contacts/Experts/Robert-Jackson The European Wergeland Centre on Jackson]&lt;/ref&gt; He continues in the role of Expert Adviser at the Council of Europe and the European Wergeland Centre. From 2011 to 2014 he was vice-chair of a joint Council of Europe and European Wergeland Centre committee given the task of disseminating the 2008 Council of Europe Ministerial recommendation. Jackson wrote the book ''Signposts'' which developed from this work, on behalf of the joint committee. ''Signposts'' was published in English in 2014&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2014) ''Signposts: Policy and Practice for Teaching about Religions and Non-Religious Worldviews in Intercultural Education''. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into twelve European languages as well as Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theewc.org/Content/Library/COE-Steering-documents/Recommendations/Signposts-Policy-and-practice-for-teaching-about-religions-and-non-religious-world-views-in-intercultural-education (English text of ''Signposts'' together with Arabic, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Norwegian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian translations; more translations are in preparation, including Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Education at [[Stockholm University]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="Stockholm"&gt;[http://www.su.se/english/profiles/rjack-1.269657 Presentation of Jackson on Stockholm University's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson also contributed to the ''Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools'', published by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/item/28314.html OSCE/ODIHR (2007) ''The Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools'' (Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Warsaw)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International outreach==
Beyond his work in Europe, Jackson has contributed to discussions on the place of the study of religions in education in countries including the USA,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2005) ‘Rethinking Religious Education and Plurality: Issues in Public Religious Education’, ''Religion &amp; Education'', 32 (1), pp 1–10.

A group of Jackson’s former doctoral students produced a special issue of the American journal ''[[Religion &amp; Education]]'' (vol 40, no. 1) and a Routledge book in his honour, both published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J., O'Grady, K. and McKenna, U. (eds) (2013) ''Religion in Education: Innovation in International Research''. New York and London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Jackson was awarded an honorary doctorate (Doc h.c.) By the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU) for his contribution to religious and intercultural education in Norway and internationally, including his work for the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ntnu-trondheim/sets/72157679314939491 NTNU's photos on Flickr from the conferral]&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2017, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Norwegian School of Theology]] (MF) in Oslo for his contributions to education in Norway and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/album/4829289/video/239451505 MF's film from the conferral]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jazz and poetry==
Jackson has been a jazz musician throughout his career, regarding the music as a complement to his academic pursuits, comparing the eclectic nature and creative development of the interpretive approach to jazz music.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2012) «Religious Education and the Arts of Interpretation Revisited». In Ina ter Avest (ed.) ''On the Edge: (Auto)biography and Pedagogical Theories on Religious Education'', pp 57–69. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; His band, Spicy Jazz, has worked since the 1980s, mainly in the English Midlands. Jackson proposed trumpet player, bandleader, broadcaster and writer, [[Humphrey Lyttelton]] for an honorary doctorate at the University of Warwick, which was awarded in 1987. Lyttelton appeared as a guest with Spicy Jazz and wrote the sleeve note for their recording, ''Coming of Age''.&lt;ref&gt;''Spicy Jazz, Coming of Age'', BSL3131, recorded 27 April 2002, reissued March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Humphrey Lyttelton’s death in 2008, Jackson accepted an invitation to become patron of the Humph Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humphreylyttelton.com/the-humph-trust/ The Humph Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackson has also played Jazz in Sweden and in Norway, including playing with [[Bjørn Alterhaug]], [[Vigleik Storaas]] and other leading Norwegian jazz musicians.

A further creative interest is poetry, and a selection of Jackson’s poems, together with poems by Dermot Killingley, is published in ''Narrowboat Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. and Killingley, D. (2015) ''Narrowboat Music: Poems of Life''. Newcastle upon Tyne: Grevatt &amp; Grevatt. {{ISBN|9780947722265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book includes a song lyric dedicated to UK jazz trombonist [[Roy Williams (musician)|Roy Williams]], and performed by a trio from Spicy Jazz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQblrYCnFo0 The trio from Spicy Jazz (with Jackson) on youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skillstreaming''' is a social skills training method introduced by Dr. Arnold P. Goldstein in 1973. It has been widely used in the United States, as well as other countries, in schools, agencies, and institutions serving children and youth. The Skillstreaming programs for early childhood, elementary age, and adolescence are published by the Research Press Publishing Company of [[Champaign, Illinois]].

Behavior theorists, including [[Albert Bandura]] described the processes of modeling, behavioral rehearsal, and reinforcement which are the basis of the Skillstreaming approach.  However, rather than emphasizing operant procedures such as prompting and shaping of behaviors, Skillstreaming takes a more [[psychoeducational]] approach, viewing the individual as a person in need of help in the form of skills training.&lt;ref name="MaherZins2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles A Maher|author2=Joseph Zins|author3=Maurice Elias|title=Bullying, Victimization, and Peer Harassment: A Handbook of Prevention and Intervention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYfsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA226|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-78722-8|pages=226–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method provides active and deliberate learning of desirable behaviors to replace less productive behaviors.&lt;ref name="GimpelPeacock2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gretchen A.

==History==

In 1950s and 1960s, the main therapeutic approaches for dealing with inappropriate behavior in individuals were ([[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]], [[Nondirective Psychotherapy|nondirective]], and [[behavior modification]]).  These three types of therapy focused on helping individuals to express their pre-existing effective, satisfying, or healthy behaviors.

After the [[Deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalization]] movement of the 1960s resulted in the discharge of large numbers of people from mental health and other institutions into local communities,  Arnold P. Goldstein developed Structured Learning Therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, A. P. (1973). ''Structured Learning Therapy: Toward a psychotherapy for the poor''. New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; the precursor to Skillstreaming, as a practical method of behavioral training. Structured learning methods deal with aggression, withdrawal, and other nonproductive actions as learned behaviors that can be changed by teaching new, alternative skills.

During this time, progressive education and character education,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, W. E. (1977). ''Roots of character education''. Schenectady, NY: Character Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; supported the teaching of values, morality, emotional functioning and values clarification,&lt;ref&gt;Simon, S. G., Howe, L. W., &amp; Kirschenbaum, H. (1972). ''Values clarification''. New York: Hart.&lt;/ref&gt; moral education,&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, L. (Ed.). (1973). ''Collected papers on moral development and moral education''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, Center for Moral Education.&lt;/ref&gt; and affective education&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. P. (1976). ''Humanizing the classroom''. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as filling its initial purpose as an intervention for low-income adults deficient in social skills, Skillstreaming has been used with other populations. In the 1980s, Dr. Goldstein’s skills training program, by that time known as Skillstreaming, was adapted to modify aggression and other problematic behaviors in adolescents,

Evaluative research studies support the efficacy of Skillstreaming and have suggested means for altering and improving its procedures and materials.&lt;ref&gt;Ganz, Jennifer B., [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/52057554?q&amp;versionId=65002063 "Skillstreaming the Adolescent: New Strategies and Perspectives for Teaching Prosocial Skills.(Review)"] ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'', v.36, no.4, 2001 March, p.246 ({{ISSN|1053-4512}}) Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Between 1984 and 2012, Goldstein and Ellen McGinnis published a series of books describing the Skillstreaming program, organized into three age groups: early childhood, elementary and adolescent. These volumes integrate the research findings on program efficacy with training recommendations provided by teachers, administrators, youth care workers, and other practitioners who have used Skillstreaming to teach social skills over the years.&lt;ref name="MaherZins2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/education/pdfs/Newsltr-ISPA-Aug-2013.pdf "School Based Support Groups"].

'''''Juan Sebastián de Elcano''''' is a [[training ship]] for the Royal [[Spanish Navy]].  It is a four-masted topsail, steel-hulled [[barquentine]] ([[schooner barque]]).  At {{convert|113|m|ft}} long, it is the third-largest [[tall ship]] in the world, and is the sailing vessel that has sailed the furthest, covering more than {{convert|2,000,000|nmi|lk=in}} in its history.

It is named after Spanish explorer [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], captain of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s last exploratory fleet and the man who completed the first circumnavigation of the world. The ship also carries the Elcano [[coat of arms]], which was granted to the family by Emperor Charles I following Elcano's return in 1522 from Magellan's global expedition. The coat of arms is a terraqueous globe with the motto "Primus Circumdedisti Me" (meaning: "First to [[circumnavigate]] me").

==Build and design==
'Juan Sebastián de Elcano' was built in 1927 in [[Cadiz, Spain]], and its hull was designed by the naval architect Mr C E Nicholson of Camper and Nicholsons Ltd of [[Southampton]]. Constructed by Echevarrieta y Larrinaga shipyard&lt;ref&gt;Sailing Ship Rigs and Rigging, H A Underhill, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; in Cadiz. After the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in April 1931 the ship became part of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]].

In 1933 under Commander [[Salvador Moreno Fernández]]'s order, a series of improvements were made to the ship and the bronze plate with the [[Latin language]] inscription ''Tu Primus Circumdedisti Me'' was placed near the prow. At the time of the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]] ''Juan Sebastián Elcano'' was at [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], a harbor that had been taken by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]].  
Its plans were used twenty-five years later to construct its [[Chile]]an sail training vessel sister ship [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|''Esmeralda'']] in 1952-1954.

==Maiden voyage== 
Its first voyage was sea testing between April and July that year from Cádiz to [[Malaga]], with [[King Alfonso XIII]] on board as a passenger, and then on to [[Sevilla]], [[Las Palmas]], [[Tenerife]], [[San Sebastián]], Cádiz, [[São Vicente, Cape Verde]], [[Montevideo]], Buenos Aires, Cape Town, [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], Suva, San Francisco, California, [[Balboa, Panama]], [[Havana]], [[New York City]], Cádiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/WASHINGTON/en/Noticias/Documents/FOLLETO%20INGLES%20nuevo%20dise%C3%B1o.pdf History summary of the ship] ''Juan Sebastián de Elcano''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Peter's Kubatana''' in [[Glen Norah]], [[Zimbabwe]], includes both a secondary school and technical vocational training. It is situated in a high-density suburb of [[Harare]], and was founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1963.

== History ==
In 1963 the [[Jesuit]] parish in the present [[Mbare, Harare|Mbare]] area of Harare opened St. Peter’s Community Secondary School (SPCSS) for students engulfed in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdmpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=St+Peter's+Kubatana+Secondary+school,+Highfield,+Harare,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V8BTLgHdvX&amp;sig=uhM3wFBIN-QdvlE-pEfs5tyiQuQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd5K6MtozRAhUr9IMKHWkOCFoQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=St%20Peter's%20Kubatana%20Secondary%20school,%20Highfield,%20Harare,&amp;f=false|title=TRIALS AND TRIUMPHS IN ADVERSITY: The Chronicles of a Zimbabwean township up-bringing and the Diaspora Saga|last=Vambe|first=Stanley A.|date=2013-08-27|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781483678535|language=en}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time secondary schools were provided for only the top 12% of primary leavers. SPCSS enrolled 80 students out of 250 applicants, for a two-year course leading to the External Junior Certificate. It used the St. Peter’s Primary School classrooms after the primary students finished their day.

A training school for social workers, the School of Social Service, began operations in the Jesuit parish in the mid-1960s. It later became the School of Social Work (SSW), a degree-awarding department of the University of Zimbabwe. The first premises of SSW were the defunct Morgan High School, and SPCSS was for a time accommodated there also. But this was found to be against the [[apartheid]] policy of the government, since SSW was mixed racial and SPCSS all-black. A closed primary school facility in the new Kambazuma township was made available for SPCSS. In the mid-1960s local volunteers were joined by volunteers from Stonyhurst College in England, who were taking a year off for service before going to the university, to work in these Jesuit schools. In 1968 technical courses were introduced to SPCSS by a Stonyhurst engineering student, and this focus has persisted in the technical school. The high school was to grow to 1051 students and cover through [[sixth-form]].

In the 1970s Kambuzuma’s population was growing and the primary school buildings were reclaimed for their original purpose. The secondary school was resituated on a 10-hectare site in [[Glen Norah, Harare]], and SPCSS took its present name St. Peter’s Kubatana, Kubatana being a Shona word encompassing notions of mutual help and co-operation. Facilities include an administration block and Jesuit residence.&lt;ref&gt;''African Journal of Social Work'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitsandfriends.org.uk/Previous%20Articles/JF59/happy%2040th/happy%2040th.html|title=Jesuits and Friends - Society of Jesus|website=www.jesuitsandfriends.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajsw/article/viewFile/127545/117070|title=Setting Up St. Peter's School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high school has, by one account, been ranked as fourth best high school in Harare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tripsuccor.com/zimbabwe/places/st-peters-kubatana-high-school-high-school-harare|title=St Peters Kubatana High School and 10+ more top High Schools near Harare|work=Glopoi|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Gloucester''' (1802 – 1850) was among the primary organizers for the [[Underground Railroad]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the founder of The First African Presbyterian Church at Girard Avenue and 42nd Street in Philadelphia, which had 123 members by 1811.&lt;ref name=abolitionistpapers&gt;{{cite book|title=The Black Abolitionist Papers|last=Ripley|first=Peter C.|year=1991|publisher=UNC Press|isbn=0-8078-1926-3|pages=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
Gloucester was one of the four sons of [[John Gloucester]]. Stephen was born a slave in [[Tennessee]], his father paid $400 for Stephen's freedom when he was 12 years of age.

==Community organizer==
Between 1820 and 1840, Reverend Gloucester ran a school for black children and established a reading room for black adults.
He organized the Leavitt Anti-Slavery Society and encouraged black churches to start similar groups, and was one of eight black pastors who founded the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.
In 1838, he became a co-publisher and co-proprietor of the [[The Colored American (New York City)|Colored American]].
He became the pastor of the [[Second African Presbyterian]] after its previous pastor died.
A mob destroyed Second African Presbyterian in the 1842 race riots.

==Controversy==

In 1844, Gloucester became the founding pastor at Lombard Street Central Presbyterian Church - a church that was formed after the congregation of Second Presbyterian split into two factions.
This schism with other activists led Gloucester to concentrate on his church, which moved into the white, Greek Revival-style building on the 800 block of Lombard upon its completion in 1848.
The church eventually dropped the "street" in its name and became known as Lombard Central Presbyterian.

Frederick Douglass is said to have called Gloucester "one of the vilest traitors to his race that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;The Black Abolitionist Papers, VOLUME III, The United States, 1830-1846, Editor: C. Peter Ripley,  P. 199, section: "Address by Watkins, Moore, and White" [https://www.scribd.com/doc/144975991/C-Peter-Ed-Ripley-the-Black-Abolitionist-Papers-Vol-III-the-United-States-1830-1846-1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial site==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stephen Gloucester Burial Site.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The church which once held the missing burial marker of Rev. Gloucester.]] --&gt;
In 1850, while on a church-related trip to Reading, Gloucester died of pneumonia. Gloucester's congregation buried him in a brick vault in the front of the building he had raised money to construct.

There they placed a marble obelisk, inscribed:
:''Rev. Stephen Henry Gloucester''
:''First Pastor of the Lombard St. Central Presbyterian Church''
:''Died May 21, 1850''
:''Aged 48''
:''Erected by the Congregation and Citizens among whom he labored, as an expression of esteem and affection for him – a devoted and successful minister of Jesus :Christ.''

In 1880, Ann Gloucester died, and her remains were placed with her husband in the brick vault.

At some point since an 1895 photograph was taken, the large obelisk that marked the Gloucesters' grave went missing.

In 1939, the congregation outgrew their original church, which is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and moved to a historic former Quaker meeting house on Powelton Avenue in West Philadelphia.

In the summer of 2008, a couple who had bought the property was in the process of converting the worn-out structure into a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} luxury home they hope to sell for $4.95 million. Workers hit a piece of slate which turned out to be his brick tomb.
On Friday November 21, 2008, his remains were found.
Mooney, an archeologist, said in an email Saturday, November 22, 2008, that all evidence at the site backs up the documentary evidence that the vault contained the remains of the Gloucesters and Winrow. Forensic details are forthcoming.&lt;ref name=planphilly&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Reverend Gloucester|url=http://www.planphilly.com/node/4551|date=2008-11-23|author=Kellie Patrick Gates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Inner World of Aphasia''''' is a 1968 [[Medical training in the US|medical training]] film by co-directors Edward Feil and Naomi Feil of Edward Feil Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/2015-additions-to-the-national-film-registry/14/|title=2015 additions to the National Film Registry|date=2016-09-05|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It portrays patients suffering from [[aphasia]] and follows their experiences through their recoveries. Notable for its innovative artistic direction and empathetic approach to patients with aphasia, the film was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-15-216/2015-national-film-registry-ghostbusters-gets-the-call/2015-12-16/|title=2015 National Film Registry: "Ghostbusters" Gets the Call|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film follows Marge Nelson (portrayed by Naomi Feil), a nurse who treats patients suffering from aphasia. Marge is overworked and unsympathetic towards her patients, experiencing frustration at their behavior and apparent inability to communicate.

Upon having an accident and suffering brain damage, Marge herself experiences aphasia and undergoes treatment at the same hospital where she previously worked. While struggling to deal with the emotions around her trauma and new issues with processing information and communicating, Marge also discovers a startling lack of empathy from hospital staff and therapists treating her.

Marge finds a new friend in a second patient who is suffering from aphasia. The film shows us that, like Marge, this second patient has also experienced a lack of empathy from others, except in his case it is his family members who are unable to understand his illness.

Through this new friendship and her own determination, Marge changes the emotional direction of her life and takes the first steps towards her recovery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1968|title=CINE/68|jstor=20686999|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=20| issue =  3|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diller|first=Leonard|date=January 1969|title=The Treatment of Aphasia: A Film|url=http://access.portico.org/stable?au=phzjr78wh|journal=PsycCRITIQUES|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=14|pages=43–44|via=Portico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Inner World of Aphasia'' was praised by contemporary sources for its attention to [[patient experience]], particularly for drawing attention to the ways in which patients treated for aphasia in the 1960s were dehumanized by hospital staff and family members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Compared to other media portrayals of aphasia the time, ''The Inner World of'' ''Aphasia'' was unique for its focus on portraying "the complex subjective feel of what it is like to be an aphasic."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Its use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], optical distortions, and audio editing techniques were noted by medical professionals as accurately conveying the experience of a person suffering from aphasia (such as [[hemiplegia]] and [[hemianopsia]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Awards and Recognition ==
In 1968, ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' received the Golden Eagle from The Council on International Non-Theatrical Events (CINE), the organization's highest honor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1969, ''[[American Journal of Nursing|The American Journal of Nursing]]'' included ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' on its list of films screened by the [[American Nurses Association]] / National League of Nurses Film Committee and recommended for screening to nurses and nursing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 1969|title=Films Screened|jstor=3453849|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|volume=69| issue =  4|pages=854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]], a selection of films noted as worthy of preservation by the United States National Film Preservation Board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tooth Invaders''' is a video game released by [[Commodore Business Machines|Commodore International]] for its [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] home computer in 1981 and later for the [[Commodore 64|C64]] in 1982. It was developed in association with Camelot Marketing Group in order to positively reinforce the pros of brushing, flossing, and healthy dental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nQdAQAAMAAJ|title=Quintessence International, Dental Digest|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Buch- und Zeitschriften-Verlag "Die Quintessenz,"|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seen as a fun way to teach children the importance of dental care, players fight as "Plaqueman" to fight plaque using a toothbrush and dental floss.{{cn|date=August 2016}} It was also made in association with the [[American Dental Association]], released during National Dental Month, and supported by dentists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVlWAAAAMAAJ|title=Microcomputing|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Wayne Green, Incorporated|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Gameplay==
Using a toothbrush and dental floss, the player must keep the teeth clean while avoiding contact with the Plaque Germ, known as "D.K". If D.K. comes into contact with the player, this will result in loss of one life. The brush needs tooth paste to work so the player must apply tooth paste. Floss is used for the space between teeth. If the teeth aren't cleaned properly and start to decay a warning bell sounds. Eventually the tooth will disappear, reflecting tooth loss. If a tooth is completely cleaned, a brief musical score will play and the teeth will change colors repeatedly. If the player comes into contact with D.K. at this time, the Plaque Germ will disappear for a time.

''Ready: A Commodore 64 Retrospective'' described it as a "simple game", a "standout" of Commodore's first generation of educational software, and a "pioneer in the serious games and games for health fields".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecuoBQAAQBAJ|title=Ready: A Commodore 64 Retrospective|last=Dillon|first=Roberto|date=2014-12-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789812873415|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book also noted that the game aged relatively quickly due to the rapid improvement in game quality in the following years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Microcomputing'' considered the game an "excellent" example of how computer software could be used educationally to create behavioural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVlWAAAAMAAJ|title=Microcomputing|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Wayne Green, Incorporated|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games Village wrote that behind the patently idiotic facade, it instead proves to be a balanced and enjoyable puzzle game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesvillage.it/retro/news/1835183/tooth-invaders-ligiene-orale-ai-tempi-dei-pixel/|title=Tooth Invaders: l'igiene orale ai tempi dei pixel • GamesVillage.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Ghana Medical School''' also '''UGMS''' is the [[Medical School|medical school]] of [[Ghana]]'s first public research institution, the [[University of Ghana]]. It is currently located at the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]] in [[Accra]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smd.ug.edu.gh/|title=Home {{!}} School of Medicine and Dentistry|website=smd.ug.edu.gh|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327164649/http://smd.ug.edu.gh/|archivedate=2018-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical school was first planned in 1919, but took its first students in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ugms.edu.gh/index.php/about-us/history-of-ugms |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616162040/http://ugms.edu.gh/index.php/about-us/history-of-ugms |archivedate=2015-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The plan to set up a medical school on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] was drawn up after the establishment of the [[Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital|Korle Bu Hospital]] in 1919 by the British Governor at the time, Sir [[Gordon Guggisberg|Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The idea was abandoned after Guggisberg left office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was renewed interest in this venture in 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the behest of the Gold Coast colonial administration and the [[University College of the Gold Coast]], a technical team from the [[University of London]] visited the Gold Coast to assess the scheme and specifications for staffing and facilities that would be required fully operationalise a medical school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1952, a government-approved commission recommended the postponement of the establishment of medical school indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1955, the issue was revisited and the colonial government invited the [[University College of the Gold Coast]] and the [[Kumasi College of Technology]] to examine the options to start a medical school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was decided medical courses would be introduced in a step-by-step fashion, as originally espoused by the [[University of London]] delegation in 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1956, the University Council Committee under the leadership of the institution’s first principal, [[David Mowbray Balme|David Balme]], was formed to suggest other avenues for founding the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recommendations of this committee included an annual enrollment of 20 to 25 students, establishment of four pre-clinical departments at the [[University of Ghana|University College of the Gold Coast]], [[Legon]] and the upgrade of the [[Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital|Korle Bu Hospital]] to a teaching hospital with its autonomous management board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 1960, the year Ghana became a republic, there was still no pathway for implementation as Korle Bu was not equipped for clinical training and funds were unavailable for its expansion. The Nkrumah government sought technical and financial assistance from the [[Kennedy Administration|Kennedy administration.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The US government appointed a team led by physician, Paul Connerlly to review all previous assessments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This team suggested the establishment of a ''National Medical and Health Training Centre'' under which the medical school would function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government accepted these recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1962, the [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Development]] (USAID) recommended that the National Medical and Health Training Centre should have these subsidiaries: a medical school, a school of nursing; a dental school; a school of medical technology; a post graduate school; a research facilities centre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It was planned that the medical school would be financially independent with its own council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the [[University of Ghana]] would be its parent institution and would award its medical degrees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The suggested curriculum would be American-based even though the Ghanaian education was modelled on the British university system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To streamline these differences, admitted sixth formers were to go through a two-year pre-medical science course prior to the actual medical training. In October 1962, the foundation class of 51 premedical students were admitted to the University of Ghana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within a year of the programme, the American Dean informed the government that he  was unable to find lecturers in the basic sciences. In February 1964, Ghana’s first president decided to wholly rely on domestic sources of funding and manpower to establish the full medical school. A study tour by [[Alexander Kwapong]], [[Charles Odamtten Easmon]] and [[E. A. Badoe]] at then newly established [[University of Lagos]] and [[University of Ibadan]] medical schools, was used as a basis for the feasibility studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 1964, 41 students enrolled in the preclinical training with a group of indigenous doctors being their lecturers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most courses were drawn from [[gross anatomy]] and [[histology]], taught by J.K.M Quartey and F. N. L. Engmann.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Surgeons and pathologists at government hospitals in Accra taught on an [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, the department of physiology was started by H. H. Philips while biochemistry was started by B. Y. A. Andoh as part of the curriculum that included [[basic sciences]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teaching in paraclinical departments commenced in April 1966 while those in clinical departments started in April 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[professoriate]] was almost entirely Ghanaian. The pioneering class of 39 medical students graduated in June 1969. Expatriate lecturers were recruited at the end of the first year. By the end of 1968, the Ghana medical school had become a semi-autonomous school under the University of Ghana with functions identical to other faculties of the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It assumed a new name, the ''University of Ghana Medical School'' and its own Executive Council and School Board were assembled. The school held landmark events to celebrate and its silver jubilee in 1987 and fortieth anniversary in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The self-accounting administration was subordinate to both the board and the executive council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a university faculty, a Dean provided academic and administrative leadership, assisted by a Vice Dean and an Executive Secretary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first Executive Secretary of the medical school was C. K. Gbeho and Deborah Boafoh was the first Administrative Secretary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The medical school now operates through seventeen departments, namely departments of [[anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[physiology]], [[chemical pathology]], [[haematology]], [[Microbiology|mircobiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]], [[Pediatrics|paediatrics]], [[community health]], [[medicine]] and [[Therapy|therapeutics]], [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[radiology]] and [[surgery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Four out every five faculty at the school are alumni.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The school had eight department in its early years. Paraclinical Departments and department heads consisted of the following:
* Department of Pharmacology led by R. Lewis with J. Blukoo Allotey as his deputy
* Department of Pathology led by F. W. N. Laing
* Department of Microbiology, led by S. N. Afoakwa
* Department of Surgery, led by [[Charles Odamtten Easmon]]
* Department of Medicine, led by S. R. A. Dodu
* Department of Paediatrics, led by Yaw Asirifi
* Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, led by K. K. Bentsi-Enchill
* Department of Community Health, led by [[Fred T. Sai]]

== School mission ==
The medical school’s mission focuses on learning, research and knowledge dissemination in the national and global context. Specifically, the college aims to train:

*''“A broad-based generalist practitioner with sufficient grounding for subsequent specialization''
*''A practitioner functionally attuned to and therefore responding aptly to the needs and exigencies of his/her environment.  He/she shall attain internationally accepted standards''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*''A practitioner who has participated in health care delivery while under instruction and therefore cognizant of the problems of health delivery and also an individual who accepts responsibility for self-learning and therefore readily responsive to the call for continuing education, and advocate for community health needs.”''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Learning environment ==
=== Curriculum ===
The school curriculum has gone through periodic reviews in line with national health needs and contemporary trends in medical education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1992, a biomedical science bachelor’s degree was introduced to be conferred at the end of the para-clinical sciences course and is now a prerequisite for clinical training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The length of the medical course was reduced from seven and a half years to six year, inclusive of a year-long premedical course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A new curriculum was introduced in 2009 and two classes were simultaneously admitted: [[secondary school]] students and bachelor degree holders in the natural sciences for the Graduate Entry Medical Programme (GEMP).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugms.edu.gh/|title=Homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UGMS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013035209/http://www.ugms.edu.gh/|archivedate=13 October 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=15 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugms.edu.gh/index.php/gemp|title=GEMP|publisher=UGMS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813151018/http://ugms.edu.gh/index.php/gemp|archivedate=13 August 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GEMP is an integrated four-year medical degree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A clinical skills and simulation centre was also established in 2009 to enhance clinical skills training. The Ghanaian government also provided a high-capacity medical library for the UGMS through budgetary support and GET Fund allocation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Student enrollment ===
The first batch of students in 1964 had 41 students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 1973, the number had risen to 53 students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1999, 94 students matriculated at the medical school. With two streams in 2006/07, intake rose to 195 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2006, student enrolled per annum effectively doubled from about 100 to 200.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2011, enrollment was 150 per year. The school strives to achieve gender parity in its admissions, with women guaranteed a minimum of 25% of the incoming class.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugms.edu.gh/index.php/about-us/history-of-ugms|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616162040/http://ugms.edu.gh/index.php/about-us/history-of-ugms|archivedate=2015-06-16|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women intake in the school’s first class was 3 which increased steadily over the years to 71 out a total of 154 students who matriculated in 2011. This represents an increase of 2367 percentage points. Between 1969 and 2012, the medical school produced 2752 physicians, consisting of 2083 men and 669 women.

In its early days, the school reserved 5% of spots to foreign students from African countries without medical schools. From 1999, the population of international students from around the globe has been pegged at 20%. Student enrollment stood at 802 in the 2006/07.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 2010/11 academic year, the medical school had an incoming class of 150, and rising, at least a quarter of which are women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Institutional challenges ===
In the 1980s, due to an [[Recession|economic downturn]] from the [[Structural Adjustment Programme|structural adjustment programme]] in Ghana, the school faced an exodus of its faculty to institutions abroad which led to a reduction in the student intake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also an “internal brain drain” as result of a wage gap between clinical teaching staff and consultants in the Ministry of Health whose compensation far exceed that of the UGMS professors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The physical space for clinical training and research is also very limited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, the Basic Sciences Building which houses 200 students was originally built to accommodate a quarter of that number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Specialist and graduate training ===
Beginning in 1972, the [[medical school]] through a variety of arrangements for postgraduate education, has trained specialists for national needs. Originally, this was carried out through the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the [[United Kingdom]], later the West African Postgraduate Medical College and now the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Medical School]] has two programs: the undergraduate  [[MB ChB|MBChB]] program for students from the [[Secondary School]], and the Graduate Entry Medical Program for Graduate students with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It has also runs the Graduate Entrance Medical Programme (GEMP) for people who did [[Bachelor Degree]]s&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in the natural sciences, applied sciences, engineering but not [[medicine]]

=== Link to other health-related institutions ===
The UGMS was instrumental in the establishment of other Ghanaian and African medical schools. In 1970s, the first two batches from the [[College of Health Sciences (KNUST)|School of Medical Sciences]], [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]], completed their training at [[Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital|Korle-Bu]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, before the Tamale hospital was upgraded to ta teaching hospital, the UGMS hosted students from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, [[University for Development Studies]] (UDS) for pre- and para-clinical and full clinical training leading to the earning of UDS degrees. Professors from the UGMS also go to the UDS from time to time to aid in teaching. A College Council that governs the institution replaced the Executive Council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The University of Ghana Dental School started in 1974 under the aegis of the UGMS, before attaining full faculty status in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ''Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research'' was founded in 1979 in partnership with the UGMS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1994, the Ghanaian [[Ministry of Health (Ghana)|Ministry of Health]] (MoH) authorised a new course: the ''Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology'' to train laboratory technicians for the country’s hospitals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the same year, the MoH collaborated with the UGMS to establish a ''School of Public Health'' that would awarded postgraduate degrees in public health, epidemiology and related fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1998, the School of Allied Health Science was started for the training of laboratory scientists, physiotherapists, radiographers, medical and dental technologists and other allied health professionals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UGMS was the progenitor of the idea to merge all the health-related schools of the University of Ghana into the first constituent college of the university - the College of Health Sciences. Upon the establishment of the College of Health Sciences in 1999, the UGMS, together with five other medical schools became a constituent college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UGMS played a critical role in the curriculum development for the establishment of the University of Cape Coast Medical School.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Recent developments ==
With financial assistance from the [[Government of Israel|Israeli government,]] a state-of-the-art University Teaching Hospital on the campus of the University of Ghana, Legon was recently completed and the UGMS is in the process expanding infrastructure and access to medical education. The university has in recent years started a school of [[Biomedical sciences|biomedical science]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Biomedical engineering|engineering]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UGMS plans to construct simulated laboratories to meet increased demand while making use of peripheral hospitals for clinical training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the future, the medical school plans to introduce distance learning programmes for certain disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Investment in the school’s research portfolio in the biomedical sciences is a top priority for the university’s medical school. International student tuition is the main source of the school’s internally–generated funds (IGFs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Eventually, certain changes to the Architects Registration Acts were enacted in 1996 which now have effect under the [[Architects Act 1997]].

== Overview ==

The Warne Report had been drawn up by (Ernest) John (David) Warne, CB.  He had been secretary to the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] from 1982 to 1990.  After graduating BA in the [[University of London]] he had entered the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]], and after a series of promotions and transfers (detailed in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'') he had become an Under-Secretary in the [[Department of Industry]], and eventually Deputy Director-General of the [[Office of Fair Trading]], 1979-1982.  Mr Warne summarised the conclusion of his report as follows:

* "'''My main recommendation is that the protection of title 'architect' should be abolished and [[ARCUK]] disbanded''',  I believe that this will help modify some of the outmoded distinctions and attitudes which inhibit change within the [[construction industry]].  It should also help the efforts being made in the architectural profession to improve the relevance of education and training to the business world in which architects must operate.  Although the loss of the [[monopoly]] use of the title '[[architect]]' (but not the term '[[chartered architect]]') will be unwelcome to many in the [[profession]], I suggest that time will show that the protection of title has been largely irrelevant to the standing of the architectural profession or to the [[public interest]]..."
