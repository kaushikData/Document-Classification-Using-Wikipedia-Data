[[File:Sangshad inside.jpg|thumb|upright|Play of light inside [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]]]]

'''Architectural lighting design''' is a field within [[architecture]], [[interior design]]  and [[electrical engineering]] that is concerned with the design of [[lighting]] systems, including natural light, [[electric light]], or both, to serve human needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lighting : basic concepts / Warren G. Julian, editor ; written by members of the Architectural Science Dept, University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process takes account of:
* The kind of human activity for which lighting is to be provided
* The amount of light required
* The color of the light as it may affect the views of particular objects and the environment as a whole
* The distribution of light within the space to be lighted, whether indoor or outdoor
* The effect of the lightened system itself on the user

The objective of lighting design is the human response, to see clearly and without discomfort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The objective of architectural lighting design is to further the design of architecture or the experience of buildings and other physical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alconlighting.com/blog/lighting-design/what-are-architectural-lighting-fixtures/|title=What Is Architectural Lighting|date=2017-10-23|website=AlconLighting.com|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Gas lighting]] was economical enough to light streets in major cities starting in the early 1800s, and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people. The [[gas mantle]] boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of [[kerosene lamp]]s. The next major drop in price came about with the [[incandescent light bulb]] powered by [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|title=Episode 534: The History of Light|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/25/306862378/episode-534-the-history-of-light|website=NPR.org|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=2014-04-25|accessdate=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:VIPlibrary.jpg|thumb|Auditorium of the Viipuri Municipal Library in the 1930s]]

Architectural lighting design focuses on three fundamental aspects of the illumination of buildings or spaces. The first is the aesthetic appeal of a building, an aspect particularly important in the illumination of [[retail]] environments. Secondly, the [[ergonomic]] aspect: the measure of how much of a function the lighting plays. Thirdly is the [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]] issue to ensure that light is not wasted by [[over illumination]], either by illuminating vacant spaces unnecessarily or by providing more light than needed for the [[aesthetics]] or the task.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Cultural factors also need to be considered; for example, bright lights was a mark of wealth through much of Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campanella|first=Thomas J.|title=Mapping the Edison Bulbs of Brooklyn|url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/10/mapping-the-edison-bulbs-of-brooklyn/543738/|accessdate=25 October 2017|work=Citylab|agency=[[The Atlantic]]|date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day lighting==
As the Sun crosses the sky, it may appear to be red, orange, yellow or white depending on its position. The changing color of the Sun over the course of the day is mainly a result of [[scattering]] of light and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the sunlight from the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.

For colors based on black-body theory, blue occurs at higher temperatures, while red occurs at lower, cooler, temperatures. This is the opposite of the cultural associations attributed to colors, in which red represents hot, and blue cold.&lt;ref&gt;

==Fixtures==
{{Main article|Light fixture}}
[[File:PH-Lampan 1.jpg|thumb|The [[PH-lamp|PH5 lamp]], designed in 1958]]

Lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions. The most important functions are as a holder for the light source, to provide directed light and to avoid [[visual glare]]. Some are very plain and functional, while some are pieces of art in themselves. Nearly any material can be used, so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes.

An important property of light fixtures is the [[luminous efficacy]] or [[wall-plug efficiency]], meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy, usually measured in [[Lumen (unit)|lumen]] per [[watt]]. A fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the "bulb" to the surroundings. The more [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] the lighting fixture is, the higher efficacy. [[Shadow|Shading]] the light will normally decrease efficiency but increase the directionality and the [[visual comfort probability]].

The [[PH-lamp]]s are a series of light fixtures designed by Danish designer and writer [[Poul Henningsen]] from 1926 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Design |url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |contribution=The PH lamp |publisher=Visit Denmark |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |archivedate=2012-02-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The lamp is designed with multiple concentric shades to eliminate [[visual glare]], only emitting reflected light, obscuring the light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poul Henningsen |url=http://www.louispoulsen.com/en/Designers/Poul%20Henningsen.aspx |publisher=Louis Poulsen Lighting |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118201306/http://www.louispoulsen.com/en/Designers/Poul%20Henningsen.aspx |archivedate=2013-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photometric studies==
&lt;!-- [[Photometric study]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:PlanckianLocus.png|thumb|The [[CIE 1931]] ''x,y'' chromaticity space, also showing the chromaticities of black-body light sources of various temperatures ([[Planckian locus]]), and lines of constant ''[[#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]]'']]

Photometric studies (also sometimes referred to as "layouts" or "point by points") are often used to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated.  This enables architects, lighting designers, and engineers to determine whether a proposed lighting setup will deliver the amount of light intended. They will also be able to determine the contrast ratio between light and dark areas. In many cases these studies are referenced against [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IESNA]] or [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]] recommended lighting practices for the type of application.  Depending on the type of area, different design aspects may be emphasized for safety or practicality (i.e. such as maintaining uniform light levels, avoiding glare or highlighting certain areas).  Specialized software is often used to create these, which typically combine the use of two-dimensional digital [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings and lighting [[simulation software]].

[[Color temperature]] for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications. The color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in [[kelvin]]s of a theoretical [[black body]] emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics  of the lamp. An incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins; daylight is around 6400 kelvins. Lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum, while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance.  For critical inspection or color matching tasks, or for retail displays of food and clothing, the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect.  Color may also be used for functional reasons.  For example, blue light makes it difficult to see veins and thus may be used to discourage drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Amanda|title=Gas station installs blue lights to combat drug use|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/health/bathroom-blue-lights-trnd/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=[[CNN]]|date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlated color temperature==
The '''color temperature''' of a light source is the [[temperature]] of an ideal [[black body|black-body radiator]] that radiates light of comparable [[hue]] to that of the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of [[visible light]] that has important applications in [[lighting]], [[photography]], [[videography]], [[publishing]], [[manufacturing]], [[astrophysics]], [[horticulture]], and other fields. In practice, color temperature is only meaningful for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally stated in the unit of absolute temperature, the [[kelvin]], having the unit symbol K.

For lighting building interiors, it is often important to take into account the color temperature of illumination. For example, a warmer (i.e., lower color temperature) light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation, while a cooler (higher color temperature) light is used to enhance concentration in offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCT dimming for LED technology is regarded as a difficult task, since binning, age and temperature drift effects of LEDs change the actual color value output. Here feedback loop systems are used for example with color sensors, to actively monitor and control the color output of multiple color mixing LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color temperature of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted from an ideal [[black body]] is defined as its surface temperature in kelvins, or alternatively in ''[[mired]]s'' (micro-reciprocal kelvin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; This permits the definition of a standard by which light sources are compared.

To the extent that a hot surface emits [[thermal radiation]] but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An [[incandescent lamp]]'s light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially the temperature of the filament.

Many other light sources, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, or [[LED]]s (light emitting diodes) emit light primarily by processes other than thermal radiation. This means that the emitted radiation does not follow the form of a [[Planck's law|black-body spectrum]]. These sources are assigned what is known as a [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]] (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to [[color vision|human color perception]] most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from the comparison to a black-body radiator.

== Methods ==
For simple installations, hand-calculations based on tabular data can be used to provide an acceptable lighting design. More critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer.

Based on the positions and mounting heights of the fixtures, and their photometric characteristics, the proposed lighting layout can be checked for uniformity and quantity of illumination. For larger projects or those with irregular floor plans, lighting design software can be used. Each fixture has its location entered, and the reflectance of walls, ceiling, and floors can be entered. The computer program will then produce a set of contour charts overlaid on the project floor plan, showing the light level to be expected at the working height. More advanced programs can include the effect of light from windows or skylights, allowing further optimization of the operating cost of the lighting installation. The amount of daylight received in an internal space can typically be analyzed by undertaking a [[daylight factor]] calculation.

The Zonal Cavity Method is used as a basis for both hand, tabulated, and computer calculations. This method uses the reflectance coefficients of room surfaces to model the contribution to useful illumination at the working level of the room due to light reflected from the walls and the ceiling. Simplified photometric values are usually given by fixture manufacturers for use in this method.

Computer modeling of outdoor flood lighting usually proceeds directly from photometric data. The total lighting power of a lamp is divided into small solid angular regions. Each region is extended to the surface which is to be lit and the area calculated, giving the light power per unit of area. Where multiple lamps are used to illuminate the same area, each one's contribution is summed. Again the tabulated light levels (in lux or foot-candles) can be presented as contour lines of constant lighting value, overlaid on the project plan drawing. Hand calculations might only be required at a few points, but computer calculations allow a better estimate of the uniformity and lighting level.

The Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia and New Zealand was established in 1930 during the [[Great Depression]].

The [[International Association of Lighting Designers]] (IALD) was founded in 1969, and its current mission is "to serve the IALD worldwide membership by promoting the visible success of its members in practicing lighting design." The organization created a new attitude towards the profession and raised the profile of architectural lighting design, one its principal goals.

The [[Professional Lighting Designers Association]] (PLDA) was formed in 1993 as the European Lighting Designers' Association (ELDA, later ELDA+). Until it was dissolved in 2014, it was with the IALD one of the main authorities regarding lighting design in architecture.

The [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America]] (IESNA) seeks to improve the lighted environment by bringing together those with lighting knowledge and by translating that knowledge into actions that benefit the public.

The National Council on Qualifications for the Lighting Professions (NCQLP) is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 to serve and protect the well-being of the public through effective and efficient lighting practice. Through a peer-review process, the NCQLP establishes the education, experience and examination requirements for baseline certification across the lighting professions. The NCQLP has established a certification process by which practitioners in lighting and related fields, through testing, demonstrate their knowledge and experience across the lighting professions.  Those who successfully complete the NCQLP Lighting Certification Examination are entitled to use the appellation LC (Lighting Certified) after their name for professional purposes.

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) is an organization "devoted to international cooperation and exchange of information among its member countries on all matters relating to the science and art of lighting." CIE works globally to develop and publish lighting design standardization and best-practice documents.

The Professional Lighting &amp; Sound Association ([[PLASA]]) represents the interests of many lighting designers and manufacturers, several of which are involved in the Architectural lighting market. PLASA is UK orientated, but does represent companies on a European and International level.

There are many more nationally-based organizations such as the Schweizerische Licht Gesellschaft (SLG) in Switzerland, the Association des Concepteurs Lumière et Éclairagistes (ACE) in [[France]], the Hellenic Illumination Committee (HIC) in [[Greece]] and the Associazione Professionisti dell'Illuminazione (APIL) in [[Italy]].

== Architectural design media ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}

With the increase in global focus on green design and energy codes, lighting design and its role in sustainability have become more well known, resulting in a number of lighting-specific trade publications and an increase in coverage in architectural publications.

=== Terminology ===
; [[Recessed light]] : The protective housing is concealed behind a ceiling or wall, leaving only the fixture itself exposed. The ceiling-mounted version is often called a downlight.
; "Cans" with a variety of lamps : Jargon for inexpensive [[downlighting]] products that are recessed into the ceiling, or sometimes for uplights placed on the floor. The name comes from the shape of the housing.  The term "pot lights" is often used in Canada and parts of the US.
; [[Cove light]] : Recessed into the ceiling in a long box against a wall.
; Floor lamp
; [[Troffer]] : Recessed fluorescent light fixtures, usually rectangular in shape to fit into a drop ceiling grid.
; [[Surface mount|Surface-mounted]] light : The finished housing is exposed, not flush mount with surface
; [[Chandelier]]
; [[Pendant light]] : Suspended from the ceiling with a chain or pipe
; [[Sconce (light fixture)|Sconce]] : Provide up or down lights; can be used to illuminate artwork, architectural details; commonly used in [[hallway]]s or as an alternative to overhead lighting.
; [[Track lighting]] fixture : Individual fixtures ("track heads") can be positioned anywhere along the track, which provides electric power.
; Under-cabinet light : Mounted below kitchen wall cabinets
; [[Emergency lighting]] or [[exit sign]] : Connected to a [[battery backup]] or to an electric circuit that has [[emergency power system|emergency power]] if the [[mains power]] fails
; High- and low-bay lighting : Typically used for general lighting for industrial buildings and often [[big-box store]]s
; Strip lights or Industrial lighting : Often long lines of fluorescent lamps used in a [[warehouse]] or [[factory]]
; [[Outdoor lighting]] and [[landscape lighting]] : Used to illuminate walkways, [[parking lot]]s, [[roadway]]s, building exteriors and architectural details, [[garden]]s, and [[park]]s.
; [[Bollard]] : A type of architectural outdoor lighting that is a short, upright ground-mounted unit typically used to provide cutoff type illumination for egress lighting, to light walkways, steps, or other pathways.
; [[Street light]]
; [[Flood lighting]] : Usually [[Utility pole|pole]]- or [[stanchion]]-mounted — for landscape, roadways, and parking lots

== Lamp types ==
Types of [[Electricity|electric]] lighting include:
* [[Incandescent light bulb]]s
* [[Arc lamp]]s
* [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s (e.g. [[Fluorescent light|fluorescent]] and [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s, [[neon lamp]]s, [[metal halide lamp]]s, modern [[photographic flash]]es)
* [[Laser]]s
* [[Light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), including [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]s
* [[Sulfur lamp]]s

Different types of lights have vastly differing [[luminous efficiency|efficiencies]] and [[color temperature|color of light]]. [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmsctech/747/747we81.htm]

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Color temperature is defined as the temperature of a [[black body]] emitting a similar spectrum; these spectra are quite different from those of black bodies.&lt;/small&gt;

The most efficient source of electric light is the low-pressure sodium lamp. It produces, for all practical purposes, a [[monochromatic]] orange/yellow light, which gives a similarly monochromatic perceprtion of any illuminated scene. For this reason, it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting usages. Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the [[light pollution]] that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.

=== Incandescent light bulb ===
{{Main article|Incandescent light bulb}}

The modern incandescent light bulb, with a coiled filament of tungsten, was commercialized in the 1920s developed from the carbon [[Electrical filament|filament]] lamp introduced in about 1880. As well as bulbs for normal illumination, there is a very wide range, including low voltage, low-power types often used as components in equipment, but now largely displaced by LEDs

There is currently interest in banning some types of filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia planning to ban standard incandescent light bulbs by 2010, because they are inefficient at converting electricity to light. Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light. Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light. Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then be removed from the building by [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air conditioning]], often resulting in more energy consumption. In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.

==== Halogen lamp ====
{{Main article|Halogen lamp}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
 
Halogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature  over 200&amp;nbsp;°C is generally necessary.  For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz), but sometimes aluminosilicate glass. This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass. The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation. One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from [[fingerprint]]s.  The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.

=== Fluorescent lamp ===
{{Main article|Fluorescent lamp}}

[[Fluorescent lighting|Fluorescent]] lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure. Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy. The inside of the tubes are coated with [[phosphor]]s that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkowitz|first1=Sidney|last2=Henry|first2=A. Joseph|date=23 November 1998|title=Empire of Light:: A History of Discovery in Science and Art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ROHJnk2JOfIC&amp;dq=fluorescent+lights+mercury+vapor+excites|location=|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn= 978-0309065566|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have much higher efficiency than Incandescent lamps. For the same amount of light generated, they typically use around one-quarter to one-third the power of an incandescent.

=== LED lamp ===
{{Main article|Solid-state lighting}}

Solid state [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs) have been popular as indicator lights since the 1970s. In recent years, [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] and output have risen to the point where LEDs are now being used in niche lighting applications.

Indicator LEDs are known for their extremely long life, up to 100,000 hours, but lighting LEDs are operated much less conservatively (due to high LED cost per watt), and consequently have much shorter lives.

Due to the relatively high cost per watt, LED lighting is most useful at very low powers, typically for lamp assemblies of under 10 W. LEDs are currently most useful and [[cost-effective]] in low power applications, such as [[nightlight]]s and [[flashlight]]s. Colored LEDs can also be used for [[accent lighting]], such as for glass objects, and even in fake ice cubes for drinks at parties. They are also being increasingly used as holiday lighting.

[[Light-emitting diodes|LED]] efficiencies vary over a very wide range. Some have lower efficiency than filament lamps, and some significantly higher. LED performance in this respect is prone to being misinterpreted, as the inherent directionality of LEDs gives them a much higher light intensity in one direction per given total light output.

Single color LEDs are well developed technology, but white LEDs at time of writing{{when|date=July 2018}} still have some unresolved issues:
* CRI is not particularly good, resulting in less than accurate color rendition.
* The light distribution from the phosphor does not fully match the distribution of light from the LED die, so color temperature varies at differing angles.
* Phosphor performance degrades over time, resulting in change of color temperature and falling output. With some LEDs degradation can be quite fast.
* Limited heat tolerance means that the amount of power packable into a lamp assembly is a fraction of the power usable in a similarly sized incandescent lamp.

LED technology is useful for lighting designers because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on-and-off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture.

In the last few years, software has been developed to merge lighting and video by enabling lighting designers to stream video content to their LED fixtures, creating low resolution video walls.

The '''Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF)''' is dedicated to advancing core and research biotechnology laboratories through research, communication, and education. ABRF members include over 900 scientists representing 340 different core laboratories in 41 countries, including those in industry, government, academic and research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/page/home/mission.htm|title = ABRF Mission Statement|accessdate = 15 April 2009 |publisher = Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090522203024/http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/page/home/mission.htm| archivedate= 22 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1986 a Research Resource Facility Satellite Meeting was held in conjunction with the Sixth International Conference on Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. The next year protein sequencing and amino acid samples were sent to survey 103 core facilities. By 1989 the ABRF was formally organized and incorporated. Each year an annual meeting was held as a satellite meeting of the Protein Society until 1996 when separate meetings began.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, JW: "ABRF; A Brief History" ABRF News, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABRF Research Groups==
Research Groups are established to fulfill two of the purposes of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities. First, to provide mechanisms for the self-evaluation and improvement of procedural and operational accuracy, precision and efficiency in resource facilities and research laboratories. Second, to contribute to the education of resource facility and research laboratory staff, users, administrators, and interested members of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrf.org/Other/RG_Comm_Guidelines/RG_Handbook_2010.pdf |title=Research Group Guidelines |accessdate=15 April 2009 |publisher=Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131071558/http://www.abrf.org/Other/RG_Comm_Guidelines/RG_Handbook_2010.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of ABRF Research Group studies have  been published in scientific papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00881|title=ABRF Proteome Informatics Research Group (iPRG) 2015 Study: Detection of Differentially Abundant Proteins in Label-Free Quantitative LC–MS/MS Experiments|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcponline.org/content/13/1/360|title=Proteome informatics research group (iPRG)_2012: a study on detecting modified peptides in a complex mixture|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=ASBMB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcponline.org/content/14/12/3299|title=The 2012/2013 ABRF Proteomic Research Group Study: Assessing Longitudinal Intralaboratory Variability in Routine Peptide Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analyses|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=ASBMB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the data reused in subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203224|title=Bayesian analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry for binding thermodynamics|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=PLOS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00899|title=A Protein Standard That Emulates Homology for the Characterization of Protein Inference Algorithms|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4923-3|title=A new estimation of protein-level false discovery rate|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=BMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firetube boiler sections.PNG|thumb|right|Sections of a [[steam locomotive]] showing the many [[fire-tube boiler|fire-tubes]] which carry the hot gases of the fire through the boiler to heat the water and so create steam.]]
'''Boiler design''' is the process of designing [[boiler]]s used for various purposes. The main function of a boiler is to heat water to generate steam. [[Steam]] produced in a boiler can be used for a variety of purposes including [[space heating]], [[soil steam sterilization|sterilisation]], [[drying]], [[humidification]] and [[power generation]]. The temperature or condition of steam required for these applications is different, so boiler designs vary accordingly.

== Modern design benefits ==
[[File:Steam Technology Centre.jpg|thumb|Boiler in the steam technology center at [[College of Engineering, Pune]]]]
Modern boiler design offers several benefits. In the past, improper design of boilers has caused [[Boiler explosion|explosions]] which led to loss of life and property. Modern designs attempt to avoid such mishaps.  Further, mathematical modeling can determine how much space a boiler will need and the type of materials to be used.  When the design specifications of a boiler are determined, design engineers can estimate a cost and time schedule for the construction.

Boiler design may be based upon:
* Production of a maximum quantity of steam with minimal fuel consumption
* Economic feasibility of installation
* Minimal operator attention required during operation
* Capability for quick starting
* Conformity to safety regulations
* Quality of raw water : how hard or soft the water is will determine the material of the boiler.
* Heat source - the fuel to be burned and its [[:wikt:ash|ash]] properties&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Basics of boiler and HRSG design |author=Brad Buecker |page=59 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-87814-795-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the process material from which the heat is to be recovered.
* Capacity/steam output required, usually measured in tonnes per hour or kg/s.
* Steam condition - pressure, temperature, etc.
* Safety considerations
* Mechanical constraints
* Cost restrictions
* Monetary cost
* Tensile strength of material must be considered while using any joining processes.&lt;ref&gt;"Elements of Workshop Technology", S Hajra Choudhury, Nirjhar Joy&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessories and mountings are devices which form an integral part of boiler but are not mounted on it. They include economizers, superheaters, feed pumps and air pre-heaters. Accessories help in controlling and running the boiler efficiently.  Certain common mountings (specifically those required by the Indian Boiler Act) include:
* Feed check valve - regulates the flow of water into the boiler and prevents the back flow of water in case of failure of the feed pump.
* Steam stop valve - regulates the flow of steam that is produced in the boiler to the steam pipe, and may also be used to stop the supply of steam from the boiler
* [[Fusible plug]] - placed at the lowest level of water and above the combustion chamber, its function is to extinguish the fire as soon as the water level in the shell of the boiler falls below a certain marked level.
* Blow-off cock - removes water from the shell at regular intervals to remove the various impurities that may be settled at the bottom of the shell.
* Safety valves - automatically prevent the steam pressure from exceeding safe levels
* Water-level indicators - indicate the level of water in the shell.

[[File:Doorway bridgeplate in low-floor LRV.jpg|thumb|An extended bridge plate in a low-floor light rail car]]
A '''bridge plate''', or '''bridgeplate''', is a mechanical, movable form of [[wheelchair ramp]] that is used on some [[low-floor]] [[light rail vehicle]]s (LRVs) to provide for [[wheelchair]] access. The bridge plate extends from the vehicle to the [[railway platform|platform]], which must be raised to close to the level of the floor of the vehicle so that the wheelchair need not travel over an excessively steep ramp (in the [[United States]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] specifies that the slope must be no more than 1 inch of rise for every 12 inches of length).  Some low-floor [[bus]]es also use bridge plates (in this case, extending to the curb) to provide for wheelchair access, but many [[low-floor bus]]es instead use a [[wheelchair ramp|ramp]] that normally serves as part of the floor but can be flipped out through the door (using a hinge at the door) onto the curb or street; in this case the ramp is long enough that it can serve as a true wheelchair ramp rather than a bridge without being excessively steep.

Bridge plates can be manually deployed (by the vehicle operator or other crew person) or powered, rectractable ramps.&lt;ref name="APTA-2013-guideline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Modern Streetcar Vehicle Guideline |url=http://www.apta.com/resources/standards/Documents/APTA-RT-ST-GL-001-13.pdf |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |at=p. 37 [p. 40 of PDF] |date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first passenger rail cars in North America to be equipped with retractable bridge plates were [[TriMet]]'s ([[Portland, Oregon]]) [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] SD660 LRVs,&lt;ref name="railway-age-2016"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vantuono |first1=William C. |title=Retractable bridge plates a first for Brightline |url=https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/intercity/retractable-bridge-plates-a-first-for-brightline/ |accessdate=2018-07-09 |magazine=[[Railway Age]] |date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of which were completed in 1996.&lt;ref name="coolnewmodel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Gordon|title=MAX takes keys to cool new model|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=August 1, 1996|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1987, the newly opened [[Sacramento RT Light Rail]] system used non-powered, station-platform-mounted bridge plates to bridge the gap between a high-platform section at each station and the floor of an LRV.&lt;ref name="TRB-221"&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Report 221: Light Rail Transit – New System Successes at Affordable Prices |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/sr/sr221/221.pdf |publisher=[[Transportation Research Board]] |accessdate=2018-07-09 |date=May 1988 |at=Section "Sacramento", pp. 157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41004">[[File:Still from footage recorded by Edward Turner, 1902. (7996010096).jpg|thumb|300px|Still from test film made by [[Edward Raymond Turner|Edward Turner]] in 1902]]
'''Color motion picture film''' refers both to unexposed [[color photography|color photographic film]] in a format suitable for use in a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and to finished motion picture [[film]], ready for use in a [[movie projector|projector]], which bears images in color.

The first color cinematography was by [[additive color]] systems such as the one patented by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899 and tested in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19598445 "Martin Scorsese on world's first colour film discovery"]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified additive system was successfully commercialised in 1909 as [[Kinemacolor]]. These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color [[filter (optics)|filters]].

Around 1920, the first practical [[subtractive color]] processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, but the final product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip [[Technicolor]] was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.

In 1935, [[Kodachrome]] was introduced, followed by [[Agfacolor]] in 1936. They were intended primarily for amateur [[home movies]] and "[[Reversal film|slides]]". These were the first films of the "integral tripack" type, coated with three layers of differently color-sensitive [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]], which is usually what is meant by the words "color film" as commonly used. The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type. The first color [[negative (photography)|negative]] films and corresponding [[release print|print]] films were modified versions of these films. They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s. In the US, [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Eastmancolor]] was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as "WarnerColor", by the studio or the film processor.

Later color films were standardized into two distinct processes: [[Eastman Color Negative|Eastman Color Negative 2]] chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and internegative stocks) and [[Eastman Color Positive|Eastman Color Positive 2]] chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products are compatible with ECN-2 and ECP-2.

Film was the dominant form of cinematography until the 2010s, when it was largely replaced by [[digital cinematography]].&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And There's a Happy Ending|website=Indiewire|last1=Hurley|first1=Michael|date=2 January 2014|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|archive-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first motion pictures were photographed using a simple homogeneous [[photographic emulsion]] that yielded a [[black-and-white]] image—that is, an image in shades of gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the [[luminous intensity]] of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.

With color motion picture film, information about the [[color]] of the light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the [[visible spectrum]] of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: red, green and blue) and recording each region separately.

Current color films do this with three layers of differently color-sensitive photographic emulsion coated on one strip of [[film base]]. Early processes used color [[filter (optics)|filters]] to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip [[Technicolor]]) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., [[Dufaycolor]]) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.

Each photographed color component, initially just a colorless record of the luminous intensities in the part of the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color [[complementary color|complementary]] to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the [[subtractive color]] method. In some early color processes (e.g., [[Kinemacolor]]), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through [[color filter]]s to synthesize the original colors by the [[additive color]] method.

==Tinting and hand coloring==
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The earliest motion picture stocks were [[orthochromatic]], and recorded blue and green light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock [[panchromatic]] to some degree. Since orthochromatic film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used [[aniline]] dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with [[Thomas Edison]]'s hand-painted ''Annabelle's Dance'' for his [[Kinetoscope]] viewers.

Many early filmmakers from the first ten years of film also used this method to some degree. [[George Méliès]] offered hand-painted prints of his own films at an additional cost over the black-and-white versions, including the visual-effects pioneering ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune|A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902). The film had various parts of the film painted frame-by-frame by twenty-one women in Montreuil&lt;ref name="history"&gt;David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a production-line method.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful [[stencil]] color process was introduced in 1905 by [[Pathé Frères]]. ''Pathé Color'', renamed [[Pathéchrome]] in 1929, became one of the most accurate and reliable stencil coloring systems. It incorporated an original print of a film with sections cut by [[pantograph]] in the appropriate areas for up to six colors&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; by a coloring machine with dye-soaked, velvet rollers.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stencil had been made for the whole film, it was placed into contact with the print to be colored and run at high speed (60 feet per minute) through the coloring (staining) machine. The process was repeated for each set of stencils corresponding to a different color. By 1910, Pathé had over 400 women employed as stencilers in their [[Vincennes]] factory.  Pathéchrome continued production through the 1930s.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

A more common technique emerged in the early 1910s known as '''[[film tinting]]''', a process in which either the emulsion or the [[film base]] is dyed, giving the image a uniform [[monochromatic]] color.  This process was popular during the silent era, with specific colors employed for certain narrative effects (red for scenes with fire or firelight, blue for night, etc.).&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A complementary process, called '''toning''', replaces the [[silver]] particles in the film with metallic salts or [[mordant]]ed [[dye]]s.  This creates a color effect in which the dark parts of the image are replaced with a color (e.g., blue and white rather than black and white).  Tinting and toning were sometimes applied together.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

In the United States, St. Louis engraver Max Handschiegl and cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff created the [[Handschiegl Color Process]], a dye-transfer equivalent of the stencil process, first used in ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917) directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and used in special effects sequences for films such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[Eastman Kodak]] introduced its own system of pre-tinted black-and-white film stocks called [[Sonochrome]] in 1929.  The Sonochrome line featured films tinted in seventeen different colors including Peachblow, Inferno, Candle Flame, Sunshine, Purple Haze, Firelight, Azure, Nocturne, Verdante, Aquagreen,&lt;ref name="readfilm" /&gt; Caprice, Fleur de Lis, Rose Doree, and the neutral-density Argent, which kept the screen from becoming excessively bright when switching to a black-and-white scene.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Tinting and toning continued to be used well into the sound era.  In the 1930s and 1940s, some western films were processed in a sepia-toning solution to evoke the feeling of old photographs of the day. Tinting was used as late as 1951 for [[Sam Newfield]]'s sci-fi film ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'' for the green lost-world sequences. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used a form of hand-coloring for the orange-red gun-blast at the audience in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Kodak's Sonochrome and similar pre-tinted stocks were still in production until the 1970s and were used commonly for custom theatrical trailers and [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipes]].

In the last half of the 20th century, [[Norman McLaren]], who was one of the pioneers in animated movies, made several animated films in which he directly hand-painted the images, and in some cases, also the soundtrack, on each frame of the film. This approach was previously employed in the early years of movies, late 19th and early 20th century. One of the precursors in color hand painting frame by frame was the Aragonese Segundo de Chomon, that worked with Melies.

Tinting was gradually replaced by natural color techniques.

==Physics of light and color==
The principles on which [[color photography]] is based were first proposed by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855 and presented at the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1861.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  By that time, it was known that [[light]] comprises a spectrum of different wavelengths that are perceived as different colors as they are absorbed and reflected by natural objects.  Maxwell discovered that all natural colors in this spectrum as perceived by the human eye may be reproduced with additive combinations of three [[primary color]]s—[[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]—which, when mixed equally, produce white light.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Between 1900 and 1935, dozens of natural color systems were introduced, although only a few were successful.&lt;ref name="readfilm"&gt;Monaco, James (1981) (Revised ed) ''How to Read a Film'' Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive color===
The first color systems that appeared in motion pictures were [[additive color]] systems.  Additive color was practical because no special color stock was necessary.  Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection.  The various additive systems entailed the use of color [[filter (photography)|filters]] on both the movie camera and [[movie projector|projector]].  Additive color adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image.  Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because the lack of a camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture color systems consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A pioneering three-color additive system was patented in England by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour moving pictures discovered|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951l|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a rotating set of red, green and blue filters to photograph the three color components one after the other on three successive [[film frame|frame]]s of [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format [[nitrate film]] copied to black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by [[telecine]]. Finally, [[digital image processing]] was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianpritchard.com/Lee_Turner_Project.htm Pritchard, B. (2012). "Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum".] Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour film unveiled|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9538882/Worlds-first-colour-film-unveiled.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Visit to the Seaside (1908).webm|thumb|''A Visit to the Seaside'', the first motion picture in Kinemacolor]]
[[File:The Delhi Durbar 1911.webm|thumb|''With Our King and Queen Through India'', extract]]
Practical color in the motion picture business began with [[Kinemacolor]], first demonstrated in 1906.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;  This was a two-color system created in England by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], and promoted by film pioneer [[Charles Urban]]'s The Charles Urban Trading Company in 1908.  It was used for a series of films including the documentary ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', depicting the [[Delhi Durbar]] (also known as ''The Durbar at Delhi'', 1912), which was filmed in December 1911. The Kinemacolor process consisted of alternating frames of specially sensitized black-and-white film exposed at 32 frames per second through a rotating filter with alternating red and green areas. The printed film was projected through similar alternating red and green filters at the same speed. A perceived range of colors resulted from the blending of the separate red and green alternating images by the viewer's persistence of vision.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1917) "Kinemacolor" ''How to Make and Operate Moving Pictures'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Courtesy of [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com Wide Screen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Friese-Greene]] invented another additive color system called Biocolour, which was developed by his son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] after William's death in 1921.  William sued George Albert Smith, alleging that the Kinemacolor process infringed on the patents for his Bioschemes, Ltd.; as a result, Smith's patent was revoked in 1914.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Both Kinemacolor and Biocolour had problems with "fringing" or "haloing" of the image, due to the separate red and green images not fully matching up.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

By their nature, these additive systems were very wasteful of light. Absorption by the color filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color [[video]] and computer display systems in common use today.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Subtractive color===
The first practical [[subtractive color]] process was introduced by Kodak as "Kodachrome", a name recycled twenty years later for a very different and far better-known product. Filter-photographed red and blue-green records were printed onto the front and back of one strip of black-and-white [[duplitized film]]. After development, the resulting silver images were bleached away and replaced with color dyes, red on one side and cyan on the other. The pairs of superimposed dye images reproduced a useful but limited range of color. Kodak's first narrative film with the process was a short subject entitled ''Concerning $1000'' (1916). Though their duplitized film provided the basis for several commercialized two-color printing processes, the image origination and color-toning methods constituting Kodak's own process were little-used.

The first truly successful subtractive color process was William van Doren Kelley's [[Prizma]],&lt;ref name="afipriz"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Prizma Color" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight p. 271. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early color process that was first introduced at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City on 8 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra0eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage Museum Notes], ''The American Museum Journal'' (1917), vol. 17, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell-Clyne, Adrian. (1951) ''Colour Cinematography'' Chapman and Hall press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prizma began in 1916 as an additive system similar to Kinemacolor.

However, after 1917, Kelley reinvented the process as a subtractive one with several years of short films and travelogues, such as ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and ''A Prizma Color Visit to Catalina'' (1919) before releasing features such as the documentary ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921), ''[[The Glorious Adventure (1922 film)|The Glorious Adventure]]'' (1922), and ''[[Venus of the South Seas]]'' (1924). A Prizma promotional short filmed for [[Del Monte Foods]] titled ''Sunshine Gatherers'' (1921) is available on DVD in Treasures 5 The West 1898–1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

The invention of Prizma led to a series of similarly printed color processes.  This [[bipack color]] system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive color print.

[[Leon Forrest Douglass]] (1869–1940), a founder of [[Victor Records]], developed a system he called Naturalcolor, and first showed a short test film made in the process on 15 May 1917 at his home in [[San Rafael, California]].  The only feature film known to have been made in this process, ''[[Cupid Angling]]'' (1918) — starring [[Ruth Roland]] and with cameo appearances by [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] — was filmed in the Lake Lagunitas area of [[Marin County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Gracyk, Tim. ''[http://www.gracyk.com/leon.shtml Leon F. Douglass: Inventor and Victor's First Vice-President]'' (Retrieved on 2007-03-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After experimenting with additive systems (including a [[movie camera|camera]] with two [[apertures]], one with a red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. [[Herbert Kalmus]], Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a [[subtractive color]] system for [[Technicolor]]. The system used a [[beam splitter]] in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

The process was later refined through the incorporation of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single print, avoiding several problems that had become evident with the cemented prints and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Technicolor's system was very popular for a number of years, but it was a very expensive process: shooting cost three times that of black-and-white photography and printing costs were no cheaper. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by major studios, until Technicolor developed a new advancement to record all three primary colors. Utilizing a special [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] equipped with two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was deflected by the prisms and split into two paths to expose each one of three black-and-white negatives (one each to record the densities for red, green, and blue).&lt;ref name="afitech"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Technicolor" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338-340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three negatives were then printed to gelatin matrices, which also completely bleached the image, washing out the silver and leaving only the gelatin record of the image. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density print of the black-and-white negative for the green record strip, and including the soundtrack, was struck and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (this "black" layer was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrices for each strip were coated with their complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), and then each successively brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, which collectively rendered a wider spectrum of color than previous technologies.&lt;ref name="awsm"&gt;Hart, Martin (2003). "[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]" Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved 2006-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The first animation film with the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), the first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first feature was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

[[Gasparcolor]], a single-strip 3-color system, was developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oskarfischinger.org/GasparColor.htm|title=Gasparcolor: Perfect Hues for Animation|publisher=Fischinger Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.

In 1947, the United States Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Technicolor for monopolization of color cinematography (even though rival processes such as [[Cinecolor]] and [[Trucolor]] were in general use). In 1950, a federal court ordered Technicolor to allot a number of its three-strip cameras for use by independent studios and filmmakers. Although this certainly affected Technicolor, its real undoing was the invention of [[Eastmancolor]] that same year.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Monopack color film==
[[Image:35mm-undevel.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A strip of undeveloped 35 mm color negative.]]

In the field of motion pictures, the many-layered type of color film normally called an ''integral tripack'' in broader contexts has long been known by the less tongue-twisting term ''monopack''. For many years, Monopack (capitalized) was a proprietary product of Technicolor Corp, whereas monopack (not capitalized) generically referred to any of several single-strip color film products, certainly including various Eastman Kodak products. It appears that Technicolor made no attempt to register Monopack as a trademark with the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]], although it certainly asserted that term as if it were a registered trademark, and it had the force of a legal agreement between it and Eastman Kodak to back up that assertion. It was a solely-sourced product, too, as Eastman Kodak was legally prevented from marketing any color motion picture film products wider than 16mm, 35mm specifically, until the expiration of the so-called "Monopack Agreement" in 1950. This, notwithstanding the facts that Technicolor never had the capability to manufacture sensitized motion picture films of any kind, nor single-strip color films based upon its so-called "Troland Patent" (which patent Technicolor maintained covered all monopack-type films in general, but monopack-type motion picture films in particular, and which Eastman Kodak elected not to contest as Technicolor was then one of its largest customers, if not its largest customer). After 1950, Eastman Kodak was free to make and market color films of any kind, particularly including monopack color motion picture films in 65/70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm. The "Monopack Agreement" had no effect on color still films.

Monopack color films are based on the subtractive color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the [[complementary color|complementary]] subtractive primary.

[[Kodachrome]] was the first commercially successful application of monopack multilayer film, introduced in 1935.&lt;ref name="explore"&gt;''Exploring the Color Image'' (1996) Eastman Kodak Publication H-188.&lt;/ref&gt; For professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 35mm [[Film perforations#BH|BH-perforated]] base, was available exclusively from Technicolor, as its so-called "Technicolor Monopack" product. Similarly, for sub-professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 16mm base, was available exclusively from Eastman Kodak. In both cases, Eastman Kodak was the sole manufacturer and the sole processor. In the 35mm case, Technicolor [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer]] printing was a "tie-in" product.&lt;ref&gt;The tie-in ensures the quality of the tied-good when the tied good (dye-transfer printing, in this case) is used in conjunction with the tying good (Three-Strip or Monopack origination, in this case), paraphrasing ''Tie-in Sales and Price Discrimination'', S. J. Liebowitz, University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16mm case, there were Eastman Kodak duplicating and printing stocks and associated chemistry, not the same as a "tie-in" product. In exceptional cases, Technicolor offered 16mm dye-transfer printing, but this necessitated the exceptionally wasteful process of printing on a 35mm base, only thereafter to be re-perforated and re-slit to 16mm, thereby discarding slightly more than one-half of the end product.

A late modification to the "Monopack Agreement", the "Imbibition Agreement", finally allowed Technicolor to economically manufacture 16mm dye-transfer prints as so-called "double-rank" 35/32mm prints (two 16mm prints on a 35mm base that was originally perforated at the 16mm specification for both halves, and was later re-slit into two 16mm wide prints without the need for re-perforation). This modification also facilitated the early experiments by Eastman Kodak with its negative-positive monopack film, which eventually became Eastmancolor. Essentially, the "Imbibition Agreement" lifted a portion of the "Monopack Agreement's" restrictions on Technicolor (which prevented it from making motion picture products less than 35mm wide) and somewhat related restrictions on Eastman Kodak (which prevented it from experimenting and developing monopack products greater than 16mm wide).

[[Eastmancolor]], introduced in 1950,&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm Chronology of Motion Picture Films: 1940–1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625062139/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm |date=2009-06-25 }}, Kodak.&lt;/ref&gt; was Kodak's first economical, single-strip [[35 mm film|35 mm]] negative-positive process incorporated into one strip of film.  This rendered Three-Strip color photography relatively obsolete, even though, for the first few years of Eastmancolor, Technicolor continued to offer Three-Strip origination combined with dye-transfer printing (150 titles produced in 1953, 100 titles produced in 1954 and 50 titles produced in 1955, the very last year for Three-Strip).  The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the documentary ''[[Royal Journey]]'', released in December 1951.&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"/&gt;  Hollywood studios waited until an improved version of Eastmancolor negative came out in 1952 before using it; ''[[This is Cinerama]]'' was an early film which employed three separate and interlocked strips of Eastmancolor negative. ''This is Cinerama'' was initially printed on Eastmancolor positive, but its significant success eventually resulted in it being reprinted by Technicolor, using dye-transfer.

By 1953, and especially with the introduction of anamorphic wide screen [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]], Eastmancolor became a marketing imperative as CinemaScope was incompatible with Technicolor's Three-Strip camera and lenses. Indeed, Technicolor Corp became one of the best, if not the best, processor of Eastmancolor negative, especially for so-called "wide gauge" negatives (5-perf 65mm, 6-perf 35mm), yet it far preferred its own 35mm dye-transfer printing process for Eastmancolor-originated films with a print run that exceeded 500 prints,&lt;ref&gt;At one point, Technicolor implemented a two-tiered print pricing structure, one for dye-transfer prints, which favored large volume printing, and one Eastmancolor prints, which favored small volume printing—but this was after the "tie-in" between origination and printing had been broken by the abandonment of Three-Strip and Monopack origination. For small print runs, dye-transfer remained an option, but at a significantly higher cost.&lt;/ref&gt; not withstanding the significant "loss of register" that occurred in such prints that were expanded by CinemaScope's 2X horizontal factor, and, to a lesser extent, with so-called "flat wide screen" (variously 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but spherical and not anamorphic). This nearly fatal flaw was not corrected until 1955 and caused numerous features initially printed by Technicolor to be scrapped and reprinted by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Labs]]. (These features are often billed as "Color by Technicolor-DeLuxe".) Indeed, some Eastmancolor-originated films billed as "Color by Technicolor" were never actually printed using the dye-transfer process, due in part to the throughput limitations of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process, and competitor DeLuxe's superior throughput. Incredibly, DeLuxe once had a license to install a Technicolor-type dye-transfer printing line, but as the "loss of register" problems became apparent in Fox's CinemaScope features that were printed by Technicolor, after Fox had become an all-CinemaScope producer, Fox-owned DeLuxe Labs abandoned its plans for dye-transfer printing and became, and remained, an all-Eastmancolor shop, as Technicolor itself later became.

Technicolor continued to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer printing process for projection prints until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998.  As an archival format, Technicolor prints are one of the most stable color print processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries.&lt;ref name="wilhelm"&gt;Wilhelm, Henry with Brower, Carol (1993) ''The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs''.

Improperly stored monopack color film from before 1983 can incur a 30 percent image loss in as little as 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, Jay (June 1999).

==How a color film works==
[[Image:Color film.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A representation of the layers within a piece of developed color 35 mm negative film. When developed, the dye couplers in the blue-, green-, and red-sensitive layers turn the exposed silver halide crystals to their complementary colors (yellow, magenta, and cyan). The film is made up of (A) Clear protective topcoat, (B) UV filter, (C) "Fast" blue layer, (D) "Slow" blue layer, (E) Yellow filter to cut all blue light from passing through to (F) "Fast" green layer, (G) "Slow" green layer, (H) Inter (subbing) layer, (I) "Fast" red layer, (J) "Slow" red layer, (K) Clear triacetate base, and (L) Antihalation (rem-jet) backing.]]

A color film is made up of many different layers that work together to create the color image.  Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers.  A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color negative film is shown in the figure at the right.  Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" (8&amp;nbsp;µm) thick.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;''Kodak Motion Picture Film (H1)'' (4th ed). Eastman Kodak Company. {{ISBN|0-87985-477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three color records are stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top to keep the non-visible ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light.  Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image.  When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color.  This forms a dye "cloud" (like a drop of water on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue).&lt;ref name="stockone"&gt;Holben, Jay. (April 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 1 of 2. ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 118-130&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two layers to each color; a "fast" and a "slow."  The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light.  Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are on the top of the film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure.  Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed.  Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the [[film base]] is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.&lt;ref name="hone" /&gt;

Eastman Kodak manufactures film in 54-inch (1,372&amp;nbsp;mm) wide rolls.  These rolls are then slit into various sizes (70&amp;nbsp;mm, 65&amp;nbsp;mm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm) as needed.

==Manufacturers of color film for motion picture use==
{{see also|List of motion picture film stocks}}

Motion picture film, primarily because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard [[C-41 process]] color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.

===Kodak color motion picture films===
In the late 1980s, Kodak introduced the [[Tabular-grain film|T-Grain]] emulsion, a technological advancement in the shape and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks.&lt;ref name="stocktwo"&gt;Probst, Christopher. (May 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 2 of 2 ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 110-120&lt;/ref&gt; This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.

===Fuji color motion picture films===
Fuji films also integrate tabular grains in their SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain is not only tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same light sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, the first in a new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.

'''Composite lumber''' is a material that is a mixture of [[wood fiber]], [[plastic]], and some type of [[binding agent]]. These ingredients are put together to form a material that is denser, stronger, and heavier than wood alone, a [[wood-plastic composite]].

==History==
Until the 1990s, wood was the material of choice for [[deck (building)|deck construction]]. However, new products, [[wood-plastic composite|composites]], began to emerge at this time. These new products offered the look and workability of wood, but they were more water resistant and required less maintenance. Over time, these lower maintenance decking options increased in popularity. Although the majority of decks are still built of [[pressure treated]] pine, redwood, cedar or mahogany, use of composite woods has increased as outdoor decks and living areas have become popular as home features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Carter |url=http://www.askthebuilder.com/composite-decking/ |title=Composite Decking |publisher=Ask the Builder |date=2005-08-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Working with composite lumber is similar to working with wood. However, composite lumber has the added benefit of being less likely to split or [[delamination|delaminate]]. Some composite lumber is also engineered to be lighter weight for easier handling. Composite lumber is also more stain, scratch, and mold resistant, and is therefore supposed to have a longer life than wood lumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Composite Decking?|url=http://www.latitudesdeck.com/whatis.htm|publisher=Latitudes Decking &amp; Railing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]
Composite lumber comes from the manufacturer as a finished product. There is no need to stain, sand, or paint the material. Composite materials usually cost more than [[lumber]], but their long life and low-maintenance requirements could make them more economical in the long run. Many composites are often made partially out of [[recycled plastic]]s and waste wood, which makes them an environmentally friendly, efficient use of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Benefits of Wood-Plastic Composite|url=http://www.sinoconcept.com/2011/08/5-benefits-of-wood-plastic-composite/|publisher=Sino Concept|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Composite lumber is usually more costly than normal or treated lumber. Composites may last longer, but the initial investment is likely to be higher. Many composites are formulated to be fade, scratch, and stain resistant, but no lumber is immune to the elements. Although composite lumber may resist these marring effects better than other materials, it will still show signs of wear over time. Composite lumber often has a plastic-like or synthetic appearance. Although manufacturers do mold the product with a wood grain or brush stroke pattern, some consumers simply do not like the artificial sheen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dinodecking.com/blog/composite-vs-timber-decking-which-is-best/ |title=Composite vs Timber Decking |publisher=dinodecking.com |date=2017-08-01 |accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=John|title=Decking Decisions|url=http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,220405-4,00.html|publisher=This Old House|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Impact===
The growth of wood-alternative products continues to fuel a debate about their environmental value when compared to wood, treated wood, metal and other alternatives. Many suggest that wood decking is made from a more sustainable ingredient and that it carries a smaller manufacturing carbon footprint. Others have claimed that the sawing of wood-alternative products during construction creates dust that will not biodegrade and that the wood-alternative deck boards, when they have outlived their useful lives, will not biodegrade in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowyer|first=Jim|title=Wood-Plastic Composite Lumber vs. Wood Decking: A Comparison of Performance Characteristics and Environmental Attributes|url=http://dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailPlasticDeck0710.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capped composite decking==
'''Capped composite decking''' is composite decking, with a thin, approximately 1/16th inch, [[PVC]]-like veneer, or cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://deckadvisor.com/2011/01/09/pvc-deck-boards-or-capped-composite/ |title=PVC Deck Boards or Capped Composite? |publisher=Deckadvisor.com |date=January 9, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cap provides protection for the composite underneath. The cap is also formulated differently, in order to provide increased fade, stain, and scratch resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolsofthetrade.net/industry-news.asp?sectionID=0&amp;articleID=1165239&amp;artnum=2 Product Monitor: Decked Out&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Capped composite decking is more expensive than both normal composite decking and wood decking because of the more involved manufacturing process in adding the second, co extruded layer to the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=So what is co extrusion anyways? &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|url=http://www.mbadeck.net/category/deck-tips/|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=MBAdeck|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Capped composites also lack the feel of real wood. Although manufacturers form the product with a realistic wood grain or brush stroke, some contractors and deck owners will not accept the artificial sheen. Capped composites, although formulated to resist fading, stains, and scratches, will show some wear over time, even if it is less than a normal composite or real wood product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deckmastersnw.com/blog/which-composite-decking-is-the-best/ Which Composite decking is the best? | Deck Masters, llc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Composite Deck Boards are sold in either grooved or solid sided versions. The grooved composite board is fastened with hidden deck fasteners or clips, while the solid board is typically face-screwed. Most Composite Deck Board manufacturers produce 12', 16', or 20' deck boards, 5-1/2" wide, x 3/4" high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedeckstoreonline.com/decking.html|title=Composite Decking | publisher=The Deck Store Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers of capped composite boards will often leave one side uncapped to prevent the material from expanding and mushrooming out of the corners of the boards. This is usually the bottom side and allows the material within to expand and contract naturally during varying weather conditions, without causing lasting damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deckinghero.com/boards/composite|title=Composite (WPC) Decking Boards|last=Watson|first=Michael|date=|publisher=Decking Hero|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental to modern [[information architecture]]s, and driven by [http://www.webreference.com/internet/semantic/ semantic Web] technologies, '''content re-appropriation''' is the act of searching, filtering, gathering, grouping, and aggregation which allows information to be related, classified and identified.  This is achieved by applying syntactic or semantic meaning though intelligent tagging or artificial interpretation of fragmented content (see [[Resource Description Framework]]).  Hence, all information becomes valuable and interpretable.

==Domain==
Since the domain of Content applies to areas of [[software applications]], [[document]]s, and [[Computer media|media]], these can be processed though a pipeline of generation, aggregation, transform-many, and serialization (see [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-pipeline/ XML Pipeline]).  The output of this can viewed in a medium most effect for decision making.

The desired outcomes of content re-appropriation are:

*Seamless, Integrated, and Shared User experiences
*[[Software visualization|Visualization]]
*Detection, Analysis &amp; Investigation
*[[Personalization]] unique to the User
*Inbound or Outbound [[web syndication|Syndication]] of Information
*[[Publish]] or [[Subscribe]] to Information
*Dynamically adapted output to Users medium

Essentially to make ''information'' disparities transparent to the [[user (computing)|user]] - getting to the bottom line … quickly.

==Areas of Use==
Content re-appropriation is effective across the [[Content-Tier]], that is places where Content exists:

*Identity &amp; Directory Management e.g. [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[Security Assertion Markup Language|SAML]] &amp; [[JNDI]]
*Content Management e.g. [http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/ Apache Slide]
*Content Systems e.g. [[File System]]s, [[E-mail]], [[Network share]]s, [[Storage Area Network|SAN]] &amp; [[Database]]
*Business Systems e.g. [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] &amp; [[Customer Relationship Management|CRM]]
*Data Warehouse e.g. [[OLAP]]
*Internet &amp; Web Services e.g. [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] &amp; [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]]
*[[Instant messenger|Presence]] and [[peer-To-Peer]]

The '''Defence Science and Technology Laboratory''' ('''Dstl''') is an [[executive agency]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Its stated purpose is "to maximise the impact of science and technology for the defence and security of the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dstl.gov.uk/aboutus|title=About us|publisher=Dstl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021183240/https://www.dstl.gov.uk/aboutus|archivedate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=16 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency is headed by Gary Aitkenhead as its Chief Executive, with the board being chaired by Sir [[David Pepper (intelligence official)|David Pepper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Chairman of the Dstl Board |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory|publisher=Dstl |date=8 July 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ministerial responsibility lies with the [[Minister for Defence Procurement]].

==History==
Dstl was formed from the July 2001 split of the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA). Dstl was established to carry out and retain the science and technology work that is best done within government,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dstl.gov.uk/downloads/framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while the majority of DERA's activities and that suitable for industry was transferred to [[Qinetiq]], a wholly owned government company before being floated on the stock exchange. 

Dstl absorbed the Home Office's Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST) in April 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/centre-for-applied-science-and-technology-cast-becomes-part-of-dstl|title=Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST) becomes part of Dstl|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, taking on CAST's role&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530164/intro-to-cast-june2016.pdf|title=Home Office Science: Centre for Applied Science and Technology: An Introduction|last=|first=|publisher=Home Office|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78655-083-5|location=United Kingdom|pages=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to apply science and technology to support the Home Office's operations and frontline delivery, provision of evidence to support policy, and provide certain regulatory functions. 

Dstl existed as a [[Trading Fund]] of the MOD from its formation in 2001 until 2016, when it became an [[Executive Agency]] of the MOD.

==Organisation==
Dstl is an [[executive agency]] sponsored by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Most funding comes from the MOD, while a small portion comes from other government departments and commercial sources. According to 2016/17 figures, 91% of Dstl's £587m income came from the MOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/621570/20170622-Dstl_ARAC_2016-17_FINAL_v1_0-O_WEB-OPTIMISED.pdf|title=Defence Science and Technology Laboratory annual report and accounts 2016 to 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Dstl completed a major reorganisation, merging twelve operating departments into five divisions on 1 April 2015. The motivation behind this change was to enable more coherent and productive delivery to customers and simplify access routes for suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/444625/20150622-Dstl_ARAC_2014-15_FINAL_v1_1-O_PRINT-READY.pdf|title = Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15|date = 22 June 2015|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Defence Science and Technology Laboratory|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Dstl has had four permanent Chief Executives:
* [[Martin Earwicker]] (2001–06): was Chief Executive from its creation in 2001, until he left in 2006 for the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-395888/MoD-seaches-new-James-Bond-style-Q.html|title=MoD searches for a new James Bond-style Q|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=16 February 2014|year=2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Dstl carries out a broad range of work from high-level analysis to support Ministry of Defence policy and procurement decisions, to technical research in defence areas such as [[healthcare science|biomedical science]] and [[electronics]], alongside operational work such as [[forensic science|forensic analysis]] of [[explosive material|explosives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557106/Weve-never-seen-a-bomb-like-217-devices.html |title='We've never seen a bomb like 21/7 devices' |first=Duncan |last=Gardham |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=11 July 2007 |location=London |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and providing paid volunteer scientists to Iraq and Afghanistan to provide rapid scientific advice to British forces. It has done work for around 40 government departments and agencies including the [[Home Office]] and [[Department for Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dstl.gov.uk/whoweworkwith&lt;/ref&gt; It undertakes research with both industry and academia to achieve its role.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dstl.gov.uk/industry&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a review and consultation process initiated by MOD's Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA), it become responsible for the formulation and commission of MOD's non-nuclear research programme from 1 Apr 2010, under the responsibility of the Dstl Programme Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmdfence/writev/761/nns45.htm |title=The Strategic Defence and Security Review and The National Security Strategy |first= |last= |work=publications.parliament.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=19 March 2010 |title=Dstl to become the key focus of science and technology within MOD |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/DstlToBecomeTheKeyFocusOfScienceAndTechnologyWithinMod.htm |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/DstlToBecomeTheKeyFocusOfScienceAndTechnologyWithinMod.htm |archivedate=26 October 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Programme Office were 16 domains&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121106233608/http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/ukspaceagency/docs/space%20science/aurora/knowledge-exchange-april-2011/gibson-dstl-presentation.pdf National Archives (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt; with some established as Science and Technology Centres, including Armour and Protection, Cyber and Influence, Counter Terrorism, and CBR (Chemical, Biological and Radiological).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dstl.gov.uk/scienceandtechnologycentres|title=Science and Technology Centres {{!}} dstl {{!}} Defence Science and Technology Laboratory|last=|first=|date=|website=dstl.gov.uk|publisher=Ministry of Defence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100139/https://www.dstl.gov.uk/scienceandtechnologycentres|archive-date=22 February 2014|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These centres funded research via the Centre for Defence Enterprise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/enterprise.aspx |title=Centre for Defence Enterprise |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also part of the Programme Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/dstl.aspx |title=The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A subsequent MOD CSA-led review in 2015 into MOD's science and technology capability recommended that the commissioning of science and technology should be independent of the delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458623/20150414-MOD_Science_Capability_Review_Executive_Summary.pdf|title=A review of MOD’s science and technology capability (Executive summary)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the commissioning role was moved to [[Defence Science and Technology]] (DST) within MOD Head Office, with Dstl focusing on delivery.

Within the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]] was a proposal to create "a government-backed service designed to help small and medium-sized businesses bring new ideas to market more quickly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015: A Secure and Prosperous United Kingdom|last=|first=|date=November 2015|publisher=HM Government|year=|isbn=9781474125963|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was announced by Defence Secretary [[Michael Fallon]] that this 'Defence and Security Accelerator'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator|title=Defence and Security Accelerator – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; would have access to an £800m innovation fund and build on the 'Centre for Defence Enterprise' model, operating within Dstl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/defence-innovation-initiative|title=Defence Innovation Initiative – Speeches|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''draw-works''' is the primary [[winch|hoisting machinery]] that is a component of a rotary [[drilling rig]].  Its main function is to provide a means of raising and lowering the [[traveling block]]s.  The wire-rope drilling line winds on the drawworks drum and extends to the [[crown block]] and traveling blocks, allowing the drill string to be moved up and down as the drum turns. The segment of drilling line from the draw-works to the crown block is called the "fast line".  The drilling line then enters the sheaves of the crown block and it makes several passes between the crown block and traveling block [[pulley]]s for [[mechanical advantage]].  The line then exits the last sheave on the crown block and is fastened to a [[derrick]] leg on the other side of the [[Drill floor|rig floor]].  This section of drilling line is called the "dead line".

A modern draw-works consists of five main parts: the drum, the [[Electric motor|motor]](s), the reduction [[gear]], the brake, and the auxiliary brake. The motors can be [[Alternating current|AC]] or [[Direct current|DC]]-motors, or the draw-works may be connected directly to diesel engines using metal chain-like belts. The number of gears could be one, two or three speed combinations. The main brake, usually operated manually by a long handle, may be friction band brake, a [[disc brake]] or a modified [[clutch]]. It serves as a parking brake when no motion is desired.  The auxiliary brake is connected to the drum, and absorbs the energy released as heavy loads are lowered.  This brake may use eddy current rotors or water-turbine-like apparatus to convert the kinetic energy of the moving load to heat and dissipate it. 

Power catheads (winches) located on each side provide the means of actuating the tongs used to couple and uncouple threaded pipe members. Outboard catheads can be used manually with ropes for various small hoisting jobs around the rig.

The drawworks often has a pulley drive arrangement on the front side to provide turning power to the [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]], although on many rigs the rotary table is independently powered. 

Drawworks can be used to hoist or lower several hundred thousand pounds of weight and can come in AC, DC or mechanical power units. Horsepower ratings for drawworks can also have a wide range, often ranging from 1000 HP to over 3000 HP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilworksinc.com/our-products/drawworks/ |title= Drawworks |date= 2014-11-04| work=  | publisher = Oil Works Inc. |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic commerce, commonly known as [[e-commerce]] or eCommerce, or [[e-business]] consists of the buying and selling of products or services over [[electronic system]]s such as the [[Internet]] and other [[computer network]]s. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction]] processing, [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and [[automated data collection]] systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]] as well. 

A large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for [[virtual item]]s such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. [[Online retail]]ers are sometimes known as e-tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e-tail. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the World Wide Web. 

Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses is referred to as [[business-to-business]] or B2B. B2B can be open to all interested parties (e.g. [[commodity market]]) or limited to specific, pre-qualified participants (private electronic market). Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses and consumers, on the other hand, is referred to as [[business-to-consumer]] or B2C. This is the type of electronic commerce conducted by companies such as [[Amazon.com]]. [[Online shopping]] is a form of electronic commerce where the buyer is connected directly online to the seller's computer usually via the Internet. There is no specific intermediary service. The sale and purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real-time, such as when buying a new book on Amazon.com. If an intermediary is present, then the sale and purchase transaction is called [[consumer-to-consumer]], such as an [[online auction]] conducted on [[eBay.com]]. 

This [[payment system]] has been widely accepted by [[consumer]]s and [[merchant]]s throughout the world, and is by far the most popular method of payments especially in the retail markets.&lt;ref name="Laudon" /&gt; Some of the most important advantages over the traditional modes of payment are: [[privacy]], integrity, compatibility, good transaction efficiency, acceptability, convenience, mobility, low [[financial risk]] and [[anonymity]].&lt;ref name="Laudon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laudon|first1=K.|last2=Traver|first2=C.|title= E-Commerce Business, Technology, Society |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flow of ecommerce payment system can be better understood from the flow of the system below.

'''Expansion springs''' are used as [[electrical connectors]] in some children's electronics kits. They are easy to use with bare [[finger]]s, they accept multiple wires, they require no learning or expertise to use them, and the cost is low.

Kits employing these connectors also have the secondary advantage that many additional projects can be made if the components are removed from the springs, and components strung between the springs instead of wires. For even more projects, these kits usually have enough space to add further springs.

Their major limitation is that spring connectors can not accept [[integrated circuit]] chips.

'''FLEX''' is a [[communications protocol]] developed by [[Motorola]] and used in many [[pager]]s. FLEX provides one-way communication only (from the provider to the pager device), but a related protocol called [[ReFLEX]] provides two-way messaging.

[[Transmission (telecommunications)|Transmission]] of message data occurs in one of four modes: 1600/2, 3200/2, 3200/4, or 6400/4.  All modes use [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] [[modulation]]. At 1600/2 this is on a 2 level [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal transmitted at 1600 bits per second. At 3200/2, this is a 2 level [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal transmitted at 3200 bits per second. At 3200/4, this is a 4 level [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal transmitted at 1600 symbols per second. Each 4 level symbol represents two bits for a bit rate of 3200 bits per second. At 6400/4, this is a 4 level [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal transmitted at 3200 symbols per second or 6400 bits per second.

Data is [[transmitted]] in a set of 128 frames that takes 4 minutes to complete.  Each frame contains a sync followed by 11 data blocks. The data blocks contain 256, 512 or 1024 [[bit]]s for 1600, 3200 or 6400 [[bits per second]] respectively.

A [[BCH code|BCH]] type [[Error-correcting code|ECC]] is used to improve the integrity of the data.  The standard has been designed to allow the pager's receiver to be turned off for a high percentage of the time and therefore save on [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] usage.

==Security==
Since data transmission over FLEX is unencrypted and insecure, transmitting private information over it should be done with caution.  There have been reported instances of individuals actively listening to pager traffic (private investigators, news organizations, etc.).

In The Netherlands the emergency services use the Flex-protocol in the nationwide [[P2000 (network)|P2000 network]] for pagers. The traffic on this network can be monitored via several websites.

In South Australia the State's SAGRN network for the Emergency Services paging system (CFS, SES, MFS and SAAS) is run on the FLEX 1600 protocol, and can be monitored through several websites.

A '''furrow profilometer''' is used for the measurement of the cross-sectional geometry of [[furrow]]s and corrugations, and is important in furrow assessments. For each furrow, the cross-sectional geometry should be measured at two to three locations before and after the [[irrigation]]. A [[profilometer]] for determining the cross-sections of furrows is shown in Figure. Individual scales located on the horizontal rod of the profilometer provide data to plot furrow depth as a function of the lateral distance and the data can be numerically integrated. This gives geometric relationships such as area verses depth, wetted perimeter versus depth and top-width verses depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dávila|first=Francisco Mojarro|title=Comparing Water Performance by Two Different Surface Irrigation Methods|year=2012|publisher=InTech|location=Croatia|isbn=978-953-51-0421-6|pages=1–20|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33994/InTech-Comparing_water_performance_by_two_different_surface_irrigation_methods.pdf|edition=1st |author2=Carlos Francisco Bautista Capetillo |author3=José Gumaro Ortiz Valdez |author4= Ernesto Vázquez Fernández|editor=García-Garizábal, Iker |editor2=Abrahao, Raphael|accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Garbage Warrior''''' is a 2007 film about architect [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]], inventor of the [[Earthship]] style of building, directed by [[Oliver Hodge]]. It follows Reynolds and how he developed the [[Earthship]] style of building and his struggle with the laws of [[Taos, New Mexico]], the location of his experimental Earthship community, in order to be allowed to build homes that do not match the structures of local [[building codes]]. The film concludes with a postscript showing Reynolds and his team of builders travelling to the [[Andaman Islands]] in the aftermath of the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] to assist the locals with disaster recovery and teaching them how to construct extremely low-cost earthships.

'''''Ghost in the Shell''''', known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Mobile Armored Riot Police'''''|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai|lead=yes}}, is a [[Seinen manga|''seinen'' manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Masamune Shirow]], which spawned the [[Ghost in the Shell|media franchise of the same name]]. The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of ''The Ghost in the Shell'', and later published as its own ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]], told the story of the fictional counter-[[cyberterrorist]] organization [[Public Security Section 9]], led by protagonist Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], in the mid 21st century of Japan. ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' was the sequel work which follows the story of Motoko after merging with the Puppeteer. The last volume, ''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'', contains four separate cases.

The books contain Shirow's thoughts on design and philosophy, including sociological issues, the consequences of technological advances and themes on the nature of consciousness and identity. Several artbooks have been released to detail the concept art and the world of ''Ghost in the Shell''. All three volumes have received mainly positive reviews.

==Setting==
{{Main article|World of Ghost in the Shell}}
Primarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of {{nihongo|Niihama, Niihama Prefecture|新浜県新浜市|Niihama-ken Niihama-shi}},&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The real world [[Niihama, Ehime|Niihama]] is located in [[Ehime Prefecture]], and its name is written differently in Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as {{nihongo|New Port City|ニューポートシティ|Nyū Pōto Shiti}}, the manga and the many [[anime]] adaptations follow the members of [[Public Security Section 9]], a special-operations task-force made up of former military officers and police detectives. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.

In this [[cyberpunk]] iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of [[prostheses]], with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a [[cyborg]]. The heroine of ''Ghost in the Shell'', Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required that she use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.

==Story==
{{Main article|List of Ghost in the Shell characters}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell'''''|攻殻機動隊 THE GHOST IN THE SHELL|Kōkaku Kidōtai za Gōsuto in za Sheru|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: The Ghost in the Shell''}} begins in 2029, and features Section 9, led by Chief [[Daisuke Aramaki]] and Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], as they investigate the Puppeteer, a cyber-criminal wanted for committing a large number of crimes by proxy through "[[ghost hacking]]" humans with [[cyberbrain]]s. As the investigation continues, Section 9 discovers that the Puppet Master is actually an advanced [[artificial intelligence]] created by a department of the Japanese government, taking up residence in a robot body. After destroying the latest host of the Puppeteer, Section 9 believes all is well, until the Major discovers the Puppet Master in her own mind. After hearing the Puppeteer's wishes to reach its next step in evolution, Kusanagi allows it to become one with her own ghost. After this event, the Major leaves Section 9 to work as a private contractor, with the remaining members of the unit, [[Batou]], [[Togusa]], Ishikawa, Saito, Paz, Borma and Azuma, continuing their work as covert operatives, occasionally meeting up with the Major in her various guises. These stories were later collected under the name {{nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'''''|攻殻機動隊 HUMAN-ERROR PROCESSOR|Kōkaku Kidōtai Hyūman Erā Purosessā|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: Human-Error Processor''}}. In 2035, the Major, now known as Motoko Aramaki, works as a security expert for Poseidon Industrial, now an entity composed of multiple identities that she controls via the network in other prosthetic bodies that attack industrial spies, assassins, and cyber-hackers, solving various crimes, while still at her day job. However, a psychic investigator finds something dangerous emerging as the teachings of a professor of artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands and attempt to intermingle with the Major's current evolving sense of self. These stories are collected under the title {{nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'''''|攻殻機動隊 MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE|Kōkaku Kidōtai Manmashīn Intāfēsu|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: Man-Machine Interface''}}.

== Creation and development ==
While writing the manga, Masamune Shirow struggled to make it neither too complex nor too simple.&lt;ref name="MS-interview"&gt;{{cite web |title= An Interview with Masamune Shirow |url= http://www.jai2.com/MSivu.htm |publisher=Frederick L. Schodt |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two official names exist for the works, the first is {{nihongo3|officially "''Armored Shell''"; literally "''Mobile Armored Riot Police''"|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}} and the second is "''Ghost in the Shell''". Masamune Shirow originally wanted to use the name "''Ghost in the Shell''" for the publication, as an homage to [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]'', from which he drew inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' Official Log 1|page=9|publisher=[[Young Magazine]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kōichi Yuri, First Coordinator at ''Young Magazine'', requested a "more flashy" name and Shirow came up with {{nihongo3||攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}}. Shirow requested that "Ghost in the Shell" be included on the title even if it was in small print. Yuri believes that ''Kōkaku Kidōtai'' is the mainstream title while "Ghost in the Shell" is the theme. While most Japanese publications use both names, the original publication in ''[[Young Magazine]]'' used ''Kōkaku Kidōtai''.&lt;ref name=log&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |year=2003 |title=攻殻機動隊 STAND ALONE COMPLEX Official Log ①|trans-title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Official Log 1 |medium=DVD |language=Japanese |url= |accessdate= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |time= |publisher= |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'', Shirow initially wanted to use a new title by changing the last [[kanji]] character meaning {{nihongo|"military unit"|隊|tai}}, to the homophonic kanji for {{nihongo|"body"|体|tai}} so that it would literally translate {{nihongo|"Mobile Unit Body Entity"|攻殻機動体|Kōkaku Kidōtai}}, but eventually he decided not to do so.&lt;ref name= "Gits2 notes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirow |first=Masamune |authorlink=Masamune Shirow |title=Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface |url= |accessdate= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Japan |isbn=4-06-336310-4 |page=|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' manga was done digitally, which was difficult for Shirow because of troubles including a hard disk failure which resulted in the loss of 16 gigabytes of data, USB hardware troubles and reading manuals related to new application upgrades. Shirow considers the manga a completely different kind of work and not a true sequel of ''Ghost in the Shell''. The original manga revolved around Public Security Section 9 and ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' follows what happens to the Major after she merges with the Puppeteer. Shirow drew the color pages on computer, in which he states was difficult to due to technical issues with his computer. In the "short-cut" version of the manga, Masamune Shirow made the color darker and softer, but used more contrasting colors in the "standard" version.&lt;ref name="MS-interview-2"&gt;{{cite web |title= Web Interview Masamune Shirow |url= http://kukaku.free.fr/interview/kodanclub.com.html |publisher=Kukaku.free.fr|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and philosophy===

Shirow's thoughts and work on ''Ghost in the Shell'' contain numerous footnotes and detailed explanations about scenes to give readers an understanding of the sociological differences or technological advances and philosophical discussion of the material. Examples include concepts like the future of hacking techniques, in which a cyberbrain can be hacked to copy information without being detected. Shirow explains instances of spirit channeling in cyborgs with kiko energy. Shirow even wrote that this phenomenon may be related to the "hearing voices" in individuals that suffer from mental disabilities like schizophrenia. This belief is represented in Motoko's reasons for head hunting Togusa for Section 9.&lt;ref name="dh1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ghost in the Shell | publisher=Dark Horse | author=Masamune, Shirow | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirow also notes that he believes these channelers do not speak with a human-like god, but instead tap into a phase of the universe which synchronizes with the channeler's functions. Other philosophical stances are represented such as Shirow's personal beliefs regarding [[death sentence]]s and crime and punishment.&lt;ref name="dh1"/&gt;

Shirow explains numerous facets of the daily life throughout his notes in ''Ghost in the Shell''. Cyborgs are shown consuming food, but Shirow noted that early in the development would have been pills or paste substance that would have both psychological and physical functions. The Fuchikoma robots also must consume in a sense, requiring replenishment of fluid for their neurochips every two months, but Fuchikoma are not entirely bio-robots. Shirow discussed in his notes how the family of Yano received notification of his death and what would be disclosed, but also notes strategic use and premature notifications exist for various purposes. The advancement of technology in Shirow's vision of the future is rapid, but the advancements are at least partially related to then-current technology. The concepts of a 3-D viewing room was based on "crude" golf simulator technology.&lt;ref name="dh1" /&gt;

Other personal beliefs of Shirow are represented in the scenes and author's commentary, such metaphysics, religious references, and other philosophical stances that enter a range of topics including his thoughts on a rotating universe.&lt;ref name="dh1" /&gt;

===Censorship===
The removal of a two-page sex scene in [[Studio Proteus]]'s localization of ''Ghost in the Shell'' was not well received, with readers reacting negatively to the removal of the previously uncensored content that was included in the original Dark Horse release. Toren Smith commented on Studio Proteus's actions claiming that requirement of the "Mature Readers Only" would translate into a 40% loss in sales and likely have caused the immediate cancellation of the series. Shirow, who grew tired of "taking flak" over the pages, opted to remove them and reworked the previous page as necessary.&lt;ref name=Toren&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sazan.net/digest/news/toren.shtml | title=Toren Smith on Manga Censorship | accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The original ''Ghost in the Shell'' ran from April 1989 to November 1990 in [[Kodansha]]'s manga anthology ''[[Young Magazine]]'', and was released in ''[[tankōbon]]'' format on October 2, 1991.&lt;ref name="GITS-KC"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:攻殻機動隊（１） |url= http://kc.kodansha.co.jp/product/top.php/1234577897 |language= Japanese |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |accessdate=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Horse initially published it in English monthly into eight comic issues from March 1, 1995, to October 1, 1995, with the translation of [[Studio Proteus]].&lt;ref name="GITS-1/8"&gt;{{cite web |title= GHOST IN THE SHELL #1 (OF 8) |url= http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/93-818/Ghost-in-the-Shell-1-of-8 |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |accessdate=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GITS-8/8"&gt;{{cite web |title= GHOST IN THE SHELL #8 (OF 8) |url= http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/94-125/Ghost-in-the-Shell-8-of-8 |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |accessdate=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later collected into a single volume in [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format on early December 1, 1995.&lt;ref name="GITS-manga-TPB"&gt;{{cite web |title= GHOST IN THE SHELL TPB |url= http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/44-818/Ghost-in-the-Shell-TPB |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |accessdate=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An uncensored version was later released by [[Dark Horse Comics]] on October 6, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= GHOST IN THE SHELL 1 2ND EDITION TPB |url= http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/10-029/Ghost-in-the-Shell-Volume-1-2nd-edition-TPB |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |accessdate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The censored version of the Dark Horse manga was later republished by [[Kodansha Comics]] on October 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ghost in the Shell Volume 1 |url= http://www.randomhouse.com/book/166169/the-ghost-in-the-shell-volume-1-by-shirow-masamune/9781935429012/ |publisher=[[Kodansha Comics]] |accessdate=October 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kodanshacomics.tumblr.com/post/56881920605/hi-i-wanted-to-ask-if-the-ghost-in-the-shell-manga-is | title=Kodansha Comics | publisher=Kodansha Comics | date=July 30, 2013 | accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ghost in the Shell'' had received mainly positive reviews. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the manga for its artwork: "Masamune's b&amp;w drawings are dynamic and beautifully gestural; he vividly renders the awesome urban landscape of a futuristic, supertechnological Japan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59307-228-5 | title = GHOST IN THE SHELL | accessdate = November 29, 2012 | work = Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leroy Douresseaux of the website ComicBookBin gave the manga an A stating: "It is visually potent and often inscrutable, but its sense of wonder and exploration makes its ideas still seem fresh two decades after its debut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comicbookbin.com/theghostintheshell001.html | title =The Ghost in the Shell: Volume 1| accessdate = November 13, 2012 | last = Douresseaux | first = Leroy | work = ComicBookBin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Gutiérrez of the website Teenreads praised the manga, writing: "In short, ''Ghost in the Shell'' is hard sci-fi of the best possible sort: the type that’s so full of both undiluted artfulness and philosophy that it’s arguably a must-read even for those who don’t usually take to the genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comicbookbin.com/theghostintheshell001.html | title =The Ghost in the Shell, Vol. 1| accessdate = November 13, 2012 | last = Gutiérrez | first = Peter | work = Teanreads}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics praised the artwork, however criticized the manga for its story pacing and collection of short adventures stating, "I'm glad I got to experience Shirow's artistic view of the future and am a little interested in the idea of his ''Intron Depot'' art books, but on the whole ''Ghost in the Shell'' was a massive shell game: flashy and fascinating from a glance, but ultimately empty when you decide to dive in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2005/02/28/ghost-in-the-shell/ | title = Ghost in the Shell| accessdate = November 13, 2012 | author=McElhatton, Greg | work = Read About Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which he apparently takes every aspect seriously and the amount of information he'd like to convey verges on a disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33925 | title = AICN Anime-Sci-Fi Reviews of Ghost in the Shell 1.5 and Freedom (Featuring Design by Akira's Katsuhiro Otomo) | accessdate = November 18, 2012 | work = Ain't It Cool News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebranded service provided a new [[application programming interface|API]] that allows merchants to add the payment service to websites, apps, [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Braintree (company)|Braintree]], and [[Google Assistant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-will-now-let-users-pay-with-any-card-they-have-on-file-not-just-those-saved-in-android-pay/|title=Google will now let users pay with any card they have on file, not just those saved in Android Pay|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092307/https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-will-now-let-users-pay-with-any-card-they-have-on-file-not-just-those-saved-in-android-pay/|archivedate=December 25, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service allows users to use the payment cards they have on file with [[Google Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5google.com/2017/10/23/pay-with-google-online-payments/|title=‘Pay with Google’ makes it easy to pay online with any card tied to your Google account|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=October 23, 2017|work=9to5Google|access-date=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225203129/https://9to5google.com/2017/10/23/pay-with-google-online-payments/|archivedate=December 25, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Pay app also added support for [[boarding pass]]es and [[Ticket (admission)|event tickets]] in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17330440/google-pay-update-mobile-boarding-pass-event-ticket-io-2018|title=Google Pay is adding mobile boarding passes and event tickets|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=May 19, 2018|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520192637/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17330440/google-pay-update-mobile-boarding-pass-event-ticket-io-2018|archivedate=May 20, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service ==
Google Pay uses [[near field communication]] (NFC) to transmit card information facilitating funds transfer to the retailer. It replaces the [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card|debit]] card [[chip and PIN]] or [[magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] transaction at [[point-of-sale terminal]]s by allowing the user to upload these in the Google Pay wallet. It is similar to contactless payments already used in many countries, with the addition of [[two-factor authentication]]. The service lets Android devices wirelessly communicate with [[point of sale]] systems using a [[near field communication]] (NFC) antenna, [[Host card emulation|host-based card emulation (HCE)]], and Android's security.

Google Pay takes advantage of physical authentications such as fingerprint ID where available. On devices without fingerprint ID, Google Pay is activated with a passcode. When the user makes a payment to a merchant, Google Pay does not send the credit or debit card number with the payment. Instead it generates a virtual account number representing the user's account information. This service keeps customer payment information private, sending a one-time security code instead of the card or user details.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-androidpay" /&gt;

Google Pay requires that a screen lock be set on the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/pay/answer/6224811?hl=en|title=Set up Google Pay|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604223014/https://support.google.com/pay/answer/6224811?hl=en|archivedate=June 4, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no card limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Google Pay |agency= HSBC UK |url=https://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/google-pay |work=[[HSBC]] |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |quote= There is no limit to the number of cards you can add to your device. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604223015/https://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/google-pay |archivedate=June 4, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Android Pay Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.co-opfs.org/media/313872/androidpay_b2c_faq.pdf |work=[[CO-OP Financial Services]] |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |quote=How many cards can the Android Pay app store?

Users can add payment cards to the service by taking a photo of the card, or by entering the card information manually. To pay at [[point of sale|points of sale]], users hold their authenticated device to the point of sale system. The service has smart-authentication, allowing the system to detect when the device is considered secure (for instance if unlocked in the last five minutes) and challenge if necessary for unlock information.&lt;ref name="fingerp15"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOn7VrTRlA4&amp;t=2m59s|title=Fingerprint and payments APIs (100 Days of Google Dev)|author=Google Developers|year=2015|publisher=Google|access-date=December 2, 2016|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826195248/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOn7VrTRlA4|archivedate=August 26, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring CEO Alan Tisch said Google Pay improves mobile shopping business by supporting a "buy button" powered by Google Pay integrated within vendor's creative design.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-androidpay2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8661867/google-introduces-android-pay-replace-wallet-app|title=Google introduces Android Pay, a replacement for its wallet app on mobile|website=The Verge|accessdate=May 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528200923/http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8661867/google-introduces-android-pay-replace-wallet-app|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Originally launched as Android Pay, the service was released at [[Google I/O]] 2015. Android Pay was a successor to and built on the base established by [[Google Wallet]] which was released in 2011.&lt;ref name="WalletYT2011"&gt;{{cite web| year= 2011| title= Google Wallet Product Launch| first= Stephanie| last= Tilenius| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am8t6iZ7up0| via= YouTube| publisher= Google| access-date= December 2, 2016| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170504170457/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am8t6iZ7up0| archivedate= May 4, 2017| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also used technology from the carrier-backed [[Softcard]]—Google had acquired its intellectual property in February 2015.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-androidpay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google introduces Android Pay, a replacement for its wallet app on mobile|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8661867/google-introduces-android-pay-replace-wallet-app|website=The Verge|accessdate=May 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528200923/http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8661867/google-introduces-android-pay-replace-wallet-app|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVerge-Softshut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Softcard is shutting down on March 31st, and Google Wallet will replace it|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/5/8152801/softcard-shutting-down-march-31|website=The Verge|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=March 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404212736/http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/5/8152801/softcard-shutting-down-march-31|archivedate=April 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, the service was compatible with 70% of Android devices, and was accepted at over 700,000 merchants.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-androidpay"/&gt; Google Wallet still powered web-based Play Store purchases and some app-based peer-to-peer payments, for instance in Gmail.&lt;ref name="TheVerge-androidpay"/&gt;

In 2016, Google began a public trial in [[Silicon Valley]] of a related [[mobile app]] called Hands Free.  In this system, the customer does not need to present a phone or card.  Instead, a customer announces they wish to "pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, who verifies their identity with a photo previously uploaded to the system.  The customer's phone will only authorize payment if its geographic location system indicates it is near a participating store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/google-experiments-with-a-way-to-pay-without-taking-out-your-phone/| title= Google experiments with a way to pay without taking out your phone| first= Matthew| last= Lynley| date= March 2, 2016| work= TechCrunch.com| publisher= AOL| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170619070802/https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/google-experiments-with-a-way-to-pay-without-taking-out-your-phone/| archivedate= June 19, 2017| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2016/03/testing-testing-one-two-hands-free.html| title= Testing, Testing - One, Two, Hands Free| work= Google Commerce| date= March 2, 2016| first= Pali| last= Bhat| publisher= Google| access-date= December 2, 2016| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160509021828/http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2016/03/testing-testing-one-two-hands-free.html| archivedate= May 9, 2016| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of a [[spatial index]], a '''grid''' or '''mesh''' is a regular [[tessellation]] of a [[manifold]] or 2-D surface that divides it into a series of contiguous cells, which can then be assigned unique identifiers and used for spatial indexing purposes. A wide variety of such grids have been proposed or are currently in use, including grids based on "square" or "rectangular" cells, triangular grids or meshes, hexagonal grids and grids based on diamond-shaped cells.also "[[Discrete_Global_Grid|global grid]]" if it covers the entire surface of the [[globe]])

==Types of grids==
[[File:Geodesic Grid (ISEA3H) illustrated.png|right | 500px]]
Square or rectangular grids are frequently used for purposes such as translating spatial information expressed in Cartesian coordinates ([[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) into and out of the grid system. Such grids may or may not be aligned with the grid lines of latitude and longitude; for example, [[Marsden Square]]s, [[World Meteorological Organization squares]], [[c-squares]] and others are aligned, while [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] and various national grid based systems such as the [[British national grid reference system]] are not. In general, these grids fall into two classes, those that are "''equal angle''", that have cell sizes that are constant in degrees of latitude and longitude but are unequal in area (particularly with varying latitude), or those that are "''equal area''", that have cell sizes that are constant in distance on the ground (e.g. 100&amp;nbsp;km, 10&amp;nbsp;km) but not in degrees of longitude, in particular.

A commonly used triangular grid is the "Quaternary Triangular Mesh" (QTM), which was developed by Geoffrey Dutton in the early 1980s. It eventually resulted in a thesis entitled "A Hierarchical Coordinate System for Geoprocessing and Cartography" that was published in 1999. This grid was also employed as the basis of the rotatable globe that forms part of the Microsoft [[Encarta]] product.

Hexagonal grids may also be used. In general, triangular and hexagonal grids are constructed so as to better approach the goals of equal-area (or nearly so) plus more seamless coverage across the poles, which tends to be a problem area for square or rectangular grids since in these cases, the cell width diminishes to nothing at the pole and those cells adjacent to the pole then become 3- rather than 4-sided.  Criteria for optimal discrete global gridding have been proposed by both Goodchild and Kimerling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/globalgrids-book/comparison Criteria and Measures for the Comparison of Global Geocoding Systems, Keith C. Clarke, University of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623002915/http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/globalgrids-book/comparison/ |date=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which equal area cells are deemed of prime importance.

[[Quadtree]]s are a specialised form of grid in which the resolution of the grid is varied according to the nature and complexity of the data to be fitted, across the 2-d space. Polar grids utilize the [[polar coordinate system]], using circles of a prescribed radius that are divided into sectors of a certain angle. Coordinates are given as the radius and angle from the center of the grid.

==Grid-based spatial indexing==
In practice, construction of grid-based spatial indices entails allocation of relevant objects to their position or positions in the grid, then creating an index of object identifiers vs. grid cell identifiers for rapid access. This is an example of a "space-driven" or data independent method, as opposed to "data-driven" or data dependent method, as discussed further in Rigaux et al. (2002)).&lt;ref&gt;Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.&lt;/ref&gt; A grid-based spatial index has the advantage that the structure of the index can be created first, and data added on an ongoing basis without requiring any change to the index structure; indeed, if a common grid is used by disparate data collecting and indexing activities, such indices can easily be merged from a variety of sources. On the other hand, data driven structures such as [[R-tree]]s can be more efficient for data storage and speed at search execution time, though they are generally tied to the internal structure of a given data storage system.

The use of such spatial indices is not limited to digital data; the "index" section of any global or street atlas commonly contains a list of named features (towns, streets, etc.) with associated grid square identifiers, and may be considered a perfectly acceptable example of a spatial index (in this case, typically organised by feature name, though the reverse is conceptually also possible).

==Other uses==
The individual cells of a grid system can also be useful as units of aggregation, for example as a precursor to data analysis, presentation, mapping, etc. For some applications (e.g., statistical analysis), equal-area cells may be preferred, although for others this may not be a prime consideration.

In computer science, one often needs to find out all cells a ray is passing through in a grid (for raytracing or collision detection); this is called "grid traversal".

'''''Harry Clarke{{spaced ndash}}Darkness in Light '''''is a documentary film originally released in 2003 (Irish-language version titled Harry Clarke - Dorchadas i Solas).

==Synopsis==
Filmmaker [[John J Doherty]] traces the life and work of the [[Irish people|Irish]] artist, book illustrator and [[stained glass]] artist [[Harry Clarke]] (1889–1931) with major contributions from his biographer [[Nicola Gordon Bowe]] as well as many stained glass artists, poets and historians. The film takes the artist's work in [[stained glass]], which was mainly religious an ethereal, and in [[book illustration]], which was mainly dark &amp; fantastical, as the basis for its title and tells a story of talent, struggle, success and the [[censorship]] of his final masterpiece 'the Geneva Window'. [[Harry Clarke]] brought his expertise in working in fine decorative detail in glass to his book illustrations, most notably in the tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] where he is compared to [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and which are featured in the film and paralleled with [[German Expressionist]] cinema of the time. The film was made in conjunction with the [[Irish Film Board]] and national broadcaster [[TG4]].

The '''Hedgehog''' (also known as an ''Anti-Submarine Projector'') was a forward-throwing  [[anti-submarine weapon]] that was used during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] in the [[Second World War]]. The device, which was developed by the [[Royal Navy]], fired up to 24 [[spigot mortar]]s ahead of a ship when attacking a [[U-boat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =278 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed on [[convoy]] escort [[warship]]s such as [[destroyer]]s and [[corvette]]s to supplement the [[depth charge]]s.

As the mortar projectiles employed [[contact fuze]]s rather than [[Fuze#Time fuzes|time]] or [[Fuze#Barometric fuzes|barometric (depth) fuze]]s, detonation occurred directly against a hard surface such as the hull of a submarine making it more deadly than [[depth charge]]s, which relied on damage caused by [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic shockwaves]]. Statistics show that during WWII out of 5,174 British depth charge attacks there were 85.5 kills: a ratio of 60.5 to 1. In comparison, the Hedgehog made 268 attacks for 47 kills: a ratio of 5.7 to 1.&lt;ref name= ABW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WAMBR_ASW.htm|title=Britain ASW Weapons|publisher=http://www.navweaps.com|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The "Hedgehog", so named because the empty rows of its launcher spigots resembled the spines of a [[hedgehog]], was a replacement for the unsuccessful [[Fairlie Mortar]] that was trialled aboard {{HMS|Whitehall|D94|6}} in 1941. Although a failure, the Fairlie was designed to fire [[depth charge]]s ahead of a ship when attacking a submarine. This principle of forward-firing projectiles was considered viable. This secret research by the [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]] (DMWD) led to the development of the Hedgehog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzsimons|first= Bernard, ed.|title=Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons &amp; Warfare|publisher=London: Phoebus|year= 1977|volume= 12|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapon was a multiple '[[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|spigot mortar]]' or spigot discharger, a type of weapon developed between the wars by Lieutenant Colonel [[Stewart Blacker]], [[Royal Artillery|RA]]. The spigot mortar was based on early [[infantry]] trench mortars. The spigot design allowed a single device to fire warheads of varying size. The propelling charge was part of the main weapon and worked against a rod (the spigot) set in the baseplate which fitted inside a tubular tail of the 'bomb'. This principle was first used on the [[Blacker Bombard]] 29&amp;nbsp;mm Spigot Mortar and the later [[PIAT]] anti-tank weapon.

The adaptation of the bombard for naval use was made in partnership with [[MIR(c)]] under Major [[Millis Jefferis]] who had taken Blacker's design and brought it into use with Army. The weapon fires a salvo of 24 bombs in an arc, aimed to land in a [[circle|circular]] or [[ellipse|elliptical]] area about {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter at a fixed point about {{convert|250|yd|m}} directly ahead of the attacking ship. The mounting initially was fixed but was later replaced by a gyro-stabilised one to allow for the rolling and pitching of the attacking ship.

The system was developed to solve the problem of the target submarine disappearing from the attacking ship's [[ASDIC]] when the ship came within the sonar's minimum range. Due to the [[Speed of sound#Water|speed of sound in water]], the time taken for the 'ping' echo to return to the attacking ship from the target submarine became too short to allow the human operator to distinguish the returning audible echo from that of the initial sound pulse emitted by the sonar – the so-called "instantaneous echo", where the output sound pulse and returning echo merge. This "blind spot" allowed the submarine to make evasive manoeuvres undetected while the ship was out of range for depth charge attack. Hence, the submarine was effectively invisible to the sonar as the ship came within the sonar's minimum range. The solution was a weapon mounted on the [[Forecastle|foredeck]] that discharged the projectiles up and over that carrying ship's [[Bow (ship)|bow]], to land in the water some distance in front of the ship while the submarine was still outside the sonar's minimum range.

==History==
The Hedgehog entered service in 1942. Carrying a [[Torpex]] charge weighing {{convert|16|kg|abbr=on}}, each mortar had a diameter of {{convert|18|cm|abbr=on}} and weighed about {{convert|29.5|kg|abbr=on}}. The projectiles were angled so they would land in a circular shape with a diameter of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on}} about {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} ahead of a stationary ship. The projectiles would then sink at about {{convert|7|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=jc/&gt; They would reach a submerged U-boat, for example at {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} in under 9 seconds. [[Sympathetic detonation]] of projectiles near those contacting hard surfaces was a possibility, but the number of explosions counted was usually fewer than the number of projectiles launched.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

The prototype launcher was tested aboard {{HMS|Westcott|D47|6}} in 1941, but there were no submarine kills until November 1942, after it had been installed aboard one hundred ships.&lt;ref name=jc&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink = |title =Naval Weapons of World War Two |publisher =Naval Institute Press |volume = |edition = |date =1985 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |pages =91&amp;166 |isbn =0-87021-459-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial success rates – of about 5% – were only slightly better than depth charges. Swells and spray frequently covered the launcher during heavy North Atlantic weather,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |authorlink =Samuel Eliot Morison |title =The Battle of the Atlantic |publisher =Little, Brown and Company |volume =I |edition = |date =1975 |location =Boston |page =212 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent attempts to launch often revealed firing circuit problems launching an incomplete pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middlebrook |first=Martin |authorlink = |title =Convoy |publisher =William Morrow and Company |volume = |edition = |date =1976 |location =New York |page =165 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disappointment of a quiet miss discouraged crews who might otherwise assume depth charge explosions had damaged their target or at least frightened the enemy. The Royal Navy launched Hedgehog so seldom in early 1943 that a directive was issued ordering captains of ships equipped with Hedgehog to report why they had ''not'' used Hedgehog on an underwater contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milner |first=Marc |authorlink = |title =North Atlantic Run |publisher =Naval Institute Press |volume = |edition = |date =1985 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |page =266 |isbn =0-87021-450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were blamed on crew inexperience and low confidence in the weapon. However, after an officer from the DMWD was sent to [[Londonderry Port]], where the convoy crews were based, with better training and shipwide talks on examples of successful Hedgehog attacks, the kill rate improved considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pawle|first= G|year=2009|title= The Wheezer and Dodgers. The inside story of clandestine weapon development in World War II|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|ISBN= 1848320264}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, statistics showed that on average, one in every five attacks made by Hedgehog resulted in a kill (compared to less than one in 80 with depth charges).&lt;ref name= ABW/&gt;

In response to this new deadly threat to its U-boats, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' brought forward its [[List of World War II torpedoes of Germany|programme]] of [[acoustic torpedo]]es in 1943, beginning with the [[G7e torpedo#G7e.2FT4 Falke|Falke]]. These new "homing" torpedoes could be employed effectively without the use of a periscope, providing submarines a better chance to remain undetected and evade counterattack.

In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], {{USS|England|DE-635|6}} sank six Japanese submarines in a matter of days with Hedgehog in May 1944.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Lanier, William D. and Williamson, John A., CAPT USN. "The Twelve Days of the England". ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'', March 1980, pp. 76–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, {{USS|Solar|DE-221|6}} was destroyed after a crewmen accidentally dropped a Hedgehog charge near one of her main turret ammunition rooms, triggering three subsequent and devastating explosions.

==Operational usage==
The launcher had four "cradles", each with six launcher spigots. The firing sequence was staggered so all the bombs would land at about the same time. This had the added advantage of minimising the stress on the weapon's mounting, so that deck reinforcement was not needed, and the weapon could easily be retrofitted to any convenient place on a ship. Reloading took about three minutes.&lt;ref name=jc/&gt;

The Hedgehog had four key advantages over the depth charge:

# An unsuccessful attack does not hide the submarine from [[sonar]].
#: When a depth charge explodes it can take 15 minutes before the disturbance can settle down enough that sonar becomes effective. Many submarines escaped during the time after an unsuccessful depth charge attack. Since Hedgehog charges only explode on contact, sonar tracking of the submarine is less likely to be disrupted by an unsuccessful hedgehog attack.
# Although knowledge of target depth was less important; the hedgehog was less successful against deep targets. Doctrine based on combat experience discouraged use on targets deeper than {{convert|400|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=jc/&gt;
#: Proximity weapons (such as depth charges) need to be set for the target's correct depth to be effective. Contact-fuzed charges do not have that limitation, and an explosion at the time predicted for the contact-fuzed projectile to reach the target depth may indicate a "hit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gretton |first=Peter |authorlink =Peter Gretton |title =Crisis Convoy |publisher =Naval Institute Press |volume = |edition = |date =1974 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |page =42 |isbn =0-87021-925-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{citation needed span|text=The weapon gives no warning of the attack. |reason=hydrophone may detect projectiles striking water surface |date=December 2016}}
#: Until depth-finding sonar became available (the first was the Royal Navy's "Q" attachment in 1943), there was a "dead period" during the final moments of the attack when the attacker had no knowledge of what the target was doing. U-boat commanders became adept at sharp changes of direction and speed at these moments, thus making the attack less accurate. Ahead-thrown weapons such as Hedgehog did not give the target the necessary warning of when to dodge.
# {{citation needed span|text=A direct hit by one or two Hedgehog bombs was usually sufficient to sink a submarine. |reason=implies data analyses |date=December 2016}}
#: Many depth charges were required to inflict enough cumulative damage to sink a submarine; even then, many U-boats survived hundreds of detonations over a period of many hours—678 depth charges were dropped against {{GS|U-427||2}} in April 1945. The depth charge, usually exploding at a distance from the submarine, had a cushion of water between it and the target which rapidly dissipated the explosive shock. {{citation needed span|text=The Hedgehog's contact charge, on the other hand, had the cushion on the other side, actually increasing the explosive shock. |reason=theory requires qualifications of author |date=December 2016}} However, near misses with the Hedgehog did not cause cumulative damage as depth charges did; nor did it have the same psychological effect as a depth charge attack.

==Derivatives and successors==
[[File:A hedgehog launcher on display.jpg|thumb|A hedgehog launcher on display at the {{USS|Silversides|SS-236|6}} museum in [[Muskegon, Michigan]].]]In late 1943 the Royal Navy introduced [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]]. This was a three-tubed mortar that launched depth charges. Initially it was used as a single weapon, but when this failed to be successful, it was upgraded to the "double squid" that consisted of two launchers placed in parallel. In 1955 this system was upgraded to the three-barreled [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] that launched {{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Minol (explosive)|Minol]] charges.

The United States produced a rocket version of Hedgehog called [[Mousetrap (weapon)|Mousetrap]], then [[Weapon Alpha]] as a replacement for both. Still, Hedgehog remained in service with the United States Navy into the [[Cold War]] until both Hedgehog and the less satisfactory Weapon Alpha were replaced by [[ASROC]].&lt;ref name="Weyer"&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard. ''Weyer's Warship of the World 1969''. (Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1969), pp. 325-328 &amp; 340&lt;/ref&gt;

Three "Hedgerow" flotillas of specialized [[Landing Craft Assault#Variants|Landing Craft Assault]] boats carrying the Hedgehog instead of troops were used during the [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/item/researching-family-and-royal-marine-history/major-landing-craft-of-world-war-ii |title=Major Landing Craft of World War II |author= |date=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=The Royal Marines Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; An addition of impact fuse extensions in the projectile noses enabled detonating the warheads above ground. The bombs were used to clear 100-yard-wide paths through mines and barbed wire obstacles on the beach.{{sfnp|Ladd|1976|p=173}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/museumresearch/PDFs/Royal%20Marines%20&amp;%20Landing%20Craft.pdf |title=Royal Marines &amp; Landing Craft |work=Royal Marine Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007163404/http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/museumresearch/PDFs/Royal%20Marines%20%26%20Landing%20Craft.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Army adapted the marine Hedgehog into a land-based seven-shot launcher that could be mounted on the back of [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]].

From 1949, a copy of Hedgehog was produced in the [[USSR]] as MBU-200, developed in 1956 into MBU-600 (also known as [[RBU-6000]]) with increased range of {{convert|600|m|ft}}.

Weapons derived from the Hedgehog have been largely phased out from Western navies in favor of homing torpedoes. MBU-600 and its derivatives remain an important part of the Russian Navy's (as well as Russia's allies, such as India) anti-submarine arsenal to this day.

'''HomeRF''' was a [[wireless networking]] specification for home devices. It was developed in 1998 by the Home Radio Frequency Working Group, a consortium of mobile wireless companies that included [[Proxim Wireless]], [[Intel]], [[Siemens AG]], [[Motorola]], [[Philips]]  and more than 100 other companies.&lt;ref name="caswell"&gt;{{cite web |title= HomeRF Archives |author= Wayne Caswell |date= November 17, 2010 |url= http://www.cazitech.com/HomeRF_Archives.htm |accessdate= July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was disbanded in January 2003 after other wireless networks became accessible to home users and [[Microsoft]] began including support for them in its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s. As a result, HomeRF fell  into obsolescence.

==Description==
Initially called Shared Wireless Access Protocol (SWAP) and later just HomeRF, this open specification allowed PCs, peripherals, cordless phones and other consumer devices to share and communicate voice and data in and around the home without the complication and expense of running new wires. HomeRF combined several wireless technologies in the [[ISM band|2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz ISM band]], including [[IEEE 802.11 FH]] (the frequency-hopping version of wireless data networking) and [[DECT]] (the most prevalent digital cordless telephony standard in the world) to meet the unique home networking requirements for security, [[quality of service]] (QoS) and interference immunity—issues that still plagued [[Wi-Fi]] (802.11b and g).{{Citation needed |date= September 2013 }}

HomeRF used [[frequency hopping]] [[spread spectrum]] (FHSS) in the 2.4 [[GHz]] frequency band and in theory could achieve a maximum of 10 Mbit/s throughput; its nodes could travel within a 50-meter range of a [[wireless access point]] while remaining connected to the [[personal area network]] (PAN). Several standards and working groups focused on wireless networking technology in [[radio frequency]] (RF). Other standards include the popular [[IEEE 802.11]] family, [[IEEE 802.16]], and [[Bluetooth]].

[[Proxim Wireless]] was the only supplier of HomeRF chipsets, and since Proxim also made end products, other manufacturers complained that they had to buy components from their competitor. The fact that our group didn't address that conflict led to the eventual downfall of HomeRF, which occurred during an economic recession when companies already struggled to justify duplicate engineering and marketing efforts - for HomeRF, 802.11 and Bluetooth. The fact that HomeRF was developed by a consortium and not an official standards body also put it at a disadvantage against Wi-Fi and its IEEE 802.11 standard.{{Citation needed |date= September 2013 }}

AT&amp;T joined the group because HomeRF was designed for high-speed broadband services and the need to support PCs, phones, stereos and televisions; but last-mile deployment occurred more slowly than expected and with slower speeds. So it was natural that the home networking market focused more on multi-PC households sharing Internet connections for email and browsing than on integrating phone and entertainment services into a broadband service bundle. As a result, the original promoter companies gradually started pulling out of the group rather than supporting multiple standards. They included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Microsoft, and lastly Intel. That left only companies like Motorola, National Semiconductor, Proxim, and Siemens. Even Proxim started pulling away when negative media surrounding HomeRF started affecting its core data networking business, and that left Siemens to do the work of integrating voice, data and video. Siemens was willing to go it alone with HomeRF technology but was concerned by growing uncertainties in the cordless phone market, including mobile phone as home phone, [[VoIP]] over Wi-Fi, and 5&amp;nbsp;GHz vs. 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz. When Siemens eventually got out of the cordless phone market, it was the final nail in the HomeRF coffin.{{Citation needed |date= September 2013 }}

HomeRF received some success because of its low cost and ease of installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= [[Ted Coombs]] |author2= Roderico Deleon |title= Basic Home Networking |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BO3hc1r_tC0C |date= July 24, 2002 |pages= 12–14 |publisher= Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-7668-6180-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By September 2000, some confusion came from the "home" in the name, leading some to associate HomeRF with [[home network]]s, using other technologies such as [[IEEE 802.11b]] for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=HomeRF vs. 802.11b |author=Joanie Wexler |work=Network World Wireless in the Enterprise Newsletter |publisher=Network World Fusion |date=September 25, 2000 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/wireless/2000/0925wire1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120191922/http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/wireless/2000/0925wire1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[digital media receiver]] for audio was marketed under the name "Motorola SimpleFi" that used HomeRF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Motorola Simplefi review |work= CNet |date= August 16, 2002 |url= http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-audio-receivers-dars/motorola-simplefi/4505-6470_7-9050945.html |accessdate= September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Simplefi Your Digital Music  |work= PC Magazine |author= Bill Howard |date= March 13, 2002 |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,4785,00.asp |accessdate= September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2001, Intel announced they would not support further development of HomeRF technology for its Anypoint line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= The Ripple Effect: How Intel's Choice to Support 802.11b is Affecting the Home Networking Market |work= Home Networks Newsletter |volume=3 |number=4  |pages= 9–10 |date= April 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SCEor912ICwC&amp;pg=PA9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group promoting 802.11 technology, the [[Wi-Fi Alliance|Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance]] (WECA) changed their name to the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2002, as the [[Wi-Fi]] brand became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Wi-Fi5, We Hardly Knew Ye |author= Eric Griffith |work= 802.11 Planet |date= July 17, 2002 |url= http://www.80211-planet.com/news/article.php/1428541 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021207042030/http://www.80211-planet.com/news/article.php/1428541 |archivedate= December 7, 2002 |accessdate= September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that WECA members lobbied the [[FCC]] for two years, which was effective in delaying the approval of wideband frequency-hopping, helped 802.11b catch up and gain an insurmountable lead in the market, which was then extended with 802.11g. The use of [[OFDM]] in 802.11a and .11g solved many of the RF interference problems of .11b. [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] and [[802.11x]] also improved security over [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] encryption, which was especially important in the corporate world.{{Citation needed |date= September 2013 }}

The [[International Space Station]] '''Environmental Control and Life Support System''' ('''ECLSS''') is a [[life support system]] that provides or controls [[atmospheric pressure]], fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, shower, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system aboard ''Zvezda'' and a similar system in ''Destiny'' generate oxygen aboard the station.&lt;ref name="OGS"&gt;{{cite web

The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and [[Vika oxygen generator|Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation]] (SFOG) canisters.&lt;ref name="breath easy"&gt;{{cite web

Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the Russian ''Vozdukh'' system in ''Zvezda,'' one Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) located in the U.S. Lab module, and one CDRA in the U.S. Node 3 module. Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, are removed by [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] filters or by the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS).&lt;ref name="breath easy"/&gt;

== Water recovery systems ==
The ISS has two water recovery systems. [[Zvezda (ISS module)|''Zvezda'']] contains a [[water]] recovery system that processes water vapor from the atmosphere that could be used for drinking in an emergency but is normally fed to the [[#Elektron|Elektron]] system to produce [[oxygen]]. The American segment has a Water Recovery System installed during [[STS-126]]&lt;ref name=2009-01-2352&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of the Regenerative ECLSS Water Recovery System (2009-01-2352)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090033097.pdf|publisher=NASA/SAE|format=PDF|accessdate=September 17, 2014|date=2009|author=D.Layne Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can process water vapour collected from the atmosphere and [[urine]] into water that is intended for drinking. The Water Recovery System was installed initially in ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'' on a temporary basis in November 2008&lt;ref name=2009-01-2352 /&gt; and moved into ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]'' (Node 3) in February 2010.&lt;ref name=2010Status&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of the Regenerative ECLS Water Recovery System|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100033089.pdf|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|accessdate=September 17, 2014|date=2010|author=Layne Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ECLSS at the ECLSS Test Facility.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The three ECLSS racks on display at the Marshall Space Flight Center ECLSS Test Facility in 2012. From left to right, the Water Recovery System (Rack 1), WRS Rack 2 and Oxygen Generating System.]]
The Water Recovery System consists of a Urine Processor Assembly and a Water Processor Assembly, housed in two of the three ECLSS racks.&lt;ref name=2005-01-2779&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of the International Space Station Regenerative ECLSS  Water Recovery and Oxygen Generation Systems (2005-01-2779)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050207456.pdf|publisher=NASA/SAE|format=PDF|accessdate=September 17, 2014|date=2005|author=Robert M. Bagdigian|author2=Dale Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urine Processor Assembly uses a low pressure vacuum distillation process that uses a centrifuge to compensate for the lack of gravity and thus aid in separating liquids and gasses.&lt;ref name=ISS-ECLSS-pdf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/104840main_eclss.pdf|title=International Space Station Environmental Control and Life Support System|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Urine Processor Assembly is designed to handle a load of 9&amp;nbsp;kg/day, corresponding to the needs of a 6-person crew.&lt;ref name=2009-01-2352 /&gt; Although the design called for recovery of 85% of the water content, subsequent experience with calcium sulfate precipitation&lt;ref name=2010Status /&gt; (in the free-fall conditions present on the ISS, calcium levels in urine are elevated due to bone density loss) has led to a revised operational level of recovering 70% of the water content.

Water from the Urine Processor Assembly and from waste water sources are combined to feed the Water Processor Assembly that filters out gasses and solid materials before passing through filter beds and then a high-temperature catalytic reactor assembly. The water is then tested by onboard sensors and unacceptable water is cycled back through the water processor assembly.&lt;ref name=2005-01-2779 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISS-ECLSS-pdf /&gt;

The Volatile Removal Assembly flew on [[STS-89]] in January 1998 to demonstrate the Water Processor Assembly's catalytic reactor in microgravity. A Vapour Compression Distillation Flight Experiment flew, but was destroyed, in [[STS-107]].&lt;ref name=ISS-ECLSS-pdf /&gt;

The distillation assembly of the Urine Processor Assembly failed on November 21, 2008, one day after the initial installation.&lt;ref name=2009-01-2352 /&gt; One of the three centrifuge speed sensors was reporting anomalous speeds, and high centrifuge motor current was observed. This was corrected by re-mounting the distillation assembly without several rubber vibration isolators. The distillation assembly failed again on December 28, 2008 due to high motor current and was replaced on March 20, 2009. Ultimately, during post-failure testing, one centrifuge speed sensor was found to be out of alignment and a compressor bearing had failed.&lt;ref name=2010Status /&gt;

== Atmosphere ==
Several systems are currently used on board the ISS to maintain the spacecraft's atmosphere, which is similar to the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-station2.htm |title=How Space Stations Work|last=Craig Freudenrich|publisher=Howstuffworks|date=20 November 2000|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal air pressure on the ISS is 101.3&amp;nbsp;[[kilopascal|kPa]] (14.7&amp;nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]]); the same as at sea level on Earth. "While members of the ISS crew could stay healthy even with the pressure at a lower level, the equipment on the Station is very sensitive to pressure. If the pressure were to drop too far, it could cause problems with the Station equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=04-032&amp;gl=58|work=NASAexplores|title=5–8: The Air Up There|publisher=NASA|accessdate=31 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114010931/http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=04-032&amp;gl=58|archivedate=14 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Air revitalization system ===
Carbon dioxide and trace contaminants are removed by the Air Revitalization System. This is a NASA rack, placed in [[Node 3|''Tranquility'']], designed to provide a Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), a Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) to remove hazardous trace contamination from the atmosphere and a Major Constituent Analyser (MCA) to monitor [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], and [[water vapour]]. The Air Revitalization System was flown to the station aboard [[STS-128]] and was temporarily installed in the [[Japanese Experiment Module]] pressurised module. The system was scheduled to be transferred to ''Tranquility'' after it arrived and was installed during Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] mission [[STS-130]].&lt;ref name="STS-128 Presskit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/379392main_STS-128_Press_Kit.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=1 September 2009|title=STS-128 Press Kit|date=18 August 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxygen generating system ===
The Oxygen Generating System (OGS) is a NASA rack designed to electrolyse water from the Water Recovery System to produce oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is delivered to the cabin atmosphere.  The unit is installed in the [[Destiny Laboratory Module|''Destiny'']] module. During one of the [[spacewalk]]s conducted by [[STS-117]] astronauts, a hydrogen vent valve required to begin using the system was installed.&lt;ref name="International Space Station Status Report: SS07-01"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Space Station Status Report: SS07-01|publisher=NASA |date=5 January 2007 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jan/HQ_SS0701_station_status.html |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was delivered in 2006 by [[STS-121]], and became operational on 12 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/07/oxygen-generating-system-activated-onboard-iss/|title=Oxygen Generating System activated onboard ISS|accessdate=25 January 2010|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001, the US orbital segment had used oxygen in a pressurized storage tank on the Quest airlock module, or from the Russian service module. Prior to the activation of the Sabatier System in October 2010 hydrogen and carbon dioxide extracted from the cabin was vented overboard.&lt;ref name="ISS-ECLSS-pdf" /&gt; 

In 2011, American news outlet CBS news and news magazine spaceflightnow reported "The OGA over the past six months has not been running well because the water that's been fed to it is just slightly too acidic," said station Flight Director Chris Edelen. "For the past several months, the station crew has been using oxygen brought up aboard visiting Progress supply ships, a European cargo craft and the Russian [[#Elektron|Elektron]] oxygen generator while awaiting delivery of the OGA repair equipment. The OGA, like the [[#Elektron|Elektron]], uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. " &lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts133/110305fd10/index2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabatier system ===
The Sabatier system closes the loop in the ECLSS by combining waste hydrogen from the Oxygen generating system and carbon dioxide from the station atmosphere using the [[Sabatier reaction]] and preserving these valuable chemicals.  The outputs of this reaction are water, and methane.  The water is recycled to reduce the total amount of water that must be carried to the station from Earth, and the methane is vented overboard by the now shared hydrogen vent line installed for the Oxygen generating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/sabatier.html|title=The Sabatier System: Producing Water on the Space Station|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-08-17|work=NASA|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elektron ===
[[File:8 July 2011 Elektron.jpg|thumb|300px|Elektron units in the Zvezda service module.]]

Elektron is a [[Russia]]n Electrolytic Oxygen Generator, which was also used on [[Mir]]. It uses [[electrolysis]] to produce oxygen. This process splits water molecules reclaimed from other uses on board the station into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis. The oxygen is vented into the cabin and the hydrogen is vented into space. The three Russian [[#Elektron|Elektron]] oxygen generators on board the International Space Station have been plagued with problems, frequently forcing the crew to use backup sources (either bottled oxygen or the Vika system discussed below). To support a crew of six, NASA added the oxygen generating system discussed above.

In 2004, the [[#Elektron|Elektron]] unit shut down due to (initially) unknown causes. Two weeks of troubleshooting resulted in the unit starting up again, then immediately shutting down. The cause was eventually traced to gas bubbles in the unit, which remained non-functional until a [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] resupply mission in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2004/09/65026|publisher=Wired News|title=Space O2 Generator Fails Again|date=20 September 2004|author=Amit Asaravala|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 ISS personnel tapped into the oxygen supply of the recently arrived Progress resupply ship, when the [[#Elektron|Elektron]] unit failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/exp10_elektron_050104.html|publisher=Space.com|title=Repaired Oxygen Generator Fails Again Aboard ISS|date=4 January 2005|author=Tariq Malik|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 fumes from a malfunctioning Elektron unit prompted NASA flight engineers to declare a "spacecraft emergency". A burning smell led the ISS crew to suspect another Elektron fire, but the unit was only "very hot". A leak of corrosive, odorless [[potassium hydroxide]] forced the ISS crew to don gloves and face masks. It has been conjectured that the smell came from overheated rubber seals. The incident occurred shortly after [[STS-115]] left and just before arrival of a resupply mission (including [[Space tourism|space tourist]] [[Anousheh Ansari]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html|publisher=Spaceflight Now|title=Oxygen generator problem triggers station alarm|date=18 September 2006|author=William Harwood|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elektron did not come back online until November 2006, after new valves and cables arrived on the October 2006 Progress resupply vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/nov/HQ_SS06048_station_status.html|title=International Space Station Status Report #48|date=3 November 2006|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERPTC (Electrical Recovery Processing Terminal Current) was inserted into the ISS to prevent harm to the systems.

=== Vika ===
{{main|Vika oxygen generator}}
The Vika or TGK oxygen generator, also known as Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) when used on the ISS, is a [[chemical oxygen generator]] originally developed by [[Roscosmos]] for [[Mir]], and it provides an alternate oxygen generating system.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/44/44s_international_life_support.html Kerry Ellis - '''International Life Support''' - Ask Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; It uses canisters of solid lithium perchlorate, which are burned to create gaseous oxygen.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt; Each canister can supply the oxygen needs of one crewmember for one day. &lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vozdukh ===
Another Russian system, Vozdukh (Russian ''Воздух'', meaning "air"), removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2010-216126.pdf "In-Flight Carbon Dioxide Exposures and Related Symptoms: Association, Susceptibility, and Operational Implications"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627061502/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2010-216126.pdf |date=27 June 2011 }} (see page 6), NASA, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperature and Humidity Control ==

Temperature and Humidity Control (THC) is the subsystem of the ISS ECLSS concerned with the maintenance of a steady air temperature and the control of the moisture in the station's air supply.  Thermal Control System (TCS) is a component part of the THC system and subdivides into the Active Thermal Control System (ATCS, PDF document) and Passive Thermal Control System (PTCS). Controlling humidity is possible through lowering or raising the temperature and through adding moisture to the air.

== Fire Detection and Suppression ==

Fire Detection and Suppression (FDS) is the subsystem devoted to identifying that there has been a fire and taking steps to fight 
it.

'''Infantile esotropia''' is an ocular condition of early onset in which one or either eye turns inward. It is a specific sub-type of [[esotropia]] and has been a subject of much debate amongst ophthalmologists with regard to its naming, diagnostic features, and treatment.

== Presentation==

Historically the term 'congenital strabismus' was used to describe constant [[esotropias]] with onset between birth and six months of age. However, this term was felt to be an inadequate classification as it covered a variety of esotropias with different causes, features and prognoses.

In 1988, American ophthalmologist Gunter K. Von Noorden discussed what he described as 'Essential Infantile Esotropia'.&lt;ref&gt;von Noorden G.k.; A Reassessment of Infantile esotropia. XLIV Edward jackson Memorial lecture; American Journal of Ophthalmology, 1988; 105:1-10
&lt;/ref&gt; He described the condition as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"early acquired, not... congenital ..., although congenital factors may favor its development between the ages of 3 and 6 months"
&lt;/blockquote&gt; and identified this squint sub-type as having the following features:

# Onset between birth and six months of age.
# Large size (greater than 30 dioptres)
# Stable size
# Not associated with abnormalities of the [[central nervous system]].
# Often associated with defective abduction (outward movement) and excessive adduction (inward movement) of the eyes.
# Also associated with oblique muscle dysfunction and Dissociated Vertical Deviation.
# Initial alternation of the squint present with crossed fixation, i.e. the affected individual uses the left eye to look right and the right eye to look left.
# Limited potential for binocular vision.

The same condition had also previously been described by other ophthalmologists, notably Cianca (1962) who named it Cianca's Syndrome and noted the presence of manifest latent [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and Lang (1968) who called it Congenital Esotropia Syndrome and noted the presence of abnormal head postures. In both cases, however, the essential characteristics were the same, but with emphasis placed on different elements of the condition.

Helveston &lt;ref name="pmid8410573"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Helveston EM |title=19th annual Frank Costenbader Lecture--the origins of congenital esotropia |journal=Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=215–32 |year=1993 |pmid=8410573 |doi= |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993) further clarified and expanded upon von Noorden's work, and incorporated the work of both Lang and Cianca into his summary of the characteristics of the condition:

# Esotropia between 10 and 90 dioptres in size
# Either alternation or fixation preference may be present (if the latter then [[amblyopia]] may result).
# Neurologically normal.
# Hyperopic correction does not eliminate or significantly reduce the squint size.
# Frequent [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (latent or manifest latent).
# The patient may or may not have any or all of the following associated conditions: Oblique muscle dysfunction, vertical incomitance, dissociated vertical deviation, asymmetric optokinetic [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[torticollis]].
# Presence will be 'confirmed' by six months.
# Best treatment results in subnormal binocular vision.

The expressions ''congenital esotropia'', ''infantile esoptropia'', ''idiopathic infantile esotropia'' and ''essential infantile esotropia'' are often used interchangeably.

=== Cross-fixation ===
''Cross-fixation congenital esotropia'', also called ''Cianci's syndrome'' is a particular type of large-angle infantile esotropia associated with tight medius rectus muscles. With the tight muscles, which hinder adduction, there is a constant inward eye turn. The patient cross-fixates, that is, to fixate objects on the left, the patient looks across the nose with the right eye, and vice versa. The patient tends to adopt a head turn, turning the head to the right to better see objects in the left visual field and turning the head to the left to see those in the right visual field. [[Binasal occlusion]] can be used to discourage cross-fixation.&lt;ref name="TaubBartuccio2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc B. Taub|author2=Mary Bartuccio|author3=Dominick Maino|title=Visual Diagnosis and Care of the Patient with Special Needs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7vuKBfSCDQC&amp;pg=PA303|date=26 September 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4511-7834-0|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the management of cross-fixation congenital esotropia usually involves [[strabismus surgery|surgery]].&lt;ref name="WrightStrube2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth W. Wright|author2=Yi Ning J. Strube|title=Color Atlas Of Strabismus Surgery: Strategies and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6qLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=19 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4939-1480-7|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
This remains undetermined at the present time. A recent study by Major et al.&lt;ref name="MajorMaples2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Major|first1=Archima|last2=Maples|first2=W.C.|last3=Toomey|first3=Shannon|last4=DeRosier|first4=Wesley|last5=Gahn|first5=David|title=Variables associated with the incidence of infantile esotropia|journal=Optometry - Journal of the American Optometric Association|volume=78|issue=10|year=2007|pages=534–541|issn=1529-1839|doi=10.1016/j.optm.2006.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Prematurity, family history or secondary ocular history, perinatal or gestational complications, systemic disorders, use of supplemental oxygen as a neonate, use of systemic medications, and male sex were found to be significant risk factors for infantile esotropia.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further recent evidence indicates that a cause for ''infantile strabismus'' may lie with the input that is provided to the [[visual cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lawrence Tychsen|title=The Cause of Infantile Strabismus Lies Upstairs in the Cerebral Cortex, Not Downstairs in the Brainstem|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|year=2012|volume=130|number=8|pages=1060–1061|doi=10.1001/archophthalmol.2012.1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, neonates who suffer injuries that, directly or indirectly, perturb binocular inputs into the primary visual cortex (V1) have a far higher risk of developing strabismus than other infants.&lt;ref name="pmid18427630"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tychsen L |title=Causing and curing infantile esotropia in primates: the role of decorrelated binocular input (an American Ophthalmological Society thesis) |journal=Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society |volume=105 |issue= |pages=564–93 |year=2007 |pmid=18427630 |pmc=2258131 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published by Eltern für Impfaufklärung, a German Anti-Vaccination activist group, cites a study by The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), claiming significant correlation between children who received Vaccinations and the onset of cause of Spine, Face &amp; Eye Asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelika Kögel-Schauz|title=Ungeimpfte Kinder sind gesünder (Unvaccinated children are healthier)|journal=UngeimpfteGesuender|year=2011|pages=6|url=http://www.efi-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UngeimpfteGesuender.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
=== Differential Diagnosis ===

Clinically Infantile esotropia must be distinguished from:

# VIth Cranial nerve or abducens palsy
# Nystagmus Blockage Syndrome
# Esotropia arising secondary to central nervous system abnormalities (in [[cerebral palsy]] for example)
# Primary Constant esotropia
# Duane's Syndrome

== Treatment ==
According to a [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review of 2012, controversies remain regarding type of surgery, non-surgical intervention and age of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliott|first1=S|last2=Shafiq|first2=A|title=Interventions for infantile esotropia.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 July 2013|volume=7|pages=CD004917|pmid=23897277|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004917.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of treatment are as follows:

The elimination of any amblyopia&lt;br /&gt;
A cosmetically acceptable ocular alignment&lt;br /&gt;
long term stability of eye position&lt;br /&gt;
binocular cooperation.

=== Initially ===
It is essential that a child with strabismus is presented to the ophthalmologist as early as possible for diagnosis and treatment in order to allow best possible monocular and [[binocular vision]] to develop. Initially, the patient will have a full eye examination to identify any associated pathology, and any glasses required to optimise acuity will be prescribed – although infantile esotropia is not typically associated with [[refractive error]]. Studies have found that approximately 15% of infantile esotropia patients have [[accommodative esotropia]]. For these patients, antiaccommodative therapy (with spectacles) is indicated before any surgery as antiaccommodative therapy fully corrects their esotropia in many cases and significantly decreases their deviation angle in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.A. Havertape|author2=C.R. Whitfill|author3=O.A. Cruz|title=Early-onset accommodative esotropia|journal=Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|year=1999|volume=36|number=2|pages=69–73|pmid=10204132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.

Amblyopia will be treated via occlusion treatment (using [[Eye patch|patching]] or [[Atropine#Optical penalization|atropine drops]]) of the non-squinting eye with the aim of achieving full alternation of fixation. Management thereafter will be [[Strabismus surgery|surgical]].

=== Surgery ===
Controversy has arisen regarding the selection and planning of surgical procedures, the timing of surgery and about what constitutes a favourable outcome.

1. Selection and planning

Some ophthalmologists, notably Ing &lt;ref&gt;Ing M.R.; Early Surgical Aignment for Congenital Esotropia; Ophthalmology, 1983; 90: 132-135&lt;/ref&gt; and Helveston,&lt;ref&gt;Helveston E.M.; Ellis F.D.; Patterson J.H; Weber, J.; Augmented Recession of the Medial Recti. Ophthalmology (Rochester) 1978; 85: 507–511&lt;/ref&gt; favour a prescribed approach often involving multiple surgical episodes whereas others prefer to aim for full alignment of the eyes in one procedure and let the number of muscles operated upon during this procedure be determined by the size of the squint.

2. Timing and outcome

This debate relates to the technical anatomical difficulties of operating on the very young versus the possibility of an increased potential for binocularity associated with early surgery. Infants are often operated upon at the age of six to nine months of age&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedseye.com/strabismus_esotropia.htm Esotropia (Crossed Eyes)], Pediatric Ophthalmic Consultants&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases even earlier at three or four months of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healio.com/ophthalmology/pediatrics-strabismus/news/print/ocular-surgery-news/%7B6aa86645-ba50-4727-b4d7-d1f4aff20710%7D/experts-discuss-infantile-esotropia-airbag-injuries-and-timing-of-surgery Experts discuss infantile esotropia, airbag injuries and timing of surgery], Ocular Surgery News U.S. Edition, June 1, 2002 (downloaded 3 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Some emphasize the importance of intervening early such as to keep the duration of the patient's abnormal visual experience to a minimum.&lt;ref name="pmid19390468"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birch EE, Wang J |title=Stereoacuity outcomes after treatment of infantile and accommodative esotropia |journal=Optometry and Vision Science |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=647–52 |year=2009 |pmid=19390468 |pmc=2769257 |doi=10.1097/OPX.0b013e3181a6168d |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of early surgery believe that those who have their surgery before the age of one are more likely to be able to use both eyes together post-operatively.

A Dutch study (ELISSS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Simonsz HJ|author2=Kolling GH|author3=Unnebrink K.|title=Final report of the early vs. late infantile strabismus surgery study (ELISSS), a controlled, prospective, multicenter study|journal=Strabismus| date=December 2005 |number=13|volume=4|pages=169–199|pmid=16361188}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared early with late surgery in a prospective, controlled, non-randomized, multicenter trial and reported that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Children operated early had better gross stereopsis at age six as compared to children operated late. They had been operated more frequently, however, and a substantial number of children in both [originally-recruited] groups had not been operated at all.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other studies also report better results with early surgery, notably Birch and Stager&lt;ref&gt;Birch EE, Stager DR Sr.Long-term motor and sensory outcomes after early surgery for infantile esotropia. J AAPOS. 2006 Oct;10(5):409-13&lt;/ref&gt; and Murray et al.&lt;ref&gt;Murray AD, Orpen J, Calcutt C. Changes in the functional binocular status of older children and adults with previously untreated infantile esotropia following late surgical realignment. J AAPOS. 2007 Apr;11(2):125-30. Epub 2007 Feb 15&lt;/ref&gt; but do not comment on the number of operations undertaken. A recent study on 38 children concluded that surgery for infantile esotropia is most likely to result in measureable [[stereopsis]] if patient age at alignment is not more than 16 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Eren Çerman |author2=Muhsin Eraslan |author3=Mehdi S. Öğüt |title=The relationship of age when motor alignment is achieved and the subsequent development of stereopsis in infantile esotropia |journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus |volume=18 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=222–225 |doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2013.12.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another study found that for children with infantile esotropia early surgery decreases the risk of [[dissociated vertical deviation]] developing after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arslan U, Atilla H, Erkam N |title=Dissociated vertical deviation and its relationship with time and type of surgery in infantile esotropia |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=740–2 |date=June 2010  |pmid=20508049 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2008.157016 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside the strabismus itself, there are other aspects or conditions that appear to improve after surgery or [[Botulinum toxin therapy of strabismus|botulinum toxin eye alignment]]. Study outcomes have indicated that after surgery the child catches up in development of fine-motor skills (such as grasping a toy and handling a bottle) and of [[Gross motor skill|large-muscle skills]] (such as sitting, standing, and walking) in case a developmental delay was present before.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080417095928.htm Babies' Development 'Catches Up' After Surgery To Fix Crossed Eyes], sciencedaily.com, 21 April 2008 (downloaded 4 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also indicates that as of the age of six, strabismic children become less accepted by their peers, leaving them potentially exposed to social exclusion starting at this age unless their eye positioning is corrected by this time&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818205308.htm Six-Year-Olds With Squint Less Likely to Be Invited to Birthday Parties, Study Suggests], sciencedaily.com, 19 August 2010 (downloaded 4 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also:'' [[Strabismus#Psychosocial effects|Psychosocial effects of strabismus]]).

==Electrical temperature sensors==
* [[Thermistor]]- Thermistors are thermally sensitive resistors whose prime function is to exhibit a large, predictable and precise change in electrical resistance when subjected to a corresponding change in body temperature. Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors exhibit a decrease in electrical resistance when subjected to an increase in body temperature and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) thermistors exhibit an increase in electrical resistance when subjected to an increase in body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussensor.com/technical-info/what-is-a-thermistor  What is a Thermistor] U.S. Sensor Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''machine industry''' or '''machinery industry''' is a subsector of the [[industry]], that produces and maintains [[machine]]s for consumers, the industry, and most other companies in the economy.

This machine industry traditionally belongs to the [[heavy industry]]. Nowadays, many smaller companies in this branch are considered part of the [[light industry]]. Most manufacturers in the machinery industry are called [[machine factories]].

== Overview ==
The machine industry is a subsector of the industry that produces a range of products from [[power tool]]s, different [[machine#Type|types of machines]], and [[domestic technology]] to [[factory]] equipment etc. On the one hand the machine industry provides:
* The [[means of production]] for businesses in the [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[industry]] and [[construction]].
* The [[means of production]] for [[public utility]], such as equipment for the production and distribution of gas, electricity and water.
* A range of supporting equipment for all sectors of the economy, such as equipment for [[heating]], ventilation, and [[air conditioning]] of buildings.
These means of production are called [[capital good]]s, because a certain amount of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is [[invested]]. Much of those production machines require regular maintenance, which becomes supplied specialized companies in the machine industry.

On the other end the machinery industry supplies consumer goods, including kitchen appliances, refrigerators, washers, dryers and a like. Production of radio and television, however, is generally considered belonging to the electrical equipment industry. The machinery industry itself is a major customer of the [[steel industry]].

The production of the machinery industry varies widely from single-unit production and [[series production]] to [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="MAO 1996"&gt;M.A. Overboom (1996). ''[http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/edn/nds96007.pdf Sectorstudie machine-industrie].'' ECN-Beleidsstudies, Petten.&lt;/ref&gt; Single-unit production is about constructing unique products, which are specified in specific customer [[requirements]]. Due to [[modular design]] such devices and machines can often be manufactured in small series, which significantly reduces the costs. From a certain stage in the production, the specific customer requirements are build in, and the unique product is created.&lt;ref name="MAO 1996"/&gt;

{{See also|History of technology}}
The machinery industry came into existence during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Companies in this emerging field grew out of iron [[foundries]], [[shipyards]], [[forge]]s and repair shops.&lt;ref name="HWL 1993"&gt;H.W. Lintsen (red.) (1993). ''Geschiedenis van de techniek in Nederland. De wording van een moderne samenleving 1800-1890. Deel IV''. p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Often companies were a combination of machine factory and shipyard. Early in the 20th century several [[motorcycle]] and [[automobile manufacturer]]s began their own machine factories.

Prior to the industrial revolution a variety of machines existed such as [[clock]]s, [[weapon]]s and running gear for mills ([[watermill]], [[windmill]], [[horse mill]] etc.) Production of these machines were on much smaller scale in artisan [[workshop]]s mostly for the local or regional market. With the advent of the industrial revolution manufacturing began of composite tools with more complex construction, such as [[steam engine]]s and [[steam generator]]s for the evolving industry and transport.&lt;ref name="HWL 1993"/&gt; In addition, the emerging machine factories started making machines for production machines as textile machinery, compressors, agricultural machinery, and engines for ships.

=== 18th century ===
During the first decades of the industrial revolution in England, from 1750, there was a concentration of labor usually in not yet mechanized factories. There were all kinds of new machines invented, which were initially made by the inventors themselves. Early in the 18th century, the first steam engines, the [[Newcomen engine]], came into use throughout Britain and Europe, principally to pump water out of mines.

In the 1770s [[James Watt]] significantly improved this design. He introduced a steam engine easy employable to supply a large amounts of energy, which set the mechanization of factories underway. In England certain cities concentrated on making specific products, such as specific types of textiles or pottery. Around these cities specialized machinery industry arose in order to enable the mechanization of the plants. Hereby late in the 18th century arose the first machinery industry in the UK and also in Germany and Belgium.

=== 19th century ===
The Industrial Revolution received a further boost with the upcoming [[railways]]. These arose at the beginning of the 19th century in England as innovation in the [[mining industry]]. The work in coal mines was hard and dangerous, and so there was a great need for tools to ease this work. In 1804, [[Richard Trevithick]] placed the first steam engine on rails, and was in 1825 the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was opened, intended to transport coals from the mine to the port. In 1835 the first train drove in continental Europe between Mechelen and Brussels, and in the Netherlands in 1839 the first train drove between Amsterdam and Haarlem. For the machinery industry this brought all sorts of new work with new machinery for metallurgy, machine tool for metalworking, production of steam engines for trains with all its necessities etc.

In time the market for the machine industry became wider, specialized products were manufactured for a greater national and often international market. For example, it was not uncommon in the second half of the 19th century that American steelmakers ordered their production in England, where new steelmaking techniques were more advanced. In the far east Japan would import these product until the early 1930s, the creation of an own machinery industry got underway. .

=== 20th century to now ===
The term "machinery industry" came into existence later in the 19th century. One of the first times this branch of industry was recognized as such, and was investigated, was in a production statistics of 1907 created by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Trade and Industry]]. In this statistic the output of the engineering industry, was divided into forty different categories, including for example, agricultural machinery, machinery for the textile industry and equipment, and parts for train and tram.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Floud (2006). ''The British Machine Tool Industry, 1850-1914.'' p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventions of new propulsion techniques based on electric motors, internal combustion engines and gas turbines brought a new generation of machines in the 20th century from cars to household appliances. Not only the product range of the machinery industry increased considerably, especially smaller machines could delivered products in much greater numbers fabricated in [[mass production]].  With the rise of mass production in other parts of the industry, there was also a high demand for manufacturing and production systems, to increase the entire production.

Shortage of labor in [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, raised the need for further mechanization of production, which required for more specific machines. The rise of the computer made further automation of production possible, which in turn set new demands on the machinery industry.

== Classification ==
The machinery industry produces different kind of products, for example engines, pumps, logistics equipment; for different kind of markets from the agriculture industry, food &amp; beverage industry, manufacturing industry, health industry, and amusement industry till different branches of the [[consumer market]]. As such companies in the machine industry can be classified by product of market.

In the world of today all kinds of [[Industry classification]]s exists. Some classifications recognize the machine industry as a specific class, and offer a subdivision for this field. For example, the Dutch [[Standard Industrial Classification]] of 1993, developed by the  [[Statistics Netherlands]], give the following breakdown of the machinery industry:

{| class="wikitable"
! SIC code
! Description sector
! Products (according to the Standard Industrial Classification of the CBS 1993)
|-
| 291 || Manufacture of for the production of mechanical energy, and application and overhaul || [[Engine]]s and [[turbine]]s, [[pump]]s and [[gas compressor|compressor]]s, [[valve]]s, [[gear]]s, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s and other gear.
|-
| 292 || Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery and equipment || [[Industrial furnaces]] and burners, [[lifting equipment]], lifting equipment and other transport equipment; machines and equipment for industrial [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]]; machinery and equipment
|-
| 293 || [[Agricultural machinery industry|Manufacture of agricultural machinery and equipment]] || Agricultural [[tractor]]s; [[agricultural machinery]] and agricultural implements 
|-
| 294 || [[Machine tool builder|Manufacture of machine tools]] || [[Machine tools]]
|-
| 295 || Manufacture of machinery for specific industrial activities and devices || Machines for iron - and steel production; machines for mineral extraction and construction; machines and devices for the food and beverage industry; machines and equipment for the textile, clothing, leather and leather products industry; machinery and equipment for paper and paperboard production; Other machinery and equipment 
|-
| 296 || [[Arms industry|Manufacture of weapons and ammunition]] || [[Weapons]] and [[ammunition]]
|-
| 297 || Manufacture of domestic appliances || electrical household appliances; non electric domestic appliances
|}

This composition of the machinery industry has been significantly altered with latest revision of the Dutch Standard Industrial Classification of 1993. The Standard Industrial Classification of 1974 broke down the machinery industry into nine sectors:
* [[Agricultural machine industry]]
* [[Metalworking]] Machine - Industry and [[Machine tool builder|machine tool factories]]
* Manufacturers of machinery and equipment for the food, chemical and allied industries
* Manufacturers of machinery and equipment for the rubber and plastics
* Manufacturers of gears, gearing and driving elements
* Manufacturers of machinery and equipment and wood furniture etc.
* Manufacturers of steam boiler, and power tools industry
* Office machinery industry
* Other machinery and equipment industry
It may be clear that classification is by markets, and the more recent classification is by product.

== Products of the machine industry ==
The machine industry makes a very diverse range of products. A selection:

== Machine industry in different countries ==

=== Germany ===
In Germany, in 2011 about 900,000 people were employed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/meldungen/Maschinenbauer-optimistisch-article3012296.html Geschäft auf Hochtouren : Maschinenbau brummt], Accessed June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  in the machine industry and an estimated of 300,000 abroad. The combined turnover of the sector was €130 billion, of which 60% came from export. There were about 6,600 active companies, and 95% of those companies employed less than 500 people. Each employee generated an average of 148,000 Euro. Some of the largest companies in Germany are [[DMG Mori Seiki AG]], [[GEA Group]], [[Siemens AG]], and [[ThyssenKrupp]].

=== France ===
In the French machinery industry in 2009 about 650,000 people were employed, and the sector generated a turnover of 98 billion euros. Because of the crisis, the turnover of the sector had fallen by 15 percent. Due to stronger consumer spending and continuing demand from the energy sector and transport sector, the damage of the crisus was still limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentschapnl.nl/nieuws/frankrijk-ontwikkelingen-de-mechanische-industrie Frankrijk: ontwikkelingen in de mechanische industrie], at agentschapnl.nl. Accessed April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands in 1996, a total of some 93,000 workers were employed in the machinery industry, with approximately 2,500 companies present. In 1000 of these companies there were working 20 or more employees.&lt;ref name="MAO 1996"/&gt; In the Netherlands, according to the Chamber of Commerce in this subsector of the industry in 2011 some 15,000 companies were active.&lt;ref&gt;''Branchewijzer van de Nederlandse Kamer van Koophandel,'' Feb. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the largest companies in the Netherlands are [[Lely (company)]], [[Philips]] and [[Stork B.V.]].

=== United States ===
U.S. machinery industries had total domestic and foreign sales of $413.7 billion in 2011.  The United States is the world’s largest market for machinery, as well as the third-largest supplier. American manufacturers held a 58.5 percent share of the U.S. domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://selectusa.commerce.gov/industry-snapshots/machinery-and-equipment-industry-united-states The Machinery and Equipment Industry in the United States] at selectusa.commerce.gov.

On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of [[Yahoo!]], effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.&lt;ref name=MM-B-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=MM-B-18/&gt; To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&amp;J.

Mayer made ''Fortune'' magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sellers |first=Patricia |url=http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2013/11/21/mayer-women-businessperson-of-the-year/ |title=Marissa Mayer's unprecedented amazing trifecta – Postcards |publisher=Postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com |date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, ''Fortune'' then named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"/&gt;

On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company [[Richtopia]] at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richtopia.com/inspirational-people/500-ceos|title=Top 500 CEOs: From Tim Cook to Justine Roberts, These Are the Most Influential CEOs in the World|work=Richtopia|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer appeared on the [[List of women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies]] in 2017, having ranked 498 of the top 500 [[Fortune 500]] company CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Emma|title=More women than ever lead Fortune 500 companies this year — but it's still not that many|url=https://mashable.com/2017/06/07/fortune-500-2017-women-ceos/#aMXEcanZAmqT|website=Mashable|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nanopore''' is a pore of [[nanometer]] size. It may, for example, be created by a pore-forming protein or as a hole in synthetic materials such as silicon or graphene.

When a nanopore is present in an electrically insulating [[artificial membrane|membrane]], it can be used as a single-[[molecule]] detector.  It can be a biological protein channel in a high electrical resistance [[lipid bilayer]], a pore in a solid-state membrane or a hybrid of these – a protein channel set in a synthetic membrane. The detection principle is based on monitoring the ionic current passing through the nanopore as a voltage is applied across the membrane. When the nanopore is of molecular dimensions, passage of molecules (e.g., [[DNA]]) cause interruptions of the "open" current level, leading to a "translocation event" signal. The passage of RNA or single-stranded DNA molecules through the membrane-embedded alpha-hemolysin channel (1.5&amp;nbsp;nm diameter), for example, causes a ~90% blockage of the current (measured at 1 M KCl solution).&lt;ref name="pmid10585944"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akeson M, Branton D, Kasianowicz JJ, Brandin E, Deamer DW |title=Microsecond time-scale discrimination among polycytidylic acid, polyadenylic acid, and polyuridylic acid as homopolymers or as segments within single RNA molecules |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=3227–33 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10585944 |pmc=1300593 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77153-5 |bibcode=1999BpJ....77.3227A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be considered a [[Coulter counter]] for much smaller particles.

==Biological and protein nanopores==
Nanopores may be formed by pore-forming proteins,&lt;ref name="pmid19494904"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bayley H |title=Membrane-protein structure: Piercing insights |journal=Nature |volume=459  |pages=651–652  |date=June 2009 |pmid=19494904 |doi=10.1038/459651a |issue=7247|bibcode=2009Natur.459..651B}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically a hollow core passing through a mushroom-shaped protein molecule.  Examples of pore-forming proteins are alpha [[hemolysin]] and [[MspA porin]].  In typical laboratory nanopore experiments, a single protein nanopore is inserted into a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane and single-channel [[electrophysiology]] measurements are taken.

==Solid state nanopores==
Solid-state nanopores are generally made in [[silicon]] compound membranes, one of the most common being [[silicon nitride]]. Solid-state nanopores can be manufactured with several techniques including [[ion-beam sculpting]]&lt;ref name="pmid11449268"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Stein D, McMullan C, Branton D, Aziz MJ, Golovchenko JA |title=Ion-beam sculpting at nanometre length scales |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6843 |pages=166–9 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11449268 |doi=10.1038/35084037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and electron beams.&lt;ref name="pmid12858166"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Storm AJ, Chen JH, Ling XS, Zandbergen HW, Dekker C |title=Fabrication of solid-state nanopores with single-nanometre precision |journal=Nat Mater |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=537–40 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12858166 |doi=10.1038/nmat941 |bibcode=2003NatMa...2..537S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the use of  [[graphene]]&lt;ref name="pmid20720538"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garaj S, Hubbard W, Reina A, Kong J, Branton D, Golovchenko J |title=Graphene as a sub-nanometer trans-electrode membrane |journal=Nature |volume=467 |issue=7312 |pages=190–3 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20720538 |doi=10.1038/nature09379 |pmc=2956266|arxiv=1006.3518 |bibcode=2010Natur.467..190G }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a material for solid-state nanopore sensing has been explored. Another example of solid-state nanopores is a box-shaped graphene (BSG) [[nanostructure]].&lt;ref name="stm2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=2016|title=STM observation of a box-shaped graphene nanostructure appeared after mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=360|issue=|pages=451–460|publisher=Elsevier B. V.|location=Netherlands|issn=0169-4332|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.09.222|url=http://www.niifp.ru/staff/lapshin/en/index.htm#stm2016|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202033454/http://www.niifp.ru/staff/lapshin/en/index.htm#stm2016|archivedate=2008-12-02|df=|arxiv=1611.04379|bibcode=2016ApSS..360..451L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSG nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1&amp;nbsp;nm. The typical width of channel facets makes about 25&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Nanopore measurement in track etched membranes==
Since the discovery of track-etched technology in the late 1960s, filter membranes with needed diameter have found application potential in various fields including food safety, environmental pollution, biology, medicine, fuel cell, and chemistry. These track-etched membranes are typically made in polymer membrane through track-etching procedure, during which the polymer membrane is first irradiated by heavy ion beam to form tracks and then cylindrical pores or asymmetric pores are created along the track after wet etching.

As important as fabrication of the filter membranes with proper diameters, characterizations and measurements of these materials are of the same paramount. Until now, a few of methods have been developed, which can be classified into the following categories according to the physical mechanisms they exploited: imaging methods such as [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM), [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM), [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM); fluid transport such as bubble point and gas transport; fluid adsorptions such as nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BEH), mercury porosimetry, liquid-vapor equilibrium (BJH), gas-liquid equilibrium (permoporometry) and liquid-solid equilibrium (thermoporometry); electronic conductance; ultrasonic spectroscopy; and molecular transport.

More recently, the use of  light transmission technique&lt;ref name="pmid24169442"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Li Yang |author2=Qingfeng Zhai |author3=Guijuan Li |author4=Hong Jiang |author5=Lei Han |author6=Jiahai Wang |author7=Erkang Wang |title=Light Transmission Technique for Pore Size Measurement in Track-Etched Membranes|journal=Chemical Communications |volume= 49|issue= 97|pages= 11415–7|date=October 2013 |pmid=24169442 |doi=10.1039/c3cc45841e }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a method for nanopore size measurement has been proposed.

==Ion current rectification ==
Ion current rectification (ICR) is an important phenomenon for nanopore. Ion current rectification can also be used as a drug sensor&lt;ref name="pmid18393663"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=JiaHai Wang |author2=Charles R Martin |title=A new drug-sensing paradigm based on ion-current rectification in a conically shaped nanopore|journal=Nanomedicine|volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=13–20 |year=2008 |month= |pmid=18393663 |doi=10.2217/17435889.3.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22284488"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhijun Guo |author2=Jiahai Wang |author3=Erkang Wang |title=Selective discrimination of small hydrophobic biomolecules based on ion-current rectification in conically shaped nanochannel.|journal=Talanta|volume= 89|issue= |pages= 253–7|date=October 2013 |pmid=22284488 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2011.12.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be employed to investigate charge status in the polymer membrane.&lt;ref name="pmid21826328"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhijun Guo |author2=Jiangtao Ren |author3=Jiahai Wang |author4=Erkang Wang |title=pH-reversed ionic current rectification displayed by conically shaped nanochannel without any modification|journal=Nanoscale|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 3767–73|date=October 2013 |pmid=21826328 |doi=10.1039/c1nr10434a|bibcode=2011Nanos...3.3767G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanopore based sequencing==
The observation that a passing strand of DNA containing different bases results in different blocking levels has led to the [[nanopore sequencing]] hypothesis. [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] and Professor Hagan Bayley's laboratories have shown identification of individual nucleotides including methylated cytosine as they pass through a modified hemolysin nanopore.&lt;ref name="pmid19350039"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke J, Wu HC, Jayasinghe L, Patel A, Reid A, Bayley H |title= Continuous base identification for single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing |journal= Nature Nanotechnology|volume=4 |issue= 4 |pages=265–270 |year=2009 |pmid=19350039 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.12|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n4/full/nnano.2009.12.html|bibcode=2009NatNa...4..265C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from rapid [[DNA sequencing theory|DNA sequencing]], other applications include separation of single stranded and double stranded DNA in solution, and the determination of length of [[polymer]]s. At this stage, nanopores are making contributions to the understanding of polymer biophysics, as well as to single-molecule analysis of DNA-protein interactions.

==Size tunable nanopores==

Size-tunable elastomeric nanopores have been fabricated, allowing accurate measurement of nanoparticles as they occlude the flow of ionic current.This measurement methodology can be used to measure a wide range of particle types. In contrast to the limitations of solid-state pores, they allow for the optimisation of the resistance pulse magnitude relative to the background current by matching the pore-size closely to the particle-size. As detection occurs on a particle by particle basis, the true average and polydispersity distribution can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seth Roberts, Darby Kozak, Will Anderson, Murray F. Broom, Robert Vogel and Matt Trau. Tunable Nano/Micropores for Particle Detection and Discrimination: Scanning Ion Occlusion Spectroscopy". Small (2010) - Volume 6, Issue 23, pages 2653–2658.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Sowerby, Murray F. Broom, George B. Petersen. "Dynamically resizable nanometre-scale apertures for molecular sensing" Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical Volume 123, Issue 1 (2007), pages 325-330&lt;/ref&gt; Using this principle, the world's only commercial tunable nanopore-based particle detection system has been developed by [[Izon Science|Izon Science Ltd]]. The box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure can be used as a basis for building devices with changeable pore sizes.&lt;ref name="stm2016" /&gt;

==Alternative definition==
These can be about 20&amp;nbsp;nm in a diameter. They are integrated into artificially constructed encapsulated cells of [[silicon wafer]]s. These pores allow small molecules like [[oxygen]], [[glucose]] and [[insulin]] to pass however they prevent large immune system molecules like [[immunoglobin]]s from passing. As an example, rat pancreatic cells are microencapsulated, they receive nutrients and release insulin through nanopores being totally isolated from their neighboring environment i.e. foreign cells. This knowledge can help to replace nonfunctional islets of [[Langerhans cell]]s in the pancreas (responsible for producing insulin), by harvested piglet cells. They can be implanted underneath the human skin without the need of immunosuppressants which put diabetic patients at a risk of infection.

'''Nitromethane''' is an [[organic compound]] with the chemical formula {{chem|CH|3|NO|2}}. It is the simplest organic [[nitro compound]].  It is a polar liquid commonly used as a solvent in a variety of industrial applications such as in extractions, as a reaction medium, and as a cleaning solvent.  As an intermediate in [[organic synthesis]], it is used widely in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, explosives, fibers, and coatings.&lt;ref name=Markofsky/&gt;  Nitromethane is used as a fuel additive in various [[motorsports]] and hobbies, e.g.  [[Top Fuel]] [[drag racing]] and miniature [[Model aircraft#Internal combustion|internal combustion engines]] in [[Radio-controlled aircraft|radio control]], [[control line]] and [[free flight (model aircraft)|free flight]] model aircraft.

== Preparation ==
Nitromethane is produced industrially by combining [[propane]] and [[nitric acid]] in the gas phase at 350–450&amp;nbsp;°C (662–842&amp;nbsp;°F).  This [[exothermic]] reaction produces the four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, [[nitroethane]], [[1-nitropropane]], and [[2-Nitropropane|2-nitropropane]].  The reaction involves free radicals, including the alkoxyl radicals of the type CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which arise via homolysis of the corresponding nitrite [[ester]].  These alkoxy radicals are susceptible to C—C fragmentation reactions, which explains the formation of a mixture of products.&lt;ref name=Markofsky&gt;{{ cite encyclopedia | author = Markofsky, S. B. | title = Nitro Compounds, Aliphatic | encyclopedia = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2000 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a17_401.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory methods===
It can be prepared in other methods that are of instructional value.  The reaction of [[chloroacetic acid|sodium chloroacetate]] with [[sodium nitrite]] in [[aqueous]] solution produces this compound:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Whitmore, F. C. | author2 = Whitmore, M. G. | title = Nitromethane | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 401 | year = 1941 | prep = cv1p0401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COONa + NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] + [[sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

==Uses==
The principal use of nitromethane is as a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, which are used in [[dry cleaning]], semiconductor processing, and degreasing.  It is also used most effectively as a solvent or dissolving agent for acrylate [[monomer]]s, such as [[cyanoacrylate]]s (more commonly known as "super-glue").&lt;ref name=Markofsky/&gt;  It is also used as a fuel in some forms of racing.

==Reactions==
===Acid-base properties===
Nitromethane is a relatively acidic [[carbanion|carbon acid]].  It has a pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 17.2 in [[DMSO]] solution.  This value indicates an aqueous pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of about 11.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, F. G.; Satish, A. V., "Is Resonance Important in Determining the Acidities of Weak Acids or the Homolytic Bond Dissociation Enthalpies (BDEs) of Their Acidic H-A Bonds?", J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, volume 116, 8885-8889. {{DOI|10.1021/ja00099a004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is slow to deprotonate.  Protonation of the [[conjugate base]] O2NCH2-, which is nearly isosteric with [[nitrate]], occurs initially at oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Kramarz, K. W.; Norton, J. R., "Slow Proton Transfer Reactions in Organometallic and Bioinorganic Chemistry", Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1994, 42, 1-65.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic reactions===
In [[organic synthesis]] nitromethane is employed as a one carbon [[synthon|building block]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ OrgSynth | author = Dauben, H. J. Jr. | author2 = Ringold, H. J. | author3 = Wade, R. H. | author4 = Pearson, D. L. | author5 = Anderson, A. G. Jr. | author6 = de Boer, T. J. | author7 = Backer, H. J. | title = Cycloheptanone | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 221 | year = 1963 | prep = cv4p0221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ OrgSynth | author = Noland,  W. E. | title = 2-Nitroethanol | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 833 | year = 1963 | prep = cv5p0833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its acidity allows it to undergo deprotonation, enabling condensation reactions analogous to those of carbonyl compounds.  Thus, under base catalysis, nitromethane adds to [[aldehyde]]s in 1,2-addition in the [[nitroaldol reaction]].  Some important derivatives include the pesticides [[chloropicrin]] (Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[beta-Nitrostyrene|beta-nitrostyrene]], and tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, ((HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Reduction of the latter gives tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, (HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, better known as [[tris]], a widely used  [[Buffer solution|buffer]]. In more specialized [[organic synthesis]], nitromethane serves as a Michael donor, adding to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via 1,4-addition in the [[Michael reaction]].

===As an engine fuel===
Nitromethane is used as a fuel in motor racing, particularly [[drag racing]], as well as for [[radio-controlled]] models&lt;ref name=Markofsky/&gt; (such as [[cars]], [[airplane|plane]]s and [[helicopters]]). In this context, nitromethane is commonly referred to as "nitro", and is the principal ingredient for fuel used in the "[[Top Fuel]]" category of drag racing.

The [[oxygen]] content of nitromethane enables it to burn with much less atmospheric oxygen.
:4 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   → 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The amount of air required to burn {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of gasoline is {{convert|14.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but only {{convert|1.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of air is required for 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitromethane. Since an engine's cylinder can only contain a limited amount of air on each stroke, 8.6 times more nitromethane than gasoline can be burned in one stroke. Nitromethane, however, has a lower specific energy: gasoline provides about 42–44 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg, whereas nitromethane provides only 11.3 MJ/kg.  This analysis indicates that nitromethane generates about 2.3 times the power of gasoline when combined with a given amount of oxygen.

Nitromethane can also be used as a [[monopropellant]], i.e., a fuel that burns without added oxygen.  The following equation describes this process:
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 CO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Nitromethane has a [[Laminar flame speed|laminar combustion velocity]] of approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;m/s, somewhat higher than gasoline, thus making it suitable for high-speed engines. It also has a somewhat higher [[Adiabatic flame temperature|flame temperature]] of about {{convert|2400|C|F}}. The high heat of vaporization of 0.56 MJ/kg together with the high fuel flow provides significant cooling of the incoming charge (about twice that of methanol), resulting in reasonably low temperatures

Nitromethane is usually used with [[Air-fuel ratio|rich air–fuel mixtures]] because it provides power even in the absence of atmospheric oxygen. When rich air–fuel mixtures are used, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are two of the combustion products.  These gases often ignite, sometimes spectacularly, as the normally very rich mixtures of the still burning fuel exits the exhaust ports. Very rich mixtures are necessary to reduce the temperature of combustion chamber hot parts in order to control pre-ignition and subsequent detonation. Operational details depend on the particular mixture and engine characteristics.

A small amount of [[hydrazine]] blended in nitromethane can increase the power output even further. With nitromethane, hydrazine forms an explosive salt that is again a monopropellant. This unstable mixture poses a severe safety hazard and the [[Academy of Model Aeronautics]] does not permit its use in competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.modelaircraft.org/files/2015-2016General.pdf |title=AMA Competition Regulations 2015-2016 Part 7. Fuels |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |page=24 |date=February 15, 2016 |website=www.modelaircraft.org |publisher=Academy of Model Aeronautics |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[model aircraft]] and [[model car|car]] [[glow fuel]], the primary ingredient is generally [[methanol]] with some nitromethane (0% to 65%, but rarely over 30%, and 10–20% lubricants (usually [[castor oil]] and/or [[synthetic oil]]).  Even moderate amounts of nitromethane tend to increase the power created by the engine (as the limiting factor is often the air intake), making the engine easier to tune (adjust for the proper air/fuel ratio).

====Explosive properties====
Nitromethane was not known to be a high [[explosive]] until a railroad tanker car loaded with it exploded on {{#dateformat:June 1, 1958}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blet602.org/Historic_accidents/Mt.%20Pulaski_6.1.1958.pdf | format = PDF | author = Interstate Commerce Commission | work = Ex Parte No 213 | title = Accident Near Mt. Pulaski, ILL }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much testing, it was realized that nitromethane was a more energetic high explosive than [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], although TNT has a higher [[Detonation velocity|velocity of detonation]] (VoD) and [[brisance]].  Both of these explosives are oxygen-poor, and some benefits are gained from mixing with an [[oxidizer]], such as [[ammonium nitrate]].  Pure nitromethane is an insensitive explosive with a VoD of approximately {{convert|6400|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}, but even so inhibitors may be used to reduce the hazards. The tank car explosion was speculated to be due to [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] compression, a hazard common to all liquid explosives.  This is when small entrained air bubbles compress and superheat with rapid rises in pressure.  It was thought that an operator rapidly snapped shut a valve creating a "[[water hammer|hammer-lock]]" pressure surge.

Nitromethane can also be mixed with ammonium nitrate, which is used as an oxidizer, to form an explosive mixture known as [[ANFO#ANNM|ANNM]].  One graphic example of this was the use of nitromethane and ammonium nitrate in the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].

====Nitromethane exhaust====
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
[[Exhaust gas]] from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes nitromethane will contain [[nitric acid]] vapour, which is corrosive, and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe.  The condensed nitric acid-based residue left over in a glow-fueled model engine after a model-flight session can also corrode their internal components, usually mandating use of a combination of [[kerosene]] to neutralize the residual nitric acid, and an "after-run oil" (often the lower-viscosity "air tool oil" variety of a popular [[Marvel Mystery Oil|preservative oil]]) for lubrication to safeguard against such damage, when such an engine is placed into storage.

==Purification==
Nitromethane is a popular solvent in organic and electroanalytical chemistry.  It can be purified by cooling below its freezing point, washing the solid with cold [[diethyl ether]], followed by distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Coetzee, J. F. |author2=Chang, T.-H. | title = Recommended Methods for the Purification of Solvents and Tests for Impurities: Nitromethane | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | year = 1986 | volume = 58 | issue = 11 | pages = 1541–1545 | doi = 10.1351/pac198658111541 | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1986/pdf/5811x1541.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazard)'''  is the [[Philippines]]' primary [[disaster risk reduction|disaster risk reduction and management]] program. It was initially administered by the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST) from 2012 to 2017, but is now managed by the [[University of the Philippines]].

==History and services==
Project NOAH was a response to President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s call on a better disaster prevention and mitigation system in the Philippines in the aftermath of the destructive [[Tropical Storm Sendong]] in December 2011.&lt;ref name=abtnoah&gt;{{cite web|title=About Project NOAH|url=http://www.gov.ph/programs/about-project-noah/|website=Official Gazette|publisher=Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UP_adpt" /&gt; It was publicly launched by President Aquino, project head [[Mahar Lagmay]], and 
other government officials in [[Marikina]] on July 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech of President Aquino at the launching of Project NOAH, July 6, 2012|url=http://www.gov.ph/2012/07/06/speech-of-president-aquino-at-the-launching-of-project-noah-july-6-2012/|website=Official Gazette|publisher=Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program combines science and technology for disaster risk reduction and management.&lt;ref name=rappler&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tupaz|first1=Voltaire|title=UP disaster scientist wins top European geosciences award|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/90166-alfredo-mahar-lagmay-up-disaster-scientist-wins-european-geosciences-union-award|accessdate=29 November 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a responsive program that aims to provide a 6-hour lead-time warning to agencies involved in disaster prevention and mitigation.&lt;ref name=wiki-yt&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the 2014 WikiPinoy of the Year, Dr. Alfredo Mahar Francisco Lagmay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=legPDefATVk|publisher=Vibal Foundation and WikiPilipinas|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also uses advanced technologies to enhance current geo-hazard vulnerability maps. It is also being developed with the help of the [[National Institute of Geological Sciences]] and the [[University of the Philippines College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] of the [[University of the Philippines]]; the [[PAGASA|Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA); the [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (PHIVOLCS); the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI), and the Science and Technology Information Institute (STII).&lt;ref name=abtnoah /&gt;The project is now composed of twenty-one institutions from the local and private sectors, including media and telecommunication companies.&lt;ref name=rappler2 /&gt;

The program involves seven major components described as follows:&lt;ref name=abtnoah /&gt; 
*'''Distribution of Hydrometeorological Devices in hard-hit areas in the Philippines (Hydromet)''' – the installation of automated [[rain gauges]] and water level monitoring stations in major river basins and flood-prone areas. 
*'''Disaster Risk Exposure Assessment for Mitigation – Light Detection and Ranging (DREAM-LIDAR) Project''' – the development of accurate three-dimensional flood inundation and hazard maps for the country’s flood-prone areas.
*'''Enhancing Geohazards Mapping through LIDAR'''– the use of [[LIDAR]] technology and computer-assisted analyses to identify [[landslide]]-prone areas.
*'''Coastal Hazards and Storm Surge Assessment and Mitigation (CHASSAM)''' – to generate wave surge, wave refraction, and coastal circulation models to understand and recommend solutions for [[coastal erosion]].
*'''Flood Information Network (FloodNET) Project''' – the building of a flood center to provide timely and accurate information for flood forecasts.
*'''Local Development of Doppler Radar Systems (LaDDeRS)''' – to develop local capacity to operate [[Weather radar|Doppler weather radar]] systems.
*'''Landslide Sensors Development Project''' – a low-cost, locally developed, sensor-based early monitoring and warning system for landslides, slope failures, and debris flow.
*'''Weather Hazard Information Project (WHIP)''' – the use of television and a [[web portal]] to display real-time weather data to help [[Local government in the Philippines|local governments]] and communities to prepare against natural hazards.&lt;ref name=abtnoah /&gt;&lt;ref name=rappler2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suarez|first1=KD|title=Project NOAH: Advocating a culture of safety|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/7758-project-noah-advocating-a-culture-of-safety|accessdate=29 November 2015|agency=Rappler|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program has been dubbed as the country's flagship disaster prevention and mitigation program.&lt;ref name=wikipinoy&gt;{{cite web|title=Project NOAH Executive Director Dr. Alfredo Mahar Lagmay awarded 2014 WikiPinoy of the Year|url=http://center.noah.up.edu.ph/project-noah-executive-director-dr-alfredo-mahar-lagmay-awarded-2014-wikipinoy-of-the-year/|website=National Operational Assessment of Hazards|publisher=DOST Project NOAH|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de la Cruz|first1=Gwen|title=How does Project NOAH contribute to PH's disaster management?|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/159975-project-noah-contribute-ph-disaster-management|accessdate=16 April 2017|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UP_adpt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mateo|first1=Janvic|title=UP adopts Project NOAH|url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/2017/02/25/1675473/adopts-project-noah|accessdate=16 April 2017|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 however, the Philippine government announced that Project NOAH would be shut down effective March 1, citing the lack of funds; it was supposed to remain in operation until February 28, 2017 only.&lt;ref name=manilabulletin&gt;{{cite web|title=PH to bid Project NOAH goodbye in March|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/01/29/ph-to-bid-project-noah-goodbye-in-march/|website=[[Manila Bulletin]]|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimacali|first1=TJ|title=Gov’t to shut down Project NOAH|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/597540/scitech/science/gov-t-to-shut-down-project-noah|accessdate=16 April 2017|publisher=''GMA News''|date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2017, the [[University of the Philippines]] decided to adopt Project NOAH and continue its operations upon the termination of its administration by the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology (DOST)]] on February 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Enano|first1=Jhesset|title=UP keeps Project Noah afloat|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/875154/up-keeps-project-noah-afloat|accessdate=16 April 2017|publisher=''Philippine Daily Inquirer''|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UP_adpt" /&gt;

The last component completed before the end of its DOST-administered era was the '''Integrated Scenario-based Assessment of Impacts and Hazards (ISAIAH)''', which sought to translate hazards mapped by the project into municipal-level risk assessments that detail the level of exposure and vulnerability of a community. The component allowed citizens to contribute ground-level risk information through the use of [[OpenStreetMap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards)|url=https://dap.edu.ph/coe-psp/innovation/noah/|website=Center of Excellence on Public-Sector Productivity|publisher=Development Academy of the Philippines|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The component resulted to completion of 16 provinces mapped with 2.2 million structures added to the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOST-Project NOAH Integrated Scenario-based Assessment of Impacts and Hazards (ISAIAH)|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Schadow1#DOST-Project_NOAH_Integrated_Scenario-based_Assessment_of_Impacts_and_Hazards_.28ISAIAH.29|website=OpenStreetMap|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2017, the University of the Philippines relaunched the UP Resilience Institute with Project NOAH, now called NOAH Center, as its flagship program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tupaz|first1=Voltaire|title=WATCH: UP Resilience Institute is Project NOAH's new home|url=https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/173727-up-resilience-institute-project-noah-new-home|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|date=June 23, 2017|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiall''' is a company that designs, develops, and manufactures connectors and associated components for use in electronic applications. The company offers interconnect components, including radio frequency/coaxial connectors and cable assemblies, antennas, fiber optic connectors and cable assemblies, microwave components and cable assemblies, microwave switches, and multipin connectors. 
It serves the aerospace, defense, industrial, instrumentation, telecom, space and medical markets. 
The company markets its products worldwide through a network of agents and distributors.

Co-founded by Yvon and Lucien Gattaz in 1952, it is headquartered in Paris, France. The Radiall Corporate entity is currently listed on Eurolist by [[NYSE Euronext]], but 89% of Radiall's shares are owned by its founders (The Gattaz Family). In 2014, Radiall's revenue was 280 million euros with a growth of 21%. Total net profit was 33.9 million euros with a growth of 83%, compared to 2013. Radiall invested approximately 7% in Research and Development, which is significantly above the industry standard.

== History ==

=== 1952&amp;ndash;1962 ===
In the spring of 1952 two brothers, Yvon and Lucien Gattaz, founded Radiall. Yvon Gattaz was the entrepreneur who took care of the commercial and financial aspect of the business. Lucien was the inventor. He was more interested by the technical aspects of research and production. In 1953, they bought their first workshop in Paris, France. A slogan had already been found: "Speed &amp; Quality".

At that time, France intended to be a world leader in television by using higher frequencies through its [[SECAM]] standard. The antenna had to be linked to the TV monitor with a coaxial cable. Yvon and Lucien worked hard to invent a cheap and easy-to-use interconnect that would fit the application. By 1954, Radiall was producing 100,000 connectors per month.

[[Image:Miniquick.jpg|thumb|The coaxial connector '''Miniquick''']]

=== 1962&amp;ndash;1972 ===
In November 1963, Yvon and Lucien inaugurated their first factory at Voiron in Isere, France, of 2,500 m2 (27,000 sqft). That same year, the company launched the coaxial connector '''Mini Quick'''. Five years later, in 1968, Radiall built its headquarters at Rosny-Sous-Bois. This 4,000 m2 (43,000 sqft) two story building (the third floor came after), is made only of glass and foil.

By 1967, opening itself to Europe was already in Radiall's mind, so they created a subsidiary in Staines, England: '''Radiall Microwave Components Ltd.''' In 1969, they opened another office in Germany (at Buchslag, close to Frankfurt): '''RGmbH''' with the goal of developing a European sales network.

=== 1972&amp;ndash;1982 ===
In 1972, Lucien Gattaz had identified the company '''Sogie''' as a competitor to Radiall in the connector business. It was for sale and showing a deficit, so Radiall made its first acquisition and it only took a few years to make it profitable. Buying '''Sogie''' showed Radiall's desire to continue specializing itself in [[Multipins Connectors]].

That same year, the company also started getting interested in Aerospace and Fiber Optics. A new facility was built in 1977 in Voreppe, France. A year later, a new factory is created, to produce hyper frequency components for military use, at l'Isle d'Abeau, which was visited by France's Prime Minister on June 6, 1980.

=== 1982&amp;ndash;1992 ===
1982 was the year in which Radiall got its first Computer-Assisted-Design equipment. 
During the 80s, Radiall expands worldwide with offices in the United States (Stratford, Connecticut), Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and Asia (from Hong Kong)
In 1984, arrived the long-awaited first qualification by [[Boeing]] for connectors that comply to '''[[ARINC]] 600'''. This is also a period of inventions, as 15 patents were obtained from 1984 to 1986. Radiall also entered the French stock market in 1989 selling 20% of its capital to the public.

=== 1992&amp;ndash;2007 ===
[[Image:EPX 2005.jpg|thumb|A multipin connector: the '''EPX''']]
In 1992, Pierre Gattaz, son of co-founder of Radiall Yvon Gattaz, becomes the new CEO of the company.
In order to become a major US player in the [[Multipins Connectors]] business (concerning mostly the Aerospace industry), Radiall acquired '''Jerrik''' in May 1995, located in Tempe, Arizona. Then, Radiall continued its expansion in the USA with the acquisition of '''Larsen''' - a company based in Portland, Oregon, which was specialized in antennas for military purposes. 
In 1994 the company continues to expand in Asia with '''Radiall Protectron''', located in Bangalore, India. Later on, Radiall creates a presence in Japan when it opened '''Radiall Nihon'''. In 2005, Radiall acquired Applied Engineering Products (AEP) located in New Haven, CT and the AEP product line was integrated into the Radiall portfolio. Finally, in July 1997, '''Radiall Shangai''' is inaugurated, which officially creates a Radiall entity in China. 
Radiall's goal was to reach sales of one billion francs by the year 2000, a goal that was actually reached three years before, in 1997. 
2001 was a tough year for the company, due to the telecommunication crisis and the September 11 aftermath, forcing the company to reduce its manpower by 30% in two years, due to a 40% activity loss.

=== 2008&amp;ndash;present ===
On January 8, Radiall announced an increase in its shareholdings of the start-up [[D-Lightsys]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d-lightsys.com/ D-Lightsys web site]&lt;/ref&gt; to 95 percent.

On June 1, '''Radiall AEP Inc''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aepconnectors.com/ Applied Engineering Products (AEP) web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981212012437/http://aepconnectors.com/ |date=1998-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Radiall USA Inc''' were consolidated into one company '''Radiall USA, Inc.''' doing business as Radiall and covering the North American territory where Radiall currently has 3 sites: [[Tempe, AZ]]; [[New Haven, CT]], and [[Obregon, Sonora, Mexico]]. The total number of employees is about 470.

2012 saw the creation of the automobile subsidiary "RAYDIALL"

On July 29, 2015, Radiall announced the acquisition of VAN-SYSTEMS, an Italian company that designs and manufactures circular electrical connectors for Industrial applications.

== Governance ==
Radiall is governed by two boards, a Supervisory Board and an Executive Board. The Supervisory board is composed of 7 people, who oversee the operation of the organization. The Executive Board, includes 3 members and obtains assistance from the Supervisory Board in creating the organizations strategy and overall management of the company.

== Locations ==
Radiall is headquartered in France with expertise centers and manufacturing locations on 3 continents and 13 countries. Radiall's 9 manufacturing plants are located in the United States, Mexico, France, China and India. More than 87% of sales are generated outside France.

A '''registration pin''' is a device intended to hold a piece of film, paper or other material in place during [[exposure (photography)|photographic exposure]], copying or drawing.

Registration pins are used in [[offset printing]] and [[cartography]], in order to accurately position the different films or plates for multi-color work.

In traditional, hand-drawn [[traditional animation|animation]], the registration pins are often called pegs, and are attached to a [http://www.sparetimelabs.com/animato/animato/pegbar/pegs.html peg bar].

Also, in traditional, hand-taped printed circuit board artwork, usually at two or four times actual size. Sometimes on a single transparent base, usually mylar, with Layer 1 being on the front and Layer 2 being on the back, in red and green, respectively, for later "separation" into component parts using a process camera.

==Motion picture cameras and related applications==
In [[motion picture camera]]s, the pin(s) hold the film immovable during exposure.

In certain "professional" motion picture cameras and "step" printers, there may be ''two'' registration pins: one is called the "big pin" and it is employed for primary (axial and lateral) registration while the other one is called the "little pin" and it is employed for secondary (axial) registration. With the "big pin"/"little pin" concept, it is not required to employ side pressure or other means to guide the film through the intermittent movement with ''absolute'' precision as the "big pin" is fully fitting in the perforation (the "little pin" ''is not'' fully fitting in width, but ''is'' fully fitting in height; this difference accommodates slight changes in the dimensions of the film media due to changes in relative humidity and possibly other factors such as media age).

This system is employed primarily in high-end "professional" cameras in the West. In the East (the former Soviet Union and its former Satellites), a single registration pin, corresponding to the "big pin", is employed along with side pressure.

Additionally, Western "professional" cameras ''always'' employ [[Bell and Howell]] (BH) pins whereas Eastern "professional" cameras ''generally'' employ [[Kodak]] Standard (KS) pins, which standard was originally recommended by the Western standards organizations, but was soundly rejected by Western studios and camera equipment manufacturers. Western "professional" cameras provided to the East during [[World War II]]'s [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]] program were ''generally'' converted to KS pins by the receiving country.

To further improve upon registration accuracy, the perforations which are utilized for registration are ''never'' used for film advancement (i.e., for pull-down).

The above description applies to "professional" applications, which is generally taken to mean film gauges larger than 16mm (i.e., 35mm and 65/70mm).

For 16mm, only, a modified strategy is ''generally'' employed, at least for "step" printers which utilize 1R (single-row) perforations.

The lower pin, the "big pin", will be fully fitting in the axial ''and'' lateral dimensions but the upper pin, the "little pin", will be fully fitting in the lateral dimension ''only'', for the same reason that the "professional's" "little pin" is fully fitting in the axial dimension ''only''.

This, then, also accomplishes ''absolute'' precision, but within the context of "sub-professional" film gauges.

For practical reasons, the 1R 16mm "little pin" is usually spaced two perforations above the 16mm "big pin".

Again for 16mm, only, certain cameras and "step" printers which utilize 2R (two-row) perforations may employ the same strategy as for "professional" applications, but 2R is seldom utilized except for certain high-speed photography and almost never for duplication or prints.

[[File:Repeater-schema.svg|thumb|A radio repeater retransmits a radio signal.]]
In [[telecommunications]], a '''repeater''' is an electronic device that receives a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction.

Some types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal, but alter its method of transmission, for example, on another frequency or [[baud rate]].

There are several different types of repeaters; a '''telephone repeater''' is an [[amplifier]] in a [[telephone line]], an [[optical repeater]] is an [[optoelectronic]] circuit that amplifies the light beam in an [[optical fiber cable]]; and a [[radio repeater]] is a [[radio receiver]] and [[transmitter]] that retransmits a radio signal.

A [[broadcast relay station]] is a repeater used in [[Broadcasting|broadcast radio and television]].

==Overview==
When an information-bearing signal passes through a [[communication channel]], it is progressively degraded due to loss of power.  For example, when a [[telephone call]] passes through a wire [[telephone line]], some of the power in the [[electric current]] which represents the [[audio signal]] is dissipated as heat in the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the copper wire.  The longer the wire is, the more power is lost, and the smaller the [[amplitude]] of the signal at the far end. So with a long enough wire the call will not be audible at the other end.  Similarly, the farther from a [[radio station]] a [[radio receiver|receiver]] is, the weaker the [[radio signal]], and the poorer the reception. A repeater is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of a signal and retransmits it, allowing it to travel further.  Since it [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal, it requires a source of [[electric power]].

The term "repeater" originated with [[telegraphy]] in the 19th century, and referred to an [[electromechanical]] device (a [[relay]]) used to regenerate [[telegraph]] signals.&lt;ref name="Loring"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term has continued in [[telephony]] and [[data]] [[telecommunication|communications]].

In [[computer networking]], because repeaters work with the actual physical signal, and do not attempt to interpret the data being transmitted, they operate on the [[physical layer]], the first layer of the [[OSI model]].

==Types==

===Telephone repeater===
This is used to increase the range of telephone signals in a [[telephone line]].

:* '''Land line repeater'''
They are most frequently used in [[Telecommunications link|trunkline]]s that carry [[Long-distance calling|long distance]] calls.  In an [[Analog signal|analog]] telephone line consisting of a pair of wires, it consists of an [[amplifier]] circuit made of [[transistor]]s which use power from a DC current source to increase the power of the [[alternating current]] [[audio signal]] on the line.  Since the telephone is a [[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] (bidirectional) communication system, the wire pair carries two audio signals, one going in each direction.  So telephone repeaters have to be bilateral, amplifying the signal in both directions without causing feedback, which complicates their design considerably.  Telephone repeaters were the first type of repeater and were some of the first applications of [[Amplifier|amplification]].  The development of telephone repeaters between 1900 and 1915 made long distance phone service possible. Now, most telecommunications cables are [[fiber optic cable]]s which use optical repeaters (below).

Before the invention of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled [[Microphone#Carbon microphone|carbon microphones]] were used as amplifiers in telephone repeaters. After the turn of the 20th century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and they were used.&lt;ref name="Sungook"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0262082985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of [[audion tube]] repeaters around 1916 made transcontinental telephony practical.  In the 1930s [[vacuum tube]] repeaters using [[hybrid coil]]s became commonplace, allowing the use of thinner wires.  In the 1950s [[negative resistance|negative impedance]] gain devices were more popular, and a [[transistor]]ized version called the E6 repeater was the final major type used in the [[Bell System]] before the low cost of digital transmission made all [[voiceband]] repeaters obsolete. [[Frequency frogging]] repeaters were commonplace in frequency-division multiplexing systems from the middle to late 20th century.

:* '''Submarine cable repeater'''
This is a type of telephone repeater used in underwater [[submarine telecommunications cable]]s.
 
===Optical communications repeater===
{{main|Optical communications repeater}}
This is used to increase the range of signals in a [[fiber optic cable]].  Digital information travels through a fiber optic cable in the form of short pulses of light.  The light is made up of particles called [[photon]]s, which can be absorbed or scattered in the fiber.  An optical communications repeater usually consists of a [[phototransistor]] which converts the light pulses to an electrical signal, an [[amplifier]] to increase the power of the signal, an [[electronic filter]] which reshapes the pulses, and a [[laser]] which converts the electrical signal to light again and sends it out the other fiber.  However, [[optical amplifier]]s are being developed for repeaters to amplify the light itself without the need of converting it to an electric signal first.

===Radio repeater===
[[File:Repeater Talk around channel.png|thumb|A radio communications with a Repeater or a Talkaround channel]]
[[File:Repetitor Guarini.jpg|thumb|Guarini-Foresio's repeater]]
 
This is used to extend the range of '''coverage''' of a [[radio]] signal. The history of radio relay repeaters began in 1898 from the publication by Johann Mattausch in Austrian Journal Zeitschrift für Electrotechnik (v. 16,
35 - 36).&lt;ref name=slyusar_relay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattausch J. Telegraphie ohne Draht. Eine Studie. // Zeitschrift für Elektrotechnik. Organ des Elektrotechnischen Vereines in Wien.- Heft 3, 16. Jänner 1898. - XVI. Jahrgang. - S. 35–36.[http://www.slyusar.kiev.ua/all/zeitschriftfrele16.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; But his proposal "Translator" was primitive and not suitable for use. The first relay system with radio repeaters, which really functioned, was that invented in 1899 by Emile Guarini-Foresio.&lt;ref name=slyusar_relay /&gt;

A radio repeater usually consists of a [[radio receiver]] connected to a [[radio transmitter]].  The received signal is amplified and retransmitted, often on another frequency, to provide coverage beyond the obstruction.  Usage of a [[duplexer]] can allow the repeater to use one antenna for both receive and transmit at the same time.

:* '''[[Broadcast relay station]], rebroadcastor''' or '''translator''': This is a repeater used to extend the coverage of a radio or television [[Broadcasting|broadcasting station]].  It consists of a secondary radio or television transmitter.  The signal from the main transmitter often comes over leased telephone lines or by microwave relay.

:* '''[[Microwave relay]]''': This is a specialized [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] telecommunications link, consisting of a [[microwave]] [[radio receiver|receiver]] that receives information over a beam of microwaves from another relay station in [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] distance, and a microwave [[transmitter]] which passes the information on to the next station over another beam of microwaves.  Networks of microwave relay stations transmit telephone calls, television programs, and computer data from one city to another over continent-wide areas.

::* '''[[Passive repeater]]''': This is a microwave relay that simply consists of a flat metal surface to reflect the microwave beam in another direction.  It is used to get microwave relay signals over hills and mountains when it is not necessary to amplify the signal.

:* '''[[Cellular repeater]]''': This is a radio repeater for boosting [[cell phone]] reception in a limited area.  The device functions like a small [[cellular base station]], with a directional antenna to receive the signal from the nearest cell tower, an amplifier, and a local antenna to rebroadcast the signal to nearby cell phones.  It is often used in downtown office buildings.

:* '''Digipeater''': A repeater node in a [[packet radio]] network.  It performs a [[store and forward]] function, passing on packets of information from one node to another.

Radio repeaters improve communication coverage in systems using frequencies that typically have [[line-of-sight propagation]]. Without a repeater, these systems are limited in range by the curvature of the Earth and the blocking effect of terrain or high buildings. A repeater on a hilltop or tall building can allow stations that are out of each other's line-of-sight range to communicate reliably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taitradioacademy.com/topic/repeater-systems-1/   |title=   Radio Awareness about Communications Systems - HOW DO REPEATER SYSTEMS WORK? |publisher= .taitradioacademy.com/|date= |accessdate=2017-08-23 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio repeaters may also allow translation from one set of radio frequencies to another, for example to allow two different public service agencies to interoperate (say, police and fire services of a city, or neighboring police departments).  They may provide links to the public switched telephone network as well.

Typically a repeater station listens on one frequency, A, and transmits on a second, B.  All mobile stations listen for signals on channel B and transmit on channel A.  The difference between the two frequencies may be relatively small compared to the frequency of operation, say 1%.  Often the repeater station will use the same antenna for transmission and reception; highly selective filters called "duplexers" separate the faint incoming received signal from the billions of times more powerful outbound transmitted signal.  Sometimes separate transmitting and receiving locations are used, connected by a wire line or a radio link. While the repeater station is designed for simultaneous reception and transmission, mobile units need not be equipped with the bulky and costly duplexers, as they only transmit or receive at any time.

Mobile units in a repeater system may be provided with a "talkaround" channel that allows direct mobile-to-mobile operation on a single channel. This may be used if out of reach of the repeater system, or for communications not requiring the attention of all mobiles. The "talkaround" channel may be the repeater output frequency; the repeater will not retransmit any signals on its output frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Land mobile radio systems - 2nd ed. Improving and Extending Area Coverage (Englewood Cliffs, NJ : PTR Prentice Hall, 1994) {{ISBN|0131231596}}, p. 67-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

An engineered radio communication system designer will analyze the coverage area desired and select repeater locations, elevations, antennas, operating frequencies and power levels to permit a predictable level of reliable communication over the designed coverage area.

==Data handling==
Repeaters can be divided into two types depending on the type of data they handle:

===Analog repeater===
This type is used in channels that transmit data in the form of an [[analog signal]] in which the voltage or current is proportional to the [[amplitude]] of the signal, as in an [[audio signal]].  They are also used in trunklines that transmit multiple signals using [[frequency division multiplexing]] (FDM). Analog repeaters are composed of a linear amplifier, and may include [[electronic filter]]s to compensate for frequency and phase distortion in the line.

===Digital repeater===
The '''digipeater''' is used in channels that transmit data by [[Binary code|binary]] [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s, in which the data is in the form of pulses with only two possible values, representing the [[binary digit]]s 1 and 0.  A digital repeater amplifies the signal, and it also may retime, resynchronize, and reshape the pulses.  A repeater that performs the retiming or resynchronizing functions may be called a '''[[regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerator]]'''.

'''SPOT''' ({{lang-fr|Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/1415-spot.php|title=SPOT - Looking Down on Earth|publisher=[[CNES]]|accessdate=19 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006213713/http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/1415-spot.php|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[literal translation|lit.]] "Satellite for observation of Earth") is a commercial high-resolution optical imaging [[Earth observation satellite]] system operating from space. It is run by [[Spot Image]], based in [[Toulouse]], [[France]]. It was initiated by the [[CNES]] (''Centre national d'études spatiales''&amp;nbsp;– the French space agency) in the 1970s and was developed in association with the SSTC (Belgian scientific, technical and cultural services) and the [[Swedish National Space Board]] (SNSB). It has been designed to improve the knowledge and management of [[Earth|the Earth]] by exploring the Earth's resources, detecting and  forecasting phenomena involving climatology and oceanography, and monitoring human activities and natural phenomena. The SPOT system includes a series of satellites and ground control resources for satellite control and programming, image production, and distribution. Earlier satellites were launched using the [[European Space Agency]]'s Ariane 2, 3, and 4 rockets, while SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 were launched by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian]] [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV]].&lt;ref name=ISRO100&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Isro-prepares-for-historic-100th-mission/articleshow/15599355.cms |title=ISRO prepares for historic 100th mission |publisher=Times of India |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=C23&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Isros-PSLV-C23-lifts-off-with-five-foreign-satellites/articleshow/37505130.cms |title= Isro's PSLV-C23 lifts off with five foreign satellites |publisher=Times of India |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of satellites==
SPOT Image is marketing the high-resolution images, which SPOT can take from every corner of the Earth.
* SPOT 1 launched February 22, 1986 with 10  [[panchromatic]] and 20 meter multispectral picture resolution capability. Withdrawn December 31, 1990.
* SPOT 2 launched January 22, 1990 and deorbited in July 2009.
* SPOT 3 launched September 26, 1993. Stopped functioning November 14, 1997.
* SPOT 4 launched March 24, 1998. Stopped functioning July, 2013. 
* SPOT 5 launched May 4, 2002 with 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m capability. Stopped functioning March 31, 2015.
* SPOT 6 launched September 9, 2012.
* [[SPOT 7]] launched on June 30, 2014.

== Orbit ==
The SPOT orbit is [[polar orbit|polar]], [[circular orbit|circular]], [[sun-synchronous]], and [[Orbit phasing|phased]]. The inclination of the orbital plane combined with the rotation of the Earth around the polar axis allows the satellite to fly over any point on Earth within 26 days. The orbit has an altitude of 832 kilometers, an inclination of 98.7°, and completing 14 + 5/26 revolutions per day.

== Generations ==

=== SPOT 1, 2, and 3 ===
Since 1986 the SPOT family of satellites has been orbiting the Earth and has already taken more than 10 million high quality images. SPOT 1 was launched with the last [[Ariane 1]] rocket on February 22, 1986. Two days later, the 1800&amp;nbsp;kg SPOT 1 transmitted its first image with a spatial resolution of 10 or 20 meters. SPOT 2 joined SPOT 1 in orbit on January 22, 1990, on the [[Ariane 4]] maiden flight, and SPOT 3 followed on September 26, 1993, also on an Ariane 4.

The satellite loads were identical, each including two identical HRV (High Resolution Visible) imaging instruments that were able to operate in two modes, either simultaneously or individually. The two spectral modes are panchromatic and multispectral. The panchromatic band has a resolution of 10 meters, and the three multispectral bands (G, R, NIR) have resolutions of 20 metres. They have a scene size of 3600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  and a revisit interval of one to four days, depending on the latitude.

Because the orbit of SPOT 1 was lowered in 2003, it will gradually lose altitude and break up naturally in the atmosphere. Deorbiting of SPOT 2, in accordance with IADC ([[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee]]), commenced in mid-July 2009 for a period of two weeks, with a final burn on 29 July 2009. SPOT 3 is no longer functioning, due to problems with its stabilization system.

=== SPOT 4 ===
SPOT 4 launched March 24, 1998 and stopped functioning July, 2013. In 2013, CNES lowered the altitude of SPOT 4 by 2.5&amp;nbsp;km to put it on a phased orbit with a five-day repeat cycle. On this orbit, SPOT4 was programmed to acquire a time-lapse series of images over 42 sites with a five days revisit period from February to end of May 2013. The data set it produced is aimed at helping future users of the [[Sentinel-2]] mission to learn working with time-lapse series. The time-lapse series provided by SPOT4 (Take5) have the same repetitiveness as those that will be delivered by the Sentinel-2 satellites, starting in 2015 and 2016.

=== SPOT 5 ===
SPOT 5 was launched on May 4, 2002 and has the goal to ensure continuity of services for customers and to improve the quality of data and images by anticipating changes in market requirements.

SPOT 5 has two high resolution geometrical (HRG) instruments that were deduced from the HRVIR of SPOT 4. They offer a higher resolution of 2.5 to 5 meters in panchromatic mode and 10 meters in multispectral mode (20 metre on short wave infrared 1.58 – 1.75&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref&gt;EOEdu. [http://eoedu.belspo.be/en/satellites/spot.htm "SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre)"], n.d. Retrieved 9 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; SPOT 5 also features an HRS imaging instrument operating in panchromatic mode. HRS points forward and backward of the satellite. Thus, it is able to take stereopair images almost simultaneously to map relief.

=== SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 ===
SPOT 6 was launched by India's [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] on flight C21&lt;ref name=ISRO100 /&gt; at 04:23 UTC on 9 September 2012, while [[SPOT 7]] was launched on PSLV flight C23&lt;ref name=C23 /&gt; at 04:42 UTC on 30 June 2014. They form a constellation of Earth-imaging satellites designed to provide continuity of high-resolution, wide-swath data up to 2024. [[EADS Astrium]] took the decision to build this constellation in 2009 on the basis of a perceived government need for this kind of data. [[Spot Image]], a subsidiary of Astrium, funded the satellites alone and owned the system (satellites and ground segments) at time of launch. In December 2014, SPOT 7 was sold to [[Azerbaijan]]'s space agency Azercosmos, who renamed it ''[[Azersky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenews.com/42840airbus-sells-in-orbit-spot-7-imaging-satellite-to-azerbaijan/ Airbus Sells In-orbit Spot 7 Imaging Satellite to Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The  architecture is similar to that of the [[Pleiades satellites]], with a centrally mounted optical instrument, a three-axis [[star tracker]], a fiber-optic gyro (FOG) and four control moment gyros (CMGs).
*SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 are phased in the same orbit as Pléiades 1A and Pléiades 1B at an altitude of 694&amp;nbsp;km, forming a constellation of 2-by-2 satellites - 90° apart from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/p/pleiades| title=Pleiades eoPortal Directory| publisher=eoPortal| access-date=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salon des arts ménagers''' ('''SAM'''; Household Arts Show) was an annual exhibition in Paris of domestic appliances, furniture and home designs. It was first held as the '''Salon des appareils ménagers''' (Home Appliances Fair) in 1923, with 100,000 visitors. By the 1950s each exhibition attracted up to 1.4 million visitors.

The SAM was run by government agencies and served an educational purpose, introducing consumers to new types of appliance and new materials. It also provided a showplace for new commercial products. The exhibition introduced modern concepts of home layout, with the kitchen moved from the back of the apartment to a central position near the entrance and near the dining and living room(s). Ergonomically designed kitchens and labor-saving devices minimized the effort required of housewives. The ''Salon'' became less relevant as department stores and specialty outlets began to offer broader ranges of products. The last exhibition was held in 1983.

==History==

===1920s: Establishment===

The ''Salon'' was created by [[Jules-Louis Breton]], who had been Undersecretary of State for Inventions during [[World War I]] (1914–18) and then Minister of Health and Social Welfare.
He was the first director of the National Board of Scientific and Industrial Research and Inventions (ORNI: ''Office national des recherches scientifiques et industrielles et des Inventions''), created on 29 December 1922 and dissolved on 24 May 1938, predecessor of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS).{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
The show was financed and supervised by the ORNI, and then from 1938 by the CNRS, which received the profits.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
Breton's son Paul was ''commissaire'' of the ''Salon'' from 1929 to 1976, and Paul's brother André was director of the ''Arts Ménagers'' publication.{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=181}}

The first ''Salon des Appareils Ménagers'' (Home Appliances Fair) was held between 18 October 1923 and 4 November 1923 in {{convert|5000|m2}} of the ''[[Foire de Paris]]'' on the [[Champ de Mars]].{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
The first show was held in a simple hut.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
The show gave prizes and medals to the inventors of the best domestic appliances, judged by ORNI and the Ministry of Public Education.
The show was a great success, with 100,000 visitors and 200 exhibitors.
The second ''Salon des Appareils Ménagers'' was held on the Champ de Mars on 21 October 1924 – 9 November 1924.
There was no ''Salon'' in 1925, but the government decided that year to make the show an annual event.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}

[[File:Le majestueux Grand Palais.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Palais]] housed the SAM from 1926 to 1961]]
In 1926 the SAM was held in the [[Grand Palais]] on the Champs-Élysées, now called the ''Salon des Arts Ménagers'' (SAM; Domestic Arts Show), again showing domestic appliances but now also showing products and materials needed for their installation and organization in the house.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
The SAM would remain at the Grand Palais until 1961.{{sfn|Le Salon des Arts Ménagers, CNRS}}
The 1926 show had 145,600 visitors and 328 exhibitors.
The SAM began to be involved in experiments with new architecture.
In 1927 an official monthly magazine was launched, ''L’Art Ménager''. An annual reader's competition was organized to select the "most beautiful cover". 
Prizes were given at the show for a cooking competition and for the best housekeeper. There were more competitions in the ''Salons'' that followed, and more activities associated with the show including cooking lessons, concerts and conferences on furniture and decoration.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}

===1930s: Innovation===
In 1930 Francis Bernard portrayed ''Marie Mécanique'' on posters for the ''Salon'', a robot housemaid who became the symbol of the ''Salon''.
There were 269,000 visitors in 1932.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
In 1932 organization of the SAM was given to the ''Comité Français des Expositions'' (CFE).{{sfn|Le Salon des Arts Ménagers, CNRS}}
In 1933 the SAM hosted new events, such as the Fish Fortnight.
Architects and decorators had formed the ''[[Union des Artistes Modernes]]'' (UAM) in 1929 to promote their views on decorative art, which sought purer harmony in place of ornamentation.
The UAM published a manifesto in 1934 and asked to participate in the ''Salon''.
The resulting home design exhibit in the ''Salon'' was organized with the help of the magazine ''L’Architecture d’aujourd’hui'' (Today's Architecture).
The first prize for a house for a family of two parents and three children was won by A. and E. Novello. A model was built on the ground floor.
The 1936 ''Salon'' presented new housing materials and their applications, such as stainless steel and fiber cement.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}

The numbers of visitors to the SAM rose steadily, with 410,000 in 1935, 428,000 in 1936, 487,000 in 1937 and 535,000 in 1938.
In 1939 there were 608,000 visitors, and the SAM covered {{convert|35000|m2}}.
The goals were defined as simplifying the work of housewives through invention of devices such as dishwashers, presenting new products and materials, and teaching women to use the devices. 
Gas and electricity companies demonstrated how their products could replace wood and then coal, providing comfort and efficiency while saving time, effort and money.
The new products would transform the lives of housewives.
Major brands at the show included Aspiron, Auer, Berger, Calor, [[De Dietrich]], [[Electrolux]], [[Frigidaire]], [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]], Jex, [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son|Johnson]] and Spontex.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}

===1940s: Recovery===
[[File:Autothermos.jpg|thumb|1940s pressure cooker by Autothermos]]
The SAM was suspended during [[World War II]] (1939–45). and did not resume until 1948. 
Reconstruction and redevelopment of old buildings were important post-war themes, as were the search for a hygienic and comfortable lifestyle and exploration of  new materials such as metal or plastic. The wide availability of gas and electricity inspired new appliances including vacuum cleaners, pressure cookers, irons, washing machines, heaters, refrigerators and hairdryers.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
However, many of the visitors in the first decade after the war were living in old, cramped accommodations, often without running water, gas or electricity.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}{{efn|The 1946 census found that 31% of urban dwellings had no water or electricity, increasing to 80% in rural communes.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}} }}
They preferred to delay purchase of major appliances until they could move into a more modern house or apartment. They visited the ''Salon'' to learn what was available and to decide on what would be most important. A gas water heater above the sink could be a more practical aspiration than a washing machine.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}

The public status of the SAM helped it maintain its mission as one of social utility and education.
Traditionally the Parisian apartment had a kitchen at the back overlooking a service yard, with food carried through a corridor to the room where the family ate. Experiment in the inter-war period led to new post-war designs in which the kitchen was moved near to the apartment's entrance, close to the living and dining room. The back stairs disappeared. Water, electricity, gas and sewage were now integrated into the design of buildings. The kitchen was relatively small, with a layout designed to let the housewife perform different tasks without moving. The SAM played an important role in introducing these innovations. In [[Marcel Gascoin]]'s 8-piece "Logis 1949" display the kitchen played a central role and followed the ergonomic principles spelled out by [[Paulette Bernège]]{{efn|Paulette Bernège founded the ''Institut d'Organisation Ménagère'' (Institute for Household Management) in 1923 and played a central role in setting up the ''Ligue d'Organisation Ménagère'' (League for Household Management).{{sfn|Salon des Arts Ménagers, Oxford}} }} in the inter-war period.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}

The first exhibition after the war, the 17th ''Salon'', opened on 26 February 1948.
The economy had not yet recovered and the goods on display could only be ordered with delays of two to six months.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
There were 795,113 visitors.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
When the 18th ''Salon'' opened on 25 February 1949 products were more readily available, but prices were too high for most of the visitors.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
The 1949 ''Salon'' had new sections such as "Woman and Child" and "Gastronomy", There were 951,139 visitors.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
A cinema news item filmed at the 1949 ''Salon'' showed the Minister of Education [[Yvon Delbos]] during his inaugural visit and gave close-ups of washing machines, dishwashers and a refrigerator. The narrative was addressed to the ladies (''mesdames'') who would benefit from the labor-saving devices.{{sfn|Gracieux|2015}}

===1950s: Growing prosperity===

The 1950 exhibition had sections on Antique Arts in Modern Life, Today's Home, the ''Cité'' 50, Rural Domestic Arts, Kitchen Furnishings, Collective Living, Food, Wine, Furniture, The Room of the Woman and Child, Cleaning Products and Home Appliances.
During the 1950 exhibition there  were twenty-eight conferences, including "If Women Designed Home Appliances" by Paulette Bernège and "Joy and Comfort through Color and Light."{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=180}}
The ''Formes utiles'' design group, created by the UAM in 1949, began to exhibit objects at the ''Salon'' that met the criteria of being everyday objects, handcrafted or made industrially, with good quality, pleasing forms and reasonable prices.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
The Salon had a restaurant that featured different regional specialties each night.{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=180}}

In 1950 the housing section reappeared, sponsored by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urban Development.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
The Exposition on Habitation in the gardens included an exhibit on [[Le Corbusier]]'s new apartment complex in Marseille.{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=180}}
In February 1955 a home completely built from plastic drew more than 200,000 visitors. The design was conceived by [[Ionel Schein]], Y. Magnant and R.A. Coulon and was financed by the ''[[Charbonnages de France]]'' and ''Houillères du Nord'' coal companies, who foresaw huge possibilities in making plastics from coal.{{sfn|Maison tout en plastiques ... FRAC}}

The number of visitors to the SAM in 1953 was down from the previous year, but sales were up, particularly refrigerators and washing machines.{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=184}}
Visits then rose from 1.2 million in 1953 to 1.4 million in 1956.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}} With more than 1,200 exhibitors, a visitor could get lost in the maze.
By the mid-1950s consumers were more prosperous and more likely to buy, often taking advantage of newly-available credit arrangements.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}{{efn|In 1954 only 7.5% of French households owned a refrigerator. This would rise to 20.5% in 1959 and 72.5% by 1968. Similarly, only 8.4% of households owned a washing machine in 1954, rising to 21.4% in 1959 and 49.9% in 1968.{{sfn|Gracieux|2015}} }}
Although the SAM supported commerce, by arranging products by type rather than by brand it helped visitors compare features and prices. The ''Salon'' organizers tried to impose some degree of uniformity on the display stands, but there was naturally competition by the vendors to attract attention through taller and more original stands. To counteract this, all displays had to meet standards and be approved by a committee. There was some social segregation. The displays of inexpensive small items in the basement from 1956 tended to be fairly chaotic, with visitors able to pick up and examine the products, while the booths upstairs showing the larger and more expensive items were calmer and more elegant.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}

[[Image:Le Creuset.jpg|thumb|right|''Coquelle Le Creuset'', cooking pots designed by [[Raymond Loewy]], around 1958]]
Consumer attitudes changed during the 1950s, and appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines came to be seen as necessities rather than luxuries.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
The SAM organizers played a role in the organization that set standards for appliances, defining essential, desirable and optional features, and tried to ensure that the products exhibited met these standards.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
Appliance designs in the early 1950s were often austere and functional, but from 1955 they became more colorful and diverse, so the housewife could demonstrate her good taste in selecting items that would make the kitchen more welcoming and that would showcase the family's prosperity. By the late 1950s there was a return to cleaner designs without decorative moldings, with line and angle replacing rounded forms and a return to white or neutral colors.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}

The volume of sales seems to have peaked in the 1955–57 period. After this the SAM became more a place where consumers or professionals came to gain information. Purchases would be made at department stores or specialty stores.{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
The ''Salon'' continued to be the key annual marketing event for consumer appliance manufacturers, dictating the rhythm of new product introduction and advertising. The Prefect of the Saine noted in 1958 that the SAM generated far more business than was transacted at the event. Many consumers bought products from retailers that they had selected at the ''Salon''.
The retailer would provide delivery, installation and repair services.{{sfn|Pulju|2011|p=185}}

===Last years===

The 1960 ''Salon'' included exhibits of complete areas such as the kitchen, bathroom and living room.{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}
In 1961 the SAM moved into larger and more modern premises in the ''[[Centre des nouvelles industries et technologies]]'' (CNIT) in [[La Défense]].{{sfn|Leymonerie|2006|pp=43–56}}
It remained at the CNIT from 1961 until it was dissolved in 1983.{{sfn|Le Salon des Arts Ménagers, CNRS}}
In March 1965 ''[[Le Figaro]]'' noted that dishwashers seemed to have finally become accepted after fifteen years of false starts, with about thirty brands shown at the SAM. They were still expensive items, but according to the newspaper they were much more hygienic than hand washing, more economical of water and soap and produced brighter results.{{sfn|La nouvelle offensive ... Le Figaro}}

The ''Salon des Arts Ménagers'' celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1973.
From 1976 it was run by the Secretary of State for Universities.
It was dissolved and its staff dismissed on 31 December 1983.
It was replaced by the PROMODO domestic appliance show, organized by and for professionals at the [[Parc des Expositions de Villepinte]].{{sfn|Salons des Appareils Ménagers, LAD}}

The '''Saudi Payments Network''' or '''mada'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sama.gov.sa/ar-sa/News/Pages/News08312015.aspx|title=مؤسسة النقد تدشن رسمياً مشروع الهوية الجديدة للشبكة السعودية للمدفوعات (مدى)|website=www.sama.gov.sa|language=ar-SA|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly '''SPAN''') is the only and major payment system in the kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It connects all [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and [[point of sale]] (POS) terminals throughout the country to a central payment switch which in turn re-routes the financial transactions to the card issuer (local bank, [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[American Express]] or [[MasterCard]]). All banks in Saudi Arabia are required by the [[Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency]] (SAMA) to issue [[ATM card]]s fully compatible with the network. All services are provided to the customer free of charge, regardless of the ATM used, its operator, or the customer's card issuer.

There are now more than 6,000 ATMs and 110,000 POSs connected to the network and in 2006 more than 340 million transactions went through SPAN, with a total value of 160 billion SR (42.5 billion USD).

The network has recently been upgraded to SPAN2 which is compliant with [[EMV]] standards and implements a higher capacity infrastructure and therefore less processing time, especially at POS terminals, resolving a major problem of the first generation SPAN system.

'''Constant acceleration''' is a proposed aspect of most future forms of '''space travel'''. It entails that the propulsion system of whatever kind operate continuously with a steady [[acceleration]], rather than the brief impulsive thrusts used by chemical rockets—for the first half of the journey it constantly pushes the spacecraft towards its destination, and for the last half of the journey it constantly uses backthrust, so that the spaceship arrives at the destination at a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;See williamhaloupek.hubpages.com/hub/Calculations-for-science-fiction-writers-Space-travel-with-constant-acceleration-nonrelativistic for some example computations.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constant-acceleration drives==
Constant acceleration is notable for several reasons:

*It is a fast form of travel. When ergonomics are considered, they are the fastest form of interplanetary and [[interstellar travel]].
*Constant acceleration creates its own [[artificial gravity]] to the benefit of passengers, who may thus be spared from having to deal with the effects of [[microgravity]].

However, constant acceleration is an inefficient use of fuel and energy, and is not used in existing spaceflight systems. {{source?|date=October 2018}}

===Constant thrust versus constant acceleration===
Constant-thrust and constant-acceleration trajectories involve the spacecraft firing its engine in a prolonged constant burn. In the limiting case where the vehicle acceleration is high compared to the local gravitational acceleration, the orbit approaches a straight line. The spacecraft points straight toward the target (accounting for target motion), and remains accelerating constantly under high thrust until it reaches its target. If it is required that the spacecraft rendezvous with the target, rather than performing a flyby, then the spacecraft must flip its orientation halfway through the journey, and decelerate the rest of the way.

In the constant-thrust trajectory,&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Moeckel, [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980223074 Trajectories with Constant Tangential Thrust in Central Gravitational Fields], ''Technical Report R-63'', NASA Lewis Research Center, 1960 (accessed 26 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; the vehicle's acceleration increases during thrusting period, since the fuel use means the vehicle mass decreases. If, instead of constant thrust, the vehicle has constant acceleration, the engine thrust must decrease during the trajectory.

==Interstellar travel==

[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|300px|right|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-gee (10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 1.0&amp;nbsp;ly/y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) "felt" or proper-acceleration&lt;ref&gt;Edwin F. Taylor &amp; John Archibald Wheeler (1966 1st ed. only) ''Spacetime Physics'' (W.H. Freeman, San Francisco) {{ISBN|0-7167-0336-X}}, Chapter 1 Exercise 51 pp. 97–98: "Clock paradox III" ([http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt; can go far, except for the problem of accelerating on-board propellant.]]

Over interstellar distances a spaceship using significant constant acceleration will approach the speed of light, so [[special relativity]] effects (like the difference in time flow between ship time and planetary time) become important.&lt;ref name="Lagoute1995"&gt;C. Lagoute and E. Davoust (1995) The interstellar traveler, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''63''':221–227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressions for covered distance and elapsed time===
{{Main|Hyperbolic motion (relativity)}}
How far one travels, experiencing constant acceleration, from the point of view of Earth as a function of the traveler's time is expressed by the [[Coordinate system|coordinate distance]] ''x'' as a function of [[proper time]] ''&amp;tau;'' at constant [[proper acceleration]] ''a''. It is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Explorations in Mathematical Physics: The Concepts Behind an Elegant Language |edition=illustrated |first1=Don |last1=Koks |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-387-32793-8 |page=242 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObMb7l9-9loC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObMb7l9-9loC&amp;pg=PA242 Extract of page 242 (where ''g''=''a'', ''c''=1 and x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=x(0))]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x(\tau) = \frac{c^2}{a} \left(\cosh \frac{a \ \tau}{c} -1 \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].

Under the same circumstances, the time elapsed on Earth (the [[coordinate time]]) as a function of the traveler's time is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;t(\tau) = \frac{c}{a} \sinh \frac{a \ \tau}{c} .&lt;/math&gt;

===Feasibility===
A major limiting factor for constant acceleration drives is having enough fuel. Imagine a horse strong enough to pull a wagon carrying enough hay to feed it on a journey from New York City to Los Angeles. Constant acceleration won't be feasible unless the specific impulse for fuel (the fuel's [[fuel efficiency]]) becomes much higher.

There are two broad categories for ways to solve this problem: one is higher efficiency fuel (the motor ship approach) and the other is drawing propulsion energy from the environment as the ship passes through it (the sailing ship approach). Two possibilities for the motor ship approach are nuclear and matter–antimatter based fuels. One possibility for the sailing ship approach is discovering something equivalent to the [[parallelogram of force]] between wind and water which allows sails to propel a sailing ship.

Picking up fuel along the way—the [[Bussard Ramjet|ramjet]] approach—will lose efficiency as the space craft's speed increases relative to the planetary reference. This happens because the fuel must be accelerated to the spaceship's velocity before its energy can be extracted and that will cut the fuel efficiency dramatically.

A related issue is drag. If the near light-speed space craft is interacting with matter or energy that is moving slowly in the planetary reference frame—solar wind, magnetic fields, cosmic microwave background radiation—this will cause drag which will bleed off a portion of the engine's acceleration.

A second big issue facing ships using constant acceleration for interstellar travel is colliding with matter and radiation while en route. In mid-journey any matter the ship strikes will be impacting at near light speed, so the impact will be dramatic.

===Interstellar traveling speeds===
If a space ship is using constant acceleration over interstellar distances, it will approach the speed of light for the middle part of its journey when viewed from the planetary [[frame of reference]]. This means that the interesting effects of relativity will become important. The most important effect is that time will appear to pass at different rates in the ship frame and the planetary frame, and this means that the ship's speed and journey time will appear different in the two frames.

====Planetary reference frame====
From the planetary frame of reference, the ship's speed will appear to be limited by the speed of light—it can approach the speed of light, but never reach it. If a ship is using 1&amp;nbsp;''g'' constant acceleration, it will appear to get near the speed of light in about a year, and have traveled about half a light year in distance. For the middle of the journey the ship's speed will be roughly the speed of light, and it will slow down again to zero over a year at the end of the journey.

As a rule of thumb, for a constant acceleration at one ''g'' ([[Earth gravity]]), the ship journey time will be the distance in light years to the destination, plus one year. This rule of thumb will give answers that are slightly shorter than the exact calculated answer, but reasonably accurate.

====Ship reference frame====

From the frame of reference of those on the ship the acceleration will not change as the journey goes on. Instead the planetary reference frame will look more and more relativistic. This means that for voyagers on the ship the journey will appear to be much shorter than what planetary observers see.

[[File:Roundtrip10ly.png|thumb|500px|center|Plot of velocity parameters and times on the horizontal axis, versus position on the vertical axis, for an accelerated twin roundtrip to a destination with &amp;Delta;x&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;=10c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;alpha; ~10 lightyears away if &amp;alpha;~9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

At a constant acceleration of 1&amp;nbsp;''g'', a rocket could travel the diameter of our galaxy in about 12 years ship time, and about 113,000 years planetary time. If the last half of the trip involves deceleration at 1&amp;nbsp;''g'', the trip would take about 24 years. If the trip is merely to the nearest star, with deceleration the last half of the way, it would take 3.6 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html Baez, UCR, "The relativistic rocket"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A half-myth: It gets harder to push a ship faster as it gets closer to the speed of light===
This is a half-myth because it depends on the frame of reference. It is true for those watching from the planetary reference frame. For those experiencing the journey (in the ship's reference frame) it is not true. For both the planetary frame and the ship's reference frame, the ship will change speed in a Newtonian way—push it a little and it speeds up a little, push it a lot and it speeds up a lot. However, in the planetary frame the acceleration will reduce, due to the speed of light being the maximum speed of material objects.

From the ship's frame, the acceleration would continue at the same rate. However, due to [[Length contraction|Lorentz contraction]], the galaxy around the ship would appear to become squashed in the direction of travel, and a destination many light years away would appear to become much closer. Traveling to this destination at subluminal speeds would become practical for the onboard travellers. Ultimately, from the ship's frame, it would be possible to reach anywhere in the observable universe, without the ship ever accelerating to light speed.

== In fiction ==
''[[Tau Zero]]'', a [[hard science fiction]] novel by [[Poul Anderson]], has a spaceship using a constant acceleration drive.

The spacecraft of [[George O. Smith|George O. Smith's]] [[Venus Equilateral]] stories are all constant acceleration ships. Normal acceleration is 1&amp;nbsp;''g'', but in "The External Triangle" it is mentioned that accelerations of up to 5&amp;nbsp;''g'' are possible if the crew is drugged with gravanol to counteract the effects of the ''g''-load.

Spacecraft in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' make extensive use of constant acceleration; they require elaborate safety equipment to keep their occupants alive at high acceleration (up to 25&amp;nbsp;''g''), and accelerate at 1&amp;nbsp;''g'' even when "at rest" to provide humans with a comfortable level of gravity.

In the "[[Known Space]]" Universe, constructed by [[Larry Niven]], Earth uses constant acceleration drives in the form of [[Bussard ramjet]]s to help colonize the nearest [[planetary system]]s. In the non-Known Space novel ''[[A World Out of Time]]'', Jerome Branch Corbell (for himself), 'takes' a ramjet to the [[Galactic Center]] and back in 150 years ships time (most of it in cold sleep), but 3 million years passes on Earth.

In "[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]", by [[Mary Doria Russell]], interstellar travel is achieved by converting a small asteroid into a constant acceleration spacecraft. Force is applied by ion engines fed with material mined from the asteroid itself.

In the [[Revelation Space]] series by [[Alastair Reynolds]], interstellar commerce depends upon "lighthugger" starships which can accelerate indefinitely at 1&amp;nbsp;''g''. The effects of relativistic travel are an important plot point in several stories, informing the psychologies and politics of the lighthuggers' "ultranaut" crews for example.

In the novel "[[2061: Odyssey Three]]" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], the spaceship ''Universe'', using a muon-catalyzed [[fusion rocket]], is capable of constant acceleration at 0.2&amp;nbsp;''g'' under full thrust.

The UET and Hidden Worlds spaceships of [[F.M. Busby]]'s Rissa Kerguelen Saga utilize a constant acceleration drive that can accelerate at 1&amp;nbsp;''g'' or even a little more.

Ships in the [[The Expanse (novel series)|Expanse]] series by [[James S. A. Corey]] make use of constant acceleration drives, which also provide artificial gravity for the occupants.

A '''spatial decision support system''' ('''SDSS''') is an interactive, computer-based system designed to assist in decision making while solving a semi-structured spatial problem.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, R. H., and E. D. Carlson (1982) Building effective Decision Support Systems. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is designed to assist the spatial planner with guidance in making land use decisions.  A system which models decisions could be used to help identify the most effective decision path.

An SDSS is sometimes referred to as a policy support system, and comprises a [[decision support system]] (DSS) and a [[geographic information system]] (GIS).  This entails use of a [[database management system]] (DBMS), which holds and handles the geographical data; a library of potential models that can be used to forecast the possible outcomes of decisions; and an interface to aid the users interaction with the computer system and to assist in analysis of outcomes.

==Process==
An SDSS usually exists in the form of a computer model or collection of interlinked computer models, including a land use model. Although various techniques are available to simulate land use dynamics, two types are particularly suitable for SDSS.  These are [[cellular automata]] (CA) based models&lt;ref&gt;White, R., and G. Engelen (2000) High-resolution integrated modeling of spatial dynamics of urban and regional systems. Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems 24: 383–400.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agent based model]]s (ABM).&lt;ref&gt;Parker, D. C., Manson, S. M., [[Marco A. Janssen|Janssen, M. A.]], Hoffmann, M., Deadman, P., June (2003) Multi-agent systems for the simulation of land-use and land-cover change: A review. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 93 (2): 314–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

An SDSS typically uses a variety of spatial and nonspatial information, like data  on land use, transportation, [[water management]], [[demographics]], agriculture, climate, [[epidemiology]], resource management or employment. By using two or more known points in history the models can be calibrated and then projections into the future can be made to analyze different spatial policy options. Using these techniques spatial planners can investigate the effects of different scenarios, and provide information to make informed decisions. To allow the user to easily adapt the system to deal with possible intervention possibilities an interface allows for simple modification to be made.

'''TRVL''' is a peer-to-peer travel booking platform that gives travelers access to the commissions and discounts of the travel industry world. It aims to facilitate and reward travelers for helping each other researching and booking trips. 

TRVL's slogan is "Power to the traveler".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trvl.com/|title=TRVL - Power to the traveler!|last=TRVL|website=@trvl|language=en|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Co-founded in the Netherlands by entrepreneur Jochem Wijnands and design specialist Michel Elings, TRVL first started as a digital publication exclusively for iPad in 2010; it was the first iPad-specific magazine in the world. 

Out of frustration with Adobe's publishing software, the TRVL team developed Prss, a mobile-first publishing platform. The Prss team and IP was acquired by Apple in 2014 to help create [[Apple News]] and the Apple News Format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/prss-digital-magazine-platform-acquired-by-apple/ "TechCrunch: Prss acquired by Apple"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Wijnands left Apple to turn TRVL into a travel booking platform where anyone can help anyone with travel recommendations while earning money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamps|first1=Haje Jan|title=You're a travel agent!

'''Technology Development Board''' (TDB), is a statutory body established by [[Government of India]] under Technology Development Board Act, 1995, to promote development and commercialisation of indigenous technology and adaptation of imported technology for wider application. The board consists of 11 Board members. The Government reconstituted the Board in March 2000. The Board plays a pro-active role by encouraging enterprises to take up technology oriented products. Provides equity capital or loans to industrial concerns and financial assistance to research and development institutions. The loan carries a simple interest rate of 5% per annum.&lt;ref&gt;http://tdb.gov.in/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

== GITA ==

In order to stimulate private sector's investment in R&amp;D, TDB established Global Innovation &amp; Technology Alliance (GITA) as a Section 25 company in a joint venture between CII and TDB with equity contribution of 51:49 respectively.

The GITA will assist DST in implementing industrial research and development programme with different countries under bilateral and multilateral science and technology cooperation agreements. In these country-specific programmes, if one industry from India and one industry from another country proposed jointly to do R&amp;D for developing a marketable product, both the governments will provide financial support up to 50% of project cost to their respective industries.

The GITA has been envisaged as an industry-driven body for supporting competitive innovation clusters which in future can be entrusted with administering of Innovation Fund under a PPP model, IP acquisition by the government for non-exclusive licensing for public and social good, sectors of R&amp;D and promotion of innovation culture in centres of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;http://gita.org.in/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venture capital funds ==

In India UTI was the first company to start venture scheme under the name of India Technology Venture Scheme in 1997. In 1999 UTI's executive trustee met the then chairperson, TDB and secretary, TDB and requested TDB's participation in venture capital fund. The board in its 13th meeting dated 19 November 1999 approved TDB's participation in UTI-India Technology Venture Unit Scheme (ITVUS) with commitment of Rs. 25 Cr. This was first commitment by TDB in any venture capital fund, and the agreement for this was signed on 6 July 2000. Thereafter on a case-by-case basis TDB' board took decision to participate in the different venture funds (as given in the list as annexure) as limited liability partner.

So far TDB has been participating in venture funds which are mainly concentrated in technology orientation, early stage projects and also investment in state-level funds where TDB's presence was inadequate. The initiative of TDB has also given confidence to venture capitalist/private equity funds to come up in big way to support the technology based projects with a pronounced emphasis on sectors witch which are growth drivers of Indian economy.

The TDB has so far supported 12 venture capital funds with total commitment of Rs. 310 Cr. leveraging total funds aggregating to Rs. 2713 Cr. from other investors.&lt;ref&gt;http://tdb.gov.in/venture-capital-funds/#&lt;/ref&gt;

== National awards ==

The board instituted a national award for successful commercialisation of indigenous technology by an industrial concern. The national award of Rs. 10 Lakhs is shared equally between the industrial concern that has successfully commercialised the indigenous technology and the developer/provider of such technology.

In August 2000, TDB introduced a cash award of Rs. 2 lakh and a trophy to a SSI unit that has successfully commercialised a technology-based product. The first SSI award was given on 11 May 2001 and thereafter it has been decided to give the Award for SSI Unit every year on the Occasion of Technology Day, i.e. 11 May. The cash awards were later revised to Rs. 5 lakh in 2011–2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">''' Tianchi basins'''  were [[rain gauge |meteorological measuring instrument]]s used to gather and measure the amount of liquid precipitation over a period of time during the Song Dynasty. The instrument was devised by the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor [[Qin Jiushao]]  in 1247.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures  |last=Selin |first=Helaine  |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-1402045592 |edition=2nd |publication-date=April 16, 2008 |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
==History and usage==
As precipitation was for important agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was widely used in 1247 during the [[Southern Song dynasty]] to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]''. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures  |last=Selin |first=Helaine  |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-1402045592 |edition=2nd |publication-date=April 16, 2008 |page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Tianchi basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding has always been a problem in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precipitation: Theory, Measurement and Distribution |last=Strangeways |first=Ian |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521172929 |publication-date=April 14, 2011 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Virtual Machine Queue''' ('''VMQ''') is a [[hardware virtualization]] technology for the efficient transfer of [[network packet|network traffic]] (such as [[TCP/IP]], [[iSCSI]] or [[FCoE]]) to a virtualized host OS.  VMQ technology was patented in 2010 by Daniel Baumberger of [[Intel]] Corp. A VMQ capable [[network interface controller|NIC]] can use [[direct memory access|DMA]] to transfer all incoming frames that should be routed to a receive queue to the receive buffers that are allocated for that queue. The miniport driver can indicate all of the frames that are in a receive queue in one receive indication call.

The VMQ interface supports:

* Classification of received packets in NIC hardware by using the destination [[MAC address]] to route the packets to different receive queues.
* NIC ability to use DMA to transfer packets directly to a virtual machine’s shared memory. For more information about shared memory, see NDIS 6.20 Memory Management Interface.
* Scaling to multiple processors by processing packets for different virtual machines on different processors.

== Virtual Machine Queue Architecture ==

The [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]] virtual machine queue (VMQ) architecture provides advantages for virtualization such as:

* Virtualization impacts performance and VMQ helps overcome those effects.
* VMQ supports live migration.
* VMQ co-exists with NDIS task offloads and other optimizations.

== Critiques ==
Some networks recommend disabling VMQ. They state this option is prone to misconfiguration and can cause reduced network performance when enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disable Virtual Machine Queues|url=https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/80/virtualization/virtualization/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/install-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/performance-tuning-of-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/disable-virtual-machine-queues.html?PageSpeed=noscript|publisher=Palo Alto Networks, Inc|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''View-Master''' is the trademark name of a line of special-format [[stereoscope]]s and corresponding View-Master "reels", which are thin cardboard disks containing seven [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic 3-D]] pairs of small transparent color photographs on film.&lt;ref name="View-Master"&gt;Mary Ann &amp; Wolfgang Sell and Charley Van Pelt, "View-Master Memories" , M.A. and W. Sell, ISBN B0006S314I, 2000 Self-Published&lt;/ref&gt;  It was manufactured and sold by [[Sawyer's]].

The View-Master system was introduced in 1939, four years after the advent of [[Kodachrome]] color film made the use of small high-quality photographic color images practical. Tourist attraction and travel views predominated in View-Master's early lists of available reels, most of which were meant to be interesting to users of all ages. Most current View-Master reels are intended for children.

==History==

===1919–56: early photo services===
Edwin Eugene Mayer worked as a pharmacist at [[The Owl Drug Company|Owl Drug]] store in downtown Portland, Oregon, after serving in the U.S. Army in World War I.  He built up a photo-finishing business there, and bought into [[Sawyer's]] Photo Finishing Service in 1919 with the help of his father August Mayer, his fiancée Eva McAnulty, and her sister Vi McAnulty.

Edwin described how he started the business in a letter dated April 1, 1954: "Suffice to say that in 1919, what little it was, was purchased with borrowed ($3,500) money from Dad, aided by about $1,600 in insurance money Eva got when her father died and which was left in permanently, and $1,600 borrowed from Vi and repaid, along with Dad's notes, within a few years."&lt;ref&gt;Document written by Edwin E. Mayer, dated April 1, 1954, stating history of Sawyers, Inc. Published in the family history "The Morris and McAnulty Connection", by Peggy Savage, 2013, Canby, OR.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the business grew, Ed Mayer incorporated in about 1926, taking on partners Harold and Beulth F. Graves, Thomas and Pauline Meyer, and Augusta and Raymond F. Kelly, renaming the business Sawyer Service, Inc. The company relocated to a large two-story building at 181 Ella St., near Morrison Street in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref name="Edwin E. Mayer 1954"&gt;Document written by Edwin E. Mayer, dated April 1, 1954, stating history of Sawyers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was producing photographic postcards and album sets as souvenirs by 1926, when Harold Graves joined Sawyer's. Graves handled marketing for the products while Mayer ran the business. Later, photographic greeting cards were added to the Sawyer's product line, marketed to major department stores. Sawyer's was the nation's largest producer of scenic postcards in the 1920s and the future View-Master viewer eventually became an extension of the two-dimensional cards.

[[File:Toronto view-master.jpg|thumb|right|A View-Master reel from 1948]]
The company took the first steps towards developing the View-Master after Edwin Mayer and Graves met with William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by [[Welte-Mignon|Welte &amp; Sons]] and an avid photographer living in Portland.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Jane Gruber: ''The Biography of William B. Gruber''. Mill City Press, Inc., 2015. {{ISBN|978-1634130097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had made up a stereo imaging rig out of two Kodak Bantam Specials mounted together on a tripod. He designed a machine that mounted the tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock. A special viewer was also designed and produced. He had the idea of updating the old-fashioned stereoscope by using the new Kodachrome 16-mm color film, which recently had become available.

===The new venture===
A View-Master reel holds 14 film transparencies in seven pairs, making up the seven stereoscopic images. The components of each pair are viewed simultaneously, one by each eye, thus simulating binocular depth perception.

According to a 1960 court document, the Gruber-Sawyer partner venture began from that first meeting in 1938. Thereafter, Ed Mayer negotiated with Gruber while production methods and some marketing were developed. After three years, a formal agreement was entered into on February 24, 1942, between Gruber and Sawyer partners, doing business as Sawyer's.

Ed Mayer and people within the Sawyer’s organization were uncertain what to call their new product, but they eventually came up with the name "View-Master." The View-Master brand name eventually came to be recognized by 65 percent of the world’s population, but William Gruber disliked the name which Mayer gave it, thinking that it sounded too much like Toast-Master, Mix-Master, or some other kitchen appliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/285/683/161080/ 285 F.2d 683] 
Eva R. MAYER, Executrix of the Estate of Edwin E. Mayer, deceased, Harold J. Graves and Beulah F. Graves, Thomas O. Meyer and Pauline Meyer, Augusta Kelly, and The Estate of Raymond F. Kelly, deceased, Augusta Kelly, Residuary Legatee, Appellants, v. UNITED STATES of America, Appellee. No. 16103. United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. Dec. 9, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The View-Master was introduced at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], marked "Patent Applied For". It was intended as an alternative to the scenic [[postcard]], and was originally sold at photography shops, stationery stores, and scenic-attraction gift shops. The main subjects of View-Master reels were [[Carlsbad Caverns]] and the [[Grand Canyon]].&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;

The View-Master was marketed through Ed Mayer's photo-finishing, postcard, and greeting card company Sawyer's Service, Inc., known eventually as Sawyer's, Inc. The partnership led to the retail sales of View-Master viewers and reels. The patent on the viewing device was issued in 1940, on what came to be called the Model A viewer. Within a very short time, the View-Master took over the postcard business at Sawyer's.

===Expansion===
Ed Mayer gave details of the company's expansion in a letter dated April 1, 1954:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1939, 20 years after starting the business, we had, by dint of hard work and long hours and frugal living, accumulated a business (Sawyer's) worth about $58,000.00 and Western Photo Supply Co. owning the buildings, worth about $30,000.00. The above figures were for the total business and buildings owned by the Kellys, Graves, Mayers and Meyers. In 1946, we had already grown a lot from 1939, and Sawyer's made a lease with Western Photo Supply Co., they to build and lease two new buildings to Sawyer's, in addition to the two we already had. At this point, Sawyer's also decided to change its structure from a partnership to a corporation, for various good reasons, one of which was to permit our children to participate in the stock ownership.&lt;ref name="Edwin E. Mayer 1954"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1940s, the United States military recognized the potential for using View-Master products for personnel training, purchasing 100,000 viewers and nearly six million reels from 1942 to the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;

After the development of the View-Master, Sawyer's, Inc. moved into a new building at 735 S.W. 20th Place in downtown Portland. The company also occupied a building next door at 740 S.W. 21st Avenue. Years later, Edwin Mayer and his Sawyer's partners purchased land in Washington County near Progress, Oregon, west of Beaverton, and built a large plant there in about 1951. The plant has since been removed and developed into a shopping center. After moving to the new plant, Mayer leased the old Sawyer's building on 20th Place to Oregon Television, Inc., KPTV, Channel 12.

===The 1950s===
In 1951, Sawyer's purchased [[Tru-Vue]], the main competitor of View-Master. The take-over eliminated the main rival and also gained Tru-Vue's licensing rights to [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]]. Sawyer's capitalized on the opportunity and produced numerous reels featuring Disney characters. The takeover paid off further in 1955 with reels of the newly opened [[Disneyland]].&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;
[[File:View-Master Model E.JPG|thumb|A View-Master Model E of the 1950s]]

In 1952, Sawyer's began its View-Master Personal line, which included the [[View-Master Personal Stereo Camera]] for its users to make their own View-Master reels. It was successful at first, but the line was discontinued in ten years. This line spawned the Model D viewer, View-Master's highest-quality viewer which was available until the early 1970s, and the Stereomatic 500, View-Master's only 3-D projector.&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt; The other projectors were 2-D and used only one of the images.

The Model E was introduced in 1955 with a more modern design, big ivory buttons on the picture changer levers, and a large "V" slot on top for easier reel insertion. It was released in brown and black in the United States, and some other colors elsewhere.&lt;ref name=model_e&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viewmaster.co.uk/htm/e.asp | title=View-Master Model E - Replacement for the Model C ViewMaster | publisher=viewmaster.co.uk | accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was about 4 inches high, 5 inches wide, and 4 inches deep.

The Model F was introduced in 1958. It used [[List of battery sizes|C-cell]] batteries to power an internal lighting source. Industrial designer Charles "Chuck" Harrison led the team designing the Model F View-Master. Fifty years later in 2008, Harrison won the Cooper-Hewitt Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/31/viewmaster.design.classic |title=Classics of everyday design No 48: Jonathan Glancey on the View-Master &amp;#124; Art and design &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-07-31|accessdate=2011-05-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962–present: stereoscopic toy===
In 1962, the [[Bakelite]] models were replaced with lighter plastic versions, the first of which was the Model G. This change was driven by Sawyer's new president, Bob Brost, who took over in 1959. The View-Master had been constructed originally from Kodak [[Tenite]] plastic and then Bakelite, a hard, sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic. The lightweight [[thermoplastic]] became the material of choice under Brost.&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;

In 1966, [[Sawyer's]] was acquired by the [[American IG|General Aniline &amp; Film]] (GAF) Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary. Under GAF's ownership, View-Master reels began to feature fewer scenic and more child-friendly subjects, such as toys and cartoons. Television series were featured on View-Master reels, such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', ''[[Family Affair]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. Actor [[Henry Fonda]] appeared in a series of TV commercials for the GAF View-Master.&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;

From 1970 to around 1997, there were versions of "Talking View-Masters", which included audio technology with the reels with three major designs with increasing sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clatworthy|first=Keith|title=Talking View-Master|url=http://www.viewmaster.co.uk/htm/talking.asp|work=20th Century Stereo Viewers|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, GAF introduced the View-Master Rear Screen projector, a table-top projector that displayed images from picture wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=GAF View-Master Rear Screen Projector|url=https://toytales.ca/view-master-rear-screen-projector-1970s/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, View-Master released the Show Beam Projector, a toy that combined the company’s stereoscopic images and flashlight technology to produce a portable hand-held projector. The Show Beam used small film cartridges that were plugged into the side of the toy. Each cartridge contained 30 full-color 2D images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=View-Master Show Beam Projector (1980)|url=https://toytales.ca/view-master-show-beam-projector-1980/|website=Toy Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, GAF sold View-Master to a group of investors headed by Arnold Thaler, and the company was reconstituted as the View-Master International Group.&lt;ref&gt;Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia By Sharon M. Scott, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
VMI acquired the Ideal Toy Company in 1984 and became known as the View-Master Ideal Group; V-M Ideal in turn was purchased by Tyco Toys in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Stereo World Volume 16, Number 3, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Tyco, including the View-Master Ideal Group, merged with Mattel Inc. in 1997. V-M was placed organizationally in Mattel's pre-school division and is now marketed under the Fisher-Price imprint, who continues emphasis on juvenile content.

In 1998, during the purchase of the [[Tyco Toys]]-owned plant by [[Mattel]], [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] investigations began on [[View-Master factory supply well]] for the toxic chemical [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE).  The plant was shut down in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/PHA.asp?docid=293&amp;pg=1#backa |title=ATSDR-PHA-HC-View-Master Factory Supply Well-p1 |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Fisher-Price division of toy maker Mattel announced that they had stopped production in December 2008 of the scenic reels depicting tourist attractions. These reels of picturesque scenes and landscape scenery were descendants of the first View-Master reels sold in 1939. Fisher-Price announced they would continue to produce reels of animated characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/business/article_a3136a9b-a396-5381-bc9e-fd8768f80803.html |title=View-Master 3-D travel reels head into the sunset|author=Doug Whiteman|work=pantagraph.com|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, Alpha-cine announced it would take-up the scenic reel production under an agreement with Fisher-Price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewmastercustomreels.com/scenic.asp?page=scen&amp;sub=adv View-Master Custom and Scenic Reel Sales, viewmastercustomreels.com, Retrieved 2012-08-16.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630135534/http://www.viewmastercustomreels.com/scenic.asp?page=scen&amp;sub=adv |date=June 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015: View-Master Virtual Reality Viewer ===
[[File:Viewmaster VR set.jpg|thumb|Viewmaster VR set]]
In February 2015, Mattel announced a collaboration with [[Google]] to produce a new version of View-Master called the View-Master Virtual Realty Viewer, based on [[virtual reality]] using [[smartphone]]s. The new View-Master is an implementation of the [[Google Cardboard]] VR platform, and is accompanied by a [[mobile app]] that was built using its [[Software development kit|SDK]]. Content is displayed on a smartphone screen; the phone itself is inserted into the back of the unit. Instead of being inserted directly into the View-Master, reels are scanned using an [[augmented reality]] interface which enables access to content from the reel, such as 360-degree panoramas, 3D models, and minigames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2015/02/13/view-master--of-old-uses-google-cardboard-vr/23297205/ | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |date=February 13, 2015 | last=Baig |first=Edward C. | title=View-Master rides Google Cardboard into virtual reality }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-vrviewmaster&gt;{{cite web|title=The VR View-Master is Google Cardboard for kids|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/9/9480941/mattel-view-master-vr-headset-hands-on|website=The Verge|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vrscout-vrviewmaster&gt;{{cite web|title=First Look: Mattel Virtual Reality View-Master|url=http://vrscout.com/news/mattel-virtual-reality-view-master/|website=VRScout|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second iteration, the View-Master Viewer DLX was released in fall, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=View-Master View DLX|url=https://toytales.ca/view-master-viewer-dlx/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulative production and honor===
There have been some 25 viewer models, thousands of titles, and 1.5 billion copies of reels. The basic design remained intact for reels and internal mechanisms, despite its long history and many changes in models and materials, ensuring that every reel will work in every model.&lt;ref name="View-Master"/&gt;

View-Master is part of the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Easy-Bake Oven |url=http://www.strongmuseum.org/nthof/inductees.html |title=National Toy Hall of Fame |publisher=Strongmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428010755/http://www.strongmuseum.org/NTHoF/inductees.html |archivedate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==
[[Image:View-Master-DinNorm.jpg|thumb|100px|Specifications for View-Master reels]]

Reels have been produced for [[Disneyland]], many TV shows (such as ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Lost In Space]]'', and ''[[The Munsters]]'', blockbuster movies (such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''), and the U.S. military (for airplane and ship identification and range estimation).

David L. Bassett, an expert on anatomy and dissection, collaborated with Gruber to create a 25-volume atlas of human anatomy using the View-Master system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/science/22bass.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=4a6e8113b82be3ac&amp;ex=1209096000 |title=The Body in Depth - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

View-Master produced custom reels for commercial customers to show 3-D images of products and services to potential clients. For example, in the early 1990s, Canadian restaurant chain [[East Side Mario's]] used a View-Master reel as their dessert menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3dstereo.com/Viewmaster-URL/commercial.html |title=The View-Master Ultimate Reel List - Commercial Reels |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the newest View-Master products are a [[Discovery Channel]] View-Master, the new Virtual Viewer, the [[Discovery Channel]] View-Master Projector and Telescope, and the View-Master 3-D Pocket Viewer, which feature images of popular performers in concert and backstage.

The '''W49''' was an American [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear warhead]], used on the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]], [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]], [[Jupiter (missile)|Jupiter]], and [[Titan I]] ballistic missile systems.  W49 warheads were manufactured starting in 1958 and were in service until 1963, with a few warheads being retained until 1975.

The W49 has been described as a design derivative of the [[B28 nuclear bomb]] nuclear warhead design. It was {{convert|20|in|cm|0}} in diameter and {{convert|54|to|58|in|cm|0}} long depending on model, weighing {{convert|1640|to|1680|lb|0}}, and had a design yield of 1.44 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]].

:''Wilhelm Fenner was the central figure in the evolution of the German Cipher Bureau between 1922 and 1939, and a major personality in the history of German communications intelligence in the interwar period. Under his direction, the Cipher Bureau evolved into a highly professional communications intelligence service, which scored impressive cryptanalytic successes against the diplomatic and military systems of many countries.''

==Personal life==
Wilhelm was born on April 14, 1891 in [[Saint Petersburg]]. He was the sixth of seven children of Heinrich Gottlieb Fenner and Charlotte Georgine Fenner, born Michaelsen. His father was the chief editor of the [[St. Petersburgische Zeitung]], a [[German language]] daily newspaper published in [[Saint Petersburg]], then the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. The sixth of seven children, he was  [[Homeschooling|home schooled]] for two years before he attended the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Anne School in St. Petersburg from 1899, and completed his final examination with distinction in May 1909. In the autumn of 1910 he matriculated at the [[Technical University of Berlin|Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Berlin]] (TH) in [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]] and studied [[construction engineering]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; In the summer of 1914, he passed his final examination.

Wilhelm Fenner was married on 11 January 1922 to Elise Sophie Katharine von Blanckensee, a daughter of the former Prussian Major General [[:de:Peter von Blanckensee (General)|Peter von Blanckensee]]. They had two children, a son, Siegwart Heinrich (born January 28, 1923), who served as a lieutenant in [[World War II]], and was killed on February 19, 1945, and a daughter, Ilse Fredericki (born July 24, 1928).

==First World War==
With the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], he had to drop out of college, and worked for a short time at [[Siemens]] as an engineer, working to develop electrical systems for warships. He was drafted into military service on December 1, 1914, joining the [[5th Guards Grenadiers]], seeing service in [[Russia]], [[France]] and [[Serbia]] and eventually joined the staff of the [[10th Army (German Empire)|Tenth Army]].&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; After the armistice in November 1918, he remained under arms as a member of one of the ''Free Corps'' battalions of demobilized soldiers who offered their services to political groups jockeying for political position in Germany in the first months of peace.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; After the war, now with the rank of [[lieutenant]], he remained in the military until February 9, 1920. When Fenner returned to civilian life, he took a job as a publicist with an èmigré assistance organization, but the position provided little interest and within the year, he took a position as an editor in a new press agency, which was founded by Konstantin von Krusenstern, who was a former colonel in the [[Imperial Russian Army]].&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; The fledgling news agency collapsed, with Krusenstern relocating to Paris, but before he left, Fenner's career took a decisive turn when the Russian colonel introduced him to [[Peter Novopaschenny]] in the spring of 1921.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

==Meeting Novopaschenny and Buschenhagen==
[[Peter Novopashenny]] was a former [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] [[Captain (naval)|captain]] of the tsarist Marine and professor of Applied Tactics. Novopaschenny asked Fenner to help him to move to Berlin and confided in Fenner that he had worked during the war as director of the Russian cryptanalytic service working to break the ciphers of the German Baltic Fleet, and that he intended to make his experience available to the [[Reichswehr|German General Staff]], under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; In the same year, Fenner provided him with contacts, eventually becoming an acquaintance of an officer called [[Erich Buschenhagen]], who would later become a general in the [[Wehrmacht]]. In 1919, Buschenhagen had set up ''Volunteer Evaluation Post'' which had been absorbed into Germany's postwar military establishment as a cipher bureau of the army's Troops Department, which was allowed under the terms of the peace agreement.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

==Establishment of Reichswehr Cipher bureau.==
As Buschenhagen's cipher bureau was primary working on Russian ciphers, he jumped at the change of using Novopaschenny, but less so Fenner, who knew little of Russian ciphers. Fenner became interested in the Russian telegrams that Novopaschenny was working on, and with his interest piqued, began the process of discovering the field of cryptanalysis. He was now working under the guidance of his "teacher", Novopaschenny, a fruitful relationship, and together they were successful in breaking Russian military ciphers.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; Fenner's excellent command of the German and Russian languages worked to his advantage, while Novopaschenny, although an excellent cryptanalyst, spoke hardly any German. Buschenhagen was particularly impressed when the pair decrypted a Russian cipher that was beyond the skill of the cipher bureau's own 4 person Russian desk.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; In the autumn of 1922, he and Novopaschenny were not only officially taken into the employment of the cryptanalysis group of the [[Reichswehr]] (Chi-point) by Buschenhagen, but Fenner was also appointed as head of the cryptanalysis section and assigned a staff of eleven. Fenner was initially unimpressed by the cipher bureau personnel, output was modest with too narrow scope of operation, and cryptanalysts happy to decrypt three or four messages a day combined with lax work habits.  Within the next years Fenner changed the operation of his group significantly. From a chaotic assembly of creative "geniuses", he formed an analytical, systematic and disciplined unit of more, and more experienced, code breakers. In this process, Fenner introduced a uniform, clear technical terminology into the field of cryptanalysis, laying the groundwork for further successes by his new employer. His first action was introducing formal training, conducted personal lectures describing various types of cryptographic systems. His actions bore fruit, and the number of successfully [[Cryptography#Cryptanalysis|decrypted]] messages increased steadily. The group also grew in numbers, and Fenner took the opportunity to train newcomers himself and transfer his own, now greatly developed, knowledge of [[Cryptography|cryptology]] to them. However, his growing leadership role caused him to start losing contact with the actual cryptanalytic work, and gained a reputation as a fearsome, arrogant pedant, which he dismissed as evidence the unit was being shaken out of its lethargy.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; By the mid 1920s, he had introduced a 90 training course for senior analysts which reviewed current systems and general principles. By the 1930s a fast track training course was introduced for talented newcomers that met twice a week and covered a two part course in cryptologic principles and practice.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

As part of his process to professionalize the unit, he sought to gain recognition and establish career level status for his staff, as he was convinced that an staff member would serve the state loyally, if their well-being was undertaken by the state. As the arcane skills of his staff did not fit in any of the German career hierarchy, they were not considered career civil servants and so had no career progression, pensions nor job security. The process was long and arduous, beginning in the early 1920s and was fully completed until late 1939, with the outbreak of [[World War II]] and shortly after establishment of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Supreme Command of the Armed Forces]] the Chiffrierstelle was renamed the ''[[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW/Chi), that the plan was approved by the chief of the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht, [[Wilhelm Keitel]].&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;  Professionalism for Fenner was always a means to an end. The whole process was about improved production and an expansion of operations.

On April 4, 1927 he was appointed a Government Councillor (''Regierungsrat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7sNVKDp-yiJNjE4YTIyOTctNGFlZi00NTliLWEwZWUtOGYxYzEyMjk1NGE1/view%3Fpli%3D1&amp;usg=ALkJrhgR1lY0J0uPcyC2eHbe8wLBgXcPNA|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |page = 7|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his management duties he increased contact and cooperation with friendly foreign groups in [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Finland]],&lt;ref name="BeckmanMcKay2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bengt Beckman|author2=C.G.

ISSN 0161-1194&lt;/ref&gt; He provided training, and wrote two treatises on cryptanalysis, namely ''Grundlagen der Entzifferung'' (fundamentals of code-breaking) and ''Beitrag zur Theorie der Schieber'' (contribution to the theory of the [[strip cipher]]). He also worked on the [[Enigma machine]], then already in trial use by the Reichswehr, pointing out cryptographic weaknesses, and making proposals for its improvement. By 1924, Fenner had identified in the intercept traffic, 85 codes and ciphers, of which 22 has been attached and 16 had been cryptanalysed successfully. In June 1927, Fenner went to Finland to deliver a course of instruction to the members of the new fledgling service of the [[Finland|Finish]] cipher bureau.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

Pers Z S believed it has a monopoly on diplomatic communication traffic and was also a rival to Reichswehr Cipher bureau.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; It dealt specifically with diplomatic ciphers and relied on the German Post Office for diplomatic intercepts, who transmitted and received the encrypted communications from [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] located in Germany, and across the world. The post service routinely retained copies of all embassy messages and passed the messages to Per Z S cryptanalysts for study and the Post Office only dealt with the Foreign Ministry. Fenner argued that OKW/Chi needed diplomatic traffic as they included information of military interest and military analysts were more likely to identify such items in messages and understand their significance. He convinced his opposite number in the foreign office ministry [[Kurt Selchow]], that cooperation would benefit both units.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; Specifically, he promised Selchow that as the OKW/Chi expanded and improved its radio monitoring network, the foreign ministry cryptanalysts would have access to all diplomatic messages intercepted. Fenner also offered access to share other OKW/Chi materials and results. The result of the inter-agency collaboration was considered rare in a normally hostile and competitive German intelligence community.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;

==Nazi seizure of power==
Within the Reichswehr bureau, a small circle of Nazi sympathizers became increasingly vocal.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; Fenner had little patience with these people, who talked politics during extended coffee breaks and who flaunted their loyalties by smoking Nazi Party cigarettes, or occasionally missed work to participate in a ''Jew raid''.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt;  After the seizure of power by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in January 1933, the times became increasingly restless, and the situation worsened for the cipher bureau, which now felt the competition from newly established rival institutions. In 1933, for example, [[Hermann Göring|Goering's]] new [[Luftwaffe]] created its own intelligence agency, the [[Research Office of the Reich Air Ministry|Forschungsamt]]. During this period Fenner worried about the professionalism of the agency as the Nazi Party tried to extend their control over the intelligence and security agencies of the state.

Many capable employees of the cipher bureau joined the new organisation, where they hoped for better career prospects. Among these were cryptanalysts whom Fenner considered excellent, their leader Baron [[Emil von Reznicek|Emil Freiherr von Reznicek]], an ardent Nazi and cryptanalyst assigned to the Italian desk and Herr Weachter. Reznicek was particularly annoyed that in the caste conscious world of German bureaucracy, he was a mere ''employee'' of the Bureau, while Fenner was a Government Councillor with a pensioner.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; [[Gottfried Schapper]], a radio intelligence operator from [[World War I]], who ran a unit in the Bureau that was concerned with the location and construction of fixed intercept stations.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; [[Hans Schimpf]] was another. Fenner may have been glad to see the malcontents go, but he quickly discovered he was not entirely rid of them. From either a desire to revenge themselves on their former employer or to expand their influence, Schimpf and Schapper informed Fenner that the Forschungsamt was now solely responsible for all diplomatic cryptanalysis and that the Bureau should abandon all such work.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; This was of course a repeat of the last bureaucratic battle with the Pers Z S. However, Fenner found an ally in Kurt Selchow, who realized that if successfully prosecuted, the Forschungsamt's supposed monopoly on diplomatic cryptanalysis would mean the end of the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; Even though Fenner managed to see off the threat, the Forschungsamt staff started a campaign to have him relieved of duty, tapped his office phone, planted an informant in his office and started spreading rumours that he was [[Jews|Jewish]], and that he had ridiculed and criticized [[Hermann Göring]] in private conversations.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; Fenner was forced to fill the resulting gaps with newcomers, necessarily having to forgo experience in favour of attitude in selection of candidates. Fenner as a rule always recruited people who had not left the church and were not members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. 
During this time, Fenner's Bureau found it increasingly difficult to fend of competitors, with the German navies organization [[B-Dienst]] and the German armies [[General der Nachrichtenaufklärung#Intercept Control Station|Intercept Control Station]] both cipher agencies. Fenner actively opposed the army bureau, but could not block its creation. OKW/Chi was explicitly ordered to cease work on Russian military ciphers, which Fenner disobeyed ordering a small covert party to continue working on Russian and French military systems.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; In the summer of 1933, he was promoted to Senior Councillor ({{lang-de|OberRegierungsrat}}). By the start of World War II, he was a Director of OKW/CHI ({{lang-de|:Ministerialrat}}) he could counteract the harmful poaching of staff, ensure suitable staff had a secure future, and place unsuitable people at the disposal of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7sNVKDp-yiJNjE4YTIyOTctNGFlZi00NTliLWEwZWUtOGYxYzEyMjk1NGE1/view%3Fpli%3D1&amp;usg=ALkJrhgR1lY0J0uPcyC2eHbe8wLBgXcPNA|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |page = 9|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff strength of the Chiffrierstelle ([[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht|OKW/Chi]]) had increased in 1939 to include over 200 employees, whereas only two years earlier there were about 40 personnel. In the ensuing war years until 1944 it quadrupled to 800.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Rezabek: TICOM and the Search for OKW / Chi. Cryptologia. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia PA 37.2013,2 (April) 149. ISSN 0161-1194&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime for Fenner and his staff in the OKW/Chi was initially relatively peaceful and successful. The raw material, in the form of intercepted radio messages, was prolific; they concentrated on several hundred messages a day on the most important projects and had to ignore relatively unimportant sources. They had important decoding success ({{lang-de|Entzifferungserfolge}}), for example, against France, in 1940, which aided the quick victory of the German [[World War II#Western Europe .281940.E2.80.9341.29|Armed Forces in the West]]—"Case Red". Also Polish, Russian and Yugoslav messages could be deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B_oIJbGCCNYeMGUxNzk0NWQtNzNhZi00YWVjLWI1NmItMzc2YWZiZGNjNjQ5&amp;usp=drive_web|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |pages = 10–14|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of war==
While his section chief, Colonel Kettler, and the head of the main group A, Major Mettig, and also one of its best people, the head of the group IV, [[Erich Hüttenhain|Dr Erich Hüttenhain]], relocated to the north, Fenner fled south with a selection of employees. On April 23, 1945, OKW/Chi was officially disbanded and the staff of the General of Nachrichtenaufklärung (gDNA) assumed their responsibilities. Just before the American army reached their position (about 40&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Salzburg]]), documents were burned or thrown into the [[Salzach|Salzach River]]. With the surrender of the Wehrmacht on 8 May 1945, Fenner moved to [[Landshut]] and found employment as a bicycle and car mechanic in neighboring [[Straubing]].&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B_oIJbGCCNYeMGUxNzk0NWQtNzNhZi00YWVjLWI1NmItMzc2YWZiZGNjNjQ5&amp;usp=drive_web|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |page = 15|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witness at Nuremberg war crimes trial==
In July 1946, Fenner was charged as a witness for the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg war crimes]] tribunal and in August transferred to the ''Haus Alaska'', a cover name for HQ 7707 European Command Intelligence Center [[Camp King]], the US Army's interrogation centre, [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]] (near [[Frankfurt]]), and interned with other high-ranking Germans. Fenner was intensively interrogated by the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] (ASA) and has written a number of reports about his life and work, including an autobiographical essay "The Career of William Fenner"—its English translation bearing the words TOP SECRET being filed in TICOM Archive: DF-187. These documents were made publicly available only a few years ago.&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt;
